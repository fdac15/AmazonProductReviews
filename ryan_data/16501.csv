"An interesting meeting changes Fallon O'Neill and Ben Kessler's lives in just one day. It was totally one of those apparent right person, bad timing things. They're eighteen years old, a bit quirky, and have their own issues. But despite the odd circumstances, they connect. But Fallon is not interested in getting distracted from her goals or being in a relationship, and she is moving away. So they give each other ""homework"" and agree to meet November 9 for the next five years to catch up and reconnect with no contact in between. And this shall also become inspiration for Ben's writing.Years. Tears. Fears. Feelings. Choices. One day a year and then it is over. Each year brings more of a connection, changes, questions, problems, and more difficulty saying good bye. But they have both a positive and negative impact on each other's lives at various times. We see growth and change. There are secrets. And there is a twist...Holy Freakin' Hell...The Twist.That sent the story spiraling and my mind reeling and my heart stalling. This book had me so full of tension at times, it punched me in the gut, broke my heart, glued it back together, then did it again. Fallon and Ben had so much happening in their young lives, but I loved them together. The fact I could feel their connection with the limited time they were actually together showed its intensity. The angst nearly killed me.I adored Ben. He was so funny, sweet, flirty, and protective. He had me laughing so much. But it was obvious he was hiding something. It drove me crazy trying to figure it out. And Fallon had her own deadpan sense of humor, issues, and flaws. She had become quite an introvert until Ben challenged her. I loved their rapport and how they related to each other.It was told in dual points of view and some of it in Ben's written form. I liked the side characters, his brother Ryan and his girl Jordyn, and her friends Amber and Glenn. And getting to spend more time with Ben's older brother Ian and his friends Miles and Tate from Ugly Love.This was definitely a unique story with an interesting plot and some surprises and twists. It pulled out all kind of emotions--laughter, frustration, anger, anticipation, joy, and sadness. I loved the book references and book boyfriend tidbits. This was sweet, swoony, romantic, heartbreaking, and emotional. Another captivating, complex story woven by Colleen that kept me engaged and surprised me at times. My only complaint (besides the angst nearly killing me) was that I would have loved to see an epilogue. The ending felt a bit rushed to me after all they had been through, it maybe I am just being greedy and needy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SM69NNRTK8FZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI1S8#wasThisHelpful","R1SM69NNRTK8FZ","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The saga of Painter and Melanie.Pen pals. Friends. Lovers. Frenemies.Can they get their second (or maybe fourth) chance at love?Levi ""Painter"" Brooks and Melanie Tucker have been circling around each other for years. Even when he was in prison, she was his pen pal. They both have hidden feelings and want each other, but are also scared of the possible consequences. They are so different, but so attracted. He always tended to put the women he really liked on a pedestal. He thinks Melanie deserves better than him, but is also unable to stay away or keep her in the friend zone. He is also protective, possessive, and jealous.But even when it looks like they might finally have a chance at more, club business keeps getting in the way. Their lives are shaken up by changes that they can't control. Melanie has a strong need and desire to be his first priority, but always seems to have to compete with the club. And the club's needs could cost him everything.These two lose years due to a series of poor choices, missed opportunities, anger, mistakes, heartbreak, lack of trust, and difficulty forgiving. It was definitely a frustrating and heartbreaking road.Painter was strong, tough, and loyal but he kept making choices that affected their lives negatively. Melanie was smart, strong, sweet, and sassy, but she was also stubborn and unforgiving. She had insecurities from her past that still affected her and colored her relationship with Painter. They both made mistakes. I wanted to yell at them both at times or lock them in a room together. But all along I felt they did belong together.  It was told in dual points of view, covered a time span of years, and interspersed with some other events in previous books.A lot of the Reapers, Silver Bastards, Devil's Jacks and their ladies  are back....Picnic, Ruger, Gage, Horse, Puck, Bolt, Duck, and Hunter. Melanie's best friend and room mate Jessica, Kit, Emma, London,  sweet Izzy, and a new woman Tinker Garrett bring in the girl contingent. There is an underlying MC story going on that keeps pulling Painter and Gage in, and also some other splintered stories from previous books adding danger, violence, and suspense. It was also an angsty, romantic, sweet, emotional, and at times volatile second chance love story. I really ended up liking Painter and Melanie even when they had me tense or frustrated. We are also given a short story about Melanie and Painter's first meeting as well as 2 epilogues.Gage's story was initiated  in this one and will continue in the next book Reaper's Fire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20JKXCZKNBOBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA5KFM0#wasThisHelpful","R20JKXCZKNBOBT","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adam Gunner has just existed for the last ten years as he never got over Evie Taylor. She brought light to his life for a brief period, but then she left him without warning or answers and destroyed him in her wake.Ten years later, they cross paths again. And he still does not get straight answers. He is still angry and confused. She is sorry and guilt ridden, but not telling him what he needs to know. Emotions run high, but there is a huge barrier between them even though the attraction is still there.She has secrets she is protecting and he has one too. The mystery was killing me! The tension, the pain, the questions, the lies all had me intrigued.Adam is now harder, jaded, and fueled by anger. He has major trust and abandonment issues. Evie is still sweet, family oriented and sensitive. But she also feels guilty and sad for how things transpired. They have a connection and attraction that cannot be denied, but it is clouded by pain and regrets from their past.Is it still love or just lust? Adam has a battle with his heart versus his head. She has the potential to make him happy, but could destroy him again just as easily. And he has the same potential for her if he cannot handle her secret.Although I enjoyed learning about their past love in contrast to their present pain, at times I felt distracted with the frequency of flashbacks (although their young love story was sweet and heartfelt and I wanted to see what happened then too). I was just so tense about the present, and was so frustrated with both of them. The secrets, the holding back, the anger, forgiveness issues and lack of real communication and trust that I was wanting some resolution in the present. I wanted to shake sense into both of them and I was surprised how certain situations played out and their reactions...and not always in a good way. Although I enjoyed this story and felt this couple belonged together, I guess I wish there was more time showing them happy especially in the present. It seemed to be so much heartbreak and anger and then finally everything was out. But I just kept waiting for the new happy. Then it seemed to rush to the ending despite having a dual pov epilogue.I liked the side characters of his best friend Max, their friend Grady, her sister Casey and her Dad. They added some humor and some extra drama to the story. There was an antagonist that I despised. It was an interesting second chance love story and was written well and had depth. It was told in dual points of view past and present and covered around twelve years total. It was sweet, and romantic, but also heartbreaking and emotional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTKJC8GHQ819G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01692EJJU#wasThisHelpful","RTKJC8GHQ819G","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Declan Boudreaux is lusting after the new owner of The Odyssey bar Callie Mills. They have a flirty rapport, sexual tension, and chemistry. But she's looking for love and he's usually looking for just a good time. Lovers. Friends. They don't know what the heck they are really doing and what they really want.Declan is a talented, sexy musician and a sweet Southern charmer. He's got a bad rep for being a man whore. He's charismatic, easy going, protective,and bossy. But he is clueless at times about how real relationships work. He is not a very consistently adept communicator.Callie is sassy, fierce, sweet, independent. and vulnerable. She's felt loss and her life has undergone a lot of recent changes. She really wanted to be loved and needed, but is also scared, insecure, and untrusting. She is used to taking care of herself and others, not being taken care of.In their favor, they have hot chemistry, shared interests, and get along well. They make each other want to be better and give each other a sense of being wanted and belonging. But they also have communication issues, tempers, and moodiness, and tendencies to avoid issues. They have to learn to trust and get on the same page. They never expected to fall. They make mistakes, have some missteps, and hurt the other at times, but they also needed each other. They really manage to fit well together if they can just deal with their communication issues and insecurities.I loved getting more with boisterous Boudreauxs...Eli and Kate, Gabby and Rhys, Charly, Savannah, Beau, their sweet Mama, and adopted brother Ben. I loved the girls' nights with wine and shoe bonding, and boys' club talks. Charly's story was teased at the end of this one and I am looking forward to her story next in Easy Kisses. I am still really looking forward to Ben and Van's book...it has been building up this whole series. I also liked Callie's room mate Adam and I am glad to see he is getting his own novella Easy For Keeps. There were some fun Seattle crossovers too! We got to see some progression with the the other couples and hang out out with this tight knit group of family and friends.This was a relatively low angst, sweet, romantic, steamy read.  I enjoyed the New Orleans setting, bar and music scene, as well as the home restoration aspects of the story. I will admit that sometimes I got a little sidetracked with all of the sex scenes, but I honestly liked both characters and getting dual points of view. Declan was a swoony hero even though sometimes he needed to be smacked upside the head and his excuses did not make perfect sense. And Callie was a strong heroine, but she also had her moments that precipitated some of their issues. And some of it was just poor timing, bad luck, or outside influences. But they were a fun couple and this was one of those easy, engaging reads that just sucks you in and makes you smile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M71LY3IE5LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153VNDZY#wasThisHelpful","R39M71LY3IE5LP","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Griffin Hancock is the bassist for the D-Bags. He self proclaims himself to be awesome and dreams of being lead guitar and more in the spotlight. He is unfiltered, cocky, self centered and at times childlike and at other times an a-hole. So the band doesn't always trust him to follow through. He feels held back, unappreciated, and not accepted for who he really is. His wife Anna supports him, but he feels no one else does.I have always had a soft spot for Griffin and his big mouth, outrageous behavior, dirty mouth, and big heart. He sometimes acted clueless and he could be really self absorbed and selfish. He was always kind of the big embarrassing oaf that was always putting his foot in his mouth that people just kind of either laughed at or were annoyed by.But now we are getting into his head, and He has his own agenda. He is filled  with  jealousy, resentment, an inflated ego, and foolish pride. It will lead him to some poor choices that will cause breaks in trust, loss, guilt, misery and even desperation. He was so busy reaching for more, he was clueless as to what he was risking losing. I was mad and disappointed in him and I wanted to smack sense into him and yell ""STOP!"" But I was also heartbroken for him and at times felt sorry for him. I liked seeing his vulnerability, inner heart and emotions. This was a journey of self discovery for him. He had to face harsh truths, go on without his safety net, and get a taste of real life and loss to truly understand what he really needed and what was most important.I adored his wife, Anna. She was always a good match for Griffin,  tolerated his behavior, and could keep up with him. But she really shined in this one. She meets him head on, pushes him, supports him and tries her best to hang on. But he really tested her. Even though their relationship was good, they still had some growing to do together. They take some hits and they will have to fight for what they both really need.Griff and his little girls together just made my heart melt.  He was such a sweet Dad and he loved his family and wanted to provide for them. But that was also part of what skewed his beliefs in what he deemed important.And of course, the D-Bags are back. Sweet, swoony lead singer Kellan who brings out major jealousy in Griff. I love him but he had a few moments that annoyed me too. And Griff's anal-retentive, precise, grumpy cousin Matt who holds tight to lead guitar and won't share. I wanted to shake him sometimes too, even though I felt that he was more emotionally invested in Griffin than he wanted to admit. And even the generally low key Evan got just as mixed up in the drama as the rest of them. And the girls Kiera (who surprisingly gets to really be on my good side in this one), Rachel, and Jenny are also back. I enjoyed seeing more progression in their lives. There were good times, but also struggles. I also loved Griffin's brother Liam who was a new sweet, sexy hottie to love and their outspoken sister Chelsey.This was another long book (416 pages). I will admit that it dragged a bit for me in the beginning to middle part. I got tired of Griffin's whining and need to prove his awesomeness and him feeling held back. It was like a train wreck that you can see coming, but can't look away. It was painful to see him about to veer so far off track and implode his life. But it was also inspirational and emotional following his journey and watching a once prideful, arrogant man try to pick up the pieces, make amends and find redemption.This story brought out negative emotions like anger, disappointment, heartbreak, pain, and sadness. I could not believe it, but Griff even had me tearing up and emotional at times. But there was also friendship, family, love, laughter, sweetness, and hope. The characters all are so familiar that they feel like  family. I felt like I was all mixed up in the drama and tension surrounding them.But I think everyone learned valuable lessons about themselves and each other. I loved everything about the last part of the book and it could not have been more perfect. I ended up loving Griff and Anna and was totally invested in them. So this was a wild ride that was to be expected with Griffin, but it was well worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19J7U6K258ASZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE8K9Q4#wasThisHelpful","R19J7U6K258ASZ","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rain Alexander was focused on a revenge game after someone was cruel to her sister. But Club 39 Bartender Craig Lanaghan became a distraction--unexpected, initially unwanted, intriguing, and persistent.Craig has a man whore reputation is King of one night stands and does not do relationships. He flirts well and gets a lot of opportunity to do so at his job. He is charismatic, honest, upfront, and protective. His family is full of women so he understands them, but he has never found one that interested him enough to go back for more.Rain is more serious and brutally honest. She is emotionally high maintenance and starved for real affection.  She does not like to compromise. She expects nothing less than epic romance and complete attention from a relationship. Craig is a distraction she doesn't need, but finds out it is one she desires. But she is torn because she also feels a strong need to  help protect her sister and needs to focus.They have chemistry in spades and find a connection. Craig finds the one girl he is interested in more with is both stubborn and resistant. It the romantic vs. the realist. But soon she even finds him hard to resist. But with it comes her high expectations and it is a whole new world for Craig. And Rain is not used to trusting people.Can a self confirmed bachelor change his ways and turn into a swoon worthy hero? And what will happen if she has to choose between her sister's needs and being with Craig?We get to visit with old friends Braden, Joss, Ellie, Adam, and Jo as they hang around Club 39. And we meet her sister Darcy and some of her new friends. There is an antagonist that fueled part of the side story, but I was not a big fan of that part of the plot line.This was short, sweet, sexy, and fun. It moved fast and had insta-lust and skirted really close to insta-love, but I know some of it had to do with it being novella length.  But the characters were well developed, had a spark, and funny rapport. It was told in both points of view letting us get their full opinions, fears, and feelings. I loved Craig even when he could be a bit clueless at times. Sometimes Rain's uncompromising ways frustrated me, but I still liked them together. It is always fun being back in the setting and with characters from previous books in a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R167HNJSYGG6KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOAZYYY#wasThisHelpful","R167HNJSYGG6KO","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Natalie Beck has issues--her experiences have left her anxiety ridden and a shut in. She is now being threatened. Her cousin Oliver enlists the help of Security expert Jake Tanner  to help find the culprit and protect Natalie.They email, text, get to know each other in a non threatening way. Jake understands fear and pain. He's been there. He has physical reminders that impact his life, but he found a way to move forward.  He's funny, sweet, intuitive and protective.Natalie is highly anxious, fearful, and stuck in her apartment and socially isolated. She wants to do better and be able to leave her safe environment, but panic seizes her. She's imaginative, sassy, and sweet. And her interactions with Jake just make her realize how much life she is missing and makes her want to fight harder.A connection builds along with trust, flirting,  and sexual chemistry. The more they get to know, the more layers are revealed. They share more and develop an understanding and compassion for each other and their limitations.But despite their connection, need, and growing feelings, Natalie still has many problems to overcome. She has her psychological issues and anxiety keeping her from living a normal life and threats against her. And Jake not only has to be willing to open himself up completely to her, but also has to try to keep her safe and stop the threat.This is a story of baring secrets, being vulnerable. and finding someone to understand and fight for. Neither could be considered perfect. Some would call them damaged, and write them off. But they were perfectly suited for each other and were compassionate, empathetic, and only saw their good hearts and not just their challenges. But it was their issues that I felt made this story somewhat unique. It seemed like the author researched and really provided an understanding of the daily challenges of being an amputee as well as the agoraphobia and anxiety.I loved Jake. He was so strong, competent, and protective, but had his own vulnerabilities and insecurities. Natalie was likable even though her issues were frustrating at times. But I loved how Jake handled them and really liked them together. It was a bit slow to get them physically together and then the pacing of feelings seemed to speed up pretty fast. But It was engaging, sweet, romantic, sexy, and suspenseful. It had the underlying mystery of the threat that I figured out early on, but it did not change my interest in the outcome.I have not read the first two books in the Kerr Chronicles series, but it was easy to follow as a stand alone. Ian and Victoria made appearances in this one, as did their mysterious friend Kaga and Jake's sister Sabrina. Kaga and Sabrina's story was teased in this one so I imagine their story will continue. I also liked Natalie's pro Quarterback cousin, Oliver. He would make a good hero as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15WYMRVXYXAHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUAP7GK#wasThisHelpful","R15WYMRVXYXAHI","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katie Rydale, a make up artist, has no idea how the next man that sits in her make up chair is going to change her life. Kiefer Rogan is a former military specialist turned  MMA fighter/actor and from the moment he hears Katie talking about him with her friend he is intrigued and by the time he sees her, he knows she will be his next mission.Katie has been hiding her true self for years and is basically just a shell of her former self, she is fairly isolated, untrusting, and does not do relationships. She has issues from her past that still affect her, fears, and insecurities. She is in no way prepared to take on Rogan.Rogan is intrigued by the one woman who is trying hard to resist him. He's charismatic, flirty, sexy , funny, and determined. He plans on wearing down her defenses and wants to see the real person she tries to hide. He will have a big fight on his hands, but that is okay since he is used to fighting for what he wants.They have a fun, witty rapport and good chemistry. He pushes, she pulls back, they circle around each other, and have to dodge some punches.  But eventually her resistance is futile.But they are on borrowed time and their lives are totally different. Are they tough enough to deal with their pasts and not break again?  Will it bring them closer or tear them apart?This installment was less about suspense and intrigue, and more abut survival and fighting to truly live. They both have secrets and past pain that is slowly revealed throughout the story. They will both have to learn to trust, takes risks, accept things that they can't change, and share feelings if they ever want a real chance. But not all fairy tales are pretty and perfect and work out easily.I was glad to get a little bit of Jasper, Muse, and Tag from Strong Enough. The story arc involving them was still being explored in this one. I am interested in Tag's story and I also enjoyed Rogan's grumpy brother Russ and Katie's sweet and funny friend Mona.This was romantic, dramatic sweet, funny, sexy, and inspiring. It was told in both points of view and flowed well. The characters were flawed and a bit broken, but likable. It had some dark subject matter but was tempered by humor and a strong connection. I totally fell for Rogan. He was such a sweet and swoony hero with just enough damage and toughness to give him an edge. And Katie had inner strength and I liked seeing her try to take her life back. There were mysteries, secrets, and some twists and turns.It technically can be read as a stand alone since the plot line for this one and featured couple was different than the first book, but there is still the ongoing story dealing with their former military team that continued in this story. So you would get the most out of it by reading Strong Enough first. I can't wait for Tag's story Brave Enough","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1Q5XT8MFQPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI025ZW#wasThisHelpful","RH1Q5XT8MFQPW","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We also spend time with Tucker's team Cole, Brooks, and Kane. I enjoyed the team work and interactions. I liked getting both Tucker and Karen's points of view. The characters were really likable and relatable. Tucker was alpha and protective, but also charming and caring. And Karen was courageous, tough, and supportive. The story line had many layers, but the author was clear in explaining all of the political, financial, and power ramifications and motivations. I really enjoy this fast paced series with just the right amount of drama, suspense, mystery, steam, humor, and romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NRU2G4ECVEK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75RXLY#wasThisHelpful","R3NRU2G4ECVEK6","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dominic Voss, A Denver cop has been injured and his last hope for a full physical recovery and to return to the force is Physical Therapist Lando Frederick. (Squee! Yes, this is Royal's best friend Dom and Remy Archer's first love Orlando!). They find they have a strong attraction to each other. A bit of flirtation and some smoking hot tension lead to stolen kisses and resistance.They have some obstacles. Lando was destroyed as a young man by the loss of Remy so dating a man that risks his life everyday is not something he thinks he can handle. And he doesn't date clients anyway. But Dom does not mind a challenge. He understands he may need to heal his own physical wounds, but Lando has his own emotional ones.Despite their passion and chemistry, guarded hearts and fear place limitations on their possible future. They will have to learn to take risks, fully trust, and get past fear and regret  if they want a chance at moving on with a new normal. It is a battle of love vs. fear...especially for Lando.I loved both of these guys. I was already attached due to Lando's relationship with Remy and his family and Dom's bond with Royal shown in previous books. I honestly thought that Lando was going to be my favorite because his history had been so heartbreaking, but I have to say that Dom won me over and I adored him. Lando actually frustrated me a bit since he did have more reservations and issues.They seemed so different with Dom being a rough around the edges cop while Lando was more refined and reserved. They both had good hearts, wanted to help people, and wanted love, but it was also difficult to trust and believe it was really possible due to their issues. These guys were both hot, sweet, funny and intense. Their chemistry was volatile. They had vulnerability and were believable. I was totally rooting for them.I loved getting both of their points of view and getting to visit with some of the Marked Men and their ladies. I am looking forward to Sayer and Zeb's book Built. This was a good transitional novella to bridge the Marked Men and Saints of Denver series. And most importantly to me it gave us some more closure over the loss of Remy Archer and let us see these two men find each other.Marked Men, Crownover style, M-M love, transition to a new series--it's a win win! This did not feel like a quickie novella, but more of a full rich story. The characters were well developed. likable, and had depth and issues. Even though the plot was not overly complicated or angsty, they did have difficult challenges to overcome and healing that needed to occur. She seamlessly brought together old friends and new ones and it was a comfy, sweet, sexy, humorous, and emotional read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2724VT7B3MWCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UEDP7O#wasThisHelpful","R2724VT7B3MWCT","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5+ starsWhat a gem! I got totally sucked in to this MM hockey love story and hated to put it down.  Rupert and Callum seemed like such opposites but I adored them together.  I loved their banter and  the depth of their building connection and relationship. The interactions with the kids and their friends and family had me smiling. I was totally immersed in their journey of finding each other and more about themselves along the way. This was such a  beautiful heartwarming, M/M hockey story about love, acceptance, and family.I loved seeing Mike and Alexei from Crashing The Net and am interested in more with some of the side characters. I need to delve into the Hat Trick trilogy now to see more with Garrick, Rhian, and Savannah too.There were just a few things that I thought were a tad unrealistic or unlikely, but I really did not care. The story totally drew me in and left me with a book hangover and warm fuzzies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR4WN0XKKJJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7KJUCW#wasThisHelpful","R2FR4WN0XKKJJF","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kira Dallaire is desperate and limited on options. Grayson Hawthorn is losing hope of restoring his family's vineyard. So Kira proposes an interesting proposition that could solve both of their problems.Kira is spirited, sassy, optimistic, and passionate. She thinks creatively and is impulsive. Grayson is detached, withdrawn, worried, and untrusting. But he is also low on options and can't seem to resist her crazy proposition.She a mix of a kind, pretty Princess and tempting, feisty Witch. He is her fire-breathing Dragon. They are antagonistic, wary, volatile, resistant, but also have an attraction and sexual tension. They challenge each other and make each other feel alive, but at the same time drive each other to distraction.Despite the differences in their pasts and upbringings, they find painful common ground. Perception is often very different than reality. Both suffered family dynamic issues, disappointment, hurt, and decreased self worth. Both are trying to find their place in the world, true acceptance, and to be wanted. But both have fears, insecurities, and demons that make it hard to truly trust. And there are influences in their world that will not idly stand by and let them find happiness. There are secrets being kept that could shake any semblance of stability they might find.I loved Kira. She was so full of life and passion. She was strong, kind, understanding, and had so much love to give. She just wanted a life of her own free from her past and family ties. Her ingenuity, impulsiveness, little schemes, sarcasm and wit made her impish and mischievous.Grayson was a bit harder to warm up to. He was guarded with a tough outer shell that hid an underlying vulnerability. He was a broken, damaged man with little hope and a lot of responsibility. He had never really been shown love and acceptance. He kept emotions locked down and tried to honor his vow with hard work. But it always seemed like something would set him back and he was fighting a losing battle. I loved seeing his layers peeled back to get to the heart of him. But his underlying emotions and ability to lose control tended to get him in trouble.Together they had the ability to bring out each other's inner strength, but with that power also had the ability to destroy the other. They challenge and push boundaries, but also have an understanding of the other. They both just needed hope, healing, acceptance, and to matter. But are also afraid to trust and believe in it. They have struggles, but also make gains.  But when the secrets and  hidden truths are revealed, Grayson will have to face the  fact this his world is built on lies. Can they hold on to what they have found or will it send them spiraling back into their separate darkness?I loved the colorful and unique side characters. They were a bit of a rag tag group that made up a network of support. The antagonists were bad enough that I hated them. The setting of the vineyard in Napa was like a character itself and came alive with the vivid imagery and descriptions.Mia Sheridan has once again immersed me in a story that I had a hard time putting down. I stayed up way too late because I hated to leave them.  It has a little of a modern fairy tale Beauty and the Beast feel to it. The story line was perfectly paced with a build up of tension, attraction, acceptance, and drama. There were dark and desperate parts, but also sweet, romantic, funny, and passionate parts. There were twists and surprises.  The characters had depth and flaws, but were vulnerable and likable even when they made mistakes. There were struggles, tension, and dramatic situations that I wondered how they would get resolved. I was completely drawn into this heartfelt, emotional, and inspiring story.I enjoyed getting both Kira and Grayson's points of view and it was necessary since they did not always communicate their feelings freely. It had themes of letting go, trust, faith, fate, and paying it forward. It was a tumultuous journey for this couple who had been beat down and broken, but were trying to rise from the ashes as others tried to bring them down again. They truly walked the edge of balance trying to manage their pain in order to find hope and allow love in even during difficult circumstances. It was a beautiful, raw, powerful, story of survival, hope, healing and the power of true love. And the epilogue was just the icing on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFARR1MFGY1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155Q0LWA#wasThisHelpful","R1LFARR1MFGY1I","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gray Brannon believed in Ryker Evans' goalie abilities so much that she convinced he father, GM for the Cold Fury hockey team to hire him even under challenging circumstances. There were dissenters, but she had faith in him. Now her Dad has retired and she has been promoted to team General Manager. Ryker is one of the few on the team to support her and her unique anayltical strategies.But they also begin harboring an attraction to one another that is strictly inappropriate. She already has a lot to prove so being caught would be hazardous to her career. It could ruin both of their credibility and affect their jobs. But they find it hard to resist.After ruining their chance at the Stanley Cup last year, Ryker is now having a hot season as the Cold Fury goalie. He is a  recently single parent of his two young daughters and is starting to find his groove on the home front. He is a good guy with strong protective instincts. I loved his softer sensitive side as well as his tough, protective, alpha side. He is sexy, sweet, humorous, and an all around likable guy and good friend. But he has been lacking love, lust, and companionship since his separation. But he is a man that knows what he wants and is not afraid to go after it. And Gray is definitely one of his goals whether it is a good idea or not.Gray is highly intelligent, funny, talented, and understands the stress of being a goalie. But she is under a lot of pressure as the new GM and the only female in a male dominated profession. Her business side and womanly side often conflict. She is a bit nerdy and inexperienced at relationships, but that made her more endearing.I loved their rapport and chemistry. I enjoyed seeing Gray out of her comfort zone. And my heart really wanted Ryker to find happiness after all he has been through. Most of the drama was extrinsic to their actual relationship. They are happy together in their little bubble,  but literally have to hide it to avoid any negative consequences and publicity. They yearn for normalcy, but there are plenty of obstacles in their way. And Gray already has enemies and many eyes on her. It is all very precarious and could fall apart at any moment.It comes down to love of a career versus love of another person. It's about goals, priorities, and sacrifice. It is humorous, sexy, romantic, and sweet with just enough drama to keep it interesting.I loved getting more with Zack and Kate, Alex and Sutton, and Garrett. I love the banter with the team mates. Zack especially had me laughing and I enjoyed more progression with him and Kate. Ryker's girls Violet and Ruby, and Gray's Dad Brian often made me smile. Their interactions were so heartfelt.  There were also several antagonists that added drama to the story.I am so glad that there are going to be two more books in this series and I can't wait to see who they will be about!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MF4V2C5QUJPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R3MF4V2C5QUJPH","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grace Johnson and Noah Bennet have been circling around each other for several books. They shared an instant connection, a short lived hidden romance that was torn apart by fears and misconceptions and misunderstandings. Realizing they have both been hurt by the loss of the other and lack of closure, both decide they need answers.Grace is a lot like her feisty, smart-mouthed, strong-willed, emotional mother Ari. She definitely gives Noah and her family some sass. But she is also a girl with trust issues and a tendency to avoid getting close. Noah is going through a lot in his life and he has some problems. But he is genuinely a sweet, caring, good guy. They felt they had a real connection that was hard to get over, but they both made mistakes.Once they reconnect, it seems like at least they might have found a bit of happiness again. But there are still trials and tribulations to face. Love isn't always pretty or easy. They will each have to find their inner strength at times. Their commitment will be tested. They will deal with pain and challenging situations.  They need to figure out where to pull strength from in difficult times. There is a give and take in relationships that has to be balanced. They will have to fight for each other and their future.Their friends and family are all a significant part of their story. They provided humor, drama, mischief, fun, stress, and support. All of their lives are intertwined and affect the others. Meg and Noah's cousin Grayson were also featured in this one and I imagine their story will be next in the series. I really liked Gray. I am still not sure how I feel about Meg.This was about trust, hope, strength, and redemption. This couple felt fate kept bringing them together, but they were constantly ripped apart by obstacles. This is their journey of fighting for hope, love, and a future. This one was a fairly easy read for me and not as super angsty as some previous installments. I did have a few issues here and there with timing issues and plot points. But overall, I enjoyed finally getting Grace and Noah's story that has been a long time coming. I had some preconceived ideas that I thought the story might entail from some previous teasing in other books, but I actually was surprised by some of the plot and challenges so that made it more interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U9LVCJKV1L1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LMAAZK#wasThisHelpful","R1U9LVCJKV1L1I","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jordan Elliott is making a big move from Australia to Texas to play soccer her senior year in college. Her life is very busy with her own studies, soccer, and limited time with her new friends. But she has been asked to take on even more to help a student not lose his football privileges.Brody Madden is not what he seems. To many, he is the handsome, popular, rich, football God who has it all. Few know of his internal struggles and demons.  His perfect facade hides a vulnerable, broken young man full of self loathing, anger and disappointment. All he really wants is acceptance from those that matter and to feel worthy. Football is all he thinks he can succeed in. But he is at risk of losing that as well.Jordan is sassy, fierce, ambitious and sweet. She has her own past issues that she tries to push out of her mind. She has so much on her plate, but does not want to let anyone down. Soccer has always been her life's dream and she is determined to succeed.Trying to keep their arrangement private requires some skillful maneuvering and it has repercussions on both of their lives.  I loved their banter, push and pull, surprising connection, and protectiveness of one another. They never meant to get attached or to care. They didn't have room for each other in their lives. Neither could afford to give up the head space the other took up because they were only supposed to focus on their game, goals, and being the best. They both have their internal motivators that lead them to excel in their sport and they are under intense pressure to succeed. But in spending time together, a new sense of need, connection, and feelings of belonging begin to develop. But eventually something will have to be sacrificed because their futures do not have common denominators and it seems impossible that they could have it all.Brody is always having to fight--his demons, his feelings of worthlessness, for acceptance, to win and succeed, and for Jordan. She believes in him and strives to help him gain confidence. But with issues piling up, sometimes the fight becomes too much. And Jordan also finds herself fighting-- For Brody, for happiness, for love, to reach her goals, and to make everyone proud.  He usually has the ability to ground her, bring her laughter and little room to breathe. But he also has the ability to distract her and cause her pain. They both have so much pressure on them from so many places, but much of it they also place on themselves. And their need to protect each other just adds more.And when life becomes more complicated and everything is at risk, do you let go or hold on tight?This is more than a typical NA sports story. It doesn't just scratch the surface and throw insta-love, lots of sex, and a quick HEA on top of a sports theme. This is an intricately woven and beautifully written story about raw pain, hope, healing, passion, and sacrifice. It is an epic journey of two people trying to achieve their dreams, but also trying to grab on to the person that believes in them enough to encourage them. But sometimes there are conflicts and challenges that seem impossible to overcome and some dreams supersede others. It is a battle for strength, acceptance, love, and happiness. It is about finding out what is most important in life to feel whole and about figuring out how to believe in yourself.I will admit that this book is long. And I have a low tolerance for long books these days. I was a beta reader for this and even warned the author of this ahead of time. I was fully prepared to get bored to tell her to take out unneeded scenes. But surprisingly I was not bored. I found myself totally engrossed. I hated to have to put it down and tend to real life needs. It was not full of long-winded descriptions or details I did not care about. Every word, every interaction, every feeling, every heartbreak, and every victory was valid and important. In the end, I felt it was all needed and I remained entranced and in breathless anticipation throughout this epic journey. And it was truly epic and poignant.It had humor, heartbreak, sacrifice, hope, and redemption, and centered around a real, soul-deep, passionate love not only for each other but also for their sports. It had me going through so many emotions from laughing, crying, anger, sadness, frustration, and gripping my kindle due to tension. I loved these complex characters despite their flaws, failures, or unpopular decisions. I loved getting into both of their heads in dual points of view. I rooted for them all along and my heart broke with them during difficult times and celebrated the happy ones. I was broken so many times, then put back together, only to be hit with another blow. There were twists and surprises and so many ups and downs. And I felt it all right along with them.I loved the side characters:  Jax, Leah, Hayden, Eddie, Carter, Paige, Nicky, Annabelle, and even their Professor.  They added layers of support, protection, and love for this couple and were not afraid to call them out as well.  I would love to see a book about his funny, sweet cousin, Jax, or her protective, sacrificing twin brother, Nicky. And of course there were a few antagonists that I truly hated that caused drama and dissension.I was not sure how Kate McCarthy was going to be able to follow up Fighting Redemption as it was our number one fave read of 2013, and Give Me Grace that was in our top faves of 2014. But she is an amazing author and has managed to write another moving, powerful story with characters that feel real and totally captured my heart. This is definitely one of my very top favorite reads of 2015. It is heart wrenching, passionate, dramatic, and inspirational. It had me completely captivated and emotionally invested throughout. I am left still thinking about these characters and their tumultuous journey and feeling the after effects of an emotional reading experience. These are the kinds of books that stick with me and inspire my love of reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX9MP5COW5EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","R2LX9MP5COW5EQ","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But when he decided his team mate's sister, Ellie is the girl he wants, it gets a bit complicated.She has her reasons for not dating football players. But he doesn't care. He is determined to win her over by any means necessary.They've got chemistry, a connection, and common interests. But she's got secrets and he still has his V card. She's got her hands full dealing with her own life. She doesn't really have the time or want to be in  a relationship with a football player. But he won't settle for anything less.They are like an addiction for each other--hard to resist the chemistry no matter how hard she tries to resist the feelings. But she has secrets and fears that could ruin it all. And sometimes in trying to protect people it only makes a situation worse.This story is about facing fears sacrifice, not giving up, and what it means to win.I absolutely adored Knox! He was the All American good guy with a big heart. He knew what he wanted and wasn't  afraid to go after it. But even though he was sweet, funny, and loving, he also had a little sexy, dirty talking edge to him as well.Ellie was sassy, fun, outspoken, and smart. But she had some underlying emotional issues. Still she was likable and was a good match for Knox. I liked their banter, rapport, and chemistry. I really believed that they were that young couple that just fits together. Unfortunately they had some issues to deal with.I enjoyed the side characters, His identical twin brother, Ty...yes twin heart throbs! And Ellie's brother Jack...She and Jack had such a strong bond and emotional tie. And their Warrior team mates Matty, Ace, Hammer, and Jesse made me smile so much. I loved the camaraderie and the ""boys only"" chats were hilarious. These guys were such a fun, if a bit clueless group when it came to women. Her room mate Riley was also such a sweet heart. I want to see her find her own love connection...maybe with a Warrior...I am a fan of Jen Frederick's Woodland series and she made an easy transition to college football. This is an engaging, humorous, sexy, sweet NA story with college football front and center. I really enjoyed this story and the characters and getting both points of view. The big conflict got a little convoluted and dramatic for me, but it was able to reel me back in pretty quickly. But the ending still felt a bit rushed to me. Maybe I was just not ready for it to be over. I am hoping that we will get more with Knox and Ellie in future books in the series featuring the other players.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBETUUA0KGU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K7YSHO#wasThisHelpful","R3CBETUUA0KGU3","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's the girl of his dreams: low maintenance, sports fan, beautiful, and funny, and they get along perfectly. But she has a single minded focus on school. For the sake of their friendship, he played by her friend zone rules throughout college. And in doing that, she sees him as a popular player who never hurts for female attention.But at the end of college, she blindsides him with a shocking request before they move onto new opportunities.

Mistakes, fears, miscommunication and missed opportunities have messed up their chances so far. She has built her own life and he really has no place in it.Can Riley convince her to take chance on him and that he is ready to finally be everything she needs?The characters were likable even when I wanted to smack sense into them. They had a good rapport and connection and chemistry. I liked that they truly connected as friends first. I enjoyed getting both points of view. The side characters especially their friends Brody and Rainey and her brother Drew were also humorous and interesting. I look forward to more with them in subsequent books. Nate was truly a precocious little man who stole every scene he was in. His interactions with all of the adults melted my heart. I loved the whole group dynamic with the friends and pseudo family they created.I liked the theme of not settling for less than you deserve. They just had to figure out if they really believed they deserved the other and if it was worth the risk.This was sweet, romantic, funny second chance NA love story. It was a cute, easy, and quick read. It went through the college years pretty quickly and focused mostly in the present. The pacing was a bit fast overall and it was not overly in depth. I would have like a bit more of digging deeper with some of their issues and past. But there was just enough angst and drama to keep it interesting, but not enough to be overly frustrating. And it was one of those reads that makes you smile and laugh despite some heartbreaking situations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VC7F3R3AV4KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZEM1OZY#wasThisHelpful","R3VC7F3R3AV4KW","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But when the mission was over, they parted ways.Also featured is his team mate and friend Dagan Zoeller who has his hands full with BKI's CIA liason, Chelsea Duvall. These two also have history and love to go rounds with each other. They are both smart mouthed, stubborn, and love to tease each other. But neither will admit what they really want. One of their team mates declares that they need to ""duke it out, or screw it out.""There is fussing, fighting, flirting, fun, and tons of sexual tension and longing between them. But they also find themselves on a mission that is getting hotter. They're hunting a mole, but it seems that they aren't the only ones. All of a sudden their quiet surveillance mission is becoming more perilous, risky, and fast-paced. I loved both of these pairings and each of their personalities. They all have a good sense of humor and love to tease, but also have good hearts. They might taunt each other, but they band together without question for protection and safety. The guys are  alpha, intelligent, protective, unfiltered, and tough. And the girls are just as talented, brave, and  bad a** as the guys.Dan and Penni seem to be the King and Queen of Bad Timing and Missed Opportunities. They've got unfinished business and it seems like anytime something can go wrong...it does. But at least they give each other hope. But they both have some secrets and baggage, and they also need to be able to trust, believe, and let go of the past.Z and Chelsea are that couple circle around each other, and give each other fits, but are afraid to make a move. They are drowning in sexual tension but both are afraid to grab onto  the other or take a risk. But they keep finding themselves thrown into close proximity so eventually something is going to have to give....or explode.

It is told in multiple points of view and brings back some of our BKI friends: Ozzie, Rock, Vanessa, Boss, Becky, and Michelle. It was a funny, suspenseful, sexy and sweet second chance love story for Dan and Penni. And also set up two other couples with sexual tension and conflicts as well. There is definitely still more brewing with Z and Chelsea, and also with Ozzie and his potential love interest. I am excited about both of those stories that have been building.I was surprised that this book ended when it did. It seemed a bit rushed to me and I wanted a bit more.  But I imagine we will get more with Dan and Penni in one of the next installments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FNWN1T479OH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X648S1A#wasThisHelpful","R3FNWN1T479OH4","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But while Jamie is determined to have her, Jackie is equally as determined that he is not. She has her personal set of rules.

She wants safety and security, but also craves passion and fun. But she is terrified of taking a risk and losing.Can she learn to trust and take a leap of faith that Jamie will be there to catch her?This was a sweet, sexy fast-paced novella. There was humor mixed in with the emotional situations and sexual tension. I liked the characters despite Jackie having some significant issues. I loved Jamie and his alpha ways. He had his own agenda but also had patience and understanding. They had fun banter and serious sexual tension and chemistry. It was told in dual points of view letting us see all their wants, needs, and fears.It also introduced her best friend Chloe who is the heroine in Indiscretion serials.

But there are a lot of hidden, unresolved feelings, fight or flight, avoidance and running. Not to mention other potential love interests  and some other underlying suspenseful situations.This brings back their best friends Gia and Logan. We get to see them all working through some life situations. I like the camaraderie support, and humor they provide each other.This is a story about survival, sacrifice, trust, friendship, and love. I had to go back and reread the end of Resisting Ryann since it has been awhile and I honestly had forgotten some of the intricate story line, but then was able to remember and move on with the story. This one is back delving more into their interpersonal issues versus the danger and undercover scenarios of the last book. But they are still dealing with the fall out from the detour Luke's life took.I adored Luke. He was a swoon worthy hero who was always willing to sacrifice for and protect Reese no matter what the personal cost. Reese could get on my nerves with her judgment, avoidance, and running. But all along this series I have felt their connection, chemistry and that they belonged together. This ties up all of the story lines and brings everything to the forefront, and gives Luke and Reese a chance to figure out what they really want and need. But nothing for them is ever easy and they will have to be prepared to fight for their own happiness.

He's young and the newest on the mercenary team, but that does not mean he is not skilled and deadly.Juliet Mason is a highly trained assassin, thief and operative on Noelle's team. She's closed off, sarcastic, fearless, stubborn, untrusting, and jaded. She believes in self preservation and makes few attachments. She is fiercely independent and hates having to ask for help.Even though she loved to tease and taunt Ethan during their previous encounters, when Juliet sends out an SOS, he comes to her rescue. And much to her dismay he basically pushes himself right into her newest op and her life.But she soon begins to realize that Ethan is more than he seems. Sure he can be the polite, protective, boy scout and gentleman. But he is also mature, alpha, bossy, confidant, quick witted, charming, and sexy. He is cool under pressure, deadly, and good to have at your back. And the more time they spend together, the more their sexual tension and chemistry sizzle.I came to like Juliet and Ethan's rapport and suitability despite their different background, personalities, and small age difference (she is a bit older at thirty-one). They balanced each other well with Ethan having more of a conscience and cool head and Juliet being the one that fearlessly goes after her goals. I loved watching them trying to handle each other and how Ethan was able to hold his own and even surprise her.Juliet's vendetta ends up a bigger op than she or Ethan even realized and eventually they have to bring in more help. So we get more with Noelle, Jim, D, Sully, Liam, and Luke. I particularly liked more with D and Noelle and Jim. This takes place in winter in Belarus with political plots, assassinations, kidnappings, and vengeance. And it eventually turns into a risk for the team that could involve the ultimate sacrifice.I am really enjoying this series and am looking forward to Abby and Kane's novella and especially more with Jim and Noelle. The plot just keeps thickening with those two and their mysterious past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZHFDYOZWQJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9EZBKQ#wasThisHelpful","R3EZHFDYOZWQJ9","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by the prologue then the story gradually unravels in this book in Phoebe's point of view in time jumps. We meet a woman lost and still longing for a past love, but who is trying to move on. We see her interactions with her close group of friends who are all a bit lost and not completely able to follow their dreams. It is obvious in her circle that money can't buy happiness, fulfillment, or love.And then she comes face to face with her past...the elusive HIM ...Jeremy McQueen. And as her past collides with her present, her whole world is shifted on its axis. Many things have changed, but can they move on from their past and possibly start again?I loved Jeremy. I appreciated his bad boy edge and dirty talking ways, but also his sweet, sensitive, vulnerable side. I enjoyed the dichotomy of the younger kid with attitude and a more mature successful man. But he was definitely not immune to making errors in judgment and sometimes he kept secrets that had the potential to be damaging.I had a love/hate relationship with Phoebe. I liked her sass, spunk and determination. I liked her with Jeremy and felt their connection. I enjoyed the rapport with her and her friends especially Jamie and Lily, But sometimes I wanted to shake her. Some mistakes she seemed to repeat and often did not provide full disclosure. So sometimes she frustrated me. But overall, she was likable and a woman who was just trying to find her own way and be happy after not being fulfilled for so long.These two people shared a connection that was hard to deny. But along with it came the past pain and trust issues that were hard to get over. Their lives were complicated with many factors causing stress, anxiety, tension, and drama. And even in the present when they wanted a second chance, they couldn't always escape the same insecurities, jealousy, doubt, and fears. They were so consumed by each other that sometimes it took over their common sense and distracted them from other issues. They both made mistakes and could be impulsive. And they both didn't always trust fully. And there were just enough situations throwing doubt and twisting the truth. Due to this, sometimes they so seemed toxic for each other. But when it was just them and they were in synch, they could also be so very good. They were extremely passionate, loving, spontaneous, tender and understanding. But with all of their baggage at times it was hard to see if it was real or just an illusion of happiness.There were little mysteries, secrets, half truths, and lies gradually revealed throughout the story making it fun to guess and theorize. It was difficult to determine who was being true and who could be manipulating.She had a wonderful support system of long time friends that had their own drama going on that added depth and humor to the story. There were family dynamic issue and definitely some people who would like nothing more than to drive a wedge between them. The whole world they lived in thrived on perceptions, illusions, money, power, and popularity. And there were some situations that left an opening for doubt and mistrust between them.Are they strong enough to truly trust and stand together or will they split apart and lose each other again?It was told in Phoebe's point of view in present and flashbacks with an epilogue in male point of view. It took me a little bit to get drawn in and get the full picture of what was going on but I soon became engaged and invested. This was Phoebe's journey towards finding herself and passion, and her rocky story towards finding love. It had twists and turns. It was a humorous, angsty, dramatic, steamy, emotional epic love story that spanned years. There were secrets, intrigue, and betrayal that showcased the true importance of honesty and trust in order to build and maintain healthy relationships even during challenging circumstances. But also demonstrated how hard it was to maintain continued happiness even once it was within their grasp.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LP88REY470OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF6E2#wasThisHelpful","R1LP88REY470OF","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This takes place after the events in Fighting Silence.Flint Page took a bullet for the woman he loves...who happens to be one woman he can never have. Now he is struggling with life in a wheelchair. His whole life has been disappointments, trauma and challenges. He is now angry, jealous, suffocating, bitter, broody, stubborn and wants to be independent.Ash Mabie bursts into his life just when he needs it. She is like a wild storm determined to bring Flint back to life and lead him out of his isolation and darkness. I loved her crazy, over the top sense of humor, unfiltered mouth, and flighty ideas. She challenged and pushed Flint but also awakens a part of him that likes to push back too. She helps numb his pain and brings back some of his confidence. She helps him experience fun and feelings again.But things are never easy for the Page boys. Mistakes are made. Things are said. And Flint may have pushed too far. Ash never had security, safety, of felt truly loved. She lives in fear of losing happiness once she finds it. But her fears and tendency to run also make it a self fulfilling prophecy.They are both so scared of not being good enough that it adds pressure and makes them fragile and volatile. But I loved their quirky humor, intensity, passion and the way they saw the good in each other. But it was not easy getting the other to believe the positives about them self.This is a journey of heartbreak and disappointments spanning time and distance. Flint has been through so much trauma and tragedy. He pulls so far into himself that he is hard to like or reach. His reactions often hurt others or push them away. His ideas of love are skewed and it costs him. His life has the tendency to change in an instant and not all changes are good. But he also has a strong, stubborn intrusive family behind him both pushing and encouraging him. Although he often struggles to feel like a complete man versus a damaged one. So this is a story of how an angry nineteen year old figures out to fight for his life and what he wants, and eventually where that road takes him.Old Friends and family make appearances in this one: Till and Eliza, Slate and Erica, Leo and Sarah, Liv, Caleb and Emma and of course younger Page brother, Quarry. It made me so happy to see them all. They provided help and support, but also some drama and strife. I also enjoyed Ash's friends Max and Donna, as well as the sassy, vivacious Mia.I love this author and this series. She never fails to grab me and pull me into her dramatic, emotional, and unique stories. She makes me love her complex, damaged characters even though I want to smack sense into them at times. But she keeps me completely engaged and flipping pages to see how it will all turn out.This was heartbreaking, emotional, romantic, humorous, and inspiring. It was told in dual points of view allowing us to feel all that the characters felt. Even though Flint tried my patience at the beginning, I could understand his issues and I came to really like him again. And Ash was just a breath of fresh air. The prologue had me saying ""Holy Crap!"" before it even got started and I loved how the story line developed.These brothers have had nothing but adversity, but find ways to fight in the hopes that their reward is worth the painful journey. We got to see Quarry's story develop in this one. I adore the younger Page brother and am already so invested in his story Fighting Solitude. I can't wait!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239LEIIIRDOK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGSIJ5O#wasThisHelpful","R239LEIIIRDOK1","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lily Fowler has once again found herself in a bit of a mess. She has done something she shouldn't and knows more than she should. So she is now hiding out in a tropical paradise until she can figure out how to address the situation.She is the oldest Fowler sister and not really involved in the family cosmetic business. She's always been seen as the wild child and party girl. She's a girl with a Daddy complex and does not do attachments. She likes to control what she can. She has always been the runner and she avoids getting close by pushing others away and hides her true self under a facade. Lily's never been really felt taken care of or had someone truly on her side. Underneath she is a broken woman who craves attention and love, but has learned that negative attention is at least some attention.Max Coleman was hired to do a job. It should be pretty simple. But he never anticipated being so fascinated with Lily. He finds himself riding the line between what he was hired to do and what he wants to do. They have serious sexual tension and chemistry.He is a dirty-talker, bossy, and likes control, but she brings out his more spontaneous side. While he makes her feel safe and more willing to submit and be taken care of. They dance around control and submission. They challenge each other and break down barriers, but at the same time both have secrets. They have a raging need pulsing between them that constantly consumes them.But there are secrets, lies, and ulterior motives between them. Eventually someone will be betrayed in some way. How bad will the fall out be on their lives and those that Lily cares about? Her whole family's future could be affected by her mistakes and choices.This one ties up some story lines that have been running through the whole series. It gives us a resolved ending and finally all three sisters have had their stories told. Violet and Ryder, Rose and Caden, their father and Pilar are all featured in this story too. I was anxiously awaiting for the culmination of the Pilar story line since we have been waiting three books for it and I was a little disappointed since it seemed a bit rushed in its conclusion.It was told in dual point of view which was really important since they were hiding so much from each other. I really liked Lily more than I thought I would based on the previous books and I liked Max as well. I will admit even though they were hot together and some aspects of the sex also showed their growth together, I felt like the sex kind of took over the story at times. It follows the similar theme of the other two books with a hero who starts out with ulterior motives but finds himself conflicted once he meets the Fowler sister. But overall it was a steamy read with a bit of suspense and an emotional bite as two broken people find each other and try to navigate their various issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVZCND73XLPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXJBZ4#wasThisHelpful","RJVZCND73XLPO","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a feeling once I read about some of these Seals in the last Black Knights Inc. book Full Throttle, that we might be seeing them again in their own series...Leo"" The Lion"" Anderson and his five ex-Navy Seal buddies are ready to embark on new adventures in their retirement...treasure hunting and salvage. They made a promise to a friend to live their lives fully and this is part of their starting over.But one part of his old life he can't seem to forget is the kiss he had with CIA agent Olivia Mortier a year and a half ago. So when Olivia shows up with a proposed mission and payout for his salvage team, they find themselves deep in dangerous waters again with terrorist plots, missing weapons, and even kidnapping. Their salvage mission turns into much more than any of them expected and it will take all of their experience to handle.I really liked Leo. He was a strong alpha leader, but he also had a big heart. He was charismatic, sexy, smart and funny. He really wanted to find the treasure that his Dad had spent years looking for. But he also could not bear to let Olivia down.Olivia was tough, sassy, fearless, but also had a hidden vulnerability due to past issues. Se also was carrying a big secret and was worried Leo would not handle well.Together they had serious chemistry and a longing for each other. I really liked them together. But it was complicated by their jobs, different lives, and her secret.Along with the romance is the dangerous, suspenseful race to complete a mission under challenging circumstances. It seemed like anytime something could go wrong, it did.It introduces us to the other team members Bran, Romeo, Doc, Mason, Wolf, and Mad Dog. The guys are all different with big personalities. I loved their sarcastic teasing and banter, and their ferocious protection of each other. Bran was highly featured not only as Leo's often obnoxious and interfering best friend, but also had his own story brewing that will continue in the next book Devil and the Deep. A couple of scrappy women also were introduced--Maddy Powers, a rich, Texas spitfire--and Alex, a woman who could be very beneficial to the team.This brings in the CIA, black ops, terrorism and throws it to the middle of the sea. These guys ultimate goal is to salvage a shipwreck, but it will be interesting to see what else might come up to get in their way. Once a Seal, always a Seal.This was in intriguing, action-paced start to this new series. I will admit it took me a bit to get immersed because of the past prologue and to get through the introductions of the team and establish the scene and the plot. But I soon became engrossed not only in the romance, but also in the camaraderie with the team as well as the tension, suspense and danger of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Y4XC17WBFPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q571YD4#wasThisHelpful","R16Y4XC17WBFPC","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy Charm is the second book in the Boudreaux series and features baby sister Gabrielle Boudreaux and Kate's cousin Rhys O'Shaughnessy.Gabby is  a young single mother who runs works tirelessly running her family's Louisiana Plantation inn and raising her seven year old son, Sam. She has not had time for herself, much less love and romance. She's strong, stubborn, spunky, kind, but also unsure and vulnerable. She has protective walls up due to her past and struggles to be as independent as she can as she hates having to ask for help.Rhys needs a quiet place to recover and train after a shoulder injury sidelined him from his pro baseball career in California. Coming to stay near his cousin/adopted sister, Kate in Louisiana seemed like a perfect plan. He never expected to be intrigued and attracted to the innkeeper or charmed by her son. But he soon finds himself immersed in their lives and becoming attached. He is handsome, charming, protective and swoon worthy. I absolutely loved him.They find an easy going rapport and chemistry. Gabby really has never had anyone make her feel so safe and beautiful. And Rhys finds himself enjoying having a home life. But their happy little bubble can't last forever since his stay is just temporary. Throw in stubbornness, secrets, communication and trust issues and things in the real world can get a bit more complicated.And of course there are lots of visits from her large supportive and nosy family: Eli and Kate (Easy Love), Beau, Charly, Savannah, Declan and pseudo-brother Ben. I love how this family is protective and in everyone else's business, especially the brothers. But Gabby does not always appreciate it since she has a stubborn streak and does not want to be treated as a weaker, baby sister. I admired her tenacity and relationship with her son. Young Sam had such a big personality and added some extra fun, sweetness, and humor to the story.This was a fairly low angst story, but it did have a little more drama towards the end. It was engaging, romantic, sexy, sweet, and swoony. It is perfect when you need a feel good read with likable characters and heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am becoming more and more attached to this cast of characters.  I am looking forward to Declan's story next. We got to know him and his love interest a bit in this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPRMG9CFXIV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y47OX12#wasThisHelpful","R2OPRMG9CFXIV2","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harper Connelly is taking steps to move on from past trauma. And one way she plans on doing it is is to cover up some physical scars with a tattoo. Not only is the idea of a tattoo out of her comfort zone, but so is making herself vulnerable to another person to see her scars, touch her, or know her past. She is guarded, untrusting, but is also strong sweet, funny, and smart.Trent Andrews is the owner of Second Circle Tattoos and is a very popular tattoo artist. He is flirty, charming, handsome, and hot. He is quickly entranced by Harper and is motivated to wear down her strong defenses. He is patient, kind, sweet, and protective with her. They have an excellent chemistry and a connection, and he also understands her issues and limitations. He does not try to force her to change, but instead encourages her to open up and supports her in her own journey of self discovery.They have to navigate fears, insecurities, and trust issues. They begin to build a relationship, but at the same time both have secrets that could ruin it. Harper is  facing demons who don't want to stay in her past and could truly become a safety issue as well. But Trent's secret could also send Harper running.I really liked them together. they had such a fun rapport, tenderness, but also hot chemistry. Trent was such a swoon worthy hero and Harper was both vulnerable and strong at the same time. I enjoyed watching her try to take back pieces of her life that had been broken and finding her inner fight. I loved the quirky side characters especially his best friend, Cujo and her best friend, Drea.  They were feisty, unfiltered and protective. Dred, Pixie, and Lia were also interesting. And the back story with her brother Reid was intriguing as well.I was surprised that this is Scarlet Cole's debut novel. It is well written, engaging, and has likable, complex characters and a layered plot. It is sweet, romantic, humorous, emotional, and has just enough drama to keep it interesting. There was a lot of foreboding, suspense and danger lurking throughout the story, but I did feel the culmination of it was maybe a bit rushed at the end. At times it felt a bit long and maybe slowed down in a few places. But it is still a wonderful story of strength, determination, survival, hope, and healing. I am looking forward to more in this series and with these intriguing characters. We already got a taste of Cujo and Drea in this one and I cannot wait for more with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAGER4XCB9BI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WE0OS4S#wasThisHelpful","RAGER4XCB9BI8","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third installment of Elle Kennedy's Killer Instincts series and I have been waiting for Isabel and Trevor's story! Even though these can technically be read as stand alones, there has been some build up for this couple in the last two books so I recommend starting at the beginning not to miss any of it. Plus I am really enjoying this series and characters so recommend jumping in and knowing that you will get sucked in and want to continue.Isabel Romo is a chameleon, a woman of many disguises, and put on facades. But that only hides her vulnerable, damaged core from most. But her closest friends and Trevor Callaghan, a mercenary from Jim Morgan's team, can see under the surface even when she does not want them too. Isabel and Trevor have been together on two previous missions. During the first one she literally saved his life from a suicide mission while he was drowning in depression. But the next time, he was ready to try to explore their chemistry, but she got scared and bolted. But now that months have passed, it is time for her to face him again.When a threat hits too close to home, both Jim and Noelle's teams must work together to get answers and find a team member that has gone missing. From Mexico to Monte Carlo casinos comes a plot of revenge and deception that is full of mysteries, suspense, and action.Trevor and Isabel have such a push and pull--he pushes and she pulls back. She hates being vulnerable and is afraid to open up, risk rejection, or hurt him. But Trevor is not going to let her get away from him. They are both stubborn and definitely both have their own issues, but Trevor is relentless in his pursuit to wear her down. And their chemistry is strong and hard to resist. I loved them together and their flirty rapport. Trevor has grown and healed so much during the series while he in turn just wants to help her heal and move forward.This also features Noelle, Jim, D, Ethan, Liam, Sully, and Holden. And we get to meet Juliet, Sean, and Sofia. It is told in multiple points of view to help tell the full story and the story itself is fast paced and full of mysteries and suspense. I felt like I was part of the team trying to figure out what was going with the missing team member and trying to put all of the pieces together. And this one has some major nail-biting action scenes and some serious emotional fall out. I was held captive the whole book and could not put it down. I am looking forward to more with Ethan and Juliet next and also Jim and Noelle. So much antagonism is brewing under the surface.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK4VBO5RIERNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GSFXHW#wasThisHelpful","RK4VBO5RIERNZ","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved Mase and Reese in their first book When I'm Gone. Now they are ready to continue their relationship together as she relocates to Texas. They have been through a lot together and are committed and in love. Unfortunately there are some new outside influences who would like nothing more but to split them apart and claim one for their own.I have adored Mase all along. He's protective, loyal, dependable, sweet, and sexy. He always took care of his sister Harlow, and now he takes care of his girl, Reese. But he could be a little clueless about things going on around him at times. But he really is the good guy.Reese is determined, loving, and still a bit naive. She has lived through a horrible past, but Mase helped her heal and grow. But she is now in a new place, still coming into her own, and learning to believe in her abilities. She has a sweetness and innocence about her, but at the same time she has a backbone and quiet strength.They are such a sweet, sexy couple when they are together. You can just feel their love, devotion, and need. But due to the interventions of others trying to cast doubts, they have to continue to build trust, prioritize, face demons, and insecurities. And Reese especially is still growing and changing her own life and trying to find her own path. She has new family and new purpose in her life, but is sometimes swayed by others' opinions or manipulation.I liked getting more with Mase and Reese, but at times it seemed like there was some contrived drama. I got a bit frustrated with communication issues and the way that in trying to be protective of each other they ended up making bigger mistakes.The side characters of his ""cousins"" Aida and Major were prevalent in this story and Blaire's brother ""Captain"" also was a big part of it. I expect we will be seeing more with Captain and Major in future stories in Rosemary Beach. Even though they could be outspoken, arrogant, rude, and obnoxious...I kind of liked both of the guys. Captain especially seemed to have some hidden aspects to his personality and life. Now Aida, I had no fondness for whatsoever. She definitely gives Nan a run for her money with annoying female characters. The frequent interference of these characters really added to the drama of the story.But I loved that many of our friends from Rosemary Beach, along with Mase's Texas family, Reese's new Chicago family, and Slacker Demon make appearances.Even though Mase and Reese might be the least dramatic of the Rosemary Beach couples, they still have been through a lot together, but still had some new challenges to navigate in their new relationship. There were a few surprising twists in the story, while some things I found a bit predictable. The ending seemed a bit abrupt with a couple of things left hanging, but there were some possible set ups for future stories. Abbi has announced plans for Captain's book, a novella for Dean Finlay (Rush's father), and Nan's book to finish out the series. I am addicted to this series and all of these characters and it was a comfy read for me. I know I can pick up one of these books and get sucked into this world with old friends and enjoy spending time with them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KFCALAQ3MD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X2HW#wasThisHelpful","R4KFCALAQ3MD1","A2MHRBM9MKRNTN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHRBM9MKRNTN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not bad...not bad at all. Jon Bon Jovi is a surprisingly decent actor; very relaxed, no awkward or bad acting that most newbie actors that all of a sudden find themselves in front of a camera...The newbies discover that it's much, MUCH, so much, harder to pull it off than they had thought. So how did a Rock Star God, known for his awesome voice (and great hair by the way) pull off a solid performance in (of all things) a vampire flick!?!? Well, ol' Jon had a little practice...I mean, standing on a stage in front of millions of fans for a couple of decades kinda gave him the ability to pull off the ""devil may care"" attitude with obvious ease. The first Vampires movie with George Clooney and Quinton Terrintino was just a tad bit better than this one, but this part two, Los Muertos was a decent watch. Would I watch it again? Obviously, because this is like, my third time...would I recommend it to a friend to watch? You bet. Was it the greatest movie of all time?..um, no. Not even close. BUT, to be totally honest, I'll probably buy this vid if I run across it somewhere. All the supporting actors/actresses, also, did a good job. It was worth the couple of bucks to rent it.Okay, SHORTSUMMARY (no spoilers)...Another alpha vampire(ss) and her brood, are out hunting and killing. Well, killing is what vampires do, right? Right...but not entirely accurate. This particular Alpha is not only a she vamp, she's old. Among vampires, age is strength, blinding speed and stealth, cunning, she's also very powerful, and kind of a hottie too. But, the worse thing is, she's out to find the hiding place of the ""Black Cross"" that will give her the most important thing to all vampires...especially to the old ones... The Black Cross will make her a Daywalker. This is huge. The sun is the only reason they haven't come after us yet. The poisonous sunlight is stopping them from feeding and multipling at will until we humans are history. During the day their weak. And when they lie week, they are vulnerable. They MUST HAVE THAT CROSS. The Black Cross is a most precious thing...especially to a vampire that hasn't seen the sun in centuries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GI0NTNK973AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWD4GTQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GI0NTNK973AM","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is just something very profound about this song that I really relate to. I was as wild as they came back in the day. I did a lot of things (that I look back on now) and cringe when I remember,  I look back on a lot of things and bow my head in shame. I see the faces of those that have seen me at my worse. Most of them have been gracious enough to forgive me. I was never a really bad person; never truly cruel...But I sure as hell came really, REALLY close to crossing the line; The Point Of No Return. BUT, I did NOT cross that line. I DID stop...I stopped right before I turned into someone or someTHING that I would NOT have ever been able to forgive. The person that is NOW looking back at me, when I look into the mirror nowadays, is just thankful. Thankful for what I have, and WHO I have...Yup, It's Been Awhile since I was the person that was ashamed when he looked into the mirror.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R106XETNEW0XC0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0011Z8R6C#wasThisHelpful","R106XETNEW0XC0","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every child...er..I mean SHEEP has to learn a few things in life. That's how all of us adult...er...sheep grow up to be wise OLD sheep. In this tale, Shaun, our favorite sheep, learns that hanging with the wrong crowd can make everything go south in a bad way. There will always be a group of people...er...I mean SHEEP, (or Llamas in this case) that seem to be so cool; they're always laughing and pulling tricks on others...they do crazy stuff that seems funny at the time, but in truth, is kinda rude and hurtful to others. Shaun, in a very uncharacteristic lapse in judgement --and totally unlike the Shaun we all know-- does something really dumb... Shaun, whom is normally the epitome of common sense and kindness, in a moment of weakness,  tricks the poor old farmer into buying these three seemingly uber-cool Llamas!? At first, all is crazy antics and wild fun...But very soon, Shaun's friends begin to bear the brunt of the mischievous Llamas hurtful pranks. And the poor farmer is terrified of the big bullies! The Llamas are rude, crude, and destructive. Soon, Shaun watches helplessly as the Llamas make shambles of everything.. Shaun has to make a decision: Does he let this pack of Looney Llamas ruin everything, or does he do what is right? This episode of Shaun the Sheep teaches a very valuable lesson about impressions and the repercussions of one's actions.

"There are two kinds of reviews that I hate to...er...review. #1)The ""Oh-my-God-this-freaking-movie-is terrible"" review, because I hate writing bad reviews. So, when a really bad one comes my way, I just TRY to ignore it and just kind of hope that it goes away. And the second kind of review.# 2) is the ""EVERYBODY-loves-this-movie"" ( because it's a classic, and it's been reviewed about a kazillion times. Millions of fans (like myself) have watched the Austin Powers' series over and over again because of the comedic super powers (no pun intended) that Mike Myers has, so it's kind of futile to write a review for this, or the other International Man Of Mystery movies. This movie has probably been reviewed more times than Obama's birth certificate!  Well I am going to go ahead and throw my review in there (a small drop in a huge ocean) because I feel I owe it to Mr. Myers. He has brought us, side splitting, choke on your popcorn, blow slushies out of your nose, and laughing until the screen is a blur because your eyes are filled with tears.--FUNNY! And that panicky feeling you start to get when you are about to suffocate because you can't stop laughing long enough to gasp for a breath of air!?!? Huh!?!? Yeah, you know that type of funny. Well, Mike Myers will (as Austin Powers, or Fat Bastard, or, of course, DR. EVIL)  always be (to me) one of the funniest persons ever borne. That guy (Myers) just KILLS me. Literally.

"Oh man, how could I have forgotten THIS song to put in my library! One of the greatest single songs of all time. If you have listened to classic rock, you know the song Free Bird. You know the song Stairway to Heaven. You've heard Hotel California. Aaaaand, you've heard Train Train. The list is actually endless for each individual, but the truth is, you just CAN'T leave this song off the list. Oh, and here is some trivia I heard; ""They"" say, and I'm not 100% certain it's true because you know how some things that ""They"" say aren't entirely accurate sometimes, but anyway, ""They"" say that the band Black foot sold the rights to this song (and others) for a mere pittance...unknowingly duped into letting it go, because they needed the money and had no clue how popular this song would become. The people that bought the song has made a ton of money, but the band got the shaft. I also heard that the band tried to form under another name, but never did manage to make another killer song like Train Train because, well, honestly, they couldn't get over the fact that they practically GAVE several million dollars worth of royalties away. And the song still plays. Somebody still gets paid. But not Blackfoot....Urg...if the story IS true, I'd be sick to death too!

"PARTIAL SPOILERS: In my last review, I must admit, I got just a wee tad excited and just a wee bit ahead of myself. Um, sorry about that. There is one thing I have discovered about Shannon Mayer: the lady is NOT predictable. I thought I had it all figured out; Lark manages to harness ALL the elements, joins with Rylee in the near future (mind you I have not read Blood of the Lost yet) and together they would open a can of whoop @$$!Simple, right?WRONG... I did not get it right, as such, because Lark doesn't APPEAR to acquire the element of fire...yet..I don't want to spoil anything for anybody, so let's just say that Lark is really starting to grow on me. I loved this book! She is shaping up to be a WISE, as well as, very POWERFUL Elemental.  I have a feeling we have got some real ""wow!"" moments coming up. Oh, and the exciting look at things through nePeta's eyes (which was so cool, by the way) in the little side novella ""Peta"" ? Another total blindside by Mayer. It was Sooo unexpected, and Sooo just like something (I'm beginning to realize) Miss Mayer would do! Loved it. As to this latest book, I am still in shock by the ending, because now, one have to pick back up with Rylee's story to catch up...whew!... So I am going to stop right here before I make a fool out of myself...again...I may add a bit more after I've processed this loop that Miss Shannon has thrown at us... in the meantime, I'm going to dig into the newest Rylee adventure. I MIGHT be able to figure out what in the world is going on here! But probably not. You see, I think Miss Mayer does SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY: She LETS HER CHARACTERS SPEAK AND ACT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL! Sounds crazy, right? Well just consider this: Rylee, a brash, trash talking powerhouse that will ram a blade down your throat as she cusses until your ears burst into flame too! Do you think Miss Mayer talks like that? I would say, no. But her character, Rylee DOES. Miss Mayer has let Rylee off her leash. And be damned those that can't take it. Some people would say that's over the top. But in truth, that's what GREAT writing is all about. An author doesn't control their characters...no...they let their characters lead, and be themselves. Now, I've got another book to read. Hee  hee!...there goes that maniacal giggle again...**NOTE** To all the cool people on GOODREADS: I really, honestly, appreciate the nods from you guys. I would get on GOODREADS and thank you myself..But unfortunately, I am Facebook phobic.

"I'm giving this latest book by Williams five stars because the quality of the read has noticeably improved since the beginning of the series. The story is solid, and now that someone is proofreading for Mr. Williams, his writing talent can be seen without the distraction caused by bad editing. If your a fan of the apocalyptic genre like myself, your definitely going to like this series.  Mr. Williams has a vision of where this story is headed and it has me wanting to see just how this thing will end up. The story is an accurate account of how civilization would quickly unravel for those that believe that our way of life is set in stone; that the government or other powers that be would make sure that each individuals little part of the rat race would remain undisturbed. Most people are in denial. They believe that the status quo is infallible. I, for one, entertain no such disillusion. I find T.A. Williams style of writing (typos and all) more likely to be a very very accurate model of what one of these disasters would, indeed, be like: 1) if the power and all communication goes down, there will be many that will not ever know what's going on. 2) Suspicion, confusion, panic, and mass hysteria will be rampant. 3) And finally, if our country were to experience an extended state of disarray, SOMEONE, would take advantage of our predicament and begin to pour into the country while we are down with all intentions of making sure that we STAY down. I've read a million stories where huge groups of Americans would pull together and (way too conveniently) thwart any such attempts...the truth of the matter is, the common everyday man would be way to busy trying to survive (by any means necessary) than putting up any resistance against an invading force. Anarchy would reign. The people that are packed into the bigger cities, that have no plan (or belief in such a thing) will be ill prepared for such a contingency. The affluent, those that think monetary security is all they need, will be the first to realize that this is, in fact, not the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBIRRLAPAGDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012237604#wasThisHelpful","RWBIRRLAPAGDO","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that I am enjoying this series by T.A. Williams, but those readers and reviewers out there that are a stickler when it comes to typos will throw a fit. The series also starts out kind of rough, but it does gain momentum and becomes a decent apocalyptic yarn. The exact cause of the coplete loss of the U.S. power grid remains a mystery. It does not seem to be important HOW the country went dark, but HOW society crashes violently, and quickly; descending into complete anarchy. I am already on book five. So, this IS a good story. I've even put off starting some books by Mayer (my favorite author) because I don't want to put this story down. SUMMARY: A family....Man, a wife and four children. The mother succumbs to cancer just before the country goes dark. The father, can't take the grief and crawls into a bottle...and stays there. Leaving his children pretty much alone. But when the lights go out, the father collects his broken family and flees to the family farm; a farm that has been in the family for generations. It's way out in the country. Maybe they can hide and wait for the world to get back on track...or so everyone hopes...right up until the foreighn soldiers roll in.. . All in all, it's a good read, but the spell check (that can really ruin your writing) was obviously hell bent on wrecking an otherwise, decent story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R227EVLL73CKVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTCJX7C#wasThisHelpful","R227EVLL73CKVD","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a current movie. Ian Keller is young (even though his make up makes him look older) and there are others in this Gothic horror story. The filming is done pretty well for the time that you will recognize. It is not a B movie, but by today's standards, it's kind of hokey. It was worth watching though and I would suggest you watch it just to see these Box Office Big Guys back in their ""starving actor's"" day. The movie is placed in Nazi occupied territory that is the sight of a massive, ancient, keep. To the horror and detriment of all, The Keep is not built to keep people out, but to keep the malevolent spirt that is traped within, from escaping out into the world. The entity is held prisoner behind vast walls of stone warded by silver glyphs embedded into the stone. When the Nazis (ignoring vehement warnings from the keeps priests, attempt to steal the silver wards...well, let's just say, they should have left the silver alone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UG9IMFMPAMKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMJSEA0#wasThisHelpful","R1UG9IMFMPAMKH","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This order was a mistake. I thought I was ordering a DVD, but got a flawless VHS instead! Totally MY bad. I didn't read the offer correctly. It was right there: ""VHS"" in great big letters!  Oh well...need to wear my glasses, no matter how dorky I look! Anyway, I was at least pleasantly surprised by the VHS that I ended up with though. This VHS was in BRAND NEW CONDITION. luckily, I DO still have an old video cassette player. I drug it out, dusted it off and the tape played as good as it looked. The shipping was super fast. (Thank you Mr. Begley!) Even the sleeve was new looking. I don't know where Mr. Begley dug this old vid up, but it looks like it came straight out of a time capsule! Very pleased considering the circumstances. Those of you whom may like to see this really odd (but funny) video, you will find that it's not simple...or cheap. This particular video is very hard to come by because, The Applegates, aired on a channel that no longer exists, so the copies are few. Loved this show back in the day.

"UPDATE #2: Okay. I was really impressed with these cords when I first got them. And the extra length was great too..HOWEVER, three out of the five that I bought have creased to function. The ENDS BURN OUT. It is not a shorting problem. The cables themselves held up fantastic. But what good is durable cables if the ends are going to smoke out!? My tester says there is no longer continuity end to end. But I tested just the cord and it read fine. So the cord is good the male ends are NOT. Look at the date of my original purchase, you will see that these cords only lasted a couple of months. I've had cheap plastic ones that lasted two years or more. I dropped the rating to three stars. I had one burn out immediately. I thought it was just maybe a fluke. Maybe I accidentally twisted it or something....I guess not. Read on. Start at the bottom if you want to see the original review, and move upward through the updates.UPDATE*** one of these cords has stopped working. Burned out? Shorted? Can't tell. I was not doing anything particularly different with the one that malfunctioned. No smell. No kinks. It just stopped working...very odd. Maybe it was a fluke, but maybe not. I felt it was my duty to update. If anything else happens to any of the others, I will know it's the cord not a fluke. At that point I will redo this review. I'll give them one more chance before dropping stars. END UPDATE**Cheap cords wear out way too soon. Here's the theory behind data exchange and charging cords: the tips of the cords that go into the Universal Service Buss on your devices are made of a softer metal. They are made to wear out. Because if they didn't, then it would wear out the USB PORT itself. In other words, they would render your device useless because the PORT is ruined. But a good quality cord will last longer and would be less prone to shorting out. Especially charging high voltage devices like laptops, and tablets. These cords are different from anything I've ever seen. I have seen braided lines on automobiles and heavy machinery. The design is superior to plastic coated cables. These cords follow the same line of performance. They are longer than most cords, and they seem to have a heavy duty feel to them. I've only had them for a short time but I love how they are performing so far. They transfer 2.0 mAh of power and don't even get warm. I'll update if they fail to perform.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BYEY1JZ9EAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MF78Q66#wasThisHelpful","R14BYEY1JZ9EAQ","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until now, I've always reviewed Shannon Mayer's Rylee series as if I were trying to ""convince"" someone who has never read one of her books, how much I like her writing style and how much I love Rylee...well, I can't figure out how to do that SOS this time. So here are the facts.***SPOILER, SPOILER, AND MORE SPOILERS!!! THE WHOLE REVIEW IS ONE GIANT SPOILER!!**So this review is for those who have read the book, not for those who are not a total fan!Okay, wow! I can't wait for the final book, Blood Of The Lost! I am so glad Pam has come to her senses and has stopped feeling guilty, and sorry for herself. I am NOT okay with Faris/Liam winning over Rylee's heart! No way! This is important: I KNEW THAT ELEMENTALLY CHALLENGED (an introduction to Larkspur) WOULD BE RELATIVE TO RYLEE'S FUTURE! And if you'll look at the review you'll see I was right! I hate that Milly is dead, but she died a good death and she died with a clean soul and not as Orions whore! I hate that Frank gets killed because he was a very decent young man. I hate it for Pamela. I am also totally freaked that Alex is and (hopefully) will retain the ability to fully transform...our little Alex is all grown up now, almost. I loved RECURVE and I enjoyed meeting Lark and I can't wait to see how much she will actually help Rylee kick Orion's ass! And I will be very pi$$d if Liam does not come out of the newly opened veil at the end of this thing and he and Rylee DON'T fly off into the sunset on Blaz!! And most of all, I hope little Marcella and Zane follow in their mother's footsteps and start the loop all over again. And last but not least, I dread The Blood Of The Lost, because it will mean that I must part ways with Rylee, her world, and her friends! WOW THAT FELT GOOD!

As I said before, the series is like all the good ""spacer"" movies rolled up in an exciting bundle of PAGE TURNING READING!  Each and every episode is another romp of high SCFI action that has an addictive element that makes me cough up my hard earned bucks and buy them all...But I had to stop and do another review on this particular book because it really shook me up! ***MINOR SPOILER***The story opens with the crew disbanded and scattered!?? I was like, OH $#!+!! And the most disturbing thing was the fact that the Phoenix is GONE!!?? Jason and Lucky the battle synth are the only ones of the old crew still together!?

Parts!?...I was like, WHAAAA!? That's all I'm going to say about the deal, but I must admit, THIS is one of the best in the WHOLE series...And that IS saying something! I read in the forward by the author that Joshua Dalzelle says that he will keep writing about the Phoenix and her crew as long as HE enjoys doing so, AND as long as his readers enjoy the series...NOTE TO AUTHOR: Mr. Dalzelle, sir.

"I totally agree with the other reviewers that Wesley Snipes is way underrated, and so are these two movies: The Art Of War, and The Art Of War 2... The whole cast did a great job. The directing was done very well also. There is a high quality to these two productions that trumped other movies that made a much bigger ado, but was not NEAR as exciting as TAOW one and two. Anyway, looking for a good vid? If you've never seen these two movies, your in for a great treat! Here's a quick summary without spoiling it: Shaw must dust of his Men In Black suit (metaphorically speaking of course) stretch out the old wounds and broken bones and go after the people that had anything to do with his mentors murder.

"I don't know how ""great"" the older Tommy Hilfiger shorts were. Where they the same price as these? I can only judge  what I know from the product I just received. I read where some of the other reviewers were terribly upset. But if I can get a whole year of decent wear out of these shorts (for this price) I will be cool with that. Heck, if I get a year of good wear out of them, well, they beat some other supposedly ""awesome"" shorts by a long shot. I have a pair of expensive shorts that I paid the same price I paid for four pairs of the TH's for one pair, ( I will not mention the name of those super duper high quality, high wicking, top of the line shorts that have two letters inverted for obvious reasons) that look like $#!+ and they aren't a year old yet. I was looking for some decent underwear that didn't cost a fortune (singly or in multi packs) after looking at dozens of brands, surprisingly, these Tommy Hilfiger shorts were perfect. The price is reasonable for four pairs. Some brands wanted this much for a single pair of underwear!? That's fine for doctors and lawyers, but I'm just a regular dude. Anyway, they feel great. I was looking to get away from the baggy boxers that bunch. I like the form fitting feel of these, they manage to fit but not too tightly and they stretch in any way that I do, and the material feels nice too, without being decadent; too slick or silky (these are MEN'S underwear, not panties, and yet feel like high quality wicking underwear) ..There are no tags or stitch bumps. I am very pleased. I will be getting another four pack immediately so I will have a pair for every day of the week....all my old baggy, faded shorts will be cut up and start their new life as rags!

"I was thirteen years old when I saw the first Exorcist staring Linda Blair. It. Freaked. Me. Out! People actually got out of their seats and RAN out of the theater! Not because they didn't like the movie, oh no, they rushed up the isle and out the door because they were SCARED! The first time I saw American Werewolf in London, hearing that creature's scream/howl rolling across the moors made the little YIKES hairs on the back of my neck stand on end! I was afraid to look out of a dark window for months...I was afraid that I would see two HUGE eyes staring back at me. When the first Alien came out, it also scared the beejeebees out of me, it was one of the first movies that actually made me nearly jump clean out of my seat! Well, it's been a long time since I saw a REALLY GOOD horror movie, but this movie Annabelle truly had me jumping like I was a teenager again! And this is what confuses me; the so called ""critics"" only gave this movie 3 1/2 stars...whaaaa!? That's right, you heard me right...three and a half lousy stars...But these same ""critics"" gave some really LAME artsy fartsy type foreign horror flick FIVE stars...whaaaa!? I'll not mention the name of the (in my opinion) way overrated movie, but I WILL say that it was no where near the movie that Annabelle is. So, I don't know who these critics are, and I don't know how they fill out their score card, but they need to find a new occupation, because they're total nimrods!! And about 1,500 reviewers agreed with me on that sentiment.  As a matter of fact,  I've started paying NO attention whatsoever to what the ""critics"" say, because I believe they need to have their medications adjusted. Here's a quick summary of Annabelle: A soon-to-be mother receives a collectable doll for a present from her husband. She loves the doll and adds it to her collection. Things are going beautifully for the newlyweds...until a couple of satanic occult nuts crash into their house! I don't want to spoil anything by saying more, but this movie is supposed to have a kernel of truth somewhere in there concerning the doll (creepy, right!?) It's also based on a concept storyline from the movie, The Conjuring. So, I'll be watching The Conjuring next...hmm...I wonder how the ""critics"" rated it? I think I will just put my trust in what the reviewers say, because, the other reviewers seem to have better taste than the ""professionals"". Anyway, watch Annabelle and see what you think. See if you don't jump a time or two!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TV6X18X76CSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SH03XJA#wasThisHelpful","R2TV6X18X76CSH","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I get to the review, first let me say congratulations to Daniel Radcliffe for shaking off the role that made him a household name and moving on with a surprisingly solid performance in this picture. As I watched the movie, I actually forgot all about his previous character, and was drawn in by this NEW character. Radcliffe is a young man now, and he did a splendid job in this dark ghost story. I must shamefully admit that I almost didn't watch the movie because, I too, could not imagine Harry Potter all grown up and having the audacity to try to pass himself off as anyone else BUT our hero from Hogwarts!  Well, he deserves some serious recognition for his acting skills...Because he CAN act in other roles. He CAN make you forget about the young boy that was a famous wizard! Maybe he will NOT suffer the fate of so many others that were forever doomed by playing such a popular role. It's happened time and again and the young superstar tragically fades away into obscurity. And not only did  Radcliffe do good work in this movie, ALL the actors involved did very well. As a matter of fact, I have a hunch that if more people KNEW how good this movie was they would have watched it. But, they were probably still grieving the end of the famous series by JK Rowling! Anyway, I am confident that we will be seeing a lot more of Radcliffe. ***Here's a short summary on this haunting movie: A young and upcoming lawyer is on the verge of losing his job. The depression brought on by the death of his wife during childbirth is beginning to affect every aspect of his life. He gets one more chance to snap out of it before he loses everything. He is sent to settle the affairs of an old estate. But from the very moment he arrives, he is shunned and avoided by the small towns inhabitants. He is warned to stay away from the house, because if he persists, he will bring about the wrath of a vengeful spirit. ***  This was a pretty cool watch. I thought I'd check it out before watching the recently released, The Woman In Black 2... And I am glad I did. Watch this, it's worth the price of a rental.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ERY9KSGZGOLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y7EYSK#wasThisHelpful","R2ERY9KSGZGOLA","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, this is the Death Wish movie that I personally liked the best. I've watched it time and again. The first two were good also, but when they made this movie, everything about the series was just working really well. When Bronson's character, Paul Kersey, brings out ""Willy"" the awesome Wildey.475 Magnum, it was just (to me) the epitome of the series. The first Death Wish movie that started it all, had this ""rawness"" about it: The bizarre background music, the garish seventies styles, and there was little monologue to make the acting too complicated for a cast that were expected to get it right in one or two ""takes"". The ""stylish seventies"" fashion that Paul Kersey lives in during the movie,  was displayed so that his character was presented as very ""civilized"" and a very ""modern"" type of person, so that when he begins his silent wrathful vengeance, the viewer could grasp the change from the happy and lavish lifestyle of an educated and well off individual, to a fallen down, broken and grieving man who resorts to retribution and vengeance to deal with the futility and impotent rage that all victims are forced to deal with when senseless violence destroys their lives. It's human nature to want revenge, an eye for an eye type justice is very appealing to those that can't get closure or justice for crimes committed against them. But entertaining that fantasy is exactly what made this movie so popular then, AND now. Obviously, in real life, EVERYONE cannot become a vigilante, the days of wild west frontier justice ended for a good reason. But the ideal of taking out your rage on the deserving, is what Death Wish is all about. The sales for the Wildey Magnum would spike every time the rerun of Death Wish 3 would air. It's a shame that Death Wish 4 went so badly. They tried to change a style that the series had established to this point...it did not work. DW 4 was the ""jumping the shark"" for the Death Wish. The end. Pity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CV9YUH09X3N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026QC0SG#wasThisHelpful","R2CV9YUH09X3N2","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh man, this Death Wish movie was really bad. And I mean 'bad' in a horrible way. The first three movies were vintage Bronson and were each consecutively BETTER: The first Death Wish was a classic, like old muscle cars and old Godzilla movies. It was limited by early seventies cinematography, and the acting and directing were borderline at best, but it a had a certain ""style"" about it. The bizarre background music, the flashy/gaudy fashion of the day, it was cool because it just all worked together. The second Death Wish was a bit better; the plot just a continuance of the first. Death Wish three was THE BEST. Especially when Bronson ""sends for Willy"" the monstrous Wildey Magnum Pistol. The third movie reminded me much of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies. BUT, this fourth one was just awful. I surmise that, after acquiring a bigger budget, I think that the producers tried to to change up the directing. I think that this is one of those times that if it's not broken, don't try to fix it, and they lost that rawness prevalent in the first three. Pair the ill attempt to throw more money at the popular Death Wish series to try and make it 'better' and the horribly corny eighties vibe (I think they were going a for futurisic, or a more 'modern' look and feel) then mix in the god-awful acting, and they ended up with really REALLY baaaaaad movie. The first three relied on Bronsons steely gaze, and he portrayed the quite desperation of a victim, a helpless widower pushed over the edge into vigilantism, really well. THIS movie portrays Kersey as being almost as bad as the people he usually deals with in these type of circumstances. They should have left it alone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PAWWSHEHM57U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ONV5NI#wasThisHelpful","R3PAWWSHEHM57U","A3B9DHWCMYQFD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B9DHWCMYQFD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jason Statham is known for his tremendous physically charged action movies and I don't think he ever made a movie that I didn't like. But, for some reason, this particular movie is my favorite I think. His interaction with Young Catherine Chan as Mei was some of his best acting. In most of his films, he's the cool headed, emotionless, lethal powerhouse. His explosive martial arts prowess is pretty dampened impressive. You just can't choreograph talent like he displays. Oh, I'm sure the action segments and fight scenes were indeed choreographed, but you can't just 'teach' that kind of skills 'on the set' ..no...Mr. Statham is a genuine, highly trained individual whom has obviously devoted an amazing amount of effort and determination to his discipline to be that bad @$$. We've established that. But the way he portrayed being 'saved' from a shattered life, a murdered wife, and the razors edge of suicide because the hopeless little Mei needs him; gives him a purpose to not give in to despair but get up and fight, and fight HARD for her is just ...well...great! Here's a quick summary: Stathan's character is an ex police officer that has been betrayed by a corrupt department. They hang him out to dry, letting all the criminals (especially the Russian mafia he'd gone afoul of) tear his life to peices...They let him live. But it's no life. Anyone he talks to, will die. Anyone he gets close to, they'll die. He is not even allowed to live anywhere or it will be destroyed. ..Mei, a small child that has an amazing photographic mind. ANY number, ANY, no matter how long or complex, she can remember it ...perfectly. Flawlessly. The Chinese Mafia use her as a human numbers book. All operations, all payments, all COMBINATIONS, are stored on the wet ware that is her brain. No paper trail. No computers to hack. There's just Mei and her mind. When the information in her head becomes too valuable to let her continue to live less she be compromised and forced to reveal immeasurable wealth and power, she has to flee certain death from her former ""fathers""  --vicious gangsters that would blow her brains out in an instant-- knowing this horrible truth about her situation,  she makes a run for it...And she runs smack into Statham just before he makes that fatal 'last step' of his life.... Their eyes meet. The connection made. Both desperate, Both about to die...thinking he's going to die anyway, he wonders, can he do one last meaningful thing before he goes? Freaking awesome!

"I have a (high school) lacrosse player, and he keeps a goal in the side yard.  It's well used - he takes shots on it probably 9 months a year.  After he had had it for about 2 years, there were holes in the net and it looked ratty. At that time I bought him a standard replacement net which he had to string into the goal; it took him a while and a fair bit of cursing.Two years later, that net was looking dingy and ratty.  I kept suggesting he get a new one and he kept resisting-- he didn't want to deal with the replacement.  Then I came across this bungee net and snapped it up (I bought the 'lacrosse' size and it fits a standard lacrosse goal).  Wow, brilliant!  I wish I'd thought of it!Once the ratty net was off, he slipped this new net on in seriously one minute.  It looks great, it stands up to his 18yo varsity attackman shots, and it couldn't be easier.  As an added bonus, it was so easy to slip on that I predict he will take it off for the winter months (something he's never bothered to do before), which will help it to last a long time.

"I used Rosebud Salve in my younger days, and was THRILLED to discover it again when I was searching for a lower cost alternative to Baume de Rose by Terry.  I was thrilled when I got the Rosebud Salve... it smells great, glides on so smoothly, and feels soooo soft.Then, sadly, I read the ingredients: petrolatum, cotton seed oil, and scent.  Petrolatum is petroleum jelly... vaseline!  This is basically perfumed vaseline.Google petroleum products, which are by-products of processing crude oil.  Many think they are carcinogenic. There are a lot of risks to using petrol based products on your face (& mouth!).  Even if you don't believe in the risks, the scientific fact is that petroleum jelly is occlusive and hydrophobic.  Here is one quote: ""Petroleum jelly can create the illusion of moisturized, hydrated skin, all the while suffocating your pores. It's water-repellant and not water-soluble, meaning it merely seals the barrier so that moisture does not leave the skin. So while you might feel the instant gratification of a softened surface, you're actually drying out your pores by keeping out air and moisture.

"I picked this food up because it's Grain-Free, which is all I feed my fogs, and because I know rabbit to be a quality food source for dogs.  However, further research has made me realize that this formula is only nutritionally 'okay'.  Meat, which dogs need, is not a star here.The first ingredient is potato.  Potatoes are a grain-free carb source, but they are nutritionally empty for dogs!  Further, while rabbit is the second ingredient, it is the only meat in the food.  Most GF foods, by comparison, have multiple meat-sources of protein (e.g. turkey, duck meal, chicken fat, etc). And, raw rabbit has a high water content, which means that after cooking it, the meat content is vastly reduced.  And the third ingredient is potato protein, which is a cheaper plant-based source of protein than meat; it has a lower biological value.  All in all, this food does not offer dogs a good amount of meat.My 2 dog however, loved the taste.  They give it 5 stars.Bottom line:  A decent dog food which apparently is delicious.

"I use a tablecloth probably once or twice a month - for dinner parties, or any special dinner, for birthdays and holidays.  My number one priority is that they be washable.  And when washed I need them to come out of the washer completely clean, and come out of the dryer unwrinkled, unpilled, and looking as they did when they went in.  Second priority: that they look nice, and add something special to my table.  This tablecloth is better at the second than the first.THE GOOD:+ Gorgeous. I have the red/green Jardine and it looks exactly as pictured (not more 'muted').  The colors are lovely and the design is eye-catching.+ It is machine-washable, and colorfast (in cold).+ Yes okay it comes out a little wrinkly, but if you get it right from the dryer and smooth it a bit as you lay it out, you don't need to iron it.  Well, *I* don't iron it... you might if you're a better housekeeper than I (a low bar).  But I don't think it needs it.+ Busy pattern hides small stainsTHE BAD:- Although it's washable, it's not stain-resistant.  Regular stains come out but grease stains do not.  I have fun parties... things get spilled.  And I'm a shoddy housekeeper, as described above, so I don't go over my tablecloth inch by inch looking for stains to pre-treat... I just throw it in.  So I have a small grease stain on it after just a few weeks of use.  I did take one star off for this because I think that in real life, tablecloths get spilled on; they should be able to take it.BOTTOM LINE:  Pretty....a bit impractical if you 're friends with people who spill...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQXAVZK4DG2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JBYZ9I#wasThisHelpful","RZQXAVZK4DG2M","A3HUC8541SJ6UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HUC8541SJ6UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a frequent baker, and was very happy to pick this plastic spatula up so I could remove brownies/bars neatly, but without scratching my aluminum pans.

"I picked up this BOOMco Blaster for my college son, whose obsession is his Humans vs Zombies Club (a nerf battle club, very big on college campuses).  He was THRILLED to get it.  He says the guns are better than Nerf Guns and his only concern is if they will be 'legal' for his club (more on that below).THE GOOD- PER HvZ PLAYER:+ Much faster shooting than nerf guns, because instead of cock-fire-reload, you cock and fire (and the reload happens automatically).  The only limitation on your firing speed is how fast you can move your arm back and forth.+ Special dart cartridge can't jam, and is fast because the pulling back you do to cock the gun moves the cartridge along and you are instantly ready to fire.+ Surprise one-time-use multi-firing ability.  If you preload 3 darts, they will fire simultaneously, while you're regularly firing, when you trigger it.+ Same distance and accuracy as a nerf gun; faster dart speed+ Sticky tips of dart stick well to targets and other BOOMco surfaces- including your pop-up 'blast shield' (so you can capture your opponent's darts!).+ Plastic darts are sleeker, cleaner, and easier to clean than foam dartsTHE WE'LL SEE:Darts are a light plastic, not foam, and the guns do NOT take Nerf darts. (I didn't mark off for this because they don't claim that they will.)  My son immediately posted on his group's page, asking if he'll be able to use these guns and darts in the HvZ battles.  Apparently their leader had already heard of these guns and has ordered some to trial, to see if they'll be ok.  I will update with the verdict.BOTTOM LINE:New style dart-gun, with several excellent features that make it faster and easier to fire.  Darts are plastic, not foam.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343WV3HYE9SYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVP1ANW#wasThisHelpful","R343WV3HYE9SYF","A3HUC8541SJ6UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HUC8541SJ6UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a PT and also the Mom of a fairly hard-core athlete.  Between us we enjoy trying various workout tools and gadgets.  I liked the idea of the Push-Up Pump as a way for people who can't do push-ups on their own to enjoy the benefits that push-ups offer.  But this thing is so bulky and cumbersome that it may not be worthwhile.THE PROS:+ Not too hard to set up - about 20 minutes+ It does indeed allow almost anyone to do a push-up with good form, because it supports you at the chest and you push your arms down and up+ 3 positions for your hands, to get at different muscles+ Comes with 3 resistance bands so that the stronger athlete can also benefitTHE CONS:- This is not small or foldable in any way. It's bulky and oddly shaped and it doesn't just tuck away anywhere.- Your body does not go all the way down, as it would with a traditional push-up.  As a result, most of the work comes from shoulders and arms, and less from your chest.- Does not actually give a ""full body"" workout,  I would argue that it gives LESS of a full body work-out than a regular push-up (which will work your core).  Core and legs are not worked.BOTTOM LINE:  Can help a beginner to do a push-up with good form, but since it doesn't precisely mimic a push-up (doesn't fully work chest, doesn't work core) and since it's kind of cumbersome, it may be more worth your time to start with modified push-ups.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJVHINLMDFX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089YI8AI#wasThisHelpful","R2IJVHINLMDFX3","A3HUC8541SJ6UT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HUC8541SJ6UT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cook a lot, and I use tea towels for the following purposes: to throw over my shoulder as I cook; to cover rising doughs; to hang on the oven handle to dry hands; to lay on the counter for hand-washed items to drip dry on.  These towels perform well in all 4 capacities - and they're pretty!WHAT WORKS:+ I mostly use tea towels over one shoulder as I cook, to wipe my hands on as I handle ingredients.  These towels work great in this capacity because they are big (20"" x 30"") so they don't fall off - as shorter towels often do when I bend to open the oven, etc.+ I also make a lot of dough - pizza dough, bread dough, sticky buns, etc.  When dough rises it has to be left in a warm place and covered.  Again, these towels are excellent in this capacity as they are big enough to cover a baking pan, a large bowl, whatever.+ When not in use as above, I hang my tea towels on the oven handle for people to dry their hands on after washing.  While these towels are not super-absorbent, they are certainly absorbent enough to dry hands.+ The few items I don't throw in the dishwasher (knives, vitamix, etc), I like to lie on a tea towel to drip dry.  Doubled, these towels are absorbent enough for this task, and they're not so ""slippy"" that items slide off of them.+ They are machine washable, or I would never use them.  They say (like all linen) that they need to be ironed, but I don't iron these as they are functional more than decorative, and I don't care about a few wrinkles.+ They are a pretty splash of color (albeit a bit reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy towels!)WHAT MAY NOT WORK:- If you intend to dry really sopping wet things with them, they may not be absorbent enough to handle this- If you use your tea towels (instead of potholders) to take things out of the oven with - they may not be thick enough to handle this- I see some reviewers talking about using these on their dining table, which I don't totally understand as they are for kitchen use- they are not napkins... but if you want to use them on a formal table you'd probably have to iron them or take them immediately out of a hot dryer.BOTTOM LINE:Oversized and pretty, they work well for everything I use a tea towel for.

"About a year ago I got a fancy new Samsung dishwasher, but I was so disappointed because, from the start, things were not getting very clean. The knives especially were coming out with baked-on crud all over them.  I called the store to complain about my defective new dishwasher, and they told me to try Cascade Pacs instead of the liquid that I was using.  And it worked!

That's the bottom line for me, and everything else is just extra.Also nice:* Throwing a tab in is super convenient* I like the bucket because it squats patiently under my sink, never tipping over or taking on leaks, and it can be re-purposed (crayons! legos!) or recycled.note: these are phosphate-free, my old cascade pacs were phosphate-free, they get the dishes perfectly clean, and phosphate-free is good for the planet.BOTTOM LINE: They work.

It definitely kept me dry during the normal course of my day (kids/dogs/work/walk)... but I can't say that it kept me drier than my regular Dove anti-perspirant.THE GOOD:+ Smooth going on+ Inoffensive smell+ WorksTHE BAD:- Will leave white marks on your shirts- I notice no difference in protection between this and cheaper (non clinical strength) productsTHE WEIRD:Packaging advises putting the product on at bedtime.  Huh?  From everything I've read, wearing these chemical-laden products is bad enough, at least let your skin breathe overnight!

"I'm a physical therapist and also a home-exercise junkie.  (And also a mom to a varsity athlete who I am continually 'prescribing' new exercises to).  I use therapy balls pretty much every day at work, and I've gone through many at home. (Sometimes the kids pop them, sometimes the dogs, and sometimes they just die a slow leaky death...)  I was happy to get a new ball for home, and this is an excellent one.THE GOOD:+ Very nice thick durable construction+ Good size that fits both my son (5'11"") and me (5'6"")+ Exercises printed right on there.  I love this!  Especially if you're working out in front of TV and not with a DVD.THE NOT GREAT:- Comes with a hand pump.  That's a lot of work!  I used my foot pump.THE EXERCISES:There are 11 strength/stability exercises (the ones that say 'reps') and 5 stretches (the ones that say 'hold').  As a PT, I like them all.  You don't need to be a golfer (I am not); these exercises offer strengthening for upper body, lower body, and a lot of core.  The stretches hit the major muscle groups as well.  That said, this is NOT for the brand-new exerciser.  For one thing, while the drawings do demonstrate the exercises to anyone who has worked on a ball before, if you are new to the ball you may not understand or do them correctly.  Additionally, these are some tough exercisers that in my opinion are for the intermediate - advanced exerciser. There are several upper back exercises which have you prone over the ball... super-effective but you'd better be doing it right or you could hurt your neck.  And some of the exercises, like knee tucks and split squats, are too hard for a beginner.BOTTOM LINE:Well-made ball with the great advantage of having 16 well-designed exercises printed right on it to help cue you.

"Author Daniel de Vise', the brother-in-law of Don Knotts has written an engaging book on a true-to-life friendship between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts primarily on their classic comedy show The Andy Griffith Show which aired on television during the 1960s.  This was back in the day when comedy on television was truly funny and the success of the show may very well have been due to the real life friendship that existed between the two.This book will be especially interesting to those who remember the relationship between sheriff Andy Taylor and his deputy Barney Fife.  The author relates various episodes of this series and they will be easily remembered by those familiar with the show.  Various other cast members such as Jim Nabors (Gomer Pyle), Francis Bavier (Aunt Bee), Ron Howard (Opie Taylor), and others are introduced into the book as well.  Omitted from those mentioned was the actor who played Briscol Darling and Ernest T. Bass.Both Don and Andy grew up in difficult circumstances and the book relates the difficulty aspiring actors face in gaining employment.  I remember the classic radio show called ""Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B-Riders"" and was surprised that it was Don Knotts who spoke the part of Windy Wales who always referred to Bobby as ""Little Boss.""  Griffith, known for his real life temper mentions that he wished he could behave in real life as he did in the television show.Both Don and Andy were married three times with each one having personal problems that many other individuals have as well.  Even after the show had run its course both men continued to see one another and maintain their friendship.  I guess you could call it a modern day Damon and Pythias relationship.The end of the book summarizes twenty memorable episodes of The Andy Griffith Show that are especially memorable.  Notably absent from my viewpoint is the one where Andy tells Opie that history is difficult and teacher Helen Crump enters the sheriff's office and chastises Andy for butting into her line of work.If you remember The Andy Griffith Show from watching it during its popularity or from reruns you will be sure to enjoy this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AB7WWGV3F6VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476747733#wasThisHelpful","R2AB7WWGV3F6VI","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Doug Wilson has scored another hit with his latest biography on Carlton Fisk.  Fisk divided his 24 years behind the plate with both the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox.  What I especially enjoyed about the book is that it wasn't a year-by-year and play-by-play of games in which he took part.  To me Fisk's two most memorable moments in his baseball career would be his historic home run in game six of the 1975 World Series and his chastising of opposing player Deon Sanders for not running out a pop fly ball.  Any baseball fan would remember game six and where they were at the time but Fisk calling out Sanders for not respecting the game is very memorable to me as well.  Pudge took part in more games behind the bat than any other catcher.  However, in order to accomplish that fete he had to punish his body in the workout room even after catching a full game and for a neophyte like Sanders to disrespect the game was too much for Fisk even though it was a player on the opposing team.Fisk played more games for Chicago than for Boston and there was some question as to which hat he would wear on his Hall of Fame plaque since he left both teams under uncomfortable circumstances.  Fisk initially chose Chicago since he played more games there but later changed his mind to Boston.  Everyone has someone we especially remember in our field of work who influenced us the most and the choice for Fisk was batting coach Walt Hriniak.Whatever one's line of work we need to give our best effort and this book on Carlton Fisk makes good reading for young readers as well to emphasize the importance of respecting our line of work whether it be baseball or anything else.  I have author Doug Wilson's books on Mark Fidrych and Brooks Robinson and his latest effort on Carlton Fisk is another important addition to my library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25H118ZQSFRG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250065437#wasThisHelpful","R25H118ZQSFRG8","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Dan D'Addona has done a commendable job in reviewing the careers of Sam Crawford, Harry Heilmann, and Heinie Manush of the Detroit Tigers.  The text is 202 pages long and is divided as follows:  Sam Crawford--Page 3 through 123  Harry Heilmann--Page 125 through 168  Heinie Manush--Page169 through 202I do not quibble with the facts the author presents.  However, the book is mainly a season-by-season review of games played loaded with individual play-by-play as to who went 2 for 4 and the final score of games.  This, to me, is not a story of each player.  Rather, it is a review of the seasons of the Detroit Tigers in which each of these players took part.  The author also relies on newspaper accounts of games and a heavy emphasis on statistics.The part I found to be the most interesting was reading about the broadcasting career of Harry Heilmann with the Tigers once his playing career was over,  The author summarizes as to why each player has been largely forgotten by today's fans.If you want to review the seasons each of these hall-of-fame players took part then I am sure you enjoy the book.

"I have never  heard of author Charles Fountain and I wondered what, if anything, someone else could write about the 1919 World Series that hasn't been covered by another individual in the past.  I believe this book along with ""Burying the Black Sox"" by Gene Carney do the best job of digging into the archives regarding the Black Sox scandal.  I feel author Fountain has done meticulous research in his search for the truth in regard to those who were involved at the time be they players, owners, or gamblers.  We have American League President Ban Johnson and his once friend and now bitter enemy White Sox owner Charles Comiskey along with another fierce foe, newly-elected Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis who has now pushed Johnson into the background of his beloved game.  We also have the eight affected players and the gamblers who ended up double-crossing one another when the money wasn't forthcoming.  Gamblers Abe Attell, Sport Sullivan, Billy Maharg, Nat Evans, and ""The Big Bankroll"" himself, Arnold Rothstein all have their respective rolls laid out.  Sportswriters such as Ring Lardner, Hugh Fullerton, Jimmy Isaminger, and J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News were featured writers at the time.  Lardner never had the same love for baseball after this scandal came to light and turned his writing to other subjects.Author Charles Fountain acknowledges that several sources are no longer available for research but he does an admirable job with the material that is available.  Each of the eight affected players give their version as to whether or not they played to win.  They admit to taking money but there appears to be questions regarding the effort put forth during the games.  I have two letters from J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News in which I asked him questions regarding the 1919 World Series which I am accompanying with this review in which he states, ""They were all guilty.""Based on the research available to author Charles Fountain I feel he has provided the reader with a first-rate book on the 1919 World Series.  It is aptly entitled ""The Betrayal"" since both sides betrayed the other and despite attempts to cover up the scandal it continued to fester during the off-season and into the 1920 season when it burst into full bloom.  The book contains two sections of photographs of several of the prominent individuals involved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWI4CPQ7W960/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199795134#wasThisHelpful","RCWI4CPQ7W960","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Norman Macht has completed his monumental work in his three-part trilogy on Connie Mack.  Part three on the Lean Leader lives up to the previous works and they belong in anyone's baseball library.  What I like about these three books is the ample use of anecdotes about the individuals involved in Mr. Mack's life as opposed to a year-by-year account of games played during the baseball season.  The author uses humor effectively throughout the book which makes for lively reading.  Examples are when Earle Mack would go to the mound to remove a pitcher from the game and say, ""Daddy wants you to come out of the game.""  The pitcher may reply by saying, ""Tell Daddy to go to hell.""  Another example is of pitcher Bobo Newsom who was being given a hard time regarding his age by pitcher Ray Scarborough, he of the big nose, and six foot four string bean Sid Hudson in the dugout.  Newsom told them he reminded them of a firetruck--hook and ladder.  The story may or may not be true but I found it to be funny, nonetheless.Mr. Mack had his share of pennant and World Series winners but also had to divest himself of star players when he was unable to pay them what they were worth.  An example would be George Kell who he knew would become a great player but dealt him to Detroit for Barney McCosky.  Mr. Mack was also known to say, although not mentioned in the book, that he dealt off players because ""the fans got tired of watching us win.""  This I have on a phonograph record entitled  ""Baseball--An Action History.""  Part three of this trilogy contains many of the lean years of the Philadelphia Athletics involving a number of supernumeraries who passed through the roster of the team.  His players, for the most part, realized he was paying them what he was able to based on the team's finances.  One of his young players was the diminutive Jacob Nelson Fox who eventually went on to stardom with the Chicago White Sox in which the Athletics received catcher Joe Tipton.  The author describes Fox ""buzzing around second base like a hungry mosquito in a bedroom at midnight.""  I thought this was a beautiful simile.The chapter on the eventual sale of the team to Kansas City interests led by Arnold Johnson I found to be very complicated and I admit to having skimmed through it.  I remember when it took place but the conflict between Earle and Roy Mack made it extremely difficult to follow and get interested in.  I'm quite sure other readers will find it to be as well.Mr. Mack lists his favorite player as Al Simmons and his finest moment to be when he sent his surprise starter Howard Ehmke to pitch the first game of the 1929 World Series in which Ehmke struck out a record thirteen Chicago Cubs.  The book contains numerous photos which I have not seen in other baseball books.  I also enjoyed reading about players I knew only from 1950s baseball cards such as Joe Astroth, Eddie Joost, Carl Scheib, and Gus Zernial.  Author Norman Macht is to be both thanked and congratulated for this three part work which greatly contributes to any individual's baseball library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQYAE1XUTZQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0803237650#wasThisHelpful","R2UQYAE1XUTZQO","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A biography on Lesley Gore is needed and author Trevor Tolliver has done a commendable job in relating her life to the reader.  I did feel there was too much of an emphasis on cataloging one song after another and whether or not it became a hit.  I am familiar with about five of her songs and the scouting report, if you will, regarding songs that she sang at one time or another became too tedious to me.Lesley hit it big as a high school student in New Jersey with her signature song entitled ""It's My Party.""  She experienced some negative feedback from some jealous students at her school as a result.  By the time she was twenty-six years old she became something of a has-been.  When the nostalgia craze for 60s music hit the country once again her music became a hot item.  The author spends some time regarding her thirty year relationship with partner Lois Sasson.I found the book and interesting read but I felt I could have been told more about Lesley Gore's life rather than such a heavy emphasis on several songs I've never heard of.

"Author Ryan D'Agostino has written an interesting book centered around the brutal killing of the wife and two children of Dr. William Petit on July 23, 2007.  Some reviewers may criticize the author spending time on the family prior to the attack but I feel this is necessary to acquaint the reader with their relationship to one another and appreciate the tragic loss which was to follow.  True, not much time is spent on the actual crime nor are the names of the two individuals given prior to the trial itself.  This was fine with me because the importance of the book is on Dr. Petit and his family and subsequent recovery to begin yet a new family and not on the perpetrators of the crime itself.Dr. Petit needed and received a tremendous outpouring of support not only from his Connecticut community but also from those across the country and this is correctly emphasized in the book.  Not only was he beaten and miraculously survived but his wife and two daughters were murdered and his house burned.  It took several years for Dr. Petit to come to grips with such a loss both physically and mentally and with the assistance of others he has managed to go on with his life with a new wife and child.This book is a story of tragedy and survival rather than a concentration of the horrific crime itself.  I would have preferred  larger photos in the book of Dr. Petit's family members and those who played a large part in his life.  I would not need photos of the two individuals responsible for this crime.  The less focus on them the better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TE31974IF6HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140162#wasThisHelpful","R3TE31974IF6HA","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grover Cleveland Alexander was alcoholic, epileptic, his own worst enemy, and one of the best pitchers ever in baseball history.  Author John Skipper has written a wonderful book on ""Old Low and Away"" in which the reader is exposed to both the greatness of his pitching abilities and his off-the-field nightmares that Alexander had to live with.  Old Pete toiled for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and St. Louis Cardinals.  He didn't get along with new Cubs' manager Joe McCarthy due to his alcohol addiction but what isn't mentioned in the book is that McCarthy, himself, had his own battle with the bottle.  Alexander had to scrounge for any employment he could find while other baseball notables such as National League President Ford Frick and St. Louis Cardinals' owner Sam Breadon did their best to keep Alexander afloat financially for the remainder of his life.  Alex had aged beyond his years due to his hard living with his numerous bouts with alcohol.  His wife Aimee attributed this problem to his experiences in World War I while his problem with epilepsy she attributed to Alex being hit in the head while a base runner when the fielder threw the ball to first base.Following his baseball career Alexander spent a few years with the House of David baseball team and in a Times Square flea circus in which he regaled people with his strikeout of New York Yankee Tony Lazzeri in the 7th inning of the final game of the 1926 World Series. He spent his final days writing letters to his beloved ex-wife Aimee and hating his town of St. Paul, Nebraska, because they would not serve him any alcoholic beverages.Alexander believed he retired with the National League record with 373 victories until a researcher discovered an extra victory entitled to New York Giants' star hurler Christy Mathewson.  Alex wasn't among the charter members of the 1936 election to the Baseball Hall of Fame.  Instead he had to wait until 1938 to be elected and many believe this was due to his off-the-field problems which was felt to be an embarrassment to baseball.  Other players had their own embarrassing moments which didn't taint their earlier election.This book rates a definite five stars and John Skipper has provided the reader with an important book on baseball history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BVGTA7MRKUGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786424125#wasThisHelpful","R1BVGTA7MRKUGT","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off let me say my rating of four stars is based on my background on this subject.  Most certainly author David Preston rates five stars for this monumental amount of research he has done is piecing together the road General Edward Braddock blazed on his way to the disaster that awaited him and his soldiers on their way to the French Fort Duquesne at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela River at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  It was a herculean achievement just to blaze a trail and lead this British army 300 miles through the wilderness of the Allegheny mountains in addition to dealing with snakes, mosquitoes, ticks, blistering hot weather, and other annoyances.  By the time they reached approximately twelve miles north of Fort Duquesne on July 9, 1755, many were too tired and worn out to begin fighting the French and their Indian allies.  Braddock was severely injured and died a few days later.I appreciated the fact that the author provided ample maps throughout the book to follow where various places were located.  Other books I have read haven't necessarily provided this service.  Photos of notable individuals were also illustrated, several of which later appeared in America's War for Independence namely George Washington, Thomas Gage, Horatio Gates, and Daniel Morgan.  A sickly George Washington took part in The Battle of the Monongahela and one can't help but wonder what would have been the result of the Revolutionary War had Washington not survived this battle.It wasn't until John Forbes and his men wrested Fort Duquesne away from the French in 1758 who blew up the fort rather than turn it over to the British.  The fort was rebuilt and named Fort Pitt. The American version of The French and Indian War took place in the years 1754--1763 and author David Preston makes history come alive in this very important book.  I learned a lot and I had a lot to learn even though I struggled at times with the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KU0V36C03B5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199845328#wasThisHelpful","R1KU0V36C03B5I","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all of the favorable reviews I am going to go out on a limb and rate the book three stars whereas 2 1/2 would be more accurate.  Andy Pafko led the life of a gentleman and stated his Christian faith at the end of the book.  While he considered himself a Cub he also played on  the fabled Brooklyn Dodgers of Roger Kahn's book The Boys of Summer in addition to being dealt to the Braves just as they transferred their team to Milwaukee from Boston.  Therefore, Pafko, a Wisconsin, played most of his career close to home.Why then the low rating for the book?  The captions beneath the photographs were very small and hard to read.  I also found much too much emphasis on game-by-game coverage and I felt over-whelmed by the amount of statistics in the book.

"I hate to say, ""I love it"" for such a tragic story as this one.  It is a cliche for one to say they found the book hard to put down but such was the case with this book.  Author Jeannine Cummins relates the story of her bother and their two cousins when the Cummins' family visited their relatives in St. Louis, Missouri.  I need not relate the tragedy here as several reviewers has already done that.  Suffice it to say the cruelty individuals can do to others knows no bounds whatsoever.  The 1924 case of Leopold and Loeb murdering Bobby Franks was solved due to a pair of glasses.  The case in this book was solved due to a flashlight in addition to the survival of Tom Cummins.After all the heartache and difficulties that Tom Cummins had to endure to survive this ordeal the punishment from the St. Louis police department was inexcusable.  Anything to ""solve"" a case never mind whether we have the correct individual/s or not.The book contains photos of the Cummins and Kerry family in addition to photos of the Chain of Rocks Bridges north of St. Louis.  If you want to find photos of the sickos who are responsible for this heinous crime you'll have to go to the internet.  I can certainly understand author Jeanine Cummins not wanting to contaminate her book by placing photos of these individuals in her book.This book is true crime at its worst.  My sincere sympathy to both the Cummins and Kerry family for what they have had to endure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HD7AGIIZ30FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451210530#wasThisHelpful","R2HD7AGIIZ30FM","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found the book to contain too much game-by-game coverage in addition to including too many paragraphs with only one or two sentences.  I realize Gene Mauch could be a combative individual but I found too much coverage on his on-the-field scraps with opposing players.  Gene modeled the uniform of several teams in his career but I also found too much coverage of every individual who was included in each transaction.  Much of this information could be found by doing research.  The book contains photographs spaced throughout the book.

"Author Rinker Buck has done a commendable job in relating the journey he, his brother, and their dog took retracing across the trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Oregon.  The book provides a brief history of each of the notable landmarks such as Chimney Rock and Scotts' Bluff in Nebraska and Independence Rock in Wyoming and then the author relates their experience in each particular area.  Mules were much preferred as were oxen in leading the wagons as opposed to horses.  Each side of the Platte River in Nebraska were used as a highway westward with the Oregon Trail not being one set of ruts across the plains but was actually a twelve mile trail, six miles on each side of the Platte River.  Cholera was a disease that victimized many of the travelers and was carried by bacteria in water pools along the Platte.I found maps to be helpful which highlighted places mentioned in the text.  Author Rinker Buck was initially going to make the trek himself but his brother insisted on going along as well.  Despite their squabbles along the way the author realizes he never would have been able to  complete the trip without his brother's valuable assistance.  They also had valuable assistance from individuals who lived in the area of the Oregon Trail.  Only once does the author mention a cantankerous couple in the area of Burnt Ranch in Wyoming.I consider this book a valuable addition to my western library.  I did feel the book got a bit long near the end and only for that reason am I rating the book four stars rather than five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AYHOYNIA6DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451659164#wasThisHelpful","R14AYHOYNIA6DT","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to rate this book five stars for the amount of research author Emerson Baker has put into it along with how he organized the chapters throughout the book.  I like the fact the author divided the book into chapters such as a general history of Salem in addition to chapters on those accused of witchcraft, the accusers, the judges, the search for atonement, and modern-day Salem as it relates to its infamous history.Reasons for the 1692 hysteria were many.  Puritans believed their religion was the best and, therefore, the devil would work hardest at destroying it.  Crop failures may be blamed on witchcraft along with the heathen practices of the Indians.  Boredom among the girls, illness which caused an early death, and the intolerance of the Puritans towards those of other religions were many.  To the Puritans the only thing worse than a witch was a Catholic.  Quakers who ventured into the Massachusetts Bay Colony risked execution.  Like today neighbors didn't always get along and vengeance may be gained by accusing another individual as a witch.Author Baker also provides research into the search for forgiveness upon citizens of Salem for seeing the error of their ways.  Interesting tidbits are provided regarding the family tree of of individuals are given such as author Nathaniel Hawthorne being a direct descendant of Judge John Hathorne.  Possible reasons are given  why author Nathaniel added the ""w"" to his last name are provided.  Israel Putnam, who fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill and author of the quote, ""Don't shoot 'til you see the whites of their eyes"" would be a descendant of the Salem Putnam family as would patriot Nathan Hale of the Reverend John Hale of Salem.I have read other books on Salem but this newest effort by Emerson Baker I have found to be the most insightful.  If this is a subject of interest to you I would strongly suggest you purchase a copy for your library.  You need not be a scholar of history to enjoy the book.  A general reader like myself found it to be fascinating reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGT9YVHU8G0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019989034X#wasThisHelpful","R1EGT9YVHU8G0N","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a wonderful job author J. Thomas Hetrick has done in bringing to life the St. Louis Browns of Der Poss Bresident Chris Von der Ahe of the 1880s and 1890s.  The book is not only baseball history but a book loaded with funny anecdotes of the team's owner.  More modern-day past owners such as Charley Finley, George Steinbrenner, and Bill Veeck came to mind.  Von der Ahe knew little, and dare I say nothing, about the game in which he attempted to inject himself into.  His fractured English added amusement to his players and had them imitating him.  He would fine his players for errors and other incidentals which were often forgotten about the following day.  He told his players to avoid hitting the ball in the air and to keep the ball ""on the floor"" instead.  Von der Ahe watched as a smallish man was having a tryout at Sportsman's Park at third base.  Chris suggested,  ""Dot little feller!  Take him out to the Fairgrounds track and make a ""hoss yockey"" out of him.  That ""little feller"" was none other than the great John Joseph McGraw.With Charles Comiskey at the helm Von der Ahe's Browns were in their heyday in the mid-to-late 1880s and won the championship of the American Association, known derisively as ""The Beer and Whiskey League"", and then defeated the Chicago White Sox of the National League in a playoff.  The egotistical Von der Ahe had a trophy made with the inscription ""Monarchs of the Sphere.""This was an era of loose regulations and umpires often were subjected to a great deal of abuse from fans and players alike.  Many players were fined for their liberal use of alcohol and not being in condition to play.  Von der Ahe had his own personal troubles by having a mistress or more while married to yet another woman.  The Sporting News wrote that he was his own worst enemy and  ""An affront to the community.""Yes, this book has a heavy price tag but if you are interested in the early days of baseball this book should be a must for you to have in your library.  The book contains a photo of the life-sized statue of Chris Von der Ahe standing on a pedestal appearing to survey his domain which he had commissioned years before his death.  Do yourself a favor and buy the book.  If you like humorous anecdotes this book is loaded with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAJNFQ2MFUS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0810834731#wasThisHelpful","ROAJNFQ2MFUS6","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew nothing about the subject matter in this book prior to reading it so anything I read was new to me.  The book is a typical mob book whereby mobsters who are supposed to be friends turn against one another and out of paranoia start eliminating those who may turn and begin singing to the authorities.  Henry Hill  is one of those involved and he and his family eventually are targeted.  The book contains the usual mobster profanities and adulterous affairs.  Henry Hill spent the last years of his life speaking to high school groups about what a mistake it is to get involved in a life of crime.  It would have been nice to see what several of the characters in the book look like but the book contains no photos.  There is a glossary of Italian slang as it applies to mobsters which I found to be something I haven't seen in other true crime books.  The book contains a lot of dialogue and I found it to be an interesting read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FEXYYKLV90ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493008498#wasThisHelpful","R2FEXYYKLV90ZY","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As one of the few surviving members of the fabled ""Boys of Summer"", Carl Erskine is certainly qualified to write anecdotes about  the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s.  This book is not a story of Erskine's years with the Dodgers but separate individual anecdotes about the players he knew so well.  Erskine has written other books of this sort as well.  Someone who has read several other books on the 1950s Brooklyn Dodgers will find several stories repeated here.  It's great that Erskine has taken the time to relate these stories especially for those who are unfamiliar with this storied team in order to give them some appreciation.  As a baseball fan you won't go wrong reading Erskine's books on his beloved Dodgers but just realize you need to be prepared for some repetition if you've read several other books on the Brooklyn Dodgers.  This book is a quick easy read with photos scattered throughout the book.  I also might add it is refreshing to read a baseball book that contains no profanity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYRGHM7LMR0LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613216459#wasThisHelpful","RYRGHM7LMR0LD","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the story of two strong-willed individuals who were at loggerheads for years.  Author James Neff doesn't take sides with either Kennedy or Hoffa.  He presents the role each one played on opposing sides.  Whenever Robert Kennedy was presented with a challenge of any sort he was determined to meet it head-on and placing teamster leader James Hoffa behind bars was a challenge to be met.  Hoffa, on the other hand, viewed Kennedy as a rich kid brat who wanted to make a name for himself  at his (Hoffa's) expense as the President's Attorney General.The book is packed with courtroom drama with both Hoffa and Kennedy achieving victories.  Jury tampering, illicit sexual affairs, and the ever-present J. Edgar Hoover's ability to stave off retirement while John Kennedy was President make for dramatic reading.  Sadly, both Robert Kennedy and James Hoffa came to violent ends.  It has taken decades for much of this information to come out and author James Neff has done his research well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CN1H5FAXK3W6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316738344#wasThisHelpful","R2CN1H5FAXK3W6","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who were of age in 1963 Two Days in June by Andre Cohen is a chance to revisit those historic two days in which President Kennedy accomplished his proudest achievement with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with Russia on June 10th with his speech at American University and on June 11th with his speech on Civil Rights.To me the most interesting part of the book was when he addressed the nation on television regarding equal rights for Negroes, as they were referred to at the time because I remember it vividly.  President Kennedy had about two minutes to review the speech prior to going on the air as his speechwriter Ted Sorensen wrote frantically  while his typist pounded out the draft that the President was to read to the nation.  What makes it more poignant today is that voting and other rights are once again under attack for minorities.  While the President was being praised for his speech a Southern bigot, whose name will not be dignified here, lay in wait for Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers to return home from a meeting and murdered him with a rifle shot while he got out of his car in his driveway.In addition to President Kennedy I feel speechwriter Ted Sorensen is a hero of sorts as he drew upon his experience of a paper he wrote in a Nebraska high school for thoughts to include in the Civil Rights speech.  Martin Luther King was thrilled with the speech while Southern Democrats were livid with who they always referred to as ""the Kennedys.""  The assassination of Medgar Evers was previews of coming attractions with the assassination of President Kennedy, brother Robert, Martin Luther King, and others in the violent 1960s.The book is thoroughly researched and if you lived through this period of our history you will find it to be history revisited for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KD6P35EJYH0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771023871#wasThisHelpful","R2KD6P35EJYH0H","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The daughter of Joe Black, one of Roger Kahn's Boys of Summer, has provided us with an interesting account of the life of her father.  Joe Black has the distinction of being the first African-American player to win a World Series game which took place in 1952 against the Yankees.  That season proved to be the highlight of Joe's baseball career as he was bedeviled by control problems beginning in 1953 which may have been caused by getting too much advice from others.  Dodgers' manager Charley Dressen took some hits for wanting Joe to develop another pitch.  Dressen had the reputation of wanting to contribute his thoughts into a player who had experienced some success in hopes of getting some of the credit for himself.The book also contains a lot of the racial bigotry that Black experienced during his baseball career.  Black's post-career also included his experiences as a middle-school teacher, his employment with the Greyhound bus line, and his assisting with the organization called BAT which aids in assisting players and their families who are down-and-out in their luck.  Former player Joe Garagiola has been heavily involved in this organization as well.One complaint I have with the book is with the chapters not being arranged chronologically.  The book's chapters skips back and forth from Joe's baseball career to his off-the-field activities.  Some readers may prefer this method but I did not.  Therefore, I rate the book four stars.  However, the content of the book would rate five stars with me.I found two errors in the book.  Already on page 4 the 1948 World Series is mentioned with the Cleveland Indians defeating the Boston Red Sox in six games.  The Boston team listed should be the Boston Braves.  In addition on page 11 the author John Debringer is listed when the correct name is John Drebinger.If you're a baseball fan of this time period you should enjoy this book.

"I rate parts 1 and 2 three stars and parts 3 and 4 five stars.  I couldn't put the book down from parts 3 and 4 I found it so riveting.  What I remember about hockey from this time period was the names of the Montreal Canadians' hockey players found in the book and the fact that the Philadelphia Flyers were known as the Broad Street Bullies and had Kate Smith, either in person or recording, sing God Bless America prior to the start of their games.  Also, I  believed that when the highlights of a game were fights I didn't feel you had much of a sport.  I knew nothing about Russia playing a series of games against several National Hockey League teams.That said, I found the game played on December 31, 1975, between the Montreal Canadians and the Russian team to be one of sportsmanship played to a 3 to 3 tie to be, for lack of a better word, heartwarming.  The Canadians had 38 shots on goal compared to only 13 for the Russians but the goal tending of Vladislav Tretiak kept things at a game-ending tie.  When the Russian team moved on to play in Philadelphia the Flyers embarrassed themselves and the United States by their use of thuggery against the Russians in which the Russian coach removed his team from the ice.  The administration of the coup de grace against the Flyers came when the Canadians swept the Flyers out of their rule of NHL champions by defeating them in for the Stanley Cup championship and a return to civilized hockey.The Montreal Canadians selected Tretiak in the draft of 1983 but the Russians would not allow him to compete in the NHL.  Although it was too late for Tretiak the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 all of the best Russian players are now eligible to join the NHL.  In 2007 Tretiak was on hand to celebrate the retirement of Canadian goal tender Ken Dryden's jersey in Montreal.This book definitely filled a gap in my knowledge of hockey's history that I wasn't aware I was living through at the time it took place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18J683F31QV9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0771026358#wasThisHelpful","R18J683F31QV9S","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marcel Pronovost has been involved in hockey since he was a child in Quebec from a family of 12 children, 9 boys and 3 girls.  The book is an over-sized paperback of 191 pages and contains numerous photographs of his entire career most notably with the Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs.  His hears spent with the Red Wings took place during those five Stanley cup winning seasons with the Production Line of Ted Lindsay, Gordie Howe, and Alex Delvecchio.  The book contains interesting anecdotes about several of his teammates including his close friendship with the late Terry Sawchuk. I found it interesting that Marcel Pronovost had a good relationship with Maple Leaf coach Punch Imlach since some other books I have recently read have found him difficult to get along with.One drawback, at least to me, was a lack of naming the individuals in team pictures.  Only two or three players would be named and I would have liked to know others who I have heard of but didn't recognize due to my very casual interest in hockey during this time period.

"Author David Dupuis has written a no-holds barred account on the ""troubles and triumphs"" of hockey great goalie Terry Sawchuk.  Terry's career found him modeling the uniforms of several teams most notably that of the Detroit Red Wings.  He was without a doubt one of the greatest, if not the greatest, goalie in the history of the National Hockey League.  He also authored the crouched ""gorilla"" stance used by goalies.  Sawchuk stated he could more easily see through the players' legs with this type of stance.  His use of a face mask became more acceptable around the league after it was first started by Montreal Canadians' goalie Jacques Plante. The fact that he was able to perform despite the numerous injuries he suffered in addition to his addiction to alcohol defies belief.  Sawchuk was able to project a heartfelt personality, but when alcohol wrapped its ugly tentacles around him he became a very abusive individual to both his wife Pat and their seven children.  I felt the author did a wonderful job in juggling these his two personalities which made for a very balanced, I felt, book.For all of the trophies Sawchuk won for his hockey exploits I feel the greatest trophy should go to his wife Pat for managing to take care of seven children while having to endure the suffering inflicted upon her due to Terry's philandering and addiction to alcohol.  Author Dupuis did an excellent job in relating the final incident that led up to Terry's unfortunate demise in a freak accident in an unnecessary encounter with Ron Stewart and Ben Weiner.  Even the funeral of Terry Sawchuk was not without controversy.  I was aware of Terry Sawchuk when he was a player but was unaware of the problems he went through during his short life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34X3GAEJ3D1UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0773731172#wasThisHelpful","R34X3GAEJ3D1UY","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me state that the authors did a fine job in this biography of Chicago Black Hawk defense man Pierre Pilote.  I recognized his name from among those who played during his time period of the 1960s and I liked his alliterative name.  Had I been more familiar with Black Hawk hockey I would have rated it higher.  I also thought there was a little too much play-by-play in the book just as there is in some baseball books I have read.Pilote spent 13 years with Chicago before being dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs where he spent the final year of his career.  Pilote found the change of teams to be a rather uneasy relationship due to fights he had had with players he now had to accept as his teammates.  Defense was Pilote's forte and was often compared with the legendary defense man Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadians.  Pilote was a good family man and found the transition into life away from hockey to be smooth.If you are a Chicago Black Hawk hockey fan I'm sure you will rate this a five star book.  The fact that I'm rating it four stars is due to the reasons I've listed above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6221VFNG2V86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770411364#wasThisHelpful","R6221VFNG2V86","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been reading a number of hockey books lately and I found this one to be a gem.  Author Bruce McDougall has done a masterful job in bringing to life the final playoff game for the Stanley Cup between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadians in 1967.  The book's title comes from the last game played prior to expansion.  Up to this time the N.H.L. had six teams namely Toronto, Montreal, New York, Boston, Detroit, and Chicago.The book is divided into the pregame, 1st period, intermission, 2nd period, intermission, 3rd period, and post-game wrap-up.  What made the book more interesting to me is that the entire book contains nuggets of information regarding the names of players I remember from this time period.  Also included are anecdotes relating to relations between the owners, coaches, and players.  Management would take advantage of starry-eyed youngsters who would like nothing more than to play with their favorite team and sign them for a pittance.  There would also be threats from management to banish a player to the minors a year short of qualifying for a pension for the player having the audacity to ask for a raise in pay.When I first saw how the book was divided into chapters I thought the ones involving the three periods would be merely a play-by-play of the game.  This, thankfully, was not so.  Crucial parts of each period are included but also included are stories involving the players that make the book more interesting.  Maple Leaf's coach George ""Punch"" Imlach is not viewed favorably in this book.  He certainly would not be a coach I would relate favorably to.  My only complaint with the book is that it doesn't contain any photographs.  I don't follow hockey but I do remember the players involved in this book.  For a true hockey fan this book would be a must for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OQTKQD052H17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0864923783#wasThisHelpful","R1OQTKQD052H17","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How did you spend New Year's Day?  I spent mine reading this book in its entirety.  I had a difficult time putting it down and I wouldn't know a blue line from a clothes line.  Of course I'm aware that Bobby Orr played hockey for the Boston Bruins but this is a book for both players and parents of any sport their child participates in.  Bobby Orr does not emphasize his numerous accomplishments in hockey.  In fact his greatest memory of the sport is the time he spent playing the game as a child on rinks near his home at Parry Sound, Ontario.  Tennyson once wrote, ""I am a part of all that I have met"" and Bobby Orr spends a great deal of time in recognizing those who helped him from the time he was a child throughout his career at a professional hockey player.  He realizes that what we accomplish we don't do on our own without the help of significant others along the way.Orr concludes the book by giving his opinions on the state of the game today and mentions suggested rule changes he would make and the reasons for them.  Included also is suggested practical advice for up-and-coming hockey players and questions they should ask themselves if they plan on continuing their dream on playing in the National Hockey League.I am not a hockey fan but for those who have children in any sport I would highly recommend this book to be read by both parents and children.  I also found it refreshing in that there are no profanities in the book.  Hockey fan or not this book is must reading for the reasons I mention above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJ1SQCUSY8Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399161759#wasThisHelpful","R3NJ1SQCUSY8Z7","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author William Brown has written an interesting and balanced account on the life of Montreal Canadians' defenceman, Doug Harvey.  Harvey has been named number six on the list of the top ten hockey players in the NHL and it is entirely appropriate that a biography is written on him.  I just wished it had been available in a hard cover edition.  Harvey always cherished his reputation of being his own man and doing things his own way which would often conflict with conventional wisdom.  He lived his life with a bipolar disorder which may have contributed to his sometimes ""off-the-wall"" behavior.  He struggled with alcohol addiction and refused to attend his election to the National Hockey Hall of Fame induction ceremony.  However, he was also often one to assist those he saw to be in need.  I don't follow hockey but I do remember Harvey and his Canadian teammates from the 1950s and '60s and I found it enjoyable to once again familiarize myself with the names from their storied past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUZPOA6DLQVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1550651668#wasThisHelpful","R1XUZPOA6DLQVJ","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Former Montreal Canadians' goal tender Ken Dryden has written an eloquent book on hockey and his experiences in the game.  He writes from a first-hand point of view as to what it is like to be a net-minder in the National Hockey League and what went on in the dressing room prior to a game and between periods.  I don't claim to be a hockey fan but I do remember the names of several of the players he talks about in the book.  Dryden also provides us with his remembrances of growing up as a child playing hockey on a makeshift rink with his brother and neighborhood kids.  He concludes the book with his opinions as to the state of the game in the year 2003. Counting this one I've read only four hockey books so I don't know whether this is the best one ever written.  It certainly isn't the best sports book ever written.  If you were a hockey fan during the 1970s when Dryden played and of the Montreal Canadians in particular you will be sure to enjoy this book.  I found myself familiar with several of the names of the players he spoke about but as far as following hockey I found myself at a definite disadvantage.  If you have a library of books on sports I would certainly include this one among those on the sport of hockey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R695HB2D3KLQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600789617#wasThisHelpful","R695HB2D3KLQE","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Unitas Jr. provides the reader with a warts and all rendition of his life as the son of the legendary quarterback of the Baltimore Colts.  If you want to learn about the good and bad John Unitas then this is the book for you to read.  It is not written as a beginning to end biography of his football years.  That is available in other books.  Life is not always the tranquil everything is great in a family of a celebrity and Unitas Jr. tells us about the conflicts in growing up in a family torn by adultery, divorce, and a step-mother he had no use for.  All families have conflicts so we shouldn't be surprised that the Unitas family had there share and more.Quarterback Unitas was in many ways a low-key individual and related well to coach Weeb Eubank who had a similar personality.  Don Shula, on the other hand, was a screamer and Unitas didn't relate well to this type of coach.  To show their contempt for Coach Shula, whenever a family member went to use the bathroom they would often state, ""I am going to take (leave?) a Shula.""  Anecdotes are provided with teammates such as Lenny Moore, Art Donovan, Raymond Berry, and Jimmy Orr.Each chapter begins with a brief synopsis of a football game played several years ago.  The games don't follow any chronological pattern and don't always involve the Colts so I don't understand the meaning of this.  If you want to read a tell-all book this is one for you to read.  Sometimes I feel that some stories are best left unsaid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AN2EN8Q948G3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160078979X#wasThisHelpful","R3AN2EN8Q948G3","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a hockey fan but I did follow hockey casually from the late 1950s through the 1970s.  Keith Magnuson will always be memorable to me by the cover photo of him on Sports Illustrated minus the teeth.  His job with the Chicago Black Hawks was as a defense man and he was the enforcer which got him involved in numerous fights on the ice.  Keith sacrificed his body by giving a 100% effort at all times and gave that same effort with his employment following the end of his playing career. He may have paraphrased Vince Lombardi who said, ""Winning isn't everything, but making the effort to win is."" Keith Magnuson phrased it by saying, ""Winning isn't everything.  What's everything is whether or not you give 100%.""  This is a good reminder for young people who read this book.Yes, the book contains quite a bit on fighting, but due to Magnuson being a defense man fighting went with the job.  I found only one profanity in the book so I would suggest you can give this to a youngster who enjoys hockey whether they like the Chicago Black Hawks or have heard of Keith Magnuson or not.This book also brought back to life the names of a number of hockey players I remembered from this time period but had forgotten about.  Whether you are a hockey fan or just a casual sports fan I believe you will enjoy this book especially if you are familiar with hockey during the 1970s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OF9YKIMH1XPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1600788319#wasThisHelpful","R2OF9YKIMH1XPY","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other than ""Pitching In A Pinch"" and Gene Schoor's 1953 biography on Christy Mathewson I'm surprised it has taken so long for someone to author another biography on Christy Mathewson.  Although I appreciate having a book  written on a baseball player that isn't laced with profanities I thought the early part of this book overdid to some extent his moral character.  As an example Matty slid home and declared himself out  and the catcher asking him why he did that.  Matty answered by saying, ""I'm a deacon in the church.""  Deacon or not the umpire is the one to make the call.The book rallied at the mid-point to the end which covered Mathewson's career with the storied Giants of John McGraw.  McGraw and Mathewson made up baseball's odd-couple.  Matty being the college-bred All-American boy and McGraw the feisty win-at-all-costs manager who played third base for the rowdy Baltimore Orioles of the 1890s.  Christy's career with the Giants and his entry into the army during World War I are well-covered in addition to the exposure he and Ty Cobb experienced with a mustard gas training session.Of additional interest to me was the inclusion of the life of Mathewson's son, Christy Jr., his experience as a pilot, and how he met his death.  The life of Matty's wife and her friendship with John McGraw's widow, Blanche, was also interesting.  I remember The Sporting News had a photo of Mrs. McGraw leaving the Polo Grounds after the Giants last game there in 1957.  She carried a bouquet of flowers and above the photo it read ""So Empty--So Quiet"".Author Bob Gaines does rely rather heavily on Larry Ritter's book ""The Glory of Their Times.""  The book contains 218 pages of text with accompanying photos, some of which I have never seen before.  Also included are three appendixes:1.Memorable games pitched by Mathewson through the years2. Former Giant teammates and what became of them3. Dead ball players in the Hall of FameNotes, bibliography, and index round out the book.I initially had my doubts about the book because it appeared to turn Matty into a saint.  However, as his wife once said that although he was a wonderful man, he wasn't a ""goody-goody.""This book would be suitable reading for young people.  Their only disadvantage is not having heard of Christy Mathewson or the New York Giants for that matter.  Don't let the price tag scare you.  If you like baseball history I would suggest you buy the book.This book should read as an ""Amazon Verified Purchase"".  I don't know why it doesn't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14NRWDZ2GEZS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442233141#wasThisHelpful","R14NRWDZ2GEZS2","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Al Michaels shares a wealth of his experiences in the world of sports and those who have influenced him over his storied career.  We all have those in our lives who have given us a helping hand and Al Michaels first had his father and later on individuals such as Curt Gowdy and John Wooden who proved to be helpful.  On the negative side were Jack Kent Cooke and Chick Hearns.Michaels experienced the polar differences in how teams were run with Sparky Anderson's Big Red Machine and the San Francisco Giants led by manager Charley Fox.  In covering such a variety of sports with different networks Al Michaels worked with a number of different personalities ranging from Howard Cosell, O. J. Simpson, Ken Dryden, John Madden, Tim McCarver, Dan Dierdorf, Jim Palmer, and Frank Gifford to name a few.  The book contains anecdotes on all of them.  My favorite is one involving Howard Cosell on page 139 and 140 that is an absolute classic.  I read it in another book on Cosell and Ali but it certainly warrants a retelling in this book.Anyone who has visions of becoming a sportscaster would do well to read this book.  It's not always the glamorous job that one may envision.  It includes countless meetings and hours of preparation and working well with personalities that may conflict with your own.  I feel if you remember the years during the career of Al Michaels this will be a chance for you to relive the many dramatic moments that he covered in his storied career.  This book is a very worthwhile addition to your sports library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PABB5MNZA79X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062314963#wasThisHelpful","R2PABB5MNZA79X","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose to read this book because I remember Jacques Plante as being the first goalie to wear a mask in the National Hockey League in the late 1950s.  I don't claim to be a hockey fan but I do remember many of those great French-sounding names that populated the rosters during this time.  It took someone like Plante who possessed a confident personality willing to endure the catcalls from the so-called macho types to become the trail blazer in using a mask for protection against the onslaught of hockey pucks without any facial protection.  The discovery of the slap shot by teammate Bernie ""Boom Boom"" Geoffrion added several miles-per-hour to the speed in which a puck traveled towards a goalie.  Plante's coach Toe Blake was an old-school type who vigorously fought against Plante's use of the mask.  Soon, however, all goalies except Gump Worsley used one throughout their career.It is unbelievable today to think that hockey players used to play without helmets and goalies were often forced to continue in a game or else use the unqualified ""house"" goalie provided by the home team.  The game would be stopped sometimes for 20 minutes to a half an hour while a goalie was stitched up for an injury and then returned to the game.Although Plante played for teams such as the New York Rangers, St. Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Boston Bruins he always thought of himself as a Montreal Canadian.  Plante had several accomplishments throughout his career, one of them being five consecutive years winning the Vezina trophy which was awarded to the goalie who successfully defended against the most shots on goal in one season.  However, Jacques Plante will always be remembered  as the goalie who pioneered the use of the mask to protect the face of goalies.I don't claim to be a hockey fan but I did thoroughly enjoy this book and came across the names of a number of players I remember from the 1950s and 1960s that I had forgotten about.  If you claim to be a hockey fan you should familiarize yourself with this pioneer of the game.  If you're not a hockey fan read the book anyway.  You will enjoy it.

"Cemeteries are interesting places to visit and each headstone involves a life with a story to tell.  Author Chris Enss has written brief a brief biography of old western characters many of which are familiar to most people and others are obscure but still having an interesting tale worthy of inclusion in the book.  I found a quote of Bat Masterson to be especially interesting which read, ""There are many in this old world of ours who hold that things break about even for all of us.  I have observed, for example, that we all get the same amount of ice.  The rich get it in the summertime and the poor get it in the winter.""

"This book contains 582 pages of text and I read this book for a while and then switched to something else before tackling another section.  There were parts of the book I thoroughly enjoyed such as the baseball, boxing, gangsters, Charles Lindbergh, Flo Ziegfeld, the chapters on the building of the Holland tunnel and George Washington Bridge,  and some of the chapters involved in the construction of buildings such as the Chrysler Building, the baby of Walter Chrysler who said, ""I like to build things.""  Another chapter I found interesting was the one on S. L. Rothafel, better known as Roxy, who had the Roxy theatre built.  He had a great quote which read, ""Don't give the people what they want; give them something better than they expect.""I found it interesting to know where some of the historic buildings of the past were located and when they were demolished.  New York is a fascinating city and one could be dropped off most anywhere in the city and know that something historic took place there.

"This is the first hockey book I have ever read and I struck gold.  Naturally I have been familiar with Gordie Howe's accomplishments with the Detroit Red Wings and have heard of several of the players mentioned in the book but I wouldn't know a red line from a blue line.  Gordie Howe had the distinction of playing professional hockey in five different decades from the 1940s and into 1980 and his reason for being able to accomplish this fete is due to his love for the game.Howe mentions his feelings of family that the Red Wings' franchise promoted and he bought into but found this not to be true as far as ownership relationships with its players were concerned.  Howe relates his philosophy in dealing with opposing players on the ice and dealing with retribution whenever necessary.A special thrill for Gordie Howe took place when he joined the Houston Aeros of the WHA and teamed up his two of his sons, Mark and Marty, for four seasons.  He concluded his career with two seasons with the New England Whalers of the WHA and the Hartford Whalers of the NHL.  The last chapter is written by his three sons and daughter in which they relate the death of their mother and the trials and tribulations that their father has now been experiencing.  As I write this Gordie Howe has since suffered a stroke and remains in critical condition.  I am not a hockey fan but I chose well in purchasing this book and adding it to my ever-growing library.

It contains only 111 pages of text in addition to two pages covering Monument Park but briefly covers baseball beginning in 1893 through the Yankees' first World Championship in 1923.  I've never heard of the author, W. Nikola-Lisa, in any of the baseball books I have read but I didn't come across any errors in the book.  I found the bibliography to be impressive and also contains an index.  The photographs are small but then so is the book.  If you want to read a concise history of the events leading up to the New York Yankees' franchise which moved from Baltimore at the turn of the century and bought by two corrupt owners, Bill Devery and Frank Farrell, for the price of $18,000 this book would be a good introduction for the novice reader who is interested in learning about the shenanigans involved in trying to prevent another major league team from invading the hallowed ground of the lordly New York Giants.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X0OUZOXNE8TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991218302#wasThisHelpful","R2X0OUZOXNE8TS","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit the cover photo of William Henry Keeler caught my eye.  This book cover the four baseball seasons from 1900--1903 and includes not only star players of this time period such as Keeler, Cy Young, Tommy Leach, Jimmy Collins, and Nap Lajoie among others but players whose names may be obscure at this time who nevertheless had interesting stories to be told.  Included here are summaries, if you will, of each team in the National League in 1900 and both leagues from 1901--1903 with the standings, regular lineups, and leading pitchers of each team.  Also included are a number of photos, some of which I have not seen in numerous other baseball books.  Examples are Cincinnati owner John T. Brush, Clark Griffith with two adopted sons in a photo with President F.D.R., Kid Elberfeld, Mike Donlin, Harry Wolverton, and others.I found it interesting that players were suspended for ""indifferent play"".  Players like Elberfeld and Donlin had hair-trigger tempers and others were heavy drinkers of alcohol (no surprise here).  Dave Fultz was a model for America's youth because didn't drink alcohol, smoke, curse, and refused to play on Sundays.This was a period in the game's history when Ban Johnson was fighting to bring his Western League onto equal footing with the National League and struggled to place a team into New York City and finally landing a location on a rock pile in upper Manhattan that became known at the Highlanders and now known as the Yankees.

"Clyde Bellecourt and Dennis Banks were co-founders of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in 1968 to address grievances regarding police brutality and injustices in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.This book addresses the takeover of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973 by member of AIM in protest to Oglala Tribal Chairman Dick Wilson's administration.  This part of the book also describes the dislike of the Wounded Knee Trading Post and Museum run by Clive and Agnes Gildersleeve because it was felt they were benefiting from what happened back in the massacre of 1890 through sales to tourists.  I organized a trip to the Black Hills for a group of Little Leaguers in August of 1974 and Clive Gildersleeve met us at Wounded Knee and gave us his thoughts regarding what took place the year before.  He told us that most of the protesters were from other parts of the country.  We witnessed the damage done to his home along with the museum and trading post.  He also mentioned the wording on the historical marker describing what happened in December of 1890 was offensive to native Americans.  That disgust was exhibited by a huge obscenity painted across the marker.  Mr. Gildersleeve was living in Rushville, Nebraska, at the time.The book's main focus is on a conference at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 2012 in which Bellecourt, Banks, and Russell Means and an F.B.I. agent and son discussed what took place and tried to come to a resolution of sorts.  What actually took place back in 1973 probably will never be agreed upon as to who did what and author Stew Magnuson doesn't claim to make any judgments one way or the other.  Each side has their own prejudices and beliefs and it will always remain so with no real progress having been made towards a meeting of the minds.  This book is an interesting read but don't expect to have it reveal any progress from either side agreeing as to who is to blame for what took place in 1973.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AFKX838TQCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985299614#wasThisHelpful","R9AFKX838TQCJ","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kim Philby exuded charisma among those he came in contact with.  So much so that he pulled the wool over the eyes of the man who thought knew him best, Nicholas Elliott.  Philby was one among five individuals from England who made up what came to be known as the Cambridge Five, those from England who spied for the Soviet Union.  Apparently Philby felt no remorse for sending a significant number of Soviets who spied for England to their deaths when they were requested to return to the Soviet Union.  Philby possessed three significant weaknesses not conducive to spying namely gambling, womanizing, and alcohol.

"I found this book to be a riveting read from beginning to end.  I had never heard of this case prior to reading this book.  All too often among kids the belief that two is company and three is a crowd rings true.  Skylar Neese found herself on the ""outs"" from her two friends Shelia Eddy and Rachel Shoaf and in a case of extreme behavior Skylar paid for it with her life.This is a book I would recommend to parents of adolescents since the problems encountered are hardly unique to those in this story.  An individual can ruin their own life in addition to those of others by acting on their frustrations first and thinking later.  The answer as to why two girls decided to take the life of one of their best friends is more complex than reasons such as ""we just didn't want to be friends with her anymore"" or wanting to keep Skylar quiet from exposing the lesbian relationship Shelia and Rachel had with one another.  Authors Darleen Berry and Geoffrey Fuller delve into possible reasons.  One officer believes it was nothing more than a thrill kill.  The authors list ten suggestions for parents to follow in dealing with their adolescent children.One complaint I have with the book is the lack of photographs.  Sprinkled sparingly in the book are a few tiny photos some of which are irrelevant to the story.  The only photos we have of the two girls who committed the murder are a tiny photo of the girls with Skylar.  You have to go on the computer to see additional photos.This book should be must reading for parents and educators alike.  Parenting has becoming increasingly difficult due to computers, cell phones, and other technological devices that children can use away from the watchful eye of their parents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JQX5INBBPFXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940363101#wasThisHelpful","R3JQX5INBBPFXM","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually don't read fiction but the 1954 Topps baseball card of Reno Bertoia on the cover intrigued me.  Author Marty Gervais has written a unique book of a boy who spent most of his time in the attic of his home while being nursed and home-schooled due to polio.  The boy's name is Henry but he develops a fixation on Reno Bertoia of the Detroit Tigers because Bertoia is from Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and Henry used to live there himself.  He adopts the name ""Reno"" for himself as he spends a lot of time sending letters to sports figures, movie stars, singers, and politicians while hoping for replies and posting them on his attic wall.  However, nothing appears from Bertoia who eventually fades from the boy's interest.The book moves to a period of thirty years later when the boy becomes a doctor. From here I'll let you read the book for yourself.  I know you will enjoy it.  I'm ordering two extra copies for friends who remember Reno Bertoia as a Detroit Tiger. Reno Bertoia played in the first baseball game I ever saw in 1958 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit.  I remember a fan yelling, ""Hey Bertoia!  Get a hit and I'll pay your way through the tunnel,""  which connected Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada.  I realize this is a work of fiction.  However, the author has Ernie Harwell announcing for the Detroit Tigers in 1957.  Harwell was with the Baltimore Orioles at the time while Van Patrick did the play-by-play for the Tigers.  Also, take a look at that 1954 Topps baseball card of Bertoia.  He's ready to field a ground ball.  However, instead of watching the ball he's watching the photographer take a photo of him.  I'm sure he's about to be charged with an error for not keeping his eye on the ball.Buy the book.  It's a quick read.  You are in for a treat even though you may not enjoy fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQ301MBVYF2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0889628572#wasThisHelpful","R2LQ301MBVYF2O","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Dan Epstein has obviously done a lot of research in writing his recap of the 1976 baseball season.  It is especially interesting for those who enjoy reminiscing about a period in time that they remember.  In addition to the baseball and the individuals such as Mark Fidrych, Charley Finley, Bill Veeck, the New York Yankees, and Cincinnati's Big Red Machine the book includes popular music and political musings as well.  I did find the play-by-play of the playoffs and World Series between the Reds and Yankees to be somewhat overdone.  Others may like this in baseball books but this is a personal irritation of mine.  The book includes numerous anecdotes most of which can be found in other baseball books.  Books on particular seasons have become popular and the 1976 season is worthy of such a book and we can be thankful to Dan Epstein for giving us this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6MB54FRZQAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034388#wasThisHelpful","R2A6MB54FRZQAJ","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book picks up where the book The Alvin Karpis Story left off.  Karpis spent over 25 years in Alcatraz, longer than any other prisoner.  His book reads like a diary in which he relates his experiences in dealing with fellow inmates, wardens, guards, escape attempts, attacks of one inmate upon another, and various jobs he had while incarcerated.  IN 1958 Karpis was briefly transferred to Leavenworth Prison in Kansas but shortly thereafter sent back to Alcatraz.  No prisoner has ever been granted parole from Alcatraz; they had to be transferred to another prison first.  Karpis gives his opinion of Robert Stroud, the so-called ""Birdman of Alcatraz:.""  Stroud never had any birds while at Alcatraz.  He gained his reputation from birds he had while at Leavenworth Prison.  Karpis considered Stroud to be a very dangerous individual.  Karpis provides the reader with a lively rendition of the 1946 escape attempt in which three convicts were killed during the attempt with two others executed for their role, with one another given a life in prison sentence.  Karpis entered Alcatraz in 1936 and was transferred to McNeil Island Prison in Washington in 1962. Karpis left feeling prison life did absolutely nothing to reform him from his life of crime.  Alcatraz was closed in 1963.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GEF9I0HLYJ55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825300193#wasThisHelpful","R3GEF9I0HLYJ55","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this to be a very entertaining book to read told through the eyes of Alvin Karpis.  Karpis relates his life of crime from one heist to another until his capture in New Orleans in 1936.  Karpis had a big ego in having the audacity to call himself a professional when it came to robbing banks and expressing his disgust for civilians who inadvertently got in his way to make a living by breaking the law.  Karpis absolves Ma Barker of any criminal wrongdoing even though she was aware of the doing of the Karpis/Barker gang.  Prior to his capture Karpis appears to have a foreboding that his ""career"" was coming to an end. since his cohorts in crime were either deceased or in prison.  John Edgar Hoover, the self-important head of the F. B. I., made himself present when Karpis was captured just as he did when Lepke Buckhalter surrendered in New York City to make sure he took credit for the work his agents did.  Karpis entered Alcatraz prison in August of 1936 and was transferred to McNeil Prison in Puget Sound in Washington.  Having spent 25 years in Alcatraz Karpis spent more time in Alcatraz than any other inmate.  I'm sure an interesting sequel to this book would be the one entitled ""On the Rock"" which covers Karpis's years on Alcatraz.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPKM5ZMOIEAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=4871873331#wasThisHelpful","R1VPKM5ZMOIEAC","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addie Joss spent a relatively short baseball career with the Cleveland Indians at the turn of the 20th century.  At the time of his death in 1911 of bacterial meningitis  he was the first of the great baseball pitchers to pass away.  Addie's career may have been at an end at the time of his death due to a torn ligament in his pitching arm.  Although his Cleveland team never appeared in a World Series Joss was a dominant pitcher in the league in addition to his taking on the role of a newspaper columnist for post-season games.  A rule change was necessary for him to be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame since he died prior to playing in his necessary tenth major league season.  A 1977 rule change led to Joss's election in 1978.  An impressive benefit made up of baseball stars raised over $13,000 for the widow of Addie Joss amply demonstrated how highly he was thought among his peers in the game.  Not many baseball fans have even heard of Addie Joss who passed away over 100 years ago and we can thank author Scott Longert for this book on one of the game's foremost pitchers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMRCQYDOWTYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0910137749#wasThisHelpful","R3AMRCQYDOWTYN","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is the only book I have read on this infamous shady character and it took me a while to pioneer my way through the 429 pages of text.

"There have been a few books dealing with the infamous murder of three civil rights workers by bigots who belonged to the Mississippi Ku Klux Klan 50 years ago this month but now author Don Mitchell has provided a book on the subject for younger middle school readers.  Author Mitchell doesn't dwell on the murders itself but he does present chapters devoted to the three victims Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner in addition to information on those involved in committing the murders and those responsible for bringing the murderers to justice.Young readers should be aware of what took place during those sickening sixties regarding the struggle African-Americans had to achieve basic rights such as the right to vote.  This book is especially timely now due to attempts to suppress the right to vote now that the Supreme Court in its ""wisdom"" did away with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Hate is a terrible thing and the three men who grace the cover of this book paid the ultimate price in the interest of serving others.I would strongly suggest readers also acquire the DVD entitled ""Murder in MIssissippi"" which deals with this tragic case.  I believe this DVD is superior to ""Mississippi Burning"" which contains too much profanity to show in schools.  In addition I believe ""Murder in Mississippi"" does a superior job anyway.

"It's hard to write anything new that 69 other individuals have not already included.  However, I did find this to be an interesting book and not simply to read about the tragedy (to say the least) that took place at the home of Sharon Tate on August 8, 1969.  Author Greg King does an excellent job in developing the personalities of the individuals involved in this story and not only the victims involved in the murders.  We learn about the relationship that Sharon had with Say Sebring who remained in love with Sharon despite her marriage to Roman Polanski and died defending her.  Sharon felt hurt and may have been contemplating a divorce from her philandering husband at the time of her death.  We get to know the three remaining victims Abigail Folger, Vorteck Frykowski, Steve Parent, and the LaBiancas (Leno and Rosemary) in addition to those that took part in the murders.The book also includes the investigation, the trials, and the attempts the killers have made in gaining parole.  There is a brand new biography of Sharon Tate which I haven't read, but this book, even though it was written in the year 2000, provides one with a good description on the life of Sharon Tate and the tragedy that led to the demise of her and her friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HU4QKZ9VCQ65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1569801576#wasThisHelpful","R2HU4QKZ9VCQ65","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book aptly illustrates how quickly lives can be destroyed.  There are no winners in this book.  Losers include the victim and her family, the murderer and his family, and the community at large all come out on the short end in Little Girl Lost.  Author Tammy Mal is the daughter of a boyhood friend of 13 year-old murderer Myron Semunchich and I feel she did an excellent job in relating the story of 9-year-old Mae Barrett of Vandling, Pennsylvania, who had her life snatched away in January of 1945.Author Mal reminds the reader as to what society's attitudes towards crime were in 1945 as opposed to what they are now.  In addition police interrogation of suspects were different than what they are now.  Murderer Myron Semunchick unconsciously exhibited attitudes common among criminals.  Examples would be trying to assist police (directing traffic), exhibiting overreacting behavior as to what should be done to the murderer (forcefully throwing his knife into the top of a desk), constantly talking about the crime to others, and assuring a friend that ""I will walk home with you and I assure you the murderer won't attack you.""It appears that God assures the victim in any case that clues will be left that will bring the perpetrator to justice.  In this case it was a right-handed winter glove that was worn by Semunchick who had a deformed little finger that led to the solving of this crime.  In a 1924 crime in Chicago it was a pair of glasses left at the scene that led to the solving of the murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks.Author Tammy Mal sums up the case in an ""Afterword"" and ""Author's Thoughts"" at the end of the book in which she brings up a number of questions regarding this crime.  She gives her opinion regarding many of them while others she admits have no answers.  The book contains five pages of photos.

"I can't say I enjoyed the book since the subject matter is off a horrible nature but the book did hold my interest.  Author Mark Pettit did a thorough job in researching the book in addition to interviewing the young man who murdered these children.  Murderer John Joubert took special satisfaction in being in the presence of others discussing the crimes and not knowing the actual murderer was in their midst.  Special comments are written by a parent of each of the two Omaha victims and the book concentrates on each of them whereas a victim from Portland, Maine, is briefly mentioned at the end of the book.This is a quick reading book and will hold your interest.  I guess the lesson to be learned is that the unlikeliest source can be the place to look for a suspect after a crime has been committed.  This book is disturbing to read but the author has done a commendable job in covering this case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZJN6OMIGEZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988928310#wasThisHelpful","R1NZJN6OMIGEZB","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five stars mean ""I loved It.""  However, I hate to say that such a book of depravity could be lovable.  Author Jeff O'Donnell did a good job in covering the Starkweather/Fugate reign of terror throughout the state of Nebraska in January of 1958.  He appears to cover the details of each of the murders as we know them to have taken place.  I have read another book on this subject and this book is the best one.Author O'Donnell appendixes A-H in which he covers questions regarding the efforts of the police, a lengthy question and answer session between Caril Fugate and a Chief Deputy Attorney, letters from Charles Starkweather and his mother, a questions and answers to Starkweather prior to his execution, and a few others.If you want to read a book on this subject I would strongly suggest reading this one.

"Although the title of this book is ""Roosevelt the Explorer"" I feel a more fitting title would be ""Roosevelt the Hunter"" since a good portion of the book is devoted to Roosevelt's experiences of hunting big game in the African countries of Kenya and Uganda.  Some individuals see a contradiction of sorts in Roosevelt the conservationist and his taking delight in shooting a variety of animals the skins of which were to be used in museums in the United States.  I found it interesting to note that among all the equipment he and his entourage had to pack for their trip he included a goodly portion of classic books to read on his safari.The book spends some time on Roosevelt's youth and his family.  His brother Elliott was alcoholic and ended up taking his own life.  One of Roosevelt's sons, Kermit, suffered the same fate.  Roosevelt's first wife died shortly after the birth of their first child who was named Alice.  Alice could be a rebel during her teen-age years and she married congressman Nicholas Longworth whom Longworth Hall in the United States Capitol building is named after.The book doesn't spend much time on Roosevelt's years as President of the United States.  Following his presidential years Roosevelt wanted to ""be a boy again"" so he ventured into a harrowing experience traveling an unmapped river in South America.  His son Kermit was urged by his mother to go along to ""look out for father.""  Kermit postponed his marriage to accompany his dad but this trip down what came to be known as ""The River of Doubt"" was one in which survival became very questionable.  This trip more so lives up to the book's title as ""Roosevelt the Explorer"" since they were literally in uncharted waters which saw things get so bad that Roosevelt resigned himself to not surviving the trip.An interesting anecdote takes place in a hotel where Roosevelt was drinking coffee.  When he was asked if he wanted another cup he asked the name of the coffee company.  When told it was Maxwell House he said he not only would like another cup but that the coffee was ""good to the last drop.""  This accolade immediately became the motto of Maxwell-House coffee and remains so to this day.If you enjoy hunting you will enjoy the section of the book that takes place in Africa.  The section in South America will appeal to armchair explorers.  You wouldn't have wanted to be on this trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G28G9AWXYMND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878332901#wasThisHelpful","R3G28G9AWXYMND","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Jonah Keri has provided us with a well-written volume on the late Montreal Expos.  Baseball history needed a book on this franchise and the author has come through with a book that is a worthy addition to your baseball library.  This book covers the birth of the team which joined the National League along with the San Diego Padres in 1969 while playing in Jarry Parc which would be a stretch to call a minor-league park.I found the book especially interesting because I organized a bus tour to Montreal for Little Leaguers in 1975 and 1980 so we got to experience both the ambiance of Jarry Parc and the sterility of Olympic Stadium.The author amply covers both the good and bad years effectively along with the difficulties involving ownership and lack of revenue sharing and big television contracts that team have now which enable them to survive which the Expos did not have the advantage of.  The Expos never lacked for stars and super stars with names such as Gary Carter, Rusty Staub, Andre Dawson, Vladiimir Guerrero, Pedro Martinez, and others which the author sprinkles with anecdotes.The author laments the loss of the Expos in Montreal which have now become the Washington Nationals.but holds out a slim hope that Montreal may once again become a major league team.  Milwaukee lost the Braves following the 1965 season and regained a team in 1970 when the Seattle Pilots transferred to Milwaukee in 1970 so perhaps some day Montreal may some day become big league once more.  The Montreal Expos had a brief run at the major league level and this book does a good job in covering their history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O2HZVMJOYJLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307361357#wasThisHelpful","R1O2HZVMJOYJLX","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author C. Alexander Hortis has written an engaging account of the history of the mafia in New York City while debunking a number of myths that have arisen through the years.  The mob was on the verge of extinction during the decade of the 1910s but then saw a resurgence with the advent of prohibition.  With its repeal in 1933 the mafia became involved in labor unions, the sport of boxing, waterfront shipping, nightclubbing, the numbers racket, and narcotics.  Mobsters supposedly liked to deny they were involved with dope but the truth speaks otherwise.The truth about mobsters is that they really are nobodies wanting to be somebody and the oath of omerta is, and always has been, a myth.  They will speak to save their own skin and will always feel paranoid about their brothers in crime knowing that ""I'd better get him before he gets me.""I especially enjoyed the last two chapters which involved the assassination of ""The Lord High Executioner"", ""The Mad Hatter"" himself, Albert Anastasia in the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel in October of 1957.  It has been presented in other books that two of the Gallo brothers were involved in this ""hit"" but author Hortis has other beliefs.  He mentions Steve Grammauta as the lead gunman but neglects to mention anyone else.  Perhaps we shall never know.  This event led to the conclave that took place in November in Apalachin, New York, at the home of Joseph Barbara Senior.  This, also, was a very interesting chapter in which, oddly enough, the oath of omerta held as the mobsters denied they'd done anything wrong in getting together to wish their friend Joesph Barbara well while a few others came up with some laughable excuses.  A number of the mobsters made a fiasco of the event by scattering through the woods to avoid the law but the authorities had absolutely nothing to hold them on.When the news of Apalachin reached the public F. B. I. Director J. Edgar Hoover finally admitted the reality regarding the mafia which he had vigorously denied the existence of.  Nobody likes to be proven wrong and Hoover had to publicly admit what he may have believed but couldn't face up to.  This, perhaps, was the most profitable outcome of the clandestine meeting of the mafia nabobs get-together as far as the authorities were concerned.The book contains a number of photographs, most of them small, in  addition to charts which the reader may or may not find interesting.  Much of America's history is infamous and this book on the New York City mobsters through 1957 is a must for your crime library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WQJA5UGGSZWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161614923X#wasThisHelpful","R1WQJA5UGGSZWI","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Gil Bogen wrote a previous biography entitled ""Tinker, Evers, and Chance--A Triple Biography"" in 2003.  Although you may have read this wonderful book you may feel it not necessary to read a new separate biography on ""Johnny Evers--A Baseball Life"" by Dennis Snelling.  I would suggest you also include author Snelling's book in your baseball library as well.This is more than a biography on Evers but also provides the reader into insight of what baseball was like at the turn of the 20th century.  Much has been made of Franklin P. Adams' poem entitled ""Baseball's Sad Lexicon"" being responsible for the inclusion of Tinker, Evers, and Chance in the Baseball Hall of Fame but the author in no way attempts to sway the reader regarding any of the three  in the Baseball Hall of Fame.Evers spent his ""salad"" years with the Chicago Cubs and Boston Braves.  The Cubs bowed to the Chicago White Sox Hitless Wonders in the 1906 World Series and then defeated the Detroit Tigers in the World Series in 1907 and 1908.  The infamous base-running gaffe by Fred Merkle of the Giants is amply covered as well.  Evers was fortunate to have Hank O'Day as the umpire at second base for that game because it was O'Day who was the umpire at second in a previous game involving Evers when a runner was not called out for not continuing on to touch the base in a similar situation.  Any other umpire would not have called Merkle out.Evers, along with his shortstop partner ""Rabbit"" Maranville were the infield sparkplugs that led the Boston Braves to upset McGraw's Giants for the National League pennant in 1914 and then swept Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series.  At least for me, the games the author includes in this book are presented in an interesting way whereas all too often baseball books get carried away with a play-by-play rendition that can become boring.Johnny Evers did not live an easy life.  The pressures he applied to himself in regard to winning, attempting to keep his business solvent, rehabilitating his broken leg, the break-up of his marriage, the death of his young daughter, and dealing with guilt he felt for his best friend losing his life in an automobile accident in which Evers was driving, along with his own driven personality which often led to ejections from games eventually led to Evers experiencing a mental breakdown.  Evers won a Chalmers automobile for being the MVP but he never drove an automobile after his friend was killed.  Instead Evers had his brother Joe drive him around.The book also includes photos I have never seen in other baseball books.  Johnny Evers deserves his own biography and we can thank author Dennis Snelling for providing us with this new biography of ""The Trojan"" or ""The Crab.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQTW96ZVP8UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0786475919#wasThisHelpful","RVQTW96ZVP8UE","AXMKAXC0TR9AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXMKAXC0TR9AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using iPads since tablets first came out and had very little knowledge with android, so this IRULU tablet was definitely out of the ordinary for me.  After owning two iPads, I wasn't very optimistic about me loving this tablet or even liking it, but I was shocked at the quality of it.  Once I learned a bit about android and how they work and reading the instructions, I was geared up to fully test out this tablet.  It's a thick tablet that is white on the back and the screen on the front is outlined in black. It's longer than my iPad, but slimmer and more narrow as well. It's comfortable to use and not too heavy to carry.One of the things I love most about my apple products is their touch screen sensitivity is spot on, and this tablet was just as fast clicking on things, I didn't have to sit and wait for a page to load, it was almost Instant.  I don't have to press repeatedly to get the screen to recognize my tap either.  It's definitely not the speed of my iPad but it is pretty nice and works well.  I use it to watch videos on YouTube, general browsing on the web, or checking my Facebook. I was a bit sad that I couldn't get some apps to run on there and since I'm still learning the ropes of an android I'm sure I can find a way to watch on my favorite apps. I don't do much game playing so I can't account for how well it works for playing games.I love the clarity of the screen and how large it is.  It is great for watching since the screen is so long.  I have used it watching Netflix and YouTube.  I like that it has internal memory of 16GB and expandable storage with a Micro SD.  The tablet also has 1GB ram which I think is an improvement from many of the cheaper tablets that do not have as much (RAM affects the speed performance of the tablet).One of my favorite features on this tablet is that I can connect my Bluetooth headphones to it.  The Bluetooth on the tablet is amazing for me!!! I love watching late at night and since I don't have a TV in my bedroom, I use the tablet now instead of my phone and I obviously don't want to wake up my husband or kids, so I can place the tablet on a tablet stand and use my Bluetooth headset without being tethered to a headset that isn't Bluetooth capable.The tablet also has a front facing camera of 0.3 MP and a back camera with 2 MP. I won't be using the tablet for photos, but if I wanted to, the resolution isn't as great as id like. Although having two cameras isn't common for a tablet that low budget tablet.Along with all of the mentioned attributes, the tablet also has a mini HDMI out to connect to the TV, GPS capabilities, cables that support numerous features on the tablet.I am sad to say that with all the great features that the tablet includes, that it somehow slipped through my fingers and fell to the ground, only about a foot, onto hardwood flooring. I was so worried about it happening and then it did, the screen cracked the tablet now has a crack on the corner. I am still able to use the tablet, just wish that it came with some kind of case that you could use since it's a budget tablet, you'd have trouble finding a case for it.  Otherwise I'm very impressed with the functionality of the tablet.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22F9VPA5I9BF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTWI8ZI#wasThisHelpful","R22F9VPA5I9BF","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fashionista at heart and I love clothes.  I have two closets full and well, I can't sort through them as easily as I used to be able to, so I often go through purging the old items when I get in new clothing.  I have dozens of different types of hangers in my closet and some are wooden, some have slots for tank tops, and some even have grips to keep shirts from slipping, but quite honestly don't work all that well. I hate when I'm searching in my closet and something slips and falls off the hanger.  With these hangers, I won't be having that issue any longer.The hangers come in a pack of 50, they're great quality and very sturdy.  They're ivory in color and are a no slip velvet material on the hanger.  The hook is a silver metal that you can switch 360 degrees.  They're non-slip, very thin, and save a ton of room in my closet.  I hung so many different articles of clothing on here and each one fit so perfectly.  From fur coats, evening gowns with heavy beading, little black dresses, to casual tops and pants with no issues.  The pants part doesn't sag to get pulled down like plastic or metal hangers do.  They velvet held up even my off shoulder tops and dresses and didn't let them slide off like my old hangers did.My evening gowns stay on and I don't even need to use the string inside for clothing for keeping them in place.  I love that I now have so much more room with the slim uniform look that the hangers give my closet.  I had a closet stuffed to the brim and not much room left for new clothes.  I did do some purging of about 10 tops, but the photographs I provided you can see a major difference in the space that is in my closet now.  The hangers are truly wonderful, space saving, and non slip.  They're very thin, yet sturdy and efficient in keeping clothes on the hanger and not ruining clothing by them sagging on the hanger like traditional hangers do. I love the hangers and I can now shop even more, what girl doesn't love that they can shop even more!?  I will definitely be purchasing a few more sets of these hangers for my husbands closet as well.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXIG5C37OQVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JQ50S4#wasThisHelpful","RBXIG5C37OQVX","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the solid black, modern look to this frame.  My husband wanted to hang up some stuff in his office and not have anything that was fancy, but sleek looking.  Its a nice thick black frame with a plexiglass.  Perfect for his office, and looks great as well.  Its a good quality frame, not something cheap or thin feeling.  He had a frame with his business license information on it and it was really cheap and didn't hold up  This one looks great and will definitely hold up much longer than the other did.  The frame can hold a photo up to 11x14 using it either horizontally or vertically.  It has the brackets in the back that make it easy for you to hang it up. on your wall as well.  My husband used this for some sports memorabilia in his office and it looks great!  The quality of the frame and the plexiglass is just what he wanted and even wants to purchase additional ones to have a uniform look with his office decor.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXST8KGZ5RVVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRMY64E#wasThisHelpful","RXST8KGZ5RVVP","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this because i loved thee sequin sleeves on it.  I ordered a large and it fits well, almost a bit snug, not like the photo.  If I had sized up to an XL l think I would've gotten a better fit.  The fabric is a good quality, thick, and soft that has a stretch to it.  The part on the elbows has sequins on it, but the sequins aren't lined by the material of the shirt.  Instead its a really itchy material that makes it very uncomfortable to wear. I really like sequined elbow and pocket patch with the Aztec designs and how pretty it looks. The elbow section doesn't have any stretch to it which makes it difficult, since the shirt is a bit snug to begin with to bend your arms comfortably.  It is still really pretty and she loves the top and the quality of it.  Just recommend ordering a size up and wearing a comfortable long sleeve top beneath it to keep it from irritating you.  I typically wear a large and I am a size 11/12 and a size 38D bust just to give you an idea of my size.  I wish mine fit as flowy as the model shows, but it definitely hugs my body unlike the photo.  Maybe when I shed a few pounds I'll be happier with the shirt, right now I still love it just wish I had gotten a size larger.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GOKIFHXZSVNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01766GJ3W#wasThisHelpful","R1GOKIFHXZSVNN","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this for my sister who wears a size XS/S and got the medium as suggested by the size chart, but I wish I had gone up in size even more to maybe the large.  It fits her well, but its PERFECT, no wiggle room at all.  The fabric is a good quality, thick fabric that has a stretch to it.  The part on the elbows, I expected to have sequins on it.  I didn't actually pay attention to all of the other photos in the listing and realized that the cover photo is different from the actual product.  The material on the elbows and pocket is NOT sequined, its a silk like material with the Aztec designs.  The elbow section doesn't have any stretch to it which makes it difficult, since the shirt is a bit snug to begin with to bend your arms comfortably.  It is still really pretty and she loves the top and the quality of it.  Just recommend ordering two sizes up.  My sister is 108 lbs and a size 32B bust just to give you an idea of how tiny she is and the medium was still a bit snug. Had it fit according to the size chart, this would be a 5 star top with the quality and how cute it is even without the sequins.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACCSEAPD2WXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WCVPCG#wasThisHelpful","R1ACCSEAPD2WXI","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HSI Professional #1 smoothing shampoo works really well. My sister in law has very coarse thick hair and has been using this when she washes her hair and her hair is noticeably much healthier looking with less frizz and much more tamed.  She loved the argon oil shampoo and the effects its having on her hair with nourishing it, she refuses to use anything else now. Overall, this product is excellent at taming dry, coarse, frizzy hair and making your hair have a beautiful lustrous shine to it.  It's a decent sized bottle with a pump too, which is great to keep from using or wasting too much shampoo. I recommend this to anyone who has dry hair to use this in combination with the HSI argon oil.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11IOIC3BWGZ02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMIFFW2#wasThisHelpful","R11IOIC3BWGZ02","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My nieces birthday was coming up and her mom mentioned her wanting to buy a cute table and chair set for her.  She just turned 5 years old and her school projects are becoming more frequent and wanted a table to work on.  She has a large bedroom and knew this table would not only make a great decor piece but also be a useful way for her to get a desk for her arts, crafts, and learning time at home.The table has pretty leopard print on it. It's black, pink, and white. Comes with a set of two chairs and the table.  I'm glad it came with two chairs since she has a sister it will make arts and crafts time so much more fun!  The table was very easy to assemble and came with step by step directions.  There was a bit of an issue with one of the chairs and getting the screw all day way in, but my husband just drilled it in and it gave all the screws a more secure hold.  The table edges and the legs on both the table and chairs are hand carved and looks beautiful. I honestly think the table is MUCH nicer in person and best of my niece loved it!  I was afraid that the pieces might be broken from the box, but it was padded well and nothing broke or was scratched either.  It's an elegant piece as bedroom decor with the modern black trimming on the table.  It's a very well made, sturdy, and beautiful table and chairs set. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the market.  I couldn't be happier!Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N4V4O4GSYYO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJ33JV0#wasThisHelpful","R1N4V4O4GSYYO6","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tons of makeup, in fact, my family calls me a makeup hoarder and being as OCD as I am, organization is a must!!  This flower cosmetic & makeup brush holder is wonderful to help me store lipsticks, brushes, lip or eye liners.  It has 12 different spaces for storage in the holder.  6 storage spaces are larger, where there are 6 smaller spaces.  The smaller ones would fit many things like liners, thin brushes, or even a thin tweezers.  The larger storage spaces can hold lipsticks, lip glosses, and makeup brushes that fit well into the storage.  Its an acrylic clear cosmetic & makeup brush holder.  Its sturdy and well made and looks great sitting on top of my other clear organizers.  Now if you're like me and are as OCD as I am, then you hate digging through your makeup bag for your makeup brushes, plus, it makes my brushes look and feel cleaner without being thrown in a bag.  I have my favorite brushes in the set, as well as some q-tips, a thin set of tweezers, and my favorite liners in the organizer.  I love having them on display on my vanity as well and everything is at my fingertips.  I love that it is slanted a bit so I can see everything in the organizer.  The organizer is a great addition to any vanity.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLM0EC5JLX2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144QU6WW#wasThisHelpful","R3VLM0EC5JLX2I","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What kid doesn't love a big dump truck, I know my kids certainly do.  Now, I have PLENTY of toys in the house that make noise, and sirens, lights, etc. so the fact that doesn't require any batteries and works off push and go action, just by revving up the wheels a few times and it will zoom on its own to a great distance.  It went from side of our living room to the other.  The flatbed part of the truck is red, and the dump trailer is on the back of the truck and is a bright yellow and actually holds things in the trailer and works with a lever to dump things out.  This is by far my children's favorite feature of the truck.  they load it up with their favorite toys and watch them dump all over the floor, and then do it again.  I also love that there was absolutely no set up time with the truck, it was ready to go right out of the package, which is perfect since my toddlers are very impatient and don't usually wait for me to try to set things up properly for them.  This is tons of fun for my kids and definitely a favorite toy of theirs now.  I think its the perfect gift for a child who loves all types of trucks!

"A big garbage truck strolling down our street gets the kids so excited, and I knew they would love this WolVol 4 Channel Electric Remote Control Take Apart Garbage Truck Toy with Lights and flip top can. The garbage truck is one of the build and play types of toys, similar to LEGO or Megabloks. The truck comes disassembled with the flatbed part of the garbage truck for the base and has wheels.  The front car section of the truck and the back garbage collection truck.  Additionally, the set includes, a garbage man, two orange cones, two extra blocks , and lights that sit on top of the garbage truck,  the stickers were preinstalled on the truck. Last but not least, the remote control for the garbage truck. It does require 4 AA batteries for the truck, and one 9 Volt battery that does not come in the set.My sons loved assembling the garbage truck and was very easy to assemble, we just followed the pictures on the box of how it is supposed to look, the instructions for the battery installation is directly on the box. The pieces are perfectly sized for toddler hands.  The remote control works great to control it to go in every direction, even at a reasonably far distance.  The flashing light turns on when pressing it and stays on until you press it again.Overall, my kids loved being able to assemble and disassemble the truck, the color of the garbage truck is consistent with many garbage trucks we see in real life. My kids keep saying where is the garbage cans, which would've been great to have instead of the extra blocks in my opinions, but they just use those blocks as ""garbage"" to throw into the flip top.  The truck moves freely in all directions with the controller. It worked really well in our kitchen and living room (ceramic and hard wood floors). We have only one room with carpeting in our home, so I can't vouch for its movement on carpet, but it worked well over our area rugs as well.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150P70XJJTWPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142AC9LG#wasThisHelpful","R150P70XJJTWPH","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My two toddler sons ages 2 and 4 and they both have taken an interest in instruments, mostly anything loud and noisy, which I wouldn't expect anything less!  My oldest son has always loved drumming onto things with his hands, straws, chopsticks, whatever he can find to bang with really.  So, when I saw this adorable drum set for children, I figured its the perfect marriage of his love for drumming, his favorite color, and the best part is, it's just for him.The set has 11 pieces: 6 drums, one of which is a bass drum that works with the foot pedal, a cymbal, drumsticks and a seat.  The drum looks exactly as its pictured.  On every drum the sides are red, with a little design on them.  On the top of every drum is clear, and have a huge BANG written within an explosive looking star.  The cymbal works, but don't expect it to sound like a real drum, this is a toy. The seat is perfect height for both of my children, when sitting they can reach all of the drums and cymbals without needed to stand up.  Their feet also touch the ground and do not need help getting on and off the the seat when using the drum.Assembly for the drum set was very easy, it didn't have instructions inside the box, they were pictured directly on the box, which were clear and easy to understand.  They had pictures to coincide with each step.  Overall, for a practice/fun drum set for kids to play on, this is perfect, fun and will make them laugh for hours.  This would be a perfect birthday or Christmas present for a child.  This would look amazing under a Christmas tree with a big red bow on it!Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5U9F26Q6NBTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HEMQ84#wasThisHelpful","R5U9F26Q6NBTL","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"St. Jude has been a blessing to me as well as my family.  My sister in law had trouble conceiving and went through a few losses and as a family we prayed the Novena to St. Jude, and she soon found out she was pregnant with my niece who is now 5 years old. Since then, every year we pray the novena together in honor of our niece.  On all saints day (November 1st) my sister was lucky enough to choose St. Jude as her saint, and I thought that this would make the perfect gift to her.The figurine is not large and doesn't take up much room.  Its about the size of my hand when fully opened.  The statue has beautiful detail and the colors are vivid and exactly like what St. Jude is usually pictured wearing.  It also has all of the details like the flame above his head, medallion on his neck, and the walking stick.  The only difference from the photo shown and the actual statue is that on the bottom, the stand had a gold plaque with St. Jude engraved on it.  I actually like that it says St. Jude on there so that when others see it and they're not familiar with St. Jude, they will be able to read it and know.  Its a beautiful statue and perfect to give as a gift.

"I haven't worn a poncho in a long time and when I saw the pretty flow and asymmetrical hem on this one I figured id give it a shot and try it it.  I'm a bit busty and loose clothes don't always flatter me, In fact they make me appear larger than I am.  I'm a size 11/12 and 5'4, it fit beautifully on me.  The material is elegant and stretchy, yet soft and comfortable all at the same time!The poncho is such a versatile piece that it can be worn in many ways, with a belt, or on its own, or with leggings or jeans.  The model is wearing it as a dress, which could be an option for some, but I'm way too modest to wear it that way.  You can dress it up or have a more casual look depending on how you wear it.I ordered the wine/burgundy color and the color is very rich and beautiful!  I layered it with a black long sleeves undershirt beneath it, dark wash skinny jeans and black velvet booties. I also accessorized it with gold fashion jewelry to make the wine color pop even more.  I liked wearing the long sleeve with t to allow me to wear it during the fall and not be cold.  Living in the Midwest, our weather fluctuates way too often for me to not be prepared. I got so many compliments on my poncho!One of my favorite things about the poncho is that is drapes down with the asymmetric hem and the way it falls and sits on me is so pretty.

"I'm in between sizes right now and hate buying tops so I've been looking for cute cardigans to throw over tank tops and t-shirts instead of tops that are either too snug or too loose on me.  I love prints and colors and making fashion din, the woman's cardigan boyfriend sweater by Zoozie LA is not only cute, it's comfortable and warm!  It's made of great quality material with 80% acrylic and 20% metallic thread, which is gold in color and gives a gorgeous shimmer.  It's a thick sweater like material that doesn't feel itchy when I have it on, which is great because I have psoriasis it's hard for me to find comfortable sweater materials that don't cause a flare up.I ordered the size M/L, I was a bit concerned that the cardigan would be a bit small if it's meant to fit a size medium, it it definitely fit and the fabric has some give to it that gives you a comfortable arm space and not snug.  It was so hard trying to pick a patter type but I ended up choosing the brown and gold leopard print. The brown is a chocolate brown color with leopard shots in a metallic gold thread that sparkle, it gives the cardigan an extra elegance.I love the fit of the cardigan and how it's loose and flows beautifully. The front drapes in a pretty way with the hem being asymmetrical.  I'm 5'4 and a size 11/12 and the Large fit me well, the sleeve length was perfect on me, and the hem fell to just below my hips.This cardigan is so versatile and can be worn as a casual fall outfit or dressed up.  I wore mine with skinny jeans, a nude colored tank top, brown heel boots and my lovely Zoozie LA brown and gold leopard print cardigan.  I love this cardigan!

"We have been having issues of connectivity in one room of our home.  It's our children's play/rec room and I can't get a great wifi signal in there.  I have to leave the room to connect to the Internet, or turn off wifi on my mobile device and use my cellular data.  This wifi range extender works wonderfully! It has great instructions that helped me set up my wifi extender fairly quickly.  It connects to ur internet and creates an extension.

"My sister baptized our youngest son and we wanted to buy her a gift to always remember to keep him in her prayers.  She's into the Alex and Ani bracelets and I went on the hunt to see if they had a Godmother one, and surprisingly, they did.  Several of the bracelets she owns are the antique gold, so I got her the same color to match her set.  It's a quality made bracelet, looks beautiful stacked with the others that she has.  The bracelet has a charm with a large flower and the word Godmother beneath it.  This bracelet is from the Because I Love You collection.  It would make a great gift for a Godmother for any occasion! She loved it and wears it often.Purchased with my own money, a review was not required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21CO8TKUGX9AU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UMDGXY#wasThisHelpful","R21CO8TKUGX9AU","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered my normal size and it was a lot bigger than I expected it to be, which is usually not the case for me since I have a large bust.  The dress fit from the top, the hips are supposed to flow in a pretty draped way, but it doesn't.  Its over sized and looks funny in the hip area for me.  Maybe I just don't have the hips to fill it in, who knows, but it certainly isn't as pretty on me as it is on the model pictured.  The waist has a tie back that you can use to tighten since its a slip on dress.  Even with the waist tie back, it still is a bit large on me.  Another downfall to the dress is that its extremely short on me, I'm 5'4, not overly tall.  It reached my ankles, which isn't what I expected when I got this dress.  Aside from the downfalls, the dress is actually a beautiful fabric and is very comfortable on.  It is made well and not cheap looking.  If it fit me the way its pictured, it really would've been a beautiful dress.  I would recommend sizing down and if you're tall, don't get this dress.I ended up giving the dress to my sister in law who is 6 months pregnant so the midsection and hip being big is great for her to grow into and wear to a wedding she has coming up. She's also much shorter than me and the length was perfect on her. So it may work for some but not everyone.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVHC0IDS9X79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5Q6ISG#wasThisHelpful","R3PVHC0IDS9X79","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have REALLY oily hair and have had so much trouble over the years getting volume in my hair.  I have tried volumizing sprays, volumizing shampoos, etc. and nothing worked well for me.  It would work for the time that I styled my hair, but overtime throughout the day, it would be as if I didn't use any products whatsoever.  I have never used dry shampoo before and was unsure of the results I would get or how it even worked.  After reading the directions, I sprayed it into my hair when it was oily and needed a wash to see if it would give it a fresh look.  After spraying it, I ran my fingers through my hair to distribute the dry shampoo everywhere and then styled it.  It worked well and gave me a better look, it didn't exactly look as clean as an actual wash with shampoo, but it did work well and volumized my hair really well.  I could see this being an excellent product for camping, someone who is unable to get up and take showers often like the elderly.  It also has a great scent to it, a light lavender scent that makes my hair smell good too.The conditioner I used on only the ends of my hair as I do with regular shampoo.  In my opinion, the conditioner is not something I would use regularly since my hair is already oily and shiny on its own, I don't need an extra conditioner.  If someone has dry, dull hair, the conditioner would be great to use in addition with the shampoo. Overall, this is an excellent duo of products which work really well.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35RW09E9EXCUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IL6YBO#wasThisHelpful","R35RW09E9EXCUZ","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i love the look of the sweater knit dress, but I've never had one before.  I was expecting a bit of a thicker material when I hear the words sweater knit but its actually a thin sweater like material.  I was actually hoping to wear this dress for the fall with a cute jean jacket, but its a bit too thin for that so I'll be leaving it for the winter.  Its a beautiful dress, and looks exactly as pictured, at midi length beneath the knee.  I'm normally a large and it fits me since it has a really good stretch to it, but it does cling to your body and shows every curve.  I definitely need to wear shape wear when wearing this dress.  Its a ribbed looking sweater material and a medium grey speckled color.  The dress has a keyhole in the neckline and is strapless.  The dress is very feminine and pretty, I love how it looks on when I have my shape wear on.  I also recommend wearing some kind of slip beneath it because it is a bit see through in some areas, and in all honesty, I think it looks better on me with the slip since ti doesn't directly cling to me, I have something beneath that give it a smoother look.

"I am on a quest to lose weight after having baby number three.  I'm a fashionista at heart and love clothing and accessories, so working out can't be any different for me, or I will lose interest in wanting to go to the gym.  I can dress myself fashionably and pull over this slim fit hoodie over my workout attire on my way to the gym.  Its a nice quality and warm material that isn't bulky or thick like traditional hoodies.  The neckline is a v-neck, which is a nice difference from most hoodies as well.  Unlike most hooded shirts, this one does not have a drawstring around the the trim of the hoodie, which I love.  Since, I'm a mom to a little baby, extra handing cords, threads or drawstrings are something I try to avoid right now.The pullover hoodie is so comfortable to wear, it fits perfectly but if you want a loose fit, size up.  I wanted mine fitted as it showed here and ordered my normal size, but be sure to read their size chart to ensure you're getting the proper size for your measurements. It is perfect for this fall weather we have been having here in the Midwest lately.

"I love the shark steam mop! This is the second shark I've owned and I'm still a happy customer! The steam mop was really easy to set up and assemble on my own without needed directions. The bottom base has a reservoir for water, that when plugged in, will warm up and then release from the bottom to steam clean the floors. I use this on my hardwood floors as well as my ceramic tile.  If you pump the handle up and down a bit it will create more steam for the hard to clean areas on the floor. I love the mop and have been using it often.  Only thing is that it only comes with one mop pad.  I would've loved an extra one but it didn't have one with it.Purchased win my own money.

"I have a belly after having 3 kids and was afraid these high waist stretchy leggings would not look nice one me.  I  expecting them to be more of a liquid legging, but they're not they're a shiny thin fabric with a zippered waist.  I also was a bit weary of the one size, since I am not stick thin, I was afraid they would be too tight, they're actually quite comfortable.  They're not see through like some of the other leggings I have, but they're not thick and warm either.  They actually helped cinch my waist a bit and were really nice on.  I did wear a longer top so the zipper didn't show too much, but it didn't matter much to me about the zipper.  Also, I wore high waist under garments, the zipper can be cold and uncomfortable against my skin, so I wore something to cover it up and make it more comfortable to wear.

"We have so many Legos in our house that I constantly step on them doing the crazy dance across the living room holding my foot from stepping on one.  With that said, I'm still a sucker for Legos myself and love building things with my kids.  I wasn't exactly sure these would be the authentic Lego brand but they certainly were.  They came in a set of 100 which is a great addition to our Lego collection.  My kids have been playing with these Legos non stop since they came in.  The Legos come in an assortment of different colors, sizes, and shapes.  As stated before, they are indeed authentic and have the Lego logo written on the round raised ""peg"" like part on the Lego bricks.We have spent hours playing with them, they fit right into our existing collection of Legos.

"I have no pictures in my house since we just moved in not too long ago.  I needed to get some family pictures up in our home to be decorative while allowing up to have photos of our family up on our walls.  I have a very modern and sleek style to my home and was worried that this may be a cheap wooden frame like some of the ones I have owned over the years that break easily and need replacing often.  This certainly isn't the case.  The black wood frame have 7 slots that each holds a 4x6 photo perfectly.  They don't slide out or shift from the frame since each slot is separate from the other and they aren't flat next to one another, which I am so happy with.  The frame is VERY sturdy and well made.  It has the hanging hooks in the back on each end of the frame to allow you to hang it up either horizontally or vertically.

"As a parent to three children, I know all too well the mess that can become of my kids clothing after a meal.  Especially the messier meals such as spaghetti, that my kids request at least once a week.  I don't normally use bibs with my older toddlers, they don't want to feel like a baby, so these bibs with sleeves are the perfect solution.  They think they're wearing another shirt that when they're done I can easily remove it.The bibs come in a pack of two that are different colors.  One of the bibs is blue while the other bib is yellow.  They have sleeves which I love since my oldest son loves wiping his dirty face on his sleeves.  They tie in the back by the neck like an apron.  I don't tie them tight just in a bow to keep it on while they're eating their meals.  There is a pocket at the bottom of the bib that is supposed to work as a food catcher.  I have not found this to work well, so my kids use it as a little pocket to put their little toys in while they are eating.I have also used these as a smock to keep them clean when finger painting.  The cleanup was so much easier and I was able to wash their hands and then remove the bibs and clean them.  The best part...No dirty clothing covered in paint when wearing these bibs.  I can't believe I never used a bib with sleeves before this.

"My son is not crawling just yet, he is 4 months old, but he's very active.  He has been rolling around from stomach to back, and will be only a matter of time until he figures out how to go about doing back to stomach, then crawling.  In my old house where my older children grew up in, we had carpeting, so crawling wasn't a concern for them.  We moved a few months ago and our home is all hardwood and the kitchen is ceramic.  There is only one room in our home with carpeting.  When I saw these knee pads, I thought they were a bit funny looking at first, but then quickly realized they're going to be quite useful in our new home for him.The knee pads come in a pack of three sets (6 knee pads in total), with each set being a different color.  One set is blue, another is green, and the third set is pink.  I tested them out on the palms on my hands to see how padded they are.  They are comfortable and protected my skin and palms  when I tested them while crawling on my hands and knees.  I do wish they had gender options to allow me to choose boy colors, or girl colors or even a more gender neutral tone to them.  I have not washed them but these would be something I would hand wash and let them air dry.  They are like a sock material and are breathable material to not irritate his baby skin. I will definitely update my review once my son is crawling and used them for some time, for now i'm extremely happy with these knee pads and their quality.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UL8K35BSLQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CAXMUW#wasThisHelpful","R26UL8K35BSLQX","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My kids love slinky's and always get them tangled up and I'm out buying a new set of them.  I usually head to the dollar store, but the ones my dollar store carries now are metal, and with toddlers, I didn't feel they were as safe to play with as the plastic ones.  I searched numerous stores and didn't find any good quality ones that weren't made of sharp plastic at the ends.  Naturally, I searched on Amazon and I found this pack of three.  First, I was extremely happy that they came three in a pack.  I have two toddlers and a newborn, obviously the newborn wont be needing one, so I had a back up in case one of my toddlers tangled theirs up.  The slinky's are indeed the original Slinky Jr. brand, the set came in the three colors exactly as pictured: Red, Green, and Blue.  Again, my kids were beyond excited since their favorite colors are red and blue.They have been playing with the slinky for about a month, while they've tangled a bit, nothing to were they were extremely ruined and I couldn't fix.  The plastic is thick and good quality, not cheap dollar store plastic.  They're so much fun to watch them fall down the stairs, my boys have such a laugh with them.  The quality is great and love that its a pack of three.  It was a bit of a fight to let myself purchase these at nearly a $10 price point when I've primarily purchased Slinky's or off brand ones from the dollar store, but the quality definitely is worth the extra dollars.  My boys are so happy with their slinky's, making me a happy mommy!  Great buy and I'll be back buying more around Christmas time for stocking stuffers!!This was a personal purchase with my own money, I was in no way obligated to leave a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z13EAGCL3EZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BYB2C4#wasThisHelpful","R1Z13EAGCL3EZQ","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cardigan is much prettier in person!  I got the Mocha in an XL and it fits comfortably.  I normally wear a large, but I always like to size up for my cardigans and jackets because i'm very busty.  The cardigan is a nice, soft, stretchy material that is 94% rayon and 6% spandex.  It's lightweight and not thick and bulky which I love because I tend to get hot rather quickly and don't like having a huge thick cardigan on.  It has a tie waist that is attached onto the cardigan, exactly at my waist.  The tie is the perfect length and not too short or too long.  It adds a beautiful style, depending on how you tie it, to the front of the cardigan.  The sleeve length is a bit long for me, I don't have really long arms or chubby arms, but I don't mind the extra fabric, it does come to the middle of my hand and keeps my hands warn as well.  The front fabric on the cardigan drapes down in a really pretty asymmetrical style and the back falls straight without any bunching up like the front does.  The cardigan is made of quality fabric, its very flattering and hides my midsection, while giving me curves in the right places.  It comes down to the middle of my thigh from front and back.  Even though its a lightweight cardigan, it is also very warm for the fall months.  It was a bit wrinkled from the package, but a quick steam and I was ready to go!  I paired my mocha colored cardigan with dark wash jeans, a black tank top and over the knee black and brown boots.

I am trying to lose weight, so this will definitely be worn more next year when the summer rolls around again and I've lost more weight.The material is very soft and comfortable, it has two thin spaghetti straps to hold up the dress.

"Like any other parent of toddlers, I have an abundance of toddler plates that either have worked great or just sit in the cabinet and not get used.  Of course my sons both love the character plates that are usually plastic with some decal on it.  Well after multiple uses and cleaning by hand as well as the dishwasher, the decal bubbles up and starts go rip off.  What exactly is under there to make that decal adhesive, I have no idea? Is it safe for my toddler? Probably not, so I end up tossing them out.These plates are made of silicone with three sections. One larger section that is one half of the plate for the main course and two smaller sections that are the other half of the plate that are perfect for sides or dipping sauces. The plates come in a pack of three and are different colors The rims on the sides of the plates come up and keep things from falling out so easily. They're a bit heavier to handle then their plastic plates but these are definitely much better quality and perfect for my toddler boys to bring to the sink when they're done with their food. The plates wipe off and clean easily and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleaning.  We love these plates and it worked out perfectly that we have three kids and they are in a pack. They're also stackable which takes up less space in our cabinets, what more could I ask for? Overall, great plates that will last much longer than the plastic ones!Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXM0ULRVQQ4FV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108ZO44O#wasThisHelpful","RXM0ULRVQQ4FV","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate clutter so much, I have been organizing my shopping bags by putting them in a bigger bag for storage and hanging it behind my pantry door.  It wasn't ""pretty"" but it worked for the time being.  I kept saying I needed to find an alternative solution for these grocery bags and kept forgetting when I would be at the store.  This oval organizer has saved me from a door handle full of clutter.  I was able to fit so many bags in here that I was really impressed that the suction cups held up the organizer as well as it did.  I wasn't sure that I'd find a place to put the organizer since it is a bit bulky.  I certainly didn't want it suctioned it onto my refrigerator, or anywhere open to the public.  I tried the wall and they didn't stick (no surprise, but I tried!), so I tried the inside of my kitchen cabinets, and to my surprise it actually suctioned really well on the inside of the cabinet.  I did have to move some things aside for it to fit in without knocking things down or pushing them away.The Oval Organizer was easy to assemble.  I did think it could've been sturdier, but I still love it and works for exactly what I need it for, storing plastic shopping bags.  There are a variety of different hole sizes and you can pull from any slot not just the top.  This would also make a great way to store your light weight scarves.  You can easily see the colors and fabrics through the slots and pick which one you'd like.  Overall, I'm very happy with this organizer and how it helps me contain my clutter better than my DIY was helping me.  I have had this inside of my kitchen cabinet for a few days, and it has yet to fall off or loosen its suction even with opening and closing the cabinet multiple times.  This is such a useful organizer and can be used for so many different things, you honestly can't go wrong with this, you will LOVE it!Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R349ASTCSM7JFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QW0EN6O#wasThisHelpful","R349ASTCSM7JFY","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband loves drinking shakes after his workouts.  This shaker bottle is perfect for him to grab and go.  It has a rubberized grip that he says is great.  It also features a flip that secures closes and opens by simply tugging on it.  its an all black blender bottle that is slightly see through with the NutraFx logo on the front in gold.  The blender bottle includes a wire whisk ball that mixes up the shakes well before drinking.  My husband really likes that the bottle is somewhat see through.  Many other bottles that he owns aren't see through and can't see how much he has left in it.  there is also a convenient sport loop on the handle that secures the opening to drink from.  This is great to easily take your bottle with you on the go.  Its great for the gym, or a morning shake, meal replacements or even using it for a water bottle.

"My husband is a residential appraiser, he often has to take measurements of houses to ensure that the measurements are accurate.  Sometimes people update their homes and are up not updated in the system.  When a lender is giving out a mortgage, or doing a refinance, they often want to do an appraisal.  Depending on the scope of work they're looking for, my husband needed a good quality measuring tape.  I had bought a 25 foot one and it wasn't long enough, my mistake.  So he asked me to find a longer measuring tape that was also an engineer tape.  I set out on Amazon and found this measuring tape.  It accurately measures up to 33 feet and recoils back great.  It has a lock feature if he wants to lock the tape at his measurement until he can write it down.One downside is if any dirt or grime gets inside the tape, the recoil is affected by it. Just be sure to keep it clean and away from dirt and grime and you'll be very happy with this measuring tape.  The neon color of the tape is also highly visible in the night, although he isn't usually measuring houses parameters in the dark.  It has all the proper markings for an engineers tape and he's very happy with it.**Purchased this with my own money, I was in no way obligated to review this.

"This makeup brush set is one of the best that I own.  The bristles are so soft, yet give me a great application.  They do smell a bit like plastic which they mention as soon as you open the package.  Its easy to get rid of the smell by cleaning them before your first application.  I guess I may have been lucky and actually got 11 pieces in my set, I got an extra eye brush.  The brush set was easy to wash but the bristles did take long to dry.  They're handle is thick which I like, and no bristles fell out when I washed them.  The handles are black and silver and the bristles are black and grey.  I used them for liquid and powder foundation on different applications and I was able to achieve flawless applications with both liquid and powder.  I do use additional brushes to get my full face of makeup put on.  I'm a bit picky with my brushes and my application.  If you're looking for a full face brush set, you might want to add a few other brushes in the mix, like an eyebrow brush and a better blush brush. The quality is fantastic, and better than I expected.  These are not only great for personal use, but also professional use and would hold up really well.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BCFCC9GMS3TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOW827M#wasThisHelpful","R3BCFCC9GMS3TH","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got pregnant with my oldest son, I started to get bloated and retaining water.  My hands and feet would swell so horribly that even wearing my wedding bridal set was becoming uncomfortable.  That didn't stop me from wearing it, although I wish it did.  I ended up having my rings cut, and haven't gotten them fixed more than 4 years later.  I wanted to still wear a band or something on my finger, I was so used to wearing a ring that it felt so odd to have a bare finger.  I wore a band until recently when one of my diamonds fell out, talk about not having luck!I fell in love with this bridal set the second I laid eyes on it.  The picture looked beautiful and I couldn't wait to see it in person and wear it.  My real diamond wedding ring is also 1.5 ct with stones on the band, so I was able to see the size comparison which is perfect.  The center store is really pretty and glistens so beautifully.  The photos on here really don't show its elegance and beauty.  The ring has stones on the band on the top half of the ring.  The stones on the band are on all sides, the top and both sides, so whichever way you move your hand, you will have a beautifully, shining ring.  The bottom half is plain with no stones or design, but the gold plated ring shines without having any stones on it at all.  The bottom of the ring is also a bit flat towards the inside of your hand, which in my opinions makes it more comfortable then my real diamond ring.  The band has a little bit of a indentation on it that allows the ring with the center stone fit into it perfectly.  The ring to an untrained eye looks very real and ""believable"".  If I didn't know it was a CZ ring set, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if it was real or not.  It is and 18kt gold plated ring with rhodium to keep from tarnishing.  It is simply beautiful and I am so excited to finally be able to wear a bridal set again.  One day I'll actually get my ring fixed, but until then, I'll happily wear these rings and none will be the wiser.  If you're one that is likely to lose jewelry, not wanting to wear your real jewelry on vacation, or just someone who would rather save money on a ring and splurge on a new home or your honeymoon, I highly recommend this beautiful set.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWRCTSYPN03Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHREMSA#wasThisHelpful","R1TWRCTSYPN03Y","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally carry a cross body purse for everyday use.  While I love how lightweight the cross body bags are, they lack room for me to put more than my wallet and keys inside.  This leaves me with few necessities that I'd like to have on hand.This purse is big but not huge.  It's a normal sized tote bag with a nice leather tan finish.  There are two thin straps that allow you to wear on your arm, shoulder or carry by the handles. The inside of the bag is spacious with lots of room for much more things than just my keys and wallet.  I can toss in a few beauty products for touch ups throughout the day without hoping to make the zipper bust open like I do with my cross body bags.  The top of the bag has a zipper closure.  I own a similar designer brand purse that looks similar but the top has a magnetic closure.  The zipper works well, doesn't get stuck and slides with ease.  This far exceeds the magnetic button and how it helps me by having a zipper. If my purse tips over in the car I don't worry about finding everything that's fallen out.There are also a few pockets inside the bag for extra organization.

"My boys are ages 2 and 4 and are the typical kids who love having their night lights to keep ""monsters"" away.  Regardless the numerous times I have told them that monsters don't exist, the dark is scary to them and so we use night lights to show them there isn't anything scary in their room.  The Abco Tech ocean wave night light projector is so cool.  My kids love the light and how cool it looks.  The projector gives an image of an ocean like effect onto the ceiling.  It projects the ocean image with movement alternating colors of red, blue, and green, as well as a mix of the three colors.  You're able to choose the setting that you would like and it will stay active for an hour, so no need to get up and turn it back on.  My kids usually fall asleep within the first 15-20 minutes of being in bed.  The unit is white with a clear cover to allow it to project.The projector is really nice on its own, it doesn't necessarily have to be used in a child's bedroom.  This could be used for relaxation as well and I can also plug in my iPhone with the AUX cable provided and the internal speakers in the projector will play music. I play some soothing music and can lay down and relax or meditate.  I like to play the ocean sounds to give the effect of a real ocean or wave sound.  Its really soothing and a great night light projector.  It covers a good portion of the ceiling and some of the side of the wall since its usually on a table or nightstand and not in the center of the room.  My sons room ceiling could probably be covered entirely with the projector if it was centered in the middle of the room.One downfall would be that the cord is fairly short.  I could of course use an extension cord, but I hate having extra wire and cluttering up a room.  The projector can also be used with batteries, but I usually use an outlet, I wouldn't have enough batteries to keep this on for as long as we do.  I haven't tried that feature yet, but its a great option in the events of a power outage, we wont have kids who are terrified at night.  The lights are beautiful and captivating.  My sons love this and so do I, on the rare occasions that I'm able to use it.Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1S3S4A63AX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKRU3UI#wasThisHelpful","RJ1S3S4A63AX3","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using a shower chair for quite a few years.  Ever since I was in a major car accident, standing or walking for long periods of time are hard on me.  We recently moved and my shower chair unfortunately broke in our move. My old chair was a chair style and a bit bigger and bulkier.  To replace it, I got this shower stool.  It doesn't have a back support which I didn't think was a big deal since I'm not usually in the shower for hours.  The stool was extremely easy to assemble on my own with no help from anyone. It comes in three big pieces, two legs and the stool chair. The legs adjust to your desired height to make it comfortable for you.  The chair is much smaller and easier to take in and out of the bathtub. It has helped me a ton with not being able to stand for long periods of time and I'm in the shower.  It is much safer for me to use in the shower and I don't have to worry about getting tired from standing and toppling over, which has happened.  The top of the shower stool is white and the legs are metal with rubber grips on the bottom to keep it from slipping.  It's also very easy to clean with warm soapy water and a rinse.Not only is this a great help for me when i'm in the shower, my sons, who are toddlers, also love this stool.  My husband gives them haircuts, and they always want to sit on mommy's stool to get their haircut.  This is a much better way to get them to want a haircut compared to them running around not wanting one at all, which used to be the case.  I can adjust the height of the chair to be suitable for them to hop off and on and be at a good height for my husband to also be able to cut their hair.Overall, this chair is perfect, small, and easy to clean.  I couldn't ask for a better shower stool! I highly recommend it for anyone with back, and leg problems as well as pregnant women.  I wish I had this stool during all my pregnancies to sit and get my feet up for once!

They are a pack of four ribbed tanks in a variety of colors. They are mostly bright colored and perfect for summer.  Our pack had pink, coral, white, and grey.The only con I would have to say is the random selection. While I got these for my sister, had they been for myself I'd likely have wanted to choose which colors or pick a pack of options like neutral tones as an option for basics in your wardrobe.

"These are not exactly what I would call yoga pants, they're definitely leggings and are thin material.  They're shiny and see through, I can see my entire leg through the entire pant and backside.  Now I did give these pants a good rating for a few reasons.  First, they're very comfortable to wear, even though they're small, they are still quite comfortable when I have them on.  They don't have a tight elastic around the waistband like leggings do but the fold over waist band that most yoga pants have.  I actually don't like how the yoga pants look folded over, the band is not as wide as I'd like it to be.  Secondly, they're a good length on me and not too long or short.  Lastly,  the pants are a breathable and comfortable material for working out.  I do think these are better suited for petite women or juniors.

"I am large busted and have a lot of trouble finding comfortable bras.  I'm a 38D/DD depending on how ""full"" I am the cup size grows.  I went according to the size chart and ordered a L/XL, which fit me perfectly.  I am currently nursing my 3 month old son and this bra is extremely comfortable as well as supportive.  I got the black bra and it is perfect for nursing both during day and night.  I personally prefer to not wear a bra at night which is horrible when nursing and hurts so bad, but all of the nursing bra's I own weren't comfortable to wear during the night so I opted to not wear one, until now.The bra has a eye and hook closure in the back that is wide and comfortable and not just a thin strap in the back.  The nursing bra is also a stretchy fabric that makes it perfect for early on breastfeeding when your breast size changes drastically.  The straps have a hook like most nursing bras to open the panel and allow for nursing.  One thing I didn't like is that its a one panel bra, so once its unhooked, you're left a bit exposed.  Its hard to nurse publicly with the bra because of the one panel.  The bra also has no padding, so you're a bit exposed in that department as well.  Your nipple does show through a bit when you're wearing this bra.  Personally I use this bra at home and at night, so this isn't a huge issue for me.  The bra is very comfortable and a nice breathable material even during the summer months.  I really love the fabric and quality of this bra, I just wish it had a bit of padding to give me a bit more coverage.Another thing that completely amazed me was that the bra came with reusable heart shaped breast pads as well as some disposable ones. I did not see that mentioned but was great to be able to use in the bra to help hide the nipple. They also provided a sample nipple cream and I loved all of them. They put great care into their products and loved being able to test out their other products as well with the freebie samples they provided.Promotional discount provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Z4OGD18NG37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QL4DS80#wasThisHelpful","R9Z4OGD18NG37","A3TPOVIABNALVF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TPOVIABNALVF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have tried all three cables and each one of them charges my phone to a full charge within the same amount of time as my other original cable did.

"I love this two layer lunch box! It has two sides, one for a larger portion meal such as a sandwich.  This larger area had a cover that snaps into place. Now it's definitely not waterproof or sealed shut so I don't recommend anything like soups or with a liquid in them to be used inside this lunch box.  The other side of the lunch box has no cover but two separate compartments. One compartment is larger and is 2/3 of the container and the other compartment is 1/3 of the container.When packing lunch I can place everything in one container which is so convenient and keeps me from packing multiple containers. The lunch box folds to be a large cube.  It holds a good amount of food for lunch including snacks and sides.

"My son is three months old and has already begun teething.  He is constantly putting his hands in his mouth and gnawing on anything that can give him relief.  I love wearing jewelry and with an infant it's not really possible, they tend to grab and pull with all their force.  Their grip is pretty strong so I alway fear they'll snap my fine jewelry items, so I don't wear them anymore.  I still love costume jewelry that I wouldn't care if they broke, until I found teething jewelry.  Fashionable and functions for a dual purpose of helping my son teethe.This silicone baby teething necklace is great quality and beautiful looking.  It is an ivory and mint green color necklace with a matching mint bracelet.  The necklace beads are knotted individually to keep them from pinching a baby between each bead and also from unraveling all the beads.

"It seems like a great product, when it works. Unfortunately that's only once, for two of them I've had. The first one I got only worked once, then the UV light would no longer illuminate, since the first day. I could monitor it draining the batteries on my fluke, slowly, until they went well below 1v from 1.62v - no UV.. The second one I got would light up everytime I closed the lid, however it would never stop. It would keep the UV light on until the batteries died, which was about 2hrs (instead of the ~5min it should run for). Essentially every single time I wanted to use this I had to replace the batteries.. I don't think I'll try for a third, I've already wasted 10x AAA batteries testing and trying to get these to work as expected. There's a lot of DOA's and early failures for this unit, perhaps it's a recent manufacturing change, I don't know. They need to fix their QC or engineering of this product/manufacturing process. I gave it two stars *extremely* generously, because IF it does work - it's probably? great.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QCBCR7ANEQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI9WW9Y#wasThisHelpful","R21QCBCR7ANEQX","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I originally purchased this off Amazon they had the wrong item in stock and three times shipped me a 26700-312-LED microscope stand.. However I think they corrected this problem now (and updated the listing), I ended up returning all of them and ordering directly from the manufacture.The 26502-LED is awesome! I replaced an older 90led magnifying lamp I had that the LED circuitry died on and I definitely like this more for several reasons :1) It has an actual brand name.2) It has a one year warranty (the other had none).3) The LED's are SIGNIFICANTLY brighter. This one I measured at 9.2w, the other was 5.8w.4) The LED is a much more pure white color temperature @ 4786k. The other is noticably more bluish probably around 5500-6000k.5) The lens seems higher quality, the ""edges"" dont seem as distorted (apart from their convex nature) as the other one.6) It comes with a free swing away 5x diopter lens that sits on top the main 5x lens, which doubles the magnification. This is extremely useful for reading fine print on IC's.7) All parts are replaceable from a manufacture who ships within 24hrs. Clamps, LED lights, power supply, etc.8) The top does NOT get as hot as the other one after a few hours of use, uses an external dc adapter.9) The clamp is a bit stronger holding (although read below).10) It has an open slot towards the front end of the magnifying lamp that aids in quick and easy pulling and moving around.The only thing I really don't like about this and from what I can tell it's true with all magnifying clamp lights. Is the clamp itself. This is a metal clamp with a plastic jacket over the top. The screw that applies pressure can easily bend the 1/8"" metal theyre using as a base, which doesnt really allow you to get a ""max"" tightness. As a result in extreme extended positions there is some movement of the clamp. If it were me I wouldve designed a wider clamp with two screws instead of one and a thicker metal that didnt bend as easy. Maybe some day I'll get around to modding it.I'm an engineer and intend to use this nearly everyday, so I definitely think it was worth the extra money for the extra quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V4HLS3COBQSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQG47TW#wasThisHelpful","R2V4HLS3COBQSW","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this then shortly after received a Contigo Autoseal West Loop Stainless Steel Travel Mug with Open-Access Lid as a gift.Comparing the two this one has it's pros: -This keeps coffee hot a good 1+ hours longer then the Contigo, lasting a good 4-6hrs depending on external temperature, how often it's opened, and the temperature of the liquid. If you like to let your coffee cool down before drinking it - poor it in a different mug first! -It also fits under my Keurig K60/K65 Special Edition Single Serve Coffee Maker without problem, where the 20oz Autoseal does not (I'm sure the 16oz Contigo would fit no problem). -The base of this is narrower at 2 1/2in, vs the 2 7/8 of the Autoseal, which might matter if you have small cup holders. -It seals tight and never leaks, just like the Autoseal. Never had a problem with either.It also has it's cons: -The lid on this one is awkward, it's smooth with nothing really to grab on to, and has an extremely tight fit. Opening it takes more hand strength then a coffee mug ever should. The Auto seal has a rubber edge on the lid and an oblong button protruding that gives you great grip for easy opening. -The open/close mechanism on the lid requires you to kid of stick your pointer finger in  the lid and push it, then move your hand back to a natural drinking grip. The Autoseal has a thumb button so you don't have to move your hand out of a natural drinking position to open/close it, making it easier and more comfortable. -The autoseal is 20oz where this model is only available in 16oz. -More difficult to take the lid apart and clean it thoroughly then the Autoseal, in my opinion.So it definitely is a great mug and depending on your needs may or may not be the better option. I prefer the Autoseal usually, however this gets used by someone in our house very frequently.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJ908WEA2E0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PY7AYS#wasThisHelpful","RWJ908WEA2E0E","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These gloves are great! I've worn them everyday this winter when going outside pretty much. When I go to my car, work or grocery store, I have these on. They're very warm and very comfortable. I can wear them down to probably 10-20f by themselves, without needing another glove on top (unless I'm outside for very long periods of time without any activity). They're not great in high winds, but the wool in them makes them very warm otherwise.The touch screen pointer and thumb are very useful, and I've never had any issues using a small touch screen (like a phone) likewise works well with car head unit touchscreen, alarm panel touchscreen, tablets, etc. The size was a bit off I think: I usually wear a small and even with Outdoor Research Sensor gloves small fit me well - however with these I had to return the small for a medium. The fingers were too short for my fingers, but otherwise fit decently. I've had a few other glove liners and these are probably the warmest I have (although more thick), they fit well underneath Mechanix and Youngstown gloves, and give you the extra warmth you need to work down to 0. I definitely recommend these for anyone wanting a daily winter glove that's not bulky and works with touch devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VL060EF8BVQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WP7SN2#wasThisHelpful","R1VL060EF8BVQZ","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fun concept, and other chemical type education sets are generally a good educational toy. This however provided little education, and left us with a cheap not-so-impressed feeling. The test tube holder itself is rather flimsy and not useful. The tests themselves are cheap, like gelatin crystals and food coloring, hydrophobic sand, dinosaur sponge you put in water to grow, fake snow mixing, and color dye on beads. My son loved them, but we also went through all of them in about 3 days (trying to drag it out as long as possible). Then the fun was over, the experiments aren't repeatable/reusable, and my son really learned nothing. The instructions were sometimes vague and incorrect, and the short explanation paragraphs didn't really help explain why such reactions occur.

"I bought these mainly to put in emergency kits, and to keep around the house when the power goes out (frequently). These so far have worked great. They burn evenly and completely, all the ones I've timed have lasted anywhere from 3.75-4.5hrs. We have some cheaper tealights left that we got  from targets, and they dont last anywhere near as long (they arent filled to the top with wax). I'd say 2 - 3hrs is a stretch for the cheap ones.

"This the best screen protector I've ever come across, hands down. I've been using screen protectors for over 5 years, starting with the G1. I've probably gone through 5-10x a year, most were really cheap ones from China. I always figured all screen protectors were made the same, so why pay more? THEY ARE NOT!  After I got my S4, I picked up some [Neo HD Crystal] JL31.6 Samsung Galaxy S4 Screen Protector - Premium Japanese Film - 3 Pack - Lifetime Replacement - Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, International, and Unlocked - Screen Protector Cover for Galaxy S IV SIV i9500 2013 Model. I went through all 3 (I think one failed to apply correctly), within 4 months. When I tried to find information to claim on the ""lifetime warranty"" I found it was impossible to contact the manufacturer.. Then I found these..1) These apply so much easier then any other screen protector I've had. Usually about 1 in 3 at best of the ""cheap"" screen protectors fail to get applied correctly. Either for a piece dust that you cannot work out, an air bubble that cant be worked out, etc. These apply smoothly with almost no air bubbles, and if there are any they push out so easily. It's really amazing the difference in applications between these and all other screen protectors I've ever seen.2) This is much thicker then most cheap screen protectors. Yet crystal clear and very touch sensitive. This gives a much better layer of screen protection. I have had a scratch get through a cheap/thin protector on my N1. I do not worry about that with these.3) This doesn't come up on the corners or under the bottom home button. Cheap protectors frequently have problems with small runs like under the home button, or sharp corners up top by the speaker bar. This adheres perfectly. I have a tight fitting car dock, that will occasionally peel up a corner of the screen protector if I don't pay attention when putting it in. I can easily just push it back down with this screen protector and it re-adheres no problem - another thing you won't see with cheap protectors.4) Lifetime warranty that is easy to claim. Me and my wife both have S4, after we scratched a couple protectors and wanted to replace them after a couple months, we emailed the manufacturer and they very painlessly sent us out another 3 pack the next day. No fuss, no excuses needed, amazing service.Out of probably dozens of different screen protectors I've ever tried - I will never try another again. These are simply the best in every way, and couldn't imagine saving a few bucks to get a cheaper one (especially when you work out the lifetime replacement over the course of a couple years). I cannot highly recommend these enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M57TJGEI2F7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT7RAPG#wasThisHelpful","R1M57TJGEI2F7E","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

IE crank it for 5-10 minutes, or let it sit outside in at least 8hrs of sunlight. Afterwards plug it into your phone and give it 5-10 minutes to transfer the charge. I was able to get about 10% battery off an older blackberry after a good battery charge via the solar panel in about 8hrs outside.

"This is by far the best wheel cleaner I've ever used. I've used both Meguiar's, Mother's and Chemical Guys. They all worked decently, I tend to prefer the Meguiar's Hot Rims over the rest; however it doesn't come close to how well this works. With 4 piston brembo calipers and hawk hps pads, my Evo's brakes spew out a TON of dust onto my wheels. It's a constant battle to keep them somewhat clean. If I let it sit on there too long and gather more road gunk, it was impossible to get off with Meguiar's (or anything else) alone, and would require scrubbing (sometimes with a harsh/dangerously hard bristled) brush. Not anymore! This cuts through caked on rims even after a couple months of horrible neglect.You might need to use two passes with it, depending how hard caked the gunk is. My advise is:-First spray the wheels with my meguiars soap and pressure wash them to get off as much as possible before applying this.-If you have a light cleaning (usually less then a couple weeks for my car), then you can get by with spraying two rims at a time. If you're going to have to scrub some of the gunked on mess it's probably best to do one rim at a time. Spray your rim(s) generously getting in your inner rim if possible, your lug nuts, etc.-The liquid will come out kind of greenish and then turn an orangish/redish as it breaks down brake dust. It has a very strong (like cat urine) odor that you just have to get used to.-Let it sit on there for a couple of minutes (usually don't want more then 5). You don't want it to dry on the rim, although having accidentally done this - it washed off no problem.-If it's a light cleaning you can probably get by with just pressure washing it clean at this point, although to make sure you get all parts of the rims I usually go over it with Griot's Garage 15704 Micro Fiber Wheel Wand, (Pack of 2). If the caked on mess requires harder scrubbing I'd recommend something like autogeek's ""speed master wheel brush"".This bottle usually last about 16 individual wheel cleanings. It makes it the most expensive option out there, but by far the best and safest! It is acid free and ph balanced, and is specifically designed to be safe on all rims. I use this on BBS, Enkei, and WedsSports rims that cost over 1000-1500/per, all the time. I have no worry that this can in any way danger them. A lot of other products out there can be a hit or miss, and especially if you have refinished rims it can be very risky. My BBS are refinished and so far this has not worn it off or damaged them whatsoever. If you're looking for a bit cheaper solution, there's Sonax 230500 Yellow Wheel Cleaner to use as a refill. You can also checkout autogeek, depending on their sales, coupon codes, and shipping situation - you can usually find a better deal there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3QG42DDWJW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UT3S6Q#wasThisHelpful","R2M3QG42DDWJW7","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this pink bottle for my sister to carry around in her car/purse. I've bought a couple of the dual packs in black for myself over the years, and they've all held up fine. They have roughly a 4 year shelf life. I test fired a bottle after about 4 years that had been sitting in my car the whole time (through extreme heats and cold), and it fired no problem. To note: most compressed gasses recommend not storing in temperature above 120, cars in parking lots in the summer here can definitely get much hotter then that. It also recommends not letting it get below freezing, but mine definitely saw temperatures down to -20f. To date, I've never had any pepper spray stored in any of my cars fail or vent. I don't necessarily recommend it, as the manufacturers obviously don't, just stating it's held up in non-recommended environments no problem.This shoots a pretty chunky stream of pepper spray about 6-8feet. Good for up close and precise situations. I've never had to rely on pepper spray in a threatening situation, but I do keep one in each of my cars, and I keep a couple bottles around the house (larger Sabre bottles) for intruders.

"I hated how whenever I went somewhere and went to sat down (car, restaurant, work, theatre, etc) the first thing I'd do is take out my wallet and tuck it between my legs or put it on the table - just because I couldn't stand sitting on it. Finally I don't need to! This wallet is so thin, I can sit on it at work, out to eat, and it not really bother me. I still occasionally do remove it, but I think that's more of habit. I find myself VERY frequently not realizing it's still in my back pocket, where that NEVER happened to me with my previous leather.This wallet empty and not compressed at the end is less than 0.25"" thick. My old Dockers ""small"" leather bifold - 0.75"" thick. Fully packed with about the same contents, my leather wallet was about 1-1.25"" thick, where this is about 0.5"".

This wallet has 4x card slots, one with a window for a license. In each card slot you can easily fit 3, perhaps 4 cards that allow easy removal. The billfold section has a divider (that to be honest they could probably loose and shave off another mm in the size). The quality and stitching of this wallet seems to be well done. After 6 months of assaulting it, there's no sign of wear, fading, stitching coming undone, or any foreseen problems.My ""slim"" Dockers leather wallet did have more storage potential. It could hold about 18x cards, plus had 3 slots behind the card flaps. The problem with it is in between every card slot was a thick piece of leather end. Thick leather binding and stitching everywhere just made it unnecessarily obese (like most leather wallets). This is all nylon construction, seems to be just as durable, and at a significant size reduction!I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good thin wallet they can actually carry around and sit on without feeling like there's a brick in your back pocket.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Z3K4IZDFK3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VBOI80#wasThisHelpful","R9Z3K4IZDFK3H","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for a double wall insulated drinking cup mainly for cold drinks in a hot and humid home. I got tired of sweat and constantly nasty/sticky coasters. I went through a couple glass versions, the Ozeri and Bodum. Both were very weak and ended up breaking rather quick. They both did work well at keep drinks cool and glasses sweat free though. A buddy of mine recommended these - as he had been using for years. He threw one hard against the floor to demonstrate and it just bounced. I was sold.In comparison to the Ozeri and Bodum : It keeps drinks colder MUCH longer. I can keep a handful of icecubes somewhat solid for 4hrs in this cup at ambient indoor temperatures. In relation to sweating - it does sweat a bit more then the Ozeri did for some reason, maybe it's because I couldn't compare them side by side since I broke all the Ozeri before I had a chance. As far as durability there's no question these will stand up to just about anything. And if they ever do break - Tervis will replace them for free. I know someone who had one fall off his truck at ~60mph, it broke clean in two pieces, he called Tervis and they sent him a new one no problem.These are great if you have kids, clumsy adults, guests, and if you like keeping your drinks cold and your furniture sweat-ring free! They are a bit pricey considering they're just plastic. However these are definitely 4 cups I intend to have for a lifetime. Maybe I can justify buying another 4 in a year.I can't highly recommend these enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AMTX59WG4WMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0051U9D5M#wasThisHelpful","R2AMTX59WG4WMV","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best thermal paste I've ever come across. It can be difficult to apply and manage sometimes, but if you get it on there correctly - it should yield you the best thermal reduction results.I usually like to microwave a cup of hot water and get it near boiling, then throw this in there for a few minutes. It comes out and spreads a lot better when it's warmed up. After it's warmed up I like applying  a small ""square"" in the middle and maybe just a few dabs around the sides to make sure the whole top will be covered. A lot of people just do a blind round bead in the middle, but I've taken off plenty of heatsinks done by this method where the paste was not completely covering the chip cover, and in a lot of cases causing it to overheat. Usually with the bead I see either too much where it squeezes over the sides, or not enough where corners or edges have none on it.After you get the hang of applying this it does seem to have a ""curing"" period, after a day you should start to see your temperatures drop by at least a few degrees. I usually keep a tube of this and ArcticSilver on hand. This for any of my personal builds, chipsets, cpus, gpu's, etc. I usually apply this to anything I buy that comes with heatsink, even if I plan on using the original cooler. Then the ArcticSilver is good for any cheap build I'm doing for someone else. The price of this does make it somewhat prohibitive - you'll get a good 10-15 applications out of this tube maybe. Usually it's about 2-3x as expensive as ArcticSilver 5. However depending on what you're using it on, you should see at least 3-5c temperature reduction at idle (which is a lot - especially when squeezing overclocks), and slightly more at max load. Of course your results will vary based on your chip, case, cooling method, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4GZCEJF1JMAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042IBAOG#wasThisHelpful","R4GZCEJF1JMAJ","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I pretty much type all day, but do a lot of high dexterity physical work on the weekends/nights (ie working on cars, soldering, building whatever, climbing, hiking, etc). This not only keeps my hands strong, and hoping to ward off arthritis, it is also a pleasant break for my hands after hours of programming.

"I bought this for a Linux HTPC build. This works great at HD video playback, never had any issues with video playback, artifacts, scan lines, tears, etc. In addition it can even play some basic games, like Source Engine based games. FPS on medium settings generally stay at or around 30fps (occasional dip). This is my first personal APU build and I was fairly impressed with this little guy, it did better then most cheap (<100$) video cards would've done. When it came to compiling (I use Gentoo) it kept up pretty well as well. In single threaded compiling against against a 4.7ghz 1100t it was about 10% slower. Of course you throw 4 parallel jobs at it and you're looking at least 25% slower. This card DOES get hot though. And by hot - I don't know why they included that crappy - not even piped heatsink with it. I threw on the heatsink with the heat pipes that came with my 1100t and it dropped the temps a good 10c (to about 40c) at idle, 15-20 at load (about 70c). It overclocks okay, I played around with it on my Asus motherboard and was able to squeeze about 200mhz more out of it without bumping up the cpuv or temps that much. Unfortunately since I have a really small console case in an entertainment center heat is a concern. Perhaps if I work out a small corsair water cooling system in there I could squeeze some more speed out of it. All in all, for the price and what it is designed to do - I am very happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36AORZ6AAWDMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPLGGXM#wasThisHelpful","R36AORZ6AAWDMF","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Built a Gentoo HTPC with MythTV. This board coupled with an A10-6800k plays HD movies over the onboard HDMI no problem. It can also play some light games, like Source Engine games. It's a great small build, the entire system draws about 120w when playing a game. All hardware on this board worked as expected; although there's no support for the boards fan controllers on the current Kernel, I hope that'll change in the future. You can use the BIOS fan controller if you want to try to keep noise to a minimum. In a thin console based chassis this board and cpu also stay surprisingly cool in an open entertainment center (I don't recommend the stock CPU cooler). Asus quality, warranty, price, and engineering always makes them the best in my book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DG2DKXX38XZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F1DTLM#wasThisHelpful","R1DG2DKXX38XZ5","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The energy drink. This is by far the best energy drink every created, I first had it well over a decade ago. It was much harder to come by then and for the past decade, unless you paid an arm and leg on ThinkGeek (with shipping). Amazon makes it very reasonable with Subscribe and Save, you can get them less then 1.50/can which is pretty much cheaper then you'll find any kind of energy drink locally.I have tried nearly every other energy drink I've ever come across and there is by far none as good tasting and as good acting as this one. Rockstar Fruit Punch is probably my next favorite, then AMP, and then everything else is equally disgusting. For Bawls - I like the cherry and original fairly equally, I go back and forth which I prefer that day. My favorite is probably the G33k B33r, however it's only sold in glasses and is very expensive (also not available on amazon prime).I definitely recommend this for anyone who loves, and frequently consumes energy drinks.

I also really like Cliff bars, and I usually alternate between the two depending on the mood I'm in.

"I had the original g700 since it came out 4 years ago. About 6 months ago after constantly dealing with the double click bug and dissembling to fix it every few weeks, I decided to upgrade to the new version. It's pretty much the same with a few distinct differences:1) The coating on the top and side thumb area. I can get very sweaty, and my sweat is very acidic. I usually burn holes through the finish on keyboards and on mice. On my last g700 I had worn off all the thumbpad area material, to where it was just completely smooth. Likewise the top got the finish worn off and just became very smooth and annoying. So far after 6 months of use, there's no sign of this same issue (was definitely showing after 6mo of use on the original g700).2) It can opperate with just the USB cable plugged in, and not need the wireless adapter. My g700 required the usb wireless adapter plugged in, even when using the usb charging cable.3) 8200dpi vs the 5700dpi on the g700 original.I use linux and in order to program the buttons and setup the profiles I used a Window VM in VirtualBox - and it works great for programming this. Once you configure the mouse you don't need their application or anything running as all of it is stored on the mouses internal rom. I don't really MMO (aside from occasional STO), but I do work and program heavily with this mouse. I find it very convenient to program key combinations to buttons, such as shift+insert, ctrl+f, ctrl+v, etc. It has 4 buttons on the side and 4 up top (plus 1 for the wheel scroll selector). I use two of the buttons up top to cycle through DPI settings on a profile, and another to cycle through the profiles themselves (which change the mapping). Depending on what I'm doing I try to keep the DPI and poll settings down as much as possible to conserve battery life. I use http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009H5VVM/ batteries, and can easily get 72hrs on a fairly aggressive profile with a good 12+hrs of use a day.I definitely recommend this mouse to anyone in need of a good quality gaming or productivity mouse. It is highly configurable, it is very well weighted (although if they added weight options it would be better), fits very comfortably in ones hand, and is reasonably priced. I'm not sure if they used the same buttons on the g700s as the g700, as I've yet to disassemble this one. However I'm hoping they at least came from a newer and more string quality controlled batch, so they don't suffer the same fate as my last (and a lot of other peoples) Logitech mice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12YNIMUM8ZWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFOEY3Y#wasThisHelpful","R12YNIMUM8ZWL","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm almost 30 and still have Acne like I'm 13. I also have generally oily skin, that is sensitive. I've been trying various washes over the past fews years, and so far this is the best I've come across. It's not that harsh on my skin, doesn't leave it overly red, and doesn't effect it's  sensitivity afterwards. It does a GREAT job at getting rid of acne building that's already there, and actually preventing it. I can occasionally go a day or so without a shower, and no longer worry about the previously inevitable breakout as a result. This is the same thing as http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B118D6A which I bought when I ran out of my first bottle. After 6 months I'm still very impressed with this product and will continue to use.

"This is the most comfortable respirator mask I've ever put on. It is very easy to put on and to pull down the 6 straps to get it nice and secure. The medium fits my build well, I'm about 5'8 140lbs, hat size I'm usually between a Medium and Large, head is about 22.5"". I also have at times a pretty thick/long beard. If you've never worn a facemask and are concerned what your size is, try to find one locally to try on first. You should be able to put your hand over the exhaust flap (taking off the cover) and exhale slowly and feel the mask lift forward as its pressurized, without hearing or feeling any leaks. I also really like the straps they are very soft (yet strong) and comfortable, and the back plate it uses is much more comfortable then most masks there. The nose/mouth cuff is also really comfortable and even after hours of work in it, I have no discomfort. It stays reasonably cool, it's obviously going to get a little warm with a face mask on but I've never had to take it off because of it. Likewise I don't really have a problem with sweat or fog building up inside of it.I use this for paint spraying, general painting, cleaning with solvents, dusting/drywall work, and insulation work. It obviously works great for all of those duties and have never had a single issue with it. If you get paint or and chemical on it the included scotchguard treatment beads it up and it rolls off no problem. I use primarily 6001, p95, and p100 filter cartridges with this and it works well.I definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a good respirator and want or require the additional benefit of eye protection and a full face mask. It's not really a con because I don't think any face mask could properly seal, but just to note, you cannot wear prescription eyeglasses with this on. However they do sell spectacle kits FF-400-20 that mount glasses on your nose cuff. Contacts work well for me, when needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OD2BURB83PUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009POIVWG#wasThisHelpful","R1OD2BURB83PUE","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two other torque wrenches that are getting old, and neither are accurate below 25ft-lbs. So I bought this mainly for that range of usage. The instructions state that it's accuracy is within 2% when you're over 20% it's max rated load (almost 12ft-lbs). There are some situations where you need lower torque then that, mainly with small interior bolts, and possibly some spark plugs on aluminum heads. It's still able to set below the 12ft-lbs, it's just not guaranteed to be within 2% accurate.Another good use for this is, if your torque wrench lets you calibrate it, you can use this against it and bring some life back into older torque wrenches (which in my experience start to go out of calibration after a couple years of use).It's pretty easy and self explanatory to use. When you reach your set torque it will beep and let you know, it's loud enough that I can hear it no problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35CHUUZIYWV5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VYUKTC#wasThisHelpful","R35CHUUZIYWV5V","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a very strong Golden, who's only about 70lbs by himself, but has broken a couple durable chains in the past. So far I haven't had any issues with this. Although I generally don't let him lead me or get to a point where I might have this strength tested, when the inevitable does happen it holds him back no problem. The locking mechanism on it is standard, haven't had any problems with it. If I had to due it again I'd probably get the 26 foot version of this for a few bucks more. When theres a couple feet of snow on the ground, id rather walk to a point out back and let him get further out to find a nice place to do his business.  With 16 feet I have to walk around too close to him, which he also doesn't like.

Even the outdoor ones are holding strong 6 months later, no sign of them becoming brittle and cracking (had this problem with cheap ties). They're easy to cut off or trim down, and are slim so they can be easily hidden, and a neutral whitish color.

"I bought this to replace my cheap ebay pocket tripod. This may be a bit expensive for something of it's size, but it's definitely worth it. I can use this on a Canon T2i with a tamron 250mm lens attached and it keeps the camera steady and in the set position. My last two mini tripods could not handle that kind of top-heavy of a camera/lens. It's very sturdy metal, and I have no doubt it will last for many years. It also comes with a velcro strap, which is very handy when doing solo shots outdoors. Depending where and how long I'm going to be on the trail I either bring the T2i or my powershot s95, and it's great to use the strap to wrap it around a tree and get a great self portrait or just a still shot of the scenery.

"I was blown away with how well these worked on my John Deere D105. Usually if my grass is too tall with the OEM JD blades, I'd have to make two passes to actually get the grass to cut (otherwise there'd be large uncut parts everywhere), and then looking over it afterwards there was visible grass clippings everywhere (with the JD mulcher attached). I waited after I got these for an extra week to install then cut my grass, so needless to say it was VERY long. I ran the mower at my standard low ""3"" setting, and on the first pass, I didn't have ANY uncut grass patches, and I saw virtually no grass clippings! I was blown away honestly. These seem to do a much better job at creating a vacuum and pulling up the grass even when a bit wet, so you don't end up with taller patches. As well it seems to cut the grass much finer so you don't end up with nearly as much of waste on your lawn. These lasted a whole year of use without any issue. I will probably sharpen them this year, although they would function for a while without needing to do so, but it should only improve the efficiency. I definitely recommend these blades if you don't like your OEM JD blades, and are looking to get rid of uncut patches and large/visible clippings leftover (note - I also recommend a mulcher block off plate if you don't have one).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPG3563194N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018U25SQ#wasThisHelpful","R2YPG3563194N9","A14Z6D3IRJ23F7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14Z6D3IRJ23F7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I try to do cardio a few times a week, and I wanted to monitor my heart rate and track my progress to see if my heart rate is getting to lower limits. I used to have high blood pressure (quitting smoking changed that) and when I fell out of shape I would get dangerously high heart rates when doing any heavy workouts. This has really helped me track my progression, and at times let me see when I need to calm down for a few minutes. This is a very comfortable strap, I can wear it for a couple hours no problem.

"I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Viva Labs Probiotics is the first probiotic supplement I've tried. As my diet is friendly to good bacteria (very unusual for an American) and has been so for decades, I probably don't need this supplement. But I can't know for sure that something has not defeated my best efforts. Taking this supplement gives me the assurance I need.The typical American diet is downright hostile to health. Among other things, it creates a poor environment for beneficial bacteria in the human body. It's worth noting that in the human body bacteria are believed to outnumber human cells by an order of magnitude (that is, by 10:1). There's a symbiotic relationship between those little critters and ourselves.People on the grain diet or on other unhealthy diets damaging to beneficial bacteria suffer from a wide range of symptoms including excessive flatulence, headaches, problems adding muscle mass, problems controlling or reducing body fat, elimination issues, and fatigue. A change of diet to something compatible with the human body should, over time, restore the bacterial balance and cause these symptoms to abate. But only if the missing beneficial bacteria are obtained. Some will come from fermented foods, some will come from other sources. A great source is a probiotic supplement.Even if your diet has been good for a long time, things can happen to trigger the need for a probiotic. Many medications, and nearly all antibiotics wreak havoc with your microbiota. Stress can cause things to go out of whack. So can inadvertently eating something that you didn't know was in or on the food, such as a pesticide or herbicide. Exposure to the results of the ""bacteria wipe"" people's OCD can result in your ingesting chemicals that should not go into your body. If your water isn't filtered, the chemicals in municipally treated water can cause problems. And on and on the list goes.So is this stuff any good? Before answering that, it might be more important to address the other side of that particular coin. You're ingesting a selection of bacteria. Will doing so give adverse effects? In my case, no noticeable problems after four days of using this supplement. No tummy aches, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, etc. Now, that is my own experience. I don't have complicating issues such as a bad diet, poor colon health, and so on. If you have a bad diet, and the odds are extremely high that you do, ease into this. Take one capsule every other day for a couple of weeks and let your body adjust.I'm not a microbiologist, so when I saw the names of the 6 strains of bacteria I didn't know one from the other. Bing is great and letting you find answers online, so I ""binged"" each one:1. Bifidobacterium lactis. Among other benefits, they enhance immunity, fight tumor growth, improve digestion, and can lower cholesterol.2. Lactobacillus acidophilus. They are noted for creating a hostile environment for the ""bad"" bacteria. Doctors will often recommend them to patients taking antibiotics.3. Lactobacillus plantarum. They have significant cancer-fighting abilities, help the intestines function better, and may help fight depresesion.4. Bifidobacterium bifidum. They  help the body use B vitamins and vitamin K.5. Bifidobacterium breve. They help prevent cancer (by depressing procarcinogenic enzymes) and help the body utilize vitamins.6. Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Among other benefits, these help protect the urogenital tract and improve the health of the intestines. They also are potent in fighting various allergies.And it's not just the bacteria in the capsule that make or break a probiotic. The capsule itself is critical. This capsule prevents early disintegration in the stomach, else gastric acid would kill most of the good guys in the capsule. This one is designed to release in the lower GI, exactly where you want those little fellas to set up shop.I highly recommend this supplement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10UU070ZD2BWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAWLVGU#wasThisHelpful","R10UU070ZD2BWV","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one awesome drill set. Even the case it comes in shows that ""fine German engineering"" we've come to expect from brands such as BMW. Over the past few decades, I've owned and worn out various drills. Battery-powered or cord-powered, they eventually wear out. I've always bought a premium American brand and always felt I've gotten my money's worth. Not just because a well-made drill will last longer, but because it will make good holes every time. Cheaper drills start to experience chuck wobble long before you ever see that in an industrial-grade (aka, contractor-grade) drill.This drill has a brushless DC motor. I've written on such motors in the electrical trade press. They have many advantages, and one advantage you will notice for the size and weight of this drill is how much torque it's got. When I drill a hole, I don't want to have to baby the drill. That's why I've always bought a hefty drill. The extra size and weight tell you there's extra torque, but in this case you get extra torque without as much of the extra weight. It's still a heavy drill, but it has a weight-saving design. You pay for that upfront, but the good news is you don't pay for it on the job--where it counts.Everything is done well, down to the smallest detail. The drill case, for example, is something that's going to last a very long time and is designed to properly and securely hold all of the components. Cheap drill sets, if they come with a case at all, often come with a plastic one that has plastic hinges that break. Inside, if they have any type of hold-down or tray, it doesn't work well or last long. This case is made to serve the owner well, and it even looks handsome.The attachable handle is easy to install and remove. So is the belt clip. How to use these was obvious to me, some other things less obvious (will get to those in a moment). Many drills have a bit dock. Typically, it's magnetized (as is the case here). Often, it's located too close to the hand grip, causing the bit to be knocked off. Metabo has two docks, one on each side out of the way.This comes with a spare battery! So you can charge one battery with the included charger while using the other. This is perhaps overkill, as the battery has a very large capacity. Not is it large, but it is a large LITHIUM battery. Still, if you're doing a big job or working with tough applications you will appreciate being able to do a quick swap. With this system, you'll never have to choose between overheating your drill motor due to low battery or finishing the job. The charger that comes with this is the ASC-30 36V. It does not take long to charge the battery. Once it is charged, the charger senses this and basically puts itself into charge maintenance mode. Sweet! No worries about drying out the battery due to overcharging, that's not going to happen (been there, done that with other chargers for other products).The battery was my first hurdle, however. I had to refer to the instructions to see how to remove it. I kept thinking it must have a push button latch or something near the joint, and I could not find that. I did find the charge state indicator; push the button, and a 4-light display will tell you your approximate charge (all 4 lights lit means full charge, 2 lit means 50%, and so on). A quick look at the manual, and it turns out the battery latch is up higher. Gee, I could have found that after all. Push the button, and the battery pack slides right off. Don't push the button, and it stays on even if you supply significant force.As with other drills, it has forward, reverse, and lock positions. Unlike most other drills, it has a gear selector; you slide to position 1 for slow turning or 2 for fast turning. I've never had this feature on a drill, before. I've had just variable speed that is a function of how far you depress the trigger. This has that variable speed function also, but combined with a slow gear or fast gear setting. This can be very helpful where you have a tricky application requiring high torque and slow speed; for example, starting a large screw into masonry or needing precision placement of pilot holes in hard materials.It has a pulse mode, so you can use it as an impact driver. It has a rubberized grip, and it just feels good in my hand. It has a torque setting, which is something I came to really appreciate on the last drill I bought. Basically, it's everything you'd want in a contractor-grade drill / drill set.If you know your tools, you'll fall in love with this drill at first sight. It looks like a well-made tool, because it is a well-made tool. Those are the only kinds of tools I buy, because those are the tools that ultimately cost you less money and let you do your best work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RASAOYN69GJAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159N7FWI#wasThisHelpful","RASAOYN69GJAG","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first requirement for any cloth-type material used in the kitchen is that it is made from natural fibers. These dish cloths are made from 100% cotton.I absolutely will not use polyester in the kitchen (or wear it), because when polyester melts on skin it actually melts into the skin and that can make a very serious burn out of what would otherwise be a very minor burn. Polyester is also prohibited apparel in electrical work for this same reason. The polyester people now call their dangerous product ""microfiber"" in hopes people won't notice. Do not use microfiber towels in the kitchen.Not all cotton cloth is the same. In fact, there are wide variations in quality. When I look at a cotton cloth, I test its weight and examine the weave. This is a very light weight fabric, almost like a cheesecloth. You can easily see through these dish cloths when holding them up to a light.These are not ""very absorbent"" as claimed. There's just not enough material per square inch for that purpose. I tried drying a few wet dish items, and these simply did not do the job. But I don't think that's the job they are intended to do. The same properties make these good for washing the dishes, thus ""dish cloth"" rather than ""dish towel"" in the name.Another test of a material is how well it recovers from wadding. I wadded a couple of wet cloths and a couple of dry ones. I think there's not enough material per square inch to give these any real ""body."" So they score well on wadding: no wrinkles.Each towel is also hemmed all the way around, and I checked out that stitching very closely. It's a ""straight stitch,"" nothing fancy. But nothing fancy is needed. Unfortunately, the stitching on three of the six towels appears to be already coming apart (stray threads sticking out, but maybe these aren't part of the actual stitch--hard to tell). So I doubt the ""long-wearing"" claim.These cloths are attractive. They look nice in the kitchen. They can come in handy as general use cloths for wiping the countertop, glass stove top, dining table, etc. The soft cotton won't scratch a surface (as long as you wash these properly, which means use less than 20% of the recommended laundry detergent and don't use one containing wood pulp). The low density of the material means quick drying times.A couple of tips on the care for these.Don't use the recommended amount of detergent or soap when washing (holds true for all clothing, linens, etc.); it's way, way too much. Typically, people can cut back to about 20% of the recommended amount and their clothes will come out even cleaner. But use a good product from the organics aisle, not the smelly, chemical-laden stuff in the consumer aisle. And never use ""fabric softener"" as it's actually quite gross (read the label).Don't dry them completely in the clothes dryer. This is true for all fabrics. That degree of drying actually damages the material. So does high heat.

"This is really a great book for the corporate ladder climber, business owner, or top executive. I think the advice applies to life generally. Mostly, it's the author's way of thinking that provides the value in this book. And thinking without acting is rather pointless, thus the title as it is.I want to note that Mr. Hayzlett, though quite articulate, could be misunderstood. Don't take his statements out of context, but try to understand the way he thinks. Mr. Hayzlett has a great deal of bravado and seeming overconfidence. But he also expresses humility. This man is not afraid to own up to his mistakes and blindspots. Some of his stories of his screw-ups had me laughing aloud.In that spirit, I will point out another one he made in this book. He says he knows what is meant by thinking outside the box, but what follows after that statement clearly shows he does not. The proverbial box is not what he portrays it to be or what most people seem to think it is.The box metaphor comes from a puzzle that tests critical thinking skills. You draw three rows of three dots. Then, using four straight lines, connect all nine dots. Most people will try to draw a box. To solve the puzzle, the lines have to form something other than a box. Thus, ""thinking outside the box."" It means thinking in a way not constrained by preconceptions. BTW, the solution is a triangle with a line extending from one vertix through the middle of the opposite side.Often in a business book, seminar, or workshop, people are looking for specific tactics or techniques. That's fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. Yes, you need technical skills, but if their use is constrained by small thinking you're not going to see big results. You get those big results by thinking bigger. The pressure to not think bigger is immense. On top of that, thinking bigger entails risks. So most of us will think smaller, minding our place and being happy with the incremental improvements that come from doing the wrong things better than we used to do them.In my own case, I've been thinking much bigger in recent years than I used to. But still not thinking on the scale someone like Mr. Hayzlett does. His book has encouraged me to, uh, think outside the box more when considering my strategies. Having gone through some severe trials, I'm maybe too risk averse to swing for home runs. There is still, however ample room for more bigness below that risk level. I see that now.Something I like about how he deals with employees (or contractors, as the case may be) is he hires them to handle specific areas of responsibility and he expects them to handle those and gives them the power to do so. He doesn't want them coming to him with questions they should already know the answer to (""Why do I need you if you have to ask me that?""). This seems a bit harsh at first glance. But the key is he's not micromanaging, disabling, or intimidating people. He wants them to take ownership. He has other things to do.The lesson here had immediate application for me with a contractor who made the best possible decision with the information she had available. I didn't like the decision at first, and shot off an e-mail before thinking about what I would have done in her shoes. My e-mail basically took the decision power away from her, which was a huge mistake on my part. I followed up by saying I was wrong, apologizing for jumping the gun, and walking through the scenario to demonstrate I honestly felt her decision was the best possible one to make. That's another aspect of thinking big. You have to be big enough to admit when you're wrong (just as Mr. Hayzlett did in this book several times, often to my amusement).I also like his oft-repeated thought, ""Nobody is going to die."" In looking back in my career, I'm now amazed at how many petty things got blown way out of proportion. Managers might expend $50 in meeting cost to gripe to an employee about a $4 problem, making it sound like a life or death matter. I put up with this sort of stupidity when I was in my 20s. By the time I was in my 30s, I would just walk off and leave the idiot boss fuming. Let him have the heart attack, I don't need one.But sometimes, I found myself starting down this same path with subordinates. Just remember Mr. Hayzlett's admonition, ""Nobody is going to die."" Unless, of course, it doesn't apply. For example, a worker is performing an unsafe act; maybe someone is going to die. In most cases, however, remembering this admonition can keep you from making a proverbial mountain out of the proverbial molehill. I think what Mr. Hayzlett is saying is to keep your response at a level that matches the severity of the issue. In most cases, the issue isn't worth making a huge fuss over. Explain the problem anad move on.A pattern in business books is some celebrity CEO writes his or her memoir or a vanity ""Look how great I am"" book with some nuggets of advice. That problem has soured me on these types of books generally, so it's hard to get me to read a business book these days. Something about this one appealed to me, and I'm glad I read it. This is definitely not a work of vanity. As I began reading, I was reminded of another outstanding man, Boake Sells. Mr. Sells was the CEO of Revco and brought it out of bankruptcy. He took time out of his busy life to provide some badly needed mentoring to me, and he was a straight-talking person who just wanted to help another person. I am eternally grateful.Mr. Hayzlett has that same, ""Let me be your mentor"" vibe. What he said has great value for the reader who pays attention and thinks about the text. But it goes beyond what he said to how he says it. My experience in the corporate world was that many people try to bluff and fluff their way through life with acronyms and ""management speak"" that, to me, simply camouflages a person's ineptness and (usually well-deserved) lack of confidence. Then you have plain-speaking people who have a good track record and well-deserved high degree of confidence. Mr. Hayzlett, unlike many business writers, is the latter.This book follows the standard construction formula of ten chapters followed by a conclusion. I had an advance reading copy (provided for reviewers), and it runs about 160 pages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5689BGWFFWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599185741#wasThisHelpful","R3P5689BGWFFWA","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This has a very pleasant, nutty taste. Let me be clear. I love the taste.I've tried other hemp powders that leave a bitter aftertaste or are gritty. This is smooth and almost sweet. Like those other hemp-based protein powders, this one caused no ill effects in my digestive systems. That is a statement I cannot make about dairy-based ones, and I have tried at least a hundred different brands or formulations.Many folks are looking to complement their dairy-based protein powers. That wasn't my goal with Viva Labs Organic Hemp Protein.this. I tried this product to see if I'd include it among the other vegan protein powders I consume (yes, I will).My days of consuming a dairy-based protein shake or meal replacement powder are behind me. I've moved entirely to vegan protein powders. These beat diary-based ones in several important ways, such as:*  Easier assimilation.*  Really good amino profile, when blended.*  Micronutrients typically included.*  Typical dairy toxins (in all but the highest-end dairy-based powders) not present. These include some pretty nasty, endocrine-modifying stuff and at least one neurotoxin.*  Nice absorption rate, unlike whey. This is critical. Whey hits your bloodstream fast, and you can absorb maybe 20g of it. Most people using whey powders consume more than 20g at a time, and the leftover is converted to fat or eliminated.*  And (as I understand it) vegan sources mean less work on the kidneys and less nitrogen loss because bioavailability is higher; this might be marginally less. To me what's important is it's not more.*  No lactose intolerance issues!Cost is always a consideration, and the vegan powders typically cost less than their dairy counterparts. Not only that, the environmental impact and the water footprint of producing a vegan powder is hugely less than for dairy-based. This product is affordably priced.I've tested about a dozen different vegan proteins, and they typically mix well (only a couple require much beyond vigorous shaking of a carafe). This Viva Labs Hemp Protein mixes very easily. It's at the high end of mixability. This mixes well by itself and also with anything I add to it. Sometimes, I mix one protein powder with another or mix one with an aminos complex (called FundAminos). Often, I toss in some beta-alinine.The ingredients panels on the vegan proteins are real eye-poppers. Read and compare the amino profile of any vegan blend to that of any diary-based, and you will want vegan every time. It's like you're taking a BCAA supplement along with your protein, plus getting aminos that aren't branch-chained. Hemp protein is noted for its excellent amino profile.The real test of these is how a body builder does on them. I've been using vegan powders for over a year, and have gained muscle mass during that time. I do not eat meat, wheat, corn, or soy; those ingredients make up about 80% of the typical American diet and meat is the primary protein source.So do I get enough protein? I recently had an ""age 55"" photoshoot, and I was at about 3.5% body fat (it is very hard to measure body fat in that range; body fat scales stop at 5%). Yet really strong; I'm doing flyes with 10lbs more than 2/3 of my body weight (counting both dumbbells) and I do them slowly. This takes unusual strength relative to body weight; normal is less than 1/3 of a man's body weight.Basically, I am finding you can't go wrong with a vegan protein powder. But some are better than others, and Viva Labs Organic Hemp Protein is one of the best. And that taste! Really delicious.The only thing I don't like about it is the pouch packaging. While presumably more environmentally friendly than the traditional tub, the pouch makes it tricky to get powder out without slopping some on the counter. I buy my turmeric and my cinnamon in these large pouches, too. My FundAminos comes in a pouch, as does my ChocoBerry Blast. All great stuff, but those pouches mean you have to be more careful when scooping out the product. Also, you also can't stack pouches on top of each other.That said, a pouch has one ginormous advantage over a tub. You can easily pack it in your luggage or you can ship it ahead to your destination in a mailing envelope instead of a more costly box. For those who really can't stand a pouch, the solution is simple: buy a reclosable, reusable or bin. I have lidded bins just for my cooking flours (which do not include wheat, corn, or soy).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRQS5RTS5FKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFR695W#wasThisHelpful","R1QRQS5RTS5FKH","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Viva Labs Magnesium is not the first magnesium supplement I've tried. I've been supplementing with magnesium for a long time, because inadequate magnesium is responsible for a long list of maladies. But I don't supplement daily and don't usually take the full dose. Here are my reasons why, and if one or more does not apply to you, then you need more magnesium than I do:*  It's already in the multivitamin I take. Not in a large amount, but it's there.*  I don't eat the inflammation, obesity, and cancer diet that most Americans prefer over real food. This diet interferes with magnesium absorption while simultaneously increasing the body's need for magnesium. Today's wheat is the main culprit, and it should be 100% excluded from your diet.*  My diet is high in high-magnesium foods. For example, I eat raw spinach several times a day.If you are on a grain-based, rather than green-based, diet you probably have a magnesium deficiency (along with other problems, including low testosterone and yes that includes you ladies too). Supplementing with the recommended dosage of magnesium tablets for a few of months while you get your diet straight will definitely help your body recover from your poor diet.Since my diet already provides me with more than enough magnesium, why do I bother with a magnesium supplement? Because magnesium is such an important nutrient that I want to ensure against a deficiency.For the most part, minerals have become commoditized. So it's difficult to point out how one brand compares to another. But let me try to do that.I like to evaluate supplements on several metrics:*  Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Viva does put a plastic seal on its cap. It does require more than a fingernail to peel back, so maybe not the most points there. But, wait. Simply giving the cap a good twist will also remove the seal. Opens without a problem. This leads to the inner seal. Some companies us a toxic aluminum foil seal that will invariably leave particles of this toxic metal on the contents; I once bought a jar of coconut oil with such a seal and was aghast at the stupidity of the manufacturer. This seal is one with the built-in tab, and it is easily removed. *  Capsule/tablet quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart and capsules that are in bits. This is bad. I poured these out and did not find one broken tablet. Yay!*  Nausea effect. Well, magnesium capsules won't give you nausea. So this inherently passes that test.*  Sugar coating. Some supplement makers put a sugar coating or other unhealthy coating on their products. No such problem here.*  Dosage. This is where you really need to worry. I've seen preworkout supplements with megadoses of B vitamins (these do nothing for improving your workout) and such high doses do tax your system. With minerals, you need to be careful to stay below the toxicity levels. Two of these tablets will give you 50% of the RDA. So, it's a safe dosage.If you are on the typical American diet, you need to replace grain with green. This is a foundational step in personal health care. During the transition phase, while your body is detoxing and nutrient absorption is probably encumbered, add a magnesium supplement to your program. This looks like a good one, to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F6LR6PG1FRZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JUGTDI#wasThisHelpful","R2F6LR6PG1FRZR","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first encountered kinesiology tape when undergoing treatment for a herniated disk in my neck. When the doctor explained the tape, I was dubious. His pitch sounded logical, but I still had my doubts. And it was pretty pricey.It may be important to note that I had a really bad condition. My C1 had been jammed so hard into the opening at the base of my skull that the chiropractor was unable to pull it out. Even after 30 minutes on the traction machine, it was stuck in there. I was in a lot of pain, and this severe dislocation threatened my other disks. C4 was the one that had herniated, and the x-ray showed C2 and C3 were looking marginal. They could burst at any time, and that would set off a chain of events in my spine.Because of these factors, I didn't want to fool around with this condition. I wanted it to heal as quickly as possible. Aggressive treatment was the route I wanted to take.So the doctor applied KT TAPE PRO Synthetic Elastic Kinesiology Tape and told me me to come back the next day. That tape worked overnight, helping calm things down so that my nerves were no longer misfiring and causing my own muscles to lock my neck into the wrong position.The doctor performed a chiropractic adjustment on my back and then on my neck just up to C4. Then he said he would try to rotate my head for the correct alignment that would allow him to maybe extract C1 with a simple pulling motion. He said it would be slow and steady, and to expect a loud pop but to stay as relaxed as possible.When that sucker popped, the headache I'd had for the last three days immediately went away. He held my neck in that position for a few minutes, then slowly rotated my head so those vertebrae would be in the right place. We went immediately to the traction machine.After traction, he applied the KT Tape again. Then we began three months of treatment that made heavy use of the KT tape, anti-inflammatory drugs (mostly Ibuprofen), neck traction (four times a day), chiropractic adjustment (twice a week), and posture exercises.Three different doctors said this was the fastest recovery they had ever seen. My mom's best friend is an RN, and she'd gone through this herself. She was also amazed at the recovery time. She said it might be a record.She had given me her neck traction machine, which is why I was able to undergo traction 4 times a day (did it from home).  Early on, I had mentioned the tape with a somewhat dubious tone in my voice, and her reply was that tape had consistently shown excellent results. It sure did in my case.Note that during the time I was using KT Tape, I was still able to take showers (albeit using caution not to drench the tape or soap it up). And I think it helped me with my weight training during the healing process. I had to use caution to train around the pain, so modified exercises that were suboptimal. But when I had the KT Tape applied, there was more leeway in how far I could go. So I was often able to keep the intensity that stimulates the adaptive response (e.g., the various changes the body initiates to promote healing and the building of new muscle after the workout).I think the ability to consistently get my body into this state explains why my herniated disk recovery time was so short. And it was possible only because of the KT Tape (I tried training without it a few times, and could not achieve intensity). Most weight trainers do not understand the concept of intensity, and I won't explain it here. But it is the ""secret"" to massive gains in strength (I can, for example, curl more than half my body weight with one hand) and in maintaining high testosterone.Herniated disks tend to cause issues in other body areas, after the disk has healed (the problems get initiated before the healing is completed). In my case, it was first shoulder problems. Then elbow problems. We used the tape to, yet again, help with the nerve misfiring. Of course, the tape isn't exclusively for addressing nerve misfiring. But that was its primary purpose in my treatments.Now occasionally, I have situations arise where the tape would be helpful. The woman in my life (I don't like the term ""girlfriend"" as we are in our 50s and no longer boy and girl but man and woman) is also heavily into weight training and also had great results with the tape. She anticipates needing it again soon. So I have my own roll of it now and will use it when the need arises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K0IRVAOB8FXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O67XCW#wasThisHelpful","R2K0IRVAOB8FXJ","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of maca, before seeing it on Amazon. So I did some research on it. Here's a summary of what I found out.Maca is an ingredient in many supplements. Some small studies (methodology not revealed, so maybe not scientific or statistically validated) have shown that maca improves sexual desire while reducing anxiety and feelings of depression. It does this without hormonal changes, thus is offered as an alternative to hormone therapy. It contains fatty acids and amino acids, so regardless of any medicinal claims it makes a good addition to your diet. Let me bolster that claim a bit. This also is high in protein and fiber, plus it contains significant amounts of vitamin C, several B vitamins, calcium, iron, potassium, copper, and manganese.Outside of what I just told you, there's not much (reliable) information on maca. For example, there are no long-term studies on its efficacy or its safety. But ancient Peruvians used it regularly and they didn't record any negative effects. It grows at high elevations in Peru and has been cultivated as a vegetable crop (it's a relative of the radish, but tastes somewhat like butterscotch) for over 3,000 years.So what about Healthworks Raw Certified Organic Maca Powder? Since I haven't used other maca products, I don't have a basis for comparison. I can't say this tastes better or works better than competing brands. I can say it does taste good and mixes easily. During testing, I added it to protein shakes.The fact it is raw certified organic is also worth noting. Many foods that aren't organic contain toxins; this is the case with dairy (high toxicity), grains (all GMO products contain a neurotoxin, so if you like becoming less intelligent over time make sure to eat GMO grains instead of certified organic ones).There is controversy over whether raw is better than cooked. I eat my (certified organic) oats raw, and generally have my vegetables raw. Daily, I eat raw bok choy, eggplant, acorn squash,and other vegetables. I also eat fruit raw (in addition to cooked as part of a cooked dish recipe). If you do some research on the raw foods movement, you'll find compelling arguments behind their viewpoint. So to me, it's a plus that this is raw. You can always cook it, if you want it cooked.Now, consider something to settle the question of whether to cook it. Maca powder is made from the root of the maca plant, not the fruit, stalk, or leaves. That makes it a root vegetable. Root vegetables usually contain starches that are hard to digest raw. Sweet potatoes, for example, don't work very well raw. But on the other hand, we routinely eat carrots and radishes (both root vegetables) raw. And maca is a relative of radishes.If you're going to use this raw, try a small amount by itself. If you get excess gas from eating this raw, then use it cooked going forward. You can add it to many things. Maca is commonly used in soup. But try mixing whipping some into eggs to make an omelet, or add it to your baked goods (I bake my own protein cookies, and it works well in those). You can also try adding it to coffee, either before brewing (so it gets brewed too) or immediately after (I think after is better). You can make tea with it, also. Use your imagination!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1SXR7X02TA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1WVEF2#wasThisHelpful","R2W1SXR7X02TA7","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past year, I've moved entirely to vegan protein powders. These beat diary-based ones in several important ways, such as:*Easier assimilation.*Really good amino profile, when blended.*Micronutrients typically included.*Typical dairy toxins (in all but the highest-end dairy-based powders) not present. These include some pretty nasty, endocrine-modifying stuff and at least one neurotoxin.*Nice absorption rate, unlike whey. This is critical. Whey hits your bloodstream fast, and you can absorb maybe 20g of it. Most people using whey powders consume more than 20g at a time, and the leftover is converted to fat or eliminated.*And (as I understand it) vegan sources mean less work on the kidneys and less nitrogen loss because bioavailability is higher; this might be marginally less. To me what's important is it's not more.*No lactose intolerance issues!Cost is always a consideration, and the vegan powders typically cost less than their dairy counterparts. I've tested about a dozen different vegan proteins, and they typically mix well (only a couple require much beyond vigorous shaking of a carafe).So basically, I am finding you can't go wrong with a vegan protein powder. Especially if it is a blend.The ingredients panels on the vegan proteins are real eye-poppers. Read and compare the amino profile of any vegan blend to that of any diary-based, and you will want vegan every time.

Yet really strong; I'm doing flyes with 10lbs more than 2/3 of my body weight (counting both dumbbells) and I do them slowly. This takes great strength relative to body weight; normal is less than 1/3 of a man's body weight.So what about Everlast VP? It's a blend of pea protein, rice protein, and hemp protein. All three of these are outstanding sources. Blending them gives you a wider absorption band (meaning you can eat more protein at one sitting and have it available for muscle cell building over a longer time) and a more powerful amino profile (each one fills in the low spots of the other two). You also get a new and interesting flavor, versus eating just one type of plant protein.It's low in calories (110 per serving that gives you 22g of protein) and very high in both the BCAAs and glutamine. Serious trainers know to supplement with glutamine. If you want a recovery protein, this is the ticket (and not just because of the high glutamine).Everlast VP is not at the top for mixability, but mixing it isn't a big chore either. It just takes a little more shaking if using a carafe or a little more stirring if using a spoon and cup (making a smoothie with just the powder and the water).I really like the taste. It tastes good by itself, but also when mixed with oats (I use raw organic oats from Natural Grocers). I bake my own ""protein cookies"" and Everlast VP works well in those also.It's hard to say which vegan protein is my favorite. But Everlast is certainly high on the list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLDY3TQ8YHHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQ1C7VQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLDY3TQ8YHHE","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an Amazon Vine review, which means I didn't actually buy these. If I had, I would have been more careful about the size. I wear an XL glove, these are mediums. Even so, they (amazingly) fit with reasonable comfort.So how does one rate a seemingly commodity item such as nitrile gloves? Well, if you've ever bought super cheap ones you have probably found they rip out easily and are thus useless because the protection is unreliable. Or they don't fit right. Let's see how the Ammex product stacks up.  The fit. As mentioned, these are too small for me so you could expect me to not say anything here. But the gloves did stretch to fit my hands. And the fingers were the right length. Poorly designed/made gloves often have ""floppy finger"" syndrome, which interferes with your ability to work. These don't have that problem. I also looked at unstretched gloves and found these to have a consistent design. Consistently good.  Smell. How does a glove protect your skin when it's laden with harsh chemicals of its own? Or a fragrance? These are just gloves, no nasty stuff on them.  Chemical resistance. These resist chemicals you are likely to encounter as, say, an industrial maintenance mechanic. The box lists 15 different categories of chemicals these gloves resist.  Strength. Stretch a nitrile glove over a hand that is two sizes too small for the glove, and then pinch the material and tug firmly on it. The glove should rip, right? These held up to that abuse. Of course, you can tear them. But in normal use or even slightly abnormal use, the consistent thickness of the material gives it surprising durability.  Sensitivity. I can still handle tools adroitly, while wearing these gloves.  Allergies. These are Latex-free.You can't go wrong with this choice. These gloves provide the protection you need without compromising in other areas. Not only that, they look good. Can you tell that I really like them?Please note that these are not rated as PPE for electrical work. Nor are they meant to be used for barrier protection in medical or healthcare applications.A tip for using these gloves for applications involving resins and other sticky (or gooey) materials. Always wear two pairs (one inside the other). Then if you find your gloves all gummed up, you can just roll them down and off. The inner pair will be clean and you can finish the job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U3TOVSMSIE7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BR571K#wasThisHelpful","R1U3TOVSMSIE7V","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The boss really likes this. I think thus far, it has gotten her highest approval rating of any food. That is especially good news, because this formulation contains no fish. Many pet custodians think fish is healthy rather than toxic, and even eat fish themselves. The sad truth is that all fish is now so contaminated with heavy metals that it is unsafe for any of us to eat.I had previously reviewed another product, Wellness Trufood Chicken, Chickpeas, and Chicken Liver Cat Food, and the boss was ecstatic about that also. But for some reason, she changed her mind after a few days. I'm not sure why, but it may be the result of ants swarming in that food on about Day Four. I think she associated the food with ants ever thereafter. I gave the bag to a neighbor who has four cats (two of his and two he mercy-adopted), and that crew just loves the Trufood.When the boss rejected the Trufood, that put us back on the salmon-based food. Much to my chagrin. The problem I have with salmon is it's loaded with heavy metals these days. Humans should not eat it; doing so significantly raises your risk of pancreatic cancer (this fact is confirmed in the medical literature).Much to my relief, she now snubs her nose at the salmon food to eat this turkey and duck food. And now it's been over a week. No ants, so I think we're good.When the box arrived from Amazon, the boss knew it was for her. She took one whiff and immediately wanted what was in there. Before feeding her any new food, I always taste it myself. This passed the taste test, so I gave her some. She gobbled it up and wanted more.Here's the complete list of ingredients:Deboned Turkey, Deboned Chicken, Chicken Meal, Whitefish Meal, Herring Meal, Peas, Turkey Meal, Potatoes, Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Tomato Pomace, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Cranberries, Chicory Root Extract, Choline Chloride, Salmon Oil, Vitamins [Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, Folic Acid, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)],Minerals [Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, Ferrous Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Calcium Iodate], Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols added to preserve freshness, Dried Kelp, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus casei Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus Fermentation Product, Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.Notice the added vitamins and other nutrients. This solves the problems of trying to give her supplemental vitamins.We are both very happy with this product. It's what I'm buying her from now on. I realize the price tag is rather steep, but you get what you pay for. And this is well worth paying for. There's a big cost-savings if you buy the 12lb bag rather than the 2lb bag. But this is food you are buying for a cat; test with the smaller bag first. If your cat does not go completely nuts over this food, I will be surprised. But again, we are talking about cats so anything is possible.Why the right cat food mattersI feed this cat dry kibble, though she does get moist treats on occasion. She's an indoor cat who likes to go outside. So she does hunt and eat rabbits, chipmunks, birds, and other little critters. At 7.8 lbs, she's not a big cat but she is a lean, muscular athlete. This is because of her diet; ""Great bodies are made in the kitchen"" and ""You are what you eat.""She whoops all contenders in the territory fights, even those big males that are more than twice her size. And I've seen her make a six-foot vertical leap. One time, she even took a bird that was in mid-flight.When she goes in for her exam and vaccinations, the veterinarian always remarks on her clean teeth and sweet breath. So many cats and dogs have caries today, and that is entirely the fault of people who feed them soft, mushy food they are not meant to eat. In this age of a caries epidemic among pets, she doesn't even have tartar. The ""secret"" is the dry kibble I feed her. Not just the fact it's dry kibble as opposed to the (never feed to your cat) canned junk, but it's very high quality kibble. No sticky grains to start that plaque forming. (Note to parents of human children, this will work for your kids also. Take them completely off of processed grain, and they won't get cavities).Note also that the bad diet exacerbates cat allergies (my girlfriend is supposedly allergic to cats but has no problem being around mine), and it's why cat ""output"" and litter usually smell so foul. My cat's litter smells like clay, only; there is no stench. If your cat is on a grain-based diet, switch immediately. If your kids are on the same thing, the same advice applies. You will notice huge and very positive differences in only a few days.Buying cheap cat food is a very expensive proposition that compromises the health of the cat you are caring for. It violates the tacit agreement you have with that animal and betrays the trust s/he put in you.Buying quality cat food saves money, but more importantly you have a better, healthier, happier cat. It is the right thing to do, and the rewards are definitely there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TUI1JRN60WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M0JLEM#wasThisHelpful","R35TUI1JRN60WS","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Norelco Electric Shaver 8900 delivers on its promises. While it's designed to be a premium system for grooming facial hair, I put it through a far more rigorous usage test. This shaver arrived about two weeks out from a planned photoshoot. This shoot wasn't going to include legs, so I hadn't shaved them. I had shaved my torso and shoulders, but still needed to shave my arms. So I used this to shave both arms and legs. This did not take long, did not hurt a bit, and produced surprisingly good results. In short, this shaver's performance is amazing.In the past when I've done the body hair removal ritual, it's been frustrating (hair apparently defies removal and multiple passes are required) and painful (nicks, razor burns, and hair pulling).I'm a very hairy person. So I started with the beard trimmer attachment, to knock things down. Keep in mind that in the past, I had always spent a good half hour with scissors and then with the trimmer attachment of my (existing) electric razor. Skipping the scissor part meant that hair got caught in the razor mechanism, meaning lots of painful hair pulls and not very good hair removal overall.This easily trimmed that body hair down to size. Then I removed the comb, figuring this would leave a trail of carnage. Nope, it just left my skin smooth. Not so much as a red mark. Anywhere. Not even on the backs of my knees, an area that I had previously considered off limits to anything but a delicately-handled cartridge razor. It was not necessary to go back over the skin with anything. So in addition to being painless and producing better results than any previous method, this took only about 10% of the time normally required.Due to the shape and design of the razor, I can reach any point on my body. With various cartridge razors, I cannot do this because the pivoting head moves the blades away from my skin on various parts of my back as I reach behind. My upper body is very flexible, but there are limits. The 8900 allowed me to safely and effectively remove all hair anywhere. Even on those parts of my back previously unshaveable with cartridge razors or my other electric shaver.I also have the Mangroomer, and it does a pretty good job. But you have to be much more careful with it than with this, and you don't want to use the Mangroomer to shave your face. Since the 8900 is designed for face-shaving, it does that very well. And it does so much more.That's my rundown on the shaving performance. On the downside, this is going to take up some counter space. If you have a small bathroom vanity, you'll definitely notice the footprint of the system if you have the cleaning/charging station there. One way around this is to put the cleaning/charging station under the counter until you are ready to clean the shaver using their system. You can charge the shaver with or without the cleaning/charging station, and it really does not take up much room by itself. You can protect the shaver by putting it in the travel case that comes with this system.I read the instructions on the cleaning procedure, but since this item is still new I haven't tried that procedure yet (it's not needed until after many shaves). It seems easy enough. But still, you have to mess with a cleaning solution and a big fixture. This may be the best way to clean the shaving heads, but I don't like the idea of storing a cleaning solution and a big fixture for cleaning/charging. Also, that big fixture requires some finesse when you go to dock or undock the razor. It took me a while to get the hang of this; I almost gave up on it.This system has many nice touches, such as the digital display and easy on/off switch (I've had other razors that are actually difficult to turn on and off without about breaking a fingernail). It's also amazingly quiet.What sells me on this system is what I described at the outset. The shave you get is amazing.This system is pricey, but if you're using cartridge razors you will spend far more in a year. How on earth do those companies justify a $40 price tag for a package of 5 blades, especially when you get maybe 3 shaves per blade? Crappy blades, high price; I think that poor value is driving people to discount razor clubs or to give up cartridge shavers entirely. If you're doing the latter, this is the thing to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PSG5IBX5WTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012VL5TB0#wasThisHelpful","R22PSG5IBX5WTK","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of several Nick Redfern books I have reviewed. I received an advance copy from Redfern's publicist, thus this review is made available before the book is actually released. Redfern's publicist always takes a risk when sending me a book for review, because I've written some harsh reviews of books they've sent. With Redfern's books, the risk is admittedly lower because I ""get"" his style and am a fan and follower. But that doesn't mean he's necessarily safe!Redfern's books tend toward the ""nonmainstream"" side. This is one of the more ""out there"" ones he's done. As usual, he really gets you thinking about how various dots connect. Often in this genre, an author starts with a conclusion and pieces together facts (and fiction) with a little bit of faulty logic to ""prove"" his thesis. Redfern takes a variation on that approach, starting with a thesis and showing you that it's possibly true. That is a far more honest approach than what we see in, for example, our fake federal ""elections"" in which straw ""candidates"" spew one inanity after another.This book keeps with the Redfern tradition of looking at arcane facts to provide an interesting, compelling set of mini-stories. I want to be clear that Redfern doesn't take the position that ""here is the fact of the matter"" as so many authors in this genre do. He presents a case and kind of disclaims it at the same time. This strikes me as intellectually honest. It's a preponderance of the evidence approach, rather than a pretense of ""beyond a shadow of a doubt."" So you can draw your own conclusions or none at all. You'll still walk away entertained and more informed.Redfern's writing is always verbose. Normally, verbosity results from a writer's ineptitude and is a detracting deficiency. But Redfern has made an art of it, and his verbosity has a definite rhythm that embeds entertainment into the writing itself. Many writers are too lazy to condense their prose down into the fewest words needed to get the job done, and reading what they blathered on about is often tedious. You feel like you've been made to drink a gallon of water with your meal. It appears that Redfern works very hard at adding ""needless"" words such that they complement the prose and give it a music of its own. This is his style, and I think it's highly polished. I've read other reviews that pan him for this; those reviewers are simply not paying attention.In Bloodline of the Gods, Redfern discusses a plethora of facts and coincidences surrounding people whose blood lack the Rh factor (making the Rh negative). I won't rehash it all here, but will summarize by saying this all leads to the idea that long-ago visiting aliens performed genetic tinkering with Cro-Magnon humans and the smoking gun is the Rh negative bloodline.Now, this sounds preposterous at first bite. However, if you stay with him, Redfern eventually has you seeing that it's plausible. You might still not be convinced that the idea is true, but you'll see that it's not totally preposterous, either.That said, one of the linchpins in this thesis is that the planet Niburu is the home planet and circles our sun. But its orbit is wildly elliptical. I don't think that proposition passes the smell test. Maybe there is or was such a planet, but if there is it would have to be on the other side of the sun where we can't see it no matter what we do. If there was such a planet, it could have been there or it could be the explanation for the asteroids and other detritus between here and Mars. This is all ""slim chance"" stuff, IMO.Another linchpin is all the reported alien abductions. These stories do not pass my BS sniffer, mainly because all of the alleged abductees (AAs) were people of no real importance, uneducated (as far as I know), poor (as far as I know), unarmed (odd in the USA), unskilled in martial arts and easily overpowered by three little abductors, etc. Some of the AAs report multi-generational abductions, but not a one of them has taken any preventive measures. Not a one of them carried a cell phone, camera, emergency beeper, GPS, or anything else that could have provided irrefutable evidence. Nobody else witnessed any of these alleged abductions, despite the huge number of times they allegedly happened. These and other anomalies tell me these abductions never happened.There are, perhaps, other explanations for the home planet and maybe the alleged abductions are just irrelevant. You could still be left wondering and scratching your head even after rejecting these ideas entirely.As usual, Redfern provides an extensive bibliography. In this case, it's 11 pages. Many of these sources are of dubious authority, but they are probably more trustworthy than such obvious sources of balderdash as the New York Times. That rag actually gets read by important people, a very scary situation when you think about it.The book is also indexed, which is helpful for those using it as a reference text. Given how many citations this book has, the index may be truly helpful to anyone researching similar topics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XIHHSJ40F4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601633653#wasThisHelpful","R11XIHHSJ40F4H","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will probably like the TRESemme Anti-Frizz Smoothing Creme product. It does a good job of helping hair stay put. I tried it for several days, and got reasonably good results with it. To give it a good trial, I first washed my hair to remove a competing hair cream (not creme, there is a difference that I will get to later) and the olive oil I often apply.The first thing I noticed upon opening the container is there was no nauseating smell. That's unusual in ""personal care"" products, most of which I cannot stand. It does have a fragrance, due in part to an added fragrance (probably best left out, but they added it) and ingredients such as mineral oil (the number two ingredient).It's most likely the mineral oil that does the ""heavy lifting"" of this product. Mineral oil, also known as paraffin oil, is a byproduct of petroleum. It's a common ingredient in make-up. When I was a kid, we had a big bottle of it for skin care. It was also commonly applied to baby's bottoms and used to clean our ears (not in that order, I assure you). I think it's also used to remove ticks and do other sorts of First Aid. Organizations such as WHO have decreed mineral oil to be non-toxic, at least if applied to the skin.That's the only oil in this product, at least as far as I can tell from the ingredients label. There are other petroleum products in it, though.Now, I understand that a hair cream contains various oils such as flax or avocado but a creme does not. Typically, both contain petroleum products. Both also tend to contain various glycols and alcohols. You'll find these and similar ingredients in shampoos and conditioners, too.I'm not a big proponent of using products that contain these ingredients, much preferring more natural products and methods for hair and scalp care. It's also true that I don't eat meat, wheat, corn, or soy for the same reasons (avoiding toxicity). If you eat those foods, wear polyester, and wash with detergent rather than soap (most bath ""soap"" sold on the market isn't soap), then you have no reason to reject this creme. It's probably one of the better ones out there.Note that not being a big proponent is different from being against something. I view the toxicity risk of this creme to be well below that of, say, your typical shampoo. And it really does a good job of control, something that is important to a person with curly hair like mine. I really don't want to have to fuss with my hair just to keep a colic down or balance curls that are stubbornly uneven. If I can put a few dabs of something on it to make quick work of the task, I'm happy.I mentioned the lack of a nauseating smell. To me, it's very important not to carry a chemical stench around on my skin or in my hair. I don't mind leaving this product in my hair, because it's not going to make me stink. I have allergies, but this creme does not trigger an allergic response.A final note is that this comes in a user-friendly tube. Good packaging is rare, but welcome when I see it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KC5W786XPZ8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FB5HTM#wasThisHelpful","R3KC5W786XPZ8Y","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nature's Bounty Whole Fruit Concentrate Cranberry Complex with Hibiscus is positioned as a ""Women's Health"" product (says so right on the box). But men get UI infections, too. So this kind of supplement isn't just for women. And UI can become serious. Deadly serious.My dad, in fact, underwent the barbaric torture of several government-sanctioned protocols for the (mis)treatment for men with cancer of the prostate. Every 10 lbs of excess body fat increases the risk of prostate cancer by an order of magnitude and fat around the lower abdomen is a prostate cancer factory. Testosterone is a very powerful hormone that signals the body to reduce stored fat and build muscle.So what did the doctors do? They administered drugs to LOWER his testosterone, thus really, really helping that cancer right along. They stretched out this abuse for years, at great expense to taxpayers ($40,000 in one month alone picked up by the govt) and insurance companies. Finally, they roto-rooted his UI tract so that he could not properly flush his bladder. This led to a series of painful, debilitating UI infections, ultimately killing him. I think the rack would have been an easier way to go.The same bunch of numbskulls (the Farce and Dummy Administration) who let doctors grossly abuse and misuse hormone-altering drugs do not approve this type of supplement for use in the prevention and treatment urinary tract infections. That, even though cranberry has a proven, well-documented efficacy for helping the patient and the common (mis)treatments for prostate cancer have a proven, well-documents efficacy for killing the patient. No reasonable person places any trust whatsoever in what this agency says or does.You can draw your own conclusions, from that alone. Or you can read the great body of literature showing the efficacy of this supplement.This particular formulation comes with hibiscus. What the heck is hibiscus? It's a beautiful flower with many health benefits. One of those is it acts as a diuretic, which means it will help you flush out that urinary tract. You can also use this to remove subcutaneous water so your skin looks tighter; a great benefit for body builders and people who like to be seen on the beach.My duty as a reviewer compelled me to try this supplement to see if it has any effects (it does) and whether they are as mild as they should be (they are). So, good news there.This last metric is important. Here's an example why. I've tried a few preworkout supplements before catching on to the ""code"" in the advertising. I don't need something to help me focus during my training sessions, but tried some preworkout supplements that claimed to provide this benefit. What the ""code"" really means is ""heaped with about 4 cups of coffee worth of caffeine, all at once."" Many of these are also loaded with insanely high levels of some B vitamins, something that will do nothing to enhance your workout. If you have a B deficiency, you correct that over several days. If you don't have a B deficiency, taking potentially harmful amounts of randomly selected B vitamins will not make you a gorilla in the gym. Perhaps all that excess B will make you temporarily incontinent while your body tries to flush all that out, but not more focused or stronger.With this supplement, I'm not evaluating taste or mixability or anything related to mixing or chewing because it's a soft gel. I do like the fact it's portable, because taking actual cranberries with you to the office or on a trip poses a big logistical challenge.On the downside, this supplement contains soy. Unless that is Monsanto-free soy, it's unsafe to eat (all Monsanto-based products are contaminated with a powerful neurotoxin, albeit in small amounts but it's still there and this has been verified by independent labs in multiple European countries). The package does not say the soy is organic. The small amount of soy in the entire bottle of soft gels may not pose a problem, but I have no data to support that idea.But if you already eat (non-organic) meat, wheat, corn, or soy (including any flours, beverages, or sweetener made from these), then this is a moot issue for you. In fact, my personal solution was to give this supplement to someone who already consumes Monsanto-based foods.Still, even if you are averse to soy (as I am) it is better to take this supplement than to leave UI untreated. Since the passing of the Unaffordable Care Act, millions of Americans no longer have access to medical care. We must look to products like this in the new DIY environment created by that blatantly illegal legislation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZAXQRAN56N5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4CT2BQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VZAXQRAN56N5","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product, Cellucor NO3 with Arginine Nitrate, is a preworkout supplement. It helps to know a few things about pre-workout supplement ingredients. Typically, they are:*L-Arginine. An amino acid that has vasodilator and other properties. This gives you ""pump"" and fullness. The previous version of NO3 did not have this in the nitrate form, the new version does. Another benefit of various L-arginine forms is they help boost your NO3 (nitrous oxide) levels, something that is hugely beneficial for recovery.*L-Alinine. This amino acid is more typically in the form of beta-alinine. For the typical gym rat, it has a mild effect. For a high-intensity trainer, the effects are quite strong. Basically, it will allow you to maximize tension on the muscle during the lift (especially on the negative portion) without getting the burn. You have to know what you're doing to get the real benefit; if you're they typical momentum-using rep counter, you're wasting your money on this. Used correctly, it increases your training capacity and thus the adaptive response.*Creatine. Contrary to popular myth, it's not going to make you super strong during your workout. Its effects come after your workout. Because it takes 30 to 60 minutes for creatine to be absorbed, taking it right before your workout is often good timing. If you train for intensity to get the adaptive response, your workout is done in 30 minutes or so. The problem there is creatine can give you a stomach ache. If you take it after your workout, you'll still get the benefits without the stomach ache.*Caffeine. If a preworkout supplement is advertised as providing ""intensity"" or ""focus"" that is code for ""seriously jacked up with way too much caffeine.""*Loads of vitamins. It's not clear why anybody adds these to a preworkout supplement. Correcting a vitamin deficiency is something you do over time. Intaking 8 times the RDA of various B vitamins is not going to affect your workout, except to maybe overload your kidneys and make you have to stop training so you can pee.Most preworkout supplements are not formulated with any logic behind them. But they do manage to include one or both of the two actually effective ingredients, which are the first two listed above. You can buy these separately, and if you want to avoid paying for ingredients that won't help you train better that is a good way to go. This is where NO3 comes in.If you use one supplement for ""pump"" (first bullet point above, and the space where NO3 lives) and another for increasing your training capacity, you can consistently build new muscle fibers (assuming you also have good nutrition and get adequate rest).I've used a different supplementation protocol for quite some time to achieve the desired effect (big vascularity and muscles swelling up during training). When I train chest, for example, I do straight-arm flyes with 55lb dumbbells. Considering I weigh barely over 150 lbs, that's a significant load. I go very, very slowly and this means I do three reps at most. During that first set, my pecs begin to fill with blood and they just keep getting bigger as I go. That's the effect of the training method combined with the right supplement.How does NO3 compare? I get similar results. I don't know if they are exactly the same, but they seem that way. This is a good supplement. Now, there is one thing that seemed like an insurmountable drawback at first. The absorption rates of the compounds in NO3 are quite slow compared to, say, that of Aginine Ethyl Ester HCL. You can't take this right before a workout and see anything happen. On the label, it says to take this on an empty stomach 60 to 90 minutes before training. This means you must take this supplement before a meal or not use it at all.Going with this limitation wasn't all that hard. For my morning training sessions for example, I would take this about 10 minutes before breakfast (about 30 minutes). Then about 15 minutes after breakfast I'd take my beta-alinine, then 15 minutes later hit the weights. After the workout, a post-workout drink (more beta-alinine, creatine, aminos mix). That would give me about an hour to get work done before meal number two.Since I work chest/tri, back/bi, and shoulders twice on their respective days, this meant another pre-meal ingestion for the afternoon workout. So before meal number three, down the hatch with those three caps. But that meal is a high-fiber meal, so I'd wait 30 minutes instead of 15 to take my beta-alinine. That leaves me still within the 90-minute window before having to start training and still get the benefit of the NO3.The nice thing about this long delay is there's less in your tummy during a workout. When doing something potentially nauseating like squats, that's a big help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146GT2BEEJEHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ849E2#wasThisHelpful","R146GT2BEEJEHV","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit is well-thought out, including from the crucial standpoint of safety (I write safety articles for trade magazines, and, yes, I wear both eye protection and hearing protection when operating a lawn mower). It comes with splash goggles and two pairs of protective gloves. They even tell you about the ""trick"" of putting on both pairs at the start of the job (something every person who works with paints and epoxies knows to do).The instructions are quite clear and easy to follow. I must admit I didn't quite follow, having gotten a little impatient with the first fill nozzle; instead of using low pressure and waiting as the video and the written instructions said to, I kept pumping. Oops, the stuff cam out that next hole a little too fast! Lesson learned, and easy enough to recover from.My big fear was I'd run out of the resin, but that didn't happen. This kit had exactly enough for the job. This did fix the leak. I waited until after several gully washers, including the worst mother of all rainstorms I have ever seen since living here, to write this review. The patch held up and no water came in.While this kit is pricey, it is worth its price. The savings over hiring a ""professional firm"" who likely will send a barely trained person to your home to do the job is huge. If you are careful about how you do your work, you will ensure the job is perfect and the leak will be permanently fixed; that's an advantage of this kit.However, I will state that if you're not the kind of person who has some craft capability (works with tools in any way), you probably should not tackle this job (or any other home repair job). The biggest part of any craft job is the preparation. That takes patience, methodology, and attention to detail; things you either learned from personal instruction or just don't get. If you don't have experience doing home repairs, car repairs, computer repairs or other sorts of ""pay attention to what you're doing and take the time to do it right"" hands-on work then don't attempt this job either. Hire a carpenter or your buddy who likes doing these sorts of things.The kit contains everything you need, except ventilation fans and a grease gun. If you're qualified to do this job, then you already have those things.These folks put a great deal of thought into this product, and that shows in many, many aspects. I can't think of any way to improve on this product.This job went so smoothly for me, I've let the neighbors know I'll be happy to fix their foundations if they need an assist. And, of course, I will insist that this kit be used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JF8I7J2CLLZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OP30L6#wasThisHelpful","R1JF8I7J2CLLZ9","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I started opening the consumer-friendly packaging, I was struck by the appearance of this lamp. The photos don't do it justice. I mentioned the consumer-friendly packaging because so many customer-hating companies encase their products in something resembling the material that Darth Vader had Whatzizhame encased in. Impenetrable stuff. This lamp was easy to remove from its packaging, even though the packing provided excellent protection. I have returned items for a refund in some cases, because I didn't want to have to deal with the idiotic packaging.OK, so I got this out and found two pieces. Instead of having to remove screws from a plastic bag or pull them off of uncooperative tape, I merely unscrewed these from where they go anyhow, inserted the lamp in the base, and reinserted the screws. Instructions on how to do this are provided, but really you don't need them if you can walk and chew gum at the same time.I was thinking this 27W fluorescent task lighting lamp system could replace the 40W incandescent task lighting lamp system I've been using for many years. It contains four fluorescent lamps (bulbs), and that design is one reason this system provides very diffuse lighting. You don't get any shadows with it. Shadows are a common problem with task lighting. Another common problem is the light isn't diffuse enough so you have to move the lamp while performing the task. Instead of giving you a small space of too much light (with the accompanying glare), this system adds to your ambient light across a sufficient area with sufficient extra light.The gooseneck adjusts across a wide range of positions, in all three planes of motion. Typically, you're going to use this as a down light but it's nice to know you can have other positions. You could, for example, use this to help light up a corner for cleaning or painting. Or increase the ambient light when you have folks over and want to take a picture without all that redeye from a flash. The list of uses goes on and on, though it's intended as as desk light.Another nice feature is the on/off switch. I've toggled this many times, just to see what fault I could find with it. It's located at the base of the gooseneck, instead of the base of the lamp, making it easy to get to. I've got this lamp system sitting behind my computer monitor, with the shade/lamp head extending out over a work area for paper. I can easily slide it back and forth as needed, and the location of the switch makes it convenient to turn it on and off instead of groping blindly trying to find it.While I really like the way this provides light, what I like most is the styling. And I am not a lamp person. For me to care about the styling, it has to be outstanding and in this case it truly is. It looks so cool! Kudos to V-light for a great design.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUO470ZEGT9K4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV41SJC#wasThisHelpful","RUO470ZEGT9K4","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy Caulk makes several variations of its basic product. The one I reviewed is for the kitchen, serving as a seal for the seam between the backsplash guard and the countertop. This is an important purpose; without that seal, you can easily get water (or other liquids or food) down into the countertop itself. Depending upon the material, this can mean a mold-growing countertop that falls apart or just a wet countertop. In either case, the water has to go somewhere and that typically means through the drawers or cabinets below and into the floor space. So you definitely need to seal that splash guard to the countertop.Another advantage of a good seal is it's one more barrier to ants, thereby discouraging them from coming into your kitchen. Of course, you still should spray ant killer into those pipe openings then seal them with an expanding foam.Splash guard seals come in many forms. The typical home builder or remodeler will simply caulk the seam where the backsplash panel meets the countertop. For those of us adept at caulking, this is the quick and inexpensive way to do the job. Just run a bead of (typically silicone) sealant along the seam and let it dry. If you're good at this, you'll leave a uniform bead that looks nice. The typical home owner or renter is not good at this, and runs a poor-looking bead then tries to fix it with a finger run along the seam. This seldom turns out looking good or working well.A problem with the caulk is it is subject to wear and tear. If you cover it with a physical guard, it will last much longer. In my own kitchen, I have a metal L-shaped guard. Each piece is cut to fit exactly that countertop length, and it's bonded in place with an epoxy. Doing that installation required precision measurement and cutting, plus I didn't like the smell of that epoxy. However, it looks good and will probably last the lifetime of that countertop. Still, it was not a project for a novice to attempt.The Easy Caulk product fills a void between the two methods just described. It is vastly superior to the caulking only method, but does not cost much more. It has that professionally finished look that I achieved with the metal strips, but is much easier to do.Easy Caulk does not market this as a ""slap it in where you need it"" product. I appreciate their honesty. The biggest part of replacing an existing seal is cleaning off the old one. If you had silicone caulking in there previously, no new caulking will stick (for long) unless you've completely removed the silicone film left by the old caulking. Inadequate preparation is the number one reason replacement jobs come out poorly.I recommend peeling off whatever you can, then scraping with a razor to get the surface free of particles. Then use a toothbrush and vinegar to clean. I recommend buying two brand new firm toothbrushes (you should always use a soft one on your teeth) for this purpose (throw them away when you're done). After you've scrubbed with the vinegar, wipe it dry with a cloth folded to get into the crack. Then repeat this exercise using the other toothbrush an isopropyl alcohol. On the box, Easy Caulk recommends a different method; it will also work just fine.The point is to remove the silicone film, not just the silicone caulk. If you fail to do this, the seal will peel away rather than stick. And you'll eventually get tired of various vain attempts to make it stick, opting to do the job over. It is better to take a little more time and do the job once every forty years than to keep doing it over and over too quickly.When installing, always work from the corner out rather than the other way around. Easy Caulk also mentions this on the box.The instructions on the box might make it appear as though this product is a pain to use. That is not at all the case. Any time you replace that seal, it's a pain regardless of what you're putting back in its place. You must make that place clean before trying to put anything back.If you're going to seal that kitchen splashguard seam and don't have the skill (and patience!) to custom-cut metal strips for that job, this product is your best choice. Also, I don't see why it would not work for bathroom sinks. I would not recommend it for a tub or shower, because it's not constructed in a way that really suits that purpose. The good news is Easy Caulk has a product that is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PWHOOOIKHZTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RBGZ48#wasThisHelpful","R2PWHOOOIKHZTY","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry, but this review is mostly subjective. I just don't have much data on which to base it. Some reasons why:*I can't see or measure what this product does. Because I already have a rigorous allergen reduction program, nothing new will take my home environment below the irritation level (it's already there) so that I can notice a difference. That doesn't mean this product doesn't work (it does work, as I will explain below), just that I can't provide data to show it does because the environment is not challenging enough.*Short version of previous point: This product DOES reduce allergens, but I can't quantify or even detect the effects.*The ingredients panel contains a mystery ingredient. But I can (and do, below) provide accurate commentary on the ingredients.I did make some observations, which I will share:*The spray operates reliably. I've used other spray products where you make a couple of squirts and then the nozzle clogs.*Unlike other reviewers, I found the fragrance to be strong. This may be because I don't use any inorganic-chemically fragranced products (any fragrances are from organic sources such as lavender) and thus have zero ""background noise.""*The previous point made, I also note that the smell diminishes rather quickly. Returning to a sprayed area after 15 minutes, I can't smell the fragrance.*Though the fragrance did not annoy my sinuses, I did not like it.*After spraying it around the queen's various catnapping spots (of course, without her there at the time), I did not get any howls or meows of protest. She is much more at peace with the fragrance than I am.*It did not appear to stain, discolor, or in any way damage a variety of fabrics on which it was tested. Generally, I sprayed into the air above the fabric-covered surface rather than directly onto the fabric.But, yes, it actually does work. Here's how I know. One way to reduce airborne allergens is to clump them. You can do this with a spray bottle of water or some light oil (e.g., citrus oil), or water with a little surfactant added. I have been doing this for years. Gee, this product contains water and a surfactant. Ergo, it works. I also contains some mystery ingredient called Allergen Blocker Complex. And it contains a fragrance.By spraying your clumping substance into the air, you cause airborne particles to stick together and fall ""out of suspension."" But you must clean up the clumped particles shortly thereafter or they'll break apart again and you're back to where you started if you disturb the area (the windage of walking past it is sufficient to disturb it).I recommend using this product in combination with other allergen control methods. For example:*I assume you always use allergen-rated filters for your vacuum cleaner; if not, get those. Sometimes, spray this in a room a few minutes before vacuuming that room. I say sometimes, because I also use baking soda to clean the carpet (apply an hour before vacuuming), and you probably don't want to spray this on that powder.*I also assume, if you are serious about pet dander, you have at least a couple of floor-standing HEPA filters in your home (I have several of these). Spray the air a few feet away from the intake side, to cause particles to clump a bit and be more easily drawn into that filter.*I also assume, if you are serious about pet dander, you have a ""high-efficiency"" (low particle size) filter for your HVAC system and you have the fan on RUN rather than AUTO. And that you change (or clean, as the case may be) this filter once it's discolored rather than waiting until it's clogged. If your pet occupies one or two rooms more than any other, use this spray a few feet from the cold air return(s) and then vacuum after waiting a few minutes. That will remove particles that would otherwise be drawn into your ductwork (where they become food for allergen-producing mites, etc.) and then into your expensive filter.The allergen in cat dander comes from the cat's saliva. So an alternative to using some sort of dander control product is to just lick the cat yourself. If anyone's trying this, let us all know how that turned out. As for me, I'm content to let the cat handle that job and I'll deal with the resulting dander. This product will help with that. Since the boss has no problem with the fragrance, and she is very picky about fragrances, I'm going to defer to her judgment on that issue and give Allergen Blocker a free pass on it. I guess it's a case of ""the cat-stomer is always right.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANHBYBW9IPWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX2N2U2#wasThisHelpful","R3ANHBYBW9IPWD","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When used as directed, the Professional Mangroomer delivers on its promises. I noticed other reviewers disparaged it but in their remarks it was clear they were not following the simple directions. Don't blame a product if you use it not as intended.This product and I did not get off to a great start, however. Following the ""be sadistic when packaging a product"" dictum, the folks at Mangroomer put this in one of those hot-sealed plastic tombs. That's bad enough, as these are notoriously difficult and dangerous to open. But that particular tomb would have made a good storage tray. All they had to do was tape it shut at one end. Instead of this tray, we have a device with attachments and no way to store them.So my first though was that if the packaging is so terrible can the product be any good? As it turned out, the product was fine (even though getting it out of its plastic was a bad user experience).Because I model for fitness photos, I need to remove hair for the photo shoots. I can reach my fingertips to any part of my body, but that flexibility is not enough to allow for easy shaving with a standard cartridge-type razor. I found a trick to making this more efficient, and that is to shave my back when it's dry. That also works for the front. But still, not very easy.With Mangroomer, I was able to do that shaving job efficiently. Because it's electric, it gives you audio feedback in the form of the hairs going ""zip zip"" and from that I can tell if the angle is correct.Contrary to some other reviewers' assertions, Mangroomer does not pull hair. But that assumes you use it correctly. I was able to get it to pull hair by simply going too fast. I also got the angle wrong when first working with it and felt those teeth that in two rows on the exterior boundary of the shaving area. By simply reducing pressure, I made this problem go away regardless of the angle.I have thick, curly hair. If anyone would have pulling problems with this device, I would. But as noted, no pulling unless used incorrectly.Because I have exceptional flexibility, the 6.5 inch length from handle tip to shaving blades is enough for me. I question whether it will be enough for a person of normal flexibility, should that person desire a cleanly shaven back. Some body shavers come with much longer handles. But for my purposes, it means no longer using a depilatory agent. Those depilatory creams and sprays irritate my skin, and sometimes cause me to break out in a rash. The Mangroomer doesn't irritate my skin at all. The packaging is the only irritating thing about this product.I like the fold-up charger and have to say this product has an overall handsome appearance. For something that costs about thirty bucks, the Mangroomer is punching well above its paygrade. It's a great value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359TZG100E3J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O50I7CE#wasThisHelpful","R359TZG100E3J3","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing I noticed is the consumer-friendly packaging. Far too many manufacturers won't hire a packaging engineer unless that person is a certified sadist. I have taken (or shipped) products back for a full refund when faced with such contempt for those buying it. At Crescent, the policy is obviously to make the customer happy and that extends to the packaging. I didn't need a chainsaw to open the packaging, how refreshing.Crescent and I go way, way back (about 50 years). I've got adjustable wrenches of various brands, but I have to say I get a glimmer in my eye when the one I pull out of that toolbox drawer is the Crescent brand. The company is famous for its adjustable wrenches the way Kleenex is for its facial tissue. I've got some other Crescent hand tools and have no complaints.Why should my comments really matter? Well, I've been collecting hand tools (mostly for automotive use) for over 50 years. I've used them expertly, having pit-crewed for two year at a circle track and another two at a drag strip. That's in addition to building street hot rods.Maybe you know someone who can, all by himself, remove the hood from a Camaro, disconnect everything, pull the engine, strip the engine down, move everything on the block to a new shortblock (making sure to properly torque those heads!), put the new engine in, hook everything back up, have it work flawlessly the first time, put the hood  back on and align it--without damaging anything. Fine, but I did that a week after breaking a finger (into three pieces). So I feel qualified to review a socket set.So, let's get this review on. Here we go. The set comes in a sturdy, well-designed plastic box. This does not surprise me, given it's a Crescent product. But the degree of sturdiness and good design is surprising compared to many similar kits on the market. This isn't one of those plastic boxes with thin hinges that will break or with a crappy internal tray that doesn't hold things in place and you need half an hour to get the thing closed again if you were brave enough to try using it in less than optimal conditions. This box, inside and out, is made to be used under whatever conditions the owner finds himself. Big kudos there. And it even has a hasp for locking! When the kit is packaged, there's a plastic pin in this hasp. I removed mine by squeezing the insert side with a pair of needle nose pliers.I've avoided 12-point sockets (keeping my collection small) for several reasons. Crescent has addressed all of them with this product. For example:*A leading competitor offers a lifetime warranty. If you break it, they replace it. But the sockets have such heavy, thick walls they are unusable in many applications. For example, I cannot use that competitor's sockets to change a spark plug because they are too fat to fit into the well where the plug is. Crescent uses a high-grade steel and can make very strong sockets with thin walls.*They slip. Like crazy. Back in my race car days, I called them ""nut rounders"" and refused to use them. In other applications, they were a necessity so on an ""as needed"" basis I splurged for a single socket from a high-end manufacturer just to have that one socket for the job. Crescent has a trade-marked feature that ""just about eliminates rounding of fasteners."" I think for a skilled mechanic, you can leave out the ""just about"" part. I think if you round fasteners with these, you're also going to round them with a run of the mill six-point version or maybe even with one of the higher-end brands.Another problem I have with many of my sockets is I cannot read the markings. I can distinguish a 9/16 from a 1/2 on sight, no need to read the markings. I can actually do that without even seeing the socket. But unfortunately, that is not the case with many of the oddball sizes I have in some of my socket sets. And as I built my metric collection on an as-needed basis, I didn't account for this so now have to use a bright light and reading glasses for anything other than a 10mm (which I know by feel).A problem I haven't had is ""cheap ratchet syndrome."" My dad started buying me tools before I was even in kindergarten, and he didn't want his little boy skinning up his knuckles or slipping the nut or bolthead while turning. So my ratchets have always been the high-quality type. When you pick one of them up, it has heft. Boy oh boy, does this Crescent ratchet have heft. Almost too much, which to me is a good thing.The ratchet has a quick release button on back. It also has one of the best direction switches I have ever seen. On most brands of ratchet, these are ambiguous so you can't tell what direction the wrench will turn or they easily move with the slightest bump so by the time you wedge that head into place it's turning the wrong direction. In my tool collection, I early on threw out (or took back) ratchets with such direction switches after having made the mistake of buying them without thinking about this aspect of the tool.The handle isn't knurled, but it is shaped in a way that should make that unnecessary. Since I clean all of my tools to pristine condition before putting them away, I prefer handles without the knurling.In addition to this well-made, ""outlast the owner"" ratchet, the kit contains:*10 sockets ranging from 7/16 to one inch. I have some smaller 1/2-inch drive sockets (but don't think I've ever used them) and some bigger ones; this is a good range for a smallish kit. Except for the one-inch socket, these are all 1-1/2 inches tall. The one-inch socket is 1-5/8 inches tall.*Three-inch socket extension.If you've already got a complete socket set, you might think also having this kit doesn't make much sense. But I don't see it that way.For one thing, I don't take my socket sets with me to do work outside of my garage (for example, doing a job for a friend at the friend's place). I don't have a pickup truck into which I can roll one of my rollaway toolboxes. What I do is use a separate hand-carry toolbox, then put everything back when I return. Now I can just pull this socket set out of the drawer and not have to worry.And because it is a set in a defined box, the mandatory tool count after the job is a breeze. At a glance you can tell if something's missing and not wonder, ""Did I bring that?"" In my case, the solution long ago was the socket caddy (have several of these, each for a different socket set).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27HU5RHKA56GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFKYSDG#wasThisHelpful","R27HU5RHKA56GV","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the presale description, this book sounded like it was aimed at the educated lay person or, at most level of detail/difficulty, the clinician treating the lay person for anxiety. That is not at all the case.And it's incorrectly described as ""accessible."" I read most books rather easily, regardless of the topic or how technical the book is. This book had me feeling lost and wondering what its point was. It was difficult to make it through page after page of dense, seemingly irrelevant text. It is one thing to explain a point, quite another to belabor it to death. LeDoux does not appear to understand the difference, going for the latter approach time and again.In the Preface, LeDoux said he wanted to write a textbook but found that approach was too restrictive. He said he was taking another approach. My question is, ""What happened to the book you were going to write using this other approach?"" I have read hundreds of undergraduate and graduate textbooks, on topics including biology, petrochemical engineering, accounting, electrical engineering, and law. These ""quant"" topics are difficult for most people to understand, but there are ""lay person"" books people can read to get a non-scholarly overview of the topic.What LeDoux produced is clearly a textbook. It's not the ""lay person"" book he indicated in the Preface. And it's not even very good as a textbook. It's incredibly dense with detail, most of which is distracting, boring, and seemingly irrelevant. He didn't write with the goal of communicating the topic, but it does seem he wrote with the goal of documenting his research.Among my readings have been many authoritative books on psychology (I am not talking about pop psychology) and a few on psychotherapy. Those were difficult for me to get through, as most of them were aimed at clinicians and I don't have the background to readily absorb that material. However, I think this book goes over the head of the typical clinician. I think it's aimed squarely at the researcher.I'd like to say, ""Hey, if you're a researcher you need to get this book!"" But since I am not a psychology researcher and don't attend conferences where researchers present their papers and don't subscribe to the ""PhD only"" journals that these people probably read, I can't evaluate this book against comparable literature.I'm also not sure this book hit on much of anything useful about anxiety. On that topic, I do have considerable background. My father had multiple anxious disorders, so early on in life I developed skills to cure my learned anxieties and not gain new ones. As I explained to a friend recently, when I say I feel anxiety about something, what I mean is there's a ripple in my pool of calm. It is, for me, anxiety. An analogy will make this point more clear. You can find a video of Ronnie Coleman doing deadlifts with 800 lbs. When Ronnie Coleman says he sometimes trains with light weights, he's still using weight that I could not lift even if I had help from a very strong friend. It's all relative.My point is I know a thing or two about anxiety and am walking proof of that. The only technique of mine that I found in this book is controlled breathing, something I learned as an athlete (and it was really emphasized when I began my studies in the martial arts and I emphasized this to my students also). And LeDoux mentioned this only after the reader survived wading through nearly three hundred mind-numbing pages to get to that spot in the text.So this book wasn't, ""This is anxiety and here's how you can handle it"". If not for my ability to control anxiety, I would have been anxious to finish reading it just to be done going through that experience.All of this is not to say LeDoux spewed forth some garbage book off the top of his head or from lab notes without any real effort. He obviously put a great deal of work into it, as evidenced by 40 pages of back notes and a bibliography that runs an astounding 91 pages. But then, this level of research also reinforces my point about how ""beyond academic"" this book is.The 317 pages of main body text could have been reduced to about half that length by omitting so much mind-numbing detail and over-explanation. Mark Twain famously quipped, ""Forgive me for the long letter. I didn't have time to write a short one."" If LeDoux had followed Twain's principle here, he'd have had a much better book. Instead, he filled the pages with stuff nobody but research PhDs would care about. I felt like he was writing at me instead of to me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1170N9KBXFBRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670015334#wasThisHelpful","R1170N9KBXFBRN","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using some type of protein bar, meal bar, or nutrition bar for more than 20 years. Not often, but when I don't have the convenience of being where I can make or obtain a non-toxic meal. For example, while traveling. Or at the typical social gathering where ""food"" is served; there's plenty of wheat, corn, and soy that the other folks are poisoning themselves with but nothing safe to eat. Knowing this will be the situation, I bring bars so I don't have to go hungry.Bar products are not ideal, nutritionally. But they are easily portable and that's what makes them great if they also pass certain other tests.One limitation of the bars is that to stabilize the protein, it's usually hydrolyzed. If not stabilized by that process, another process is used and no matter the process there is some degradation of the protein. This is the trade-off made to have portable protein. Try carrying a slab of meat around at room temperature for a day and you'll understand why this trade-off is necessary. It's a worthwhile trade-off if you are traveling or otherwise away from your normal sources of quality nutrition and need something.The main problem with bars generally is they are stuffed with corn syrup and other toxins, plus most have sugar and other garbage added. The reason for this is to make the bars taste better to those whose normal diet is limited to the normal two flavors that appeal to the typical American palate (over-sweetened and rancid fats).I've looked at the bars from every major supplement manufacturer who offers them, this poisoning of the product is standard practice. Not only does it make the bars addictive to the nutritionally-depraved, it also makes them cheaper to produce so the manufacturer's profits are larger. I don't understand why people are so willing to throw away their training just to ride the sugar train, but that is often the case. Not just with bars, but also with shakes and other supplements whose ingredients panel should have a big skull and crossbones on it.So what about this particular bar? I reviewed the ingredients panel before ordering these, and found that Health Warrior mostly respects the bodies of its customers. Here are those ingredients:Ancient Grain Blend (Chia, Oats, Organic Quinoa), Brown Rice Syrup, Pea Crisp (Pea Protein Isolate, Pea Starch, Rice Flour, Calcium Carbonate), Almonds, Organic Agave Syrup, Organic Dark Chocolate Chips (Organic Sugar, Organic Cocoa Liquor, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Vanilla), Coconut Flakes, Cocoa Powder, Arabic Gum, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt, Mixed Tocopherols (Natural Vitamin E).Let's take this apart. First, no problem with these ingredients:Ancient Grain Blend (Chia, Oats, Organic Quinoa), Pea Crisp (Pea Protein Isolate, Pea Starch, Rice Flour, Calcium Carbonate), Almonds,  Coconut Flakes, Cocoa Powder, Arabic Gum, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt.These are somewhat problematic:*Brown Rice Syrup. Depending on how much is in there, it's still a processed sugar. I'd say no real worries.*Organic Agave Syrup. Agave isn't the ""safe sweetener"" it's been hyped up to be. There's good coverage of this in the book, ""The Anti-cancer Diet"". Stevia would have been a better choice.*Organic Dark Chocolate Chips (Organic Sugar, Organic Cocoa Liquor, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Vanilla). Yet another sweetener. How many do they need? I'm not sure that it matters if sugar is organic; it's still sugar. Being organic does matter when the default is a GMO or heavily pesticided product.*Mixed Tocopherols (Natural Vitamin E). Vitamin E has been hyped up, but you want to be careful not to overdo it. Since I mentioned the book, ""The Anti-cancer Diet"" already as a source on one ingredient I'll recommend it as a source on this one also.With these ingredients, you get only 10 grams of protein. But you get 200 calories. That means to get enough protein to use this bar as a meal substitute. the typical athlete will have to greatly exceed his/her daily calorie limit to satisfy his/her protein needs.What about the taste and texture? Well, bars are always going to have that hydrolyzed protein texture, unless the manufacturer adds something like colon cancer causing hydrogenated oil (most of them do), but Health Warrior does not include that toxin. Still, it's a pleasant texture. The credit for that texture goes to the combination of ingredients that end up giving you 20% of your RDA for fiber in just one bar.Compared to the candy bars that are misrepresented as nutrition bars, this one has a complex flavor that is quite pleasing. They could do with a little less of the sweeteners and still have a good taste.They've also managed to keep the sodium low and they've done something to make the bar not require the normal ""wash it down with something"" that comes with even fairly good bars. That's a plus for the traveler, who might not always have access to water when it's time for a meal and the bar is the only thing readily available.Because of the protein to calorie ratio, I would not make this my main bar generally. I think it's good to add into your bar mix if you're traveling. Another great use for it is if you're involved in a calorie burn sport such as climbing. In that case, making this your main bar is a very good idea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X5T2T65ESUVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UO1WA8K#wasThisHelpful","R2X5T2T65ESUVL","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the box arrived from Amazon, I realized this shipment must be the one with the new cat food. My kitty loves getting packages, so I told her this one was for her. She came over to investigate, and suddenly became very animated. Apparently, she could smell the food through the shipping box. When I pulled the product bag out, she sniffed it and became ecstatic.It was clear she wanted this food, but she wanted it so much she blocked my way to where her dishes are. ""No waiting for going to the food dish, give it to me now!""This was a good omen. But I don't feed her anything toxic, such as wheat or corn or the new ""poison your pet"" darling, the potato. I don't eat these toxins myself, and certainly would not serve them to a trusting animal. I needed to read the package first even though I had read the label online (just making sure). And good discipline is essential for having a well-behaved cat (or dog). I wasn't going to start her eating just anywhere in the house.Not only did the product bag artwork, label, and text make it clear this is one of the (relatively few) non-toxic cat foods on the market, this is actually a super-food blend. It even contains the powerful anti-carcinogen turmeric.I feed this cat dry kibble, though she does get moist treats on occasion. She's an indoor cat who likes to go outside. So she does hunt and eat rabbits, chipmunks, birds, and other little critters.At 7.8 lbs, she's not a big cat but she is a lean, muscular athlete. This is because of her diet; ""Great bodies are made in the kitchen"" and ""You are what you eat.""She whoops all contenders in the territory fights, even those big males that are more than twice her size. And I've seen her make a six-foot vertical leap. One time, she even took a bird that was in mid-flight.The day the package arrived (but before it arrived), I took her to her vet for her annual exam and vaccinations. He always comments positively on how healthy she is and how clean her teeth are. In this age of a caries epidemic among pets, she doesn't even have tartar. The ""secret"" is the dry kibble I feed her. Not just the fact it's dry kibble as opposed to the (never feed to your cat) canned junk, but it's very high quality kibble. No sticky grains to start that plaque forming.(Note to parents of human children, this will work for your kids also. Take them completely off of processed grain, and they won't get cavities).Now, this cat has been on a salmon-only bend for most of her life. If I give her a kibble that isn't salmon, she sniffs at it and gives me a look of disgust. The problem I have with salmon is it's loaded with heavy metals these days. Humans should not eat it; doing so significantly raises your risk of pancreatic cancer (this fact is confirmed in the medical literature).So how do you get a salmon-fixated cat to eat something else? I had been pondering this for several months. When I ordered this food, I did so with a big risk that she would probably no eat it.As I noted, her behavior before even seeing this on her plate (her food goes on tea saucers, not in bowls) was a good omen. To my delight, she dug right in. When she was done, she let me know ""you done good"" by purring and rubbing the product bag in classic happy cat style (side of body, chin, top of head, side of body). She was letting me know she now had a new favorite food. Considering her fanaticism over her previous favorite food, this was really saying something.I took a taste for myself. That told me all I needed to know about her decision. This stuff is delicious! Looking again at the label, I noticed the similarities between how I feed myself (all nutrient-dense foods, no junk at all) and the formulation of this food. That's par for what I feed her, but some of the ingredients are new for her (for example, the turmeric). This food also takes a different approach from standard kibble. Instead of one dough extruded to make it, there are two. So you get two distinctly different nuggets in the same mix.One nugget is the ""whole-prey protein bites"" and the other is the ""living superfood""; as you can guess the latter has all the chia seeds, spinach, tomato pomace, etc., and the former has the chicken, chicken meal, etc.This even contains green tea extract (helps with lean body composition and is a powerful anti-oxidant) and spearmint extract (not sure of the health benefits, but it's good for one's breath).Here's the complete list of ingredients: Chicken, Chicken Meal, Chickpeas, Peas, Lentils, Chicken Liver, Chicken Hearts, Flaxseed, Pea Fiber, Tapioca Flour, Tomato Pomace, Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Natural Flavor, Beets, Coconut Oil, Cranberries, Choline Chloride, Turmeric, Calcium Carbonate, Chia Seeds, Vitamin E Supplement, Taurine, Zinc Proteinate, Spinach, Mixed Tocopherols added to preserve freshness, Broccoli, Ginger, Pumpkin, Parsley, Apples, Blueberries, Kale, Purple Carrots, Niacin, Iron Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Manganese Proteinate, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Inulin, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus casei Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus thermophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus bulgaricus Fermentation Product, Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract, Spearmint Extract. This is a naturally preserved product.We are both very happy with this product. It's what I'm buying her from now on. I realize the price tag is on the high side, but you get what you pay for. And this is well worth paying for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1AJNTX61L6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03HJC#wasThisHelpful","RW1AJNTX61L6K","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the typical American on the typical ""let's get sick"" diet, this book is a ""must read."" But it's not, despite the author's best intentions, 100% correct. With a few adjustments, however, it becomes an ideal reference. Dr. Khayat's writing style is highly accessible, and he makes every effort to be clear. His honesty and integrity are also important to him, and this shows in his writing.Dr. Khayat brings a mix of sound nutritional advice and poor nutritional advice, in this book. For example, he is adamant about drinking a particular fruit juice. Ask an endocrinologist about that; these experts on what happens when you rapidly ingest sugar in liquid form won't even debate any alleged health benefits from fruit juice. They say don't touch the stuff, no matter what it might hold in health benefits because those will cost you in other, serious health deficits.He advocates drinking cow's milk (except for men over 50). He is apparently unaware that the factory farmed cows who produce this milk all have mastitis. They are given antibiotics for this, which you drink in the milk along with the pus their infected mammaries pass into the milk. There are many reasons to not drink milk (other than organic milk). In his defense, things are done differently in France where his nutritionist resides.I'm not a doctor of any sort, but I haven't been sick since 1971 despite having an immune disorder from birth (cured in my 50s, after my own research and blood tests confirm this). The difference is that at a very early age I took ""you are what you eat"" very seriously. That has really paid off.Among his sound nutritional advice Dr. Khayat is very big on turmeric. He even mentioned combining it with pepper, something that multiplies (not merely adds) the cancer-killing effects of both spices. He did not mention that not only can you add ground turmeric to foods (which I do), but you can also consume turmeric capsules (which I do). He did mention to add it to ""everything,"" which is good advice because if you're eating six meals a day you can intake turmeric six times (if you're eating only three meals a day, you need to assess your eating habits).Generally where he's right is in his advocacy of eating many different fruits and vegetables and taking care how you prepare your foods. Generally where he's wrong is his misunderstanding of the frankengrains and their pernicious effects on health in general. If you combine this book with an authoritative book (or documentary) on the poisons we call ""wheat"" (it's not really wheat) and ""corn"" today, plus avoid fruit juices, you'll greatly reduce your cancer risk. Far, far more than he claims is possible.And that brings me to another point. He gives great advice, except as noted. But he goes on, late in the book, to minimize the cancer-fighting effects of a sensible diet. He says a 50% reduction in cancer risk from food choices alone is absurd. He's wrong about that.Here's why. About the only thing within your control is what you put into your mouth. You can not only reduce your self-inflicted risks to zero by eliminating toxic ""food"" from your diet, you can use real food to reduce risks that come from other sources.If you look at the threshold a given cocktails of risks must add up to for the total risk to become serious, it's well above zero. We can all agree on that. The exact number varies by individual.It depends upon your genetics, what's in your air and water, how you handle stress, what you wash your clothes in, and many other variables. It's the risk above this threshold that matters. If your threshold is 80% and diet accounts for 30% of risk, guess what? You can reduce your cancer risk to zero. It will remain zero until your threshold changes or some other risk factor increases so much your diet accounts for less than 20% (or some combination of the two).We know there's a threshold, because in a given population in a given location most risk factors are identical. Some people get cancer, some don't. Only genetics and personal choices (in food, household cleaners, fabrics worn, etc.) can account for the difference. The people who don't get cancer might all have superior genetics to those who don't, but that is truly stretching things to say that's the reason. Personal choices must be at play, and common sense tells us that food is the most important of these choices (you are made of the food you eat).Also, go to the grocery store and try this experiment. First, understand that how a body looks on the outside tells you a great deal about how well it's working on the inside. We gage this all the time; the ability to gage this is wired into our genes.Step 1. Look for fat people (it won't be hard to find them). Then look in their shopping carts. You will invariably find most of what they are buying is a processed wheat product and you are unlikely to see any vegetables other than iceberg lettuce. They'll have sodas and nearly everything they buy comes in a can (Dr. Khayat also gives canned vegetables kudos, which is wrong unless you don't mind eating lead and aluminum), bottle, box, or other container. Common health advice is ""read the label"" but if it comes in something with a label on it, that's your first clue it's probably unsafe to eat.Step 2. OK, now that you see how fat people eat, look for people with beautiful bodies and nice skin. The woman whose figure does Spandex proud or the guy whose chest is 14 inches bigger around than his waist. What is in their carts? Almost NOTHING that you find in the fat people carts. What you see in their carts came mostly from the produce aisle. And they have traditional oats instead of instant oats, no sodas, no snack cakes, etc.Step 3. Go visit the produce aisle, and look at the people shopping there. Then go look at the people shopping in the snack aisle where the chips and soda are. This also speaks volumes on the ""does food matter very much"" non-question. It does matter. You are what you eat.Dr. Khayat is highly credentialed. After having been suitably impressed by his Preface, I had higher hopes for this book. I think he needs to revise it, after carefully re-reading his own statement in the Introduction: ""The truth is that our eating habits, in the broadest sense, are in fact responsible for many of the cancers we get!""Exactly. And he should have hammered this point repeatedly instead of telling us at the end it hardly matters. Perhaps he ""dialed down"" expectations in response to the idiots and psychopaths who peddle hope with crazy diets, worthless (or even harmful) supplements (there are good supplements, too), and ""treatments"" that have no effect or that amount to slow torture.He's correct that eating sensibly does not provide iron-clad protection; something can always enter the picture to change the normal equation such that your food can't balance it anymore. But to say that eating sensibly is going to give you only a little protection is grossly mistaken.In a sense, his conclusion is correct because of the fact that (as he pointed out) cancers take a long time to grow from one single defective cell into a dangerous tumor. So if you have been eating from the snack and soda aisle for twenty years and then suddenly decide to eat sensibly you aren't going to be at 100% risk reduction in terms of getting a tumor. You've done the ""cancer cell growing"" thing for many years. It will take many more years before the results of that fade into nothing. But that is no reason not to start today. In fact, it makes starting today even more urgent.Here is my suggestion for what to do with this book. First, buy and read the book. But remember that fruit juice is out, along with wheat products. Next, go through your pantry and refrigerator and toss out anything that's processed. Don't give it away to the poor; it's poison, so toss it. Chips, soda, beer, pizza, any ""instant"" foods, anything that's processed. If you have nothing left after this, that means you've been growing cancer cells and ingesting toxins that affect you in other ways than cancer risk.Next, go to the grocery store and shop only in the produce aisle. After you get what you want, pick up whole grain rice and some dry beans (for the protein you'll need). Also buy several dozen eggs (Dr. Khayat recommends eggs, and he is quite right to do so). Buy any spices you want, making sure to buy plenty of turmeric. Eat only these foods for several months; for beverages, only green tea, coffee, or water. After you've given your body a few months of this, then re-read this book and see what foods you want to add into your diet. Given what's available on this ""strict"" regimen, you might not want to add anything. But this book is a great guide if you do (just no fruit juices or frankengrains).The bottom line is you need to control and reduce as many risk factors as you can. It is possible to make ""all good"" food choices; I know, because I have been doing that for decades. It's not hard at all.Making good food choices will just about eliminate your chances of getting any disease, including cancer. Doing that also has a very positive effect on your appearance. And there is also something to be said for enjoying the thousands of fantastic flavors in real food rather than limiting yourself to the two dominant flavors in the typical American diet: processed grain (sugars) and rancid fats.The text runs 193 pages. There's a useful appendix that lists foods with their anti-cancer benefits or risks, followed by a glossary and a list of abbreviations. This book is well-researched; in addition to the subject matter experts who contributed, it has 29 pages of notes. These are followed by an extensive index. The index is followed by a 21-page resource called ""Your Anti-Cancer Checklist.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119XH3DH1FTN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393088936#wasThisHelpful","R119XH3DH1FTN1","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this book. The authors deliver exactly what the title and subtitles (there are actually two) promise, and it's a good read. Unlike many of today's authors, they didn't use the writing of book on one topic as an excuse to advance their agenda on another. In fact, they didn't seem to advance any agenda other than to inform the reader.Many allegedly non-fiction works today are suffused with ample amounts of the author's personal opinions. Often, I find those opinions flatly wrong (and can prove it from the data). Jones and Flaxman didn't seem to present any personal opinions in this work, other than the obvious one--that they don't agree with the massive mind control and invasion of privacy we have today. Anyone reading the cover of this book would get that, so no foul there.They were brave enough to touch one of the ""third rail"" topics, namely how religions rely on mind control techniques. This isn't debatable, it just is. You can verify it by simply looking down a list of mind control techniques and checking off each one you find implemented in a particular religion. It's sometimes done subtly, sometimes not so subtly. If you belong to a religion that doesn't use these techniques, then congratulations. If your religion does use these techniques, you might want to think about why the leaders feel that's necessary.Of course, this book is not an attack on religions. I just mentioned that third rail because, as I said, they touch it. Just a tiny portion of what they go into. They also cover ancient mind control techniques, many of which are in use today. They cover modern mind control techniques, most of which were unimaginable in ancient times. Those are rather fascinating, and in general people are unaware that they are being manipulated like puppets.One of the great manipulators the authors address is television. I stopped watching television in 1990. I have a machine to wash my clothes and another one to wash my dishes. I don't need one to wash my brain, thank you very much. But a brainwashing machine it is, and in no small way. This review isn't the place to go into substantiating that claim, and the authors do a good job of that themselves. If you are making the mistake of exposing your mind to television, order this book with expedited shipping and read it as soon as it arrives. The new-found freedom you will gain, not to mention higher IQ and greater personal control over your thoughts and decisions, will easily justify the cost ten times over.Mind control isn't ""conspiracy theory"" though it typically does involve conspiracy. It's very real. And while, as the authors point out, it can be used for good purposes it is more often used for bad.A positive example of mind control is hypnosis to help a person quit smoking. But why was that person smoking in the first place? This particular drug habit is such a health disaster (number one cause of male impotence and over two dozen diseases) that no free-thinking person would ever do it. Smoking is an example of mind control. In this case, mind control (through misleading advertising, peer pressure, and addictive chemicals) causes a person to replace sane behavior with self-destructive (and therefore insane) behavior.What other types of mind control and negative behaviors are being inflicted on people? Read this book and find out. You may just discover you're a victim yourself, and you'll be taking a big step toward finding your way out.Then there's surveillance. Chapter 9 is titled, ""The United States of Surveillance"" and that's not a hyperbolic suggestion. It's an accurate observation. The degree of surveillance is shocking, yet most folks don't have any idea. Something else most folks don't understand is most of the surveillance inflicted on us is illegal. Read the Fourth Amendment (it's quoted in this book, so you won't have to look it up to ""get"" what the authors are telling you). When some federal agent searches through your phone records or uses technology that permits him (her) to observe you through the walls of your home but does not have a warrant, that is a gross violation of your civil liberties. And it's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.This book consists of nine chapters and a conclusion, which collectively occupy 196 pages. It also has a short Author's Note and a short Introduction. And it's indexed. It's also well-researched; the bibliography runs 8 pages. While the bibliography does include a few dubious sources, such as the ""we detest accuracy"" New York Times, it has some other fairly impressive sources. Plus, none of the book runs counter to what privacy advocates have been saying for a few years now.The mind control problem is pervasive. It's been a topic of great interest to me for a very long time and I often write pieces on some aspect of it in the Mindconnection newsletter. So I feel qualified to comment on a book that goes into this topic. I think it makes an excellent addition to the personal library of any thinking, self-actualized person.But it's desperately needed by those who aren't self-actualized, because those are the people who are truly in need of understanding and ending the mind control that enslaves them. Whether you think you might be such a person or not, I recommend reading this book. At the very least, you will be better able to help another person break free of mind control. Surveillance, not so much. We would need a lawful (federal) government if we want to fix that problem and we are nowhere near close to making that a reality.If you watch television, you already know one important step to take. Whether you simply unplug the thing or smash it with a sledgehammer, take that first step. Buying this book would be an excellent second step.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7TPXNI6IUB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601633580#wasThisHelpful","R2N7TPXNI6IUB8","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"reviewed an advance copy. It was an uncorrected proof, but even at that stage it had fewer copy errors than most finished books do. So mechanically, the team did a good job on this book.I don't follow any of the venues in which Mr. Brooks appears or is published, so this was my first exposure to him and to his thoughts. Noticeable in this book is most of the text doesn't reflect his thoughts. Most of it is story-telling, and I had a hard time seeing where each story was going in relation to the theme of the book. I had difficulty trying to get what point or points he was trying to make, because he seemed to digress as he told each story.Perhaps I did get what I presume to be his core point. If I understand him correctly, Brooks asserts there are two sides to us. There's Adam I (self-centered and self-aggrandizing) and there's Adam 2 (others-centered and self-effacing). Each story presumably illustrates one of these or both.In my own discussion style, I will often start off with a good example but then go on too long about that example, expanding it into its own story and diverting the entire discussion from the original point. A very good friend of mine, in exasperation, pointed this out to me (not for the first time) while I was reading this book. While such a story may be interesting in its own right, it can (and often does) derail the conversation by causing it to lose focus. The effect in a verbal conversation can be rather annoying t those whose communication style isn't story-based.Brooks did not convince me that the road character is the same as the road to the Adam II modality. When you hear the phrase, ""He's a man of character"" or ""I admire her for her high degree of character,"" what comes to mind? Can self-centered people possess character? When Martin Luther King said he dreamed of the day we would judge men not by the color of their skin, but by their character, what did he mean?If you scour the definitions presented in various dictionaries, you find it has to do with moral excellence and consistency of holding to moral values. So things such as your honesty in dealing with other people, your willingness to endure personal sacrifice rather than sacrifice your moral ideals, and being a ""solid citizen"" come to mind. Do they not?Brooks seems to be talking about something else. I'm not sure what it is, though. In some cases, I began to think he was proselytizing in a religious sense; he seemed to put a great deal of emphasis on religion. But morals don't derive from religion (though most religions do prescribe a moral code). The most immoral acts have been done in the name of religion, and continue to be done in the name of religion today. Many agnostics and atheists have outstanding character and very high morals. Many, admittedly, do not. Religiosity and moral fiber (or character) are two separate issues. Brooks doesn't see them as such.A point he makes both implicitly and explicitly is that prior to the end of World War II, Americans were, both individually and collectively, exemplars of culture characterized by others-centered and self-effacing (Adam II). But after the end of hostilities, Americans (according to Brooks) sank into a spoiled brat, self-centered, self-aggrandizing, me-me-me culture both individually and collectively. Members of the Greatest Generation were humble and effective, subsequent generations missed the mark by miles.But I don't find this point properly supported in his book. Nor do I find it supported in other literature or in my own observations. Any time you extrapolate from specific examples to the general, you're on dangerous ground. Each of his stories was a specific example. The extrapolations are non-sequitors. He didn't present meta data to support his claims, nor did he present a solid theory to support them (he did present a theory, but it's a weak one).He seems to be saying that Americans had character before the end of WWII and haven't had it since. He did highlight a difference in personal confidence that is probably true. After all, we won the war. Our economic competitors bombed each others' factories and infrastructure, while ours remained intact. This put FDR's Depression (brought on by excessive debt, something exacerbated ever since) on temporary hold, giving us an economic boom while they rebuilt. By the late 1950s, this reprieve ended; American employers were laying off workers in 1958. But what does this have to do with character?Humility is a virtue. But it's not a moral issue. Many people of high moral standards are not very humble about it. Some people have character in spades, and take great pride in that. Have you not encountered a judgmental person who strictly follows society's moral rules? They are everywhere, so of course you have. And what about self-important people who get things done in the name of moral virtue? Leaders are rarely humble people. Dynamic leaders never are. They are good, and they know it. That's one reason we follow them. Western civilization texts don't celebrate Alexander the Humble, they celebrate Alexander the Great.An acid test of Brooks' theory might be this. If Americans began lacking character after World War II because they sank into the Adam I condition, how did so many people have the moral fortitude to face attack dogs and fire hoses in Selma, Alabama? How did they have the steadfastness of character to hold so firmly to the nonresistance credo that they didn't fight back even when attacked with clubs? Think, and you can easily come up with many other examples of character since 1945.OK, so you probably ""get it"" that I think Brooks spent too much space storytelling and not enough making his point or expressing his own thoughts on character. As I read this, the meandering gave me the impression there were multiple authors and too many cooks in the kitchen. So I wasn't surprised at his comments in the acknowledgements. That's exactly what happened.So is the book even worth reading?Yes, it is. The book does make food for thought. However, it's really a collection of separate ideas (and stories) rather than a treatise on character. The stories, which mostly struck me as irrelevant, are interesting in their own right. The various ideas unrelated to character are also interesting, and are worth exploring separately. Just don't expect it to show you the road to character, because it doesn't.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R191TNKK8UVH2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R191TNKK8UVH2X","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This range extender provides huge additional coverage, and can easily solve such Wi-Fi issues as blind spots, weak signal areas, and ""outside the bubble"" problems. The typical small office encounters these more often than the typical home does. But if you're thinking of this for your home then you've probably been frustrated by taking your laptop to a neighbor's to show them some video or other great online find, only to discover your Wi-Fi doesn't reach far enough.So you go back home and download the video, then walk over to show your neighbor. Or if it's a Website, you go home and write down the URL then walk back over and then type it into the browser on their computer. Or maybe they decide to give you access as a guest, but that involves looking up their router settings and they can't remember where they filed that information. Now you can eliminate that entire series of wasted steps and just get on with sharing your great find.Before opening the box, I saw on its bottom that this has a two-year warranty and unlimited tech support (24 hrs a day, 7 days a week). That was the first sign that I was going to be in for a good user experience. Nobody puts out a two-year warranty unless their product is really well-made, and nobody provides unlimited tech support (especially in this product price range) unless they've made the product just about idiot-proof.From the moment I opened the package, I had one pleasant surprise after another. The attention to detail is amazing, and this is truly a quality product.Typically with tech gadgets you get one unpleasant surprise after another. It normally begins with a crappy package that requires the Jaws of Life to open. This came in a nice box that just slides open. From there, it got better.My first step in trying this out was to read the Quick Installation Guide. As the cover of this guide states, there are two options for set-up.Option One for set-up looked a bit complicated, but doable. By ""a bit complicated"" I mean only a bit. Mainly, it would consist of looking up my router settings and going through the same process I use when adding a device or user to my wireless network. The only reason this is ""a bit complicated"" is I have a secure network with user ID and password to enter so it's necessary to look up those settings.Then I read Option 2. I thought, ""You have got to be kidding."" Can it really be so simple? This option basically gives you a pushbutton method that automatically registers the extender if your router has a WPS button. I looked on the back of my router, and sure enough it has this button. I pushed it, and the extender then did exactly as the guide said it would. Gee, that took all of a quarter second....The next step is to move the extender to the desired location. I put mine in the farthest indoor position from my router.Without the extender, the range inside my home drops from five bars to four bars at the interior periphery. I lose the signal altogether when I get to about 1/3 across either next door neighbor's front yard on a line very close to the house (think horizontal) or to the backyard fence in a position directly across from my router (think horizontal) or to within about 15 feet of the farthest corner of my backyard (think diagonal).With the extender, I had 5 bars at all of these positions. I even had 5 bars across the street at their front door. I live mid-block, and I actually had to walk to the end of the block to get it to dip to 4 bars. This is far more range extension than I could have gotten by running another router off an Ethernet connection to my existing router (an idea I had been toying with, but that's a very long Ethernet cable). I had also looked at running a second router off the first wirelessly, but this seemed problematic at best.This extender is just a device that plugs into any household receptacle. You can move it around if you want to. So let's say you have a guest bedroom; you can run the device from there to get this huge coverage. If a guest stays and you don't want them to be bothered by the status lights, you can move this to the hallway; as a bonus, the status lights act as a free night light for your guest!While this extender is perfect for residential applications, I can also see how it solves problems in the typical small office. Let's say you own a small company with a dozen employees. The space you rent is in a strip mall style office park, and the shape is such that your router won't quite cover the whole area. A friend of mine has such an office; it has an upstairs plus a rear storage area. The typical router won't cover all of that, partly because there's so much steel in the way and partly because of the geometry/distance involved. He could plug this extender into any of several convenient places, and eliminate all the blind spots.I haven't evaluated other products in this category, so can't compare this to the competition. But given the quality, performance, price, and ease of set-up, I don't see a need to do that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CH12IUIUCBXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVD6CJY#wasThisHelpful","R3CH12IUIUCBXF","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book will help you think about your stewardship of water. Not just how you use what comes out of the faucet, but also what gets used to make the products you buy. For that reason, I think it's important to read this book. Though the text runs 120 pages, this book is a quick read because it's very graphics-heavy. A typical page has about 100 words on it, so except for the introduction and the conclusion the actual text length is less than that of a normal-sized magazine article.The subtitle promises shocking facts, but it's unclear from the text or the graphics where the author gets these from. I think it is best to use his ""facts"" as starting points and conduct your own additional research.In some cases, his facts are technically false but mostly right. For example, he claims that the earth has no more water than when the dinosaurs roamed, as if the planet were a closed system. The reality is the earth is not a closed system, and it has taken on additional water since the dinosaurs roamed. Astronomers have proven this beyond all doubt, and anyone who has watched a ""falling star"" has probably seen a water-bearing comet plunging to earth. Granted, this much water is not going to replenish our drying aquifers or other sources of fresh water, but the fact remains we do not have exactly the same amount of water on this planet as we did 30 million years ago.In other cases, he presents ""secret recipe"" numbers that we are to accept by faith. For example, he claims that producing one cotton shirt requires 2500 liters of water but producing one polyester shirt requires only 350 liters. How does he arrive at this figure? He does say in the introduction that these calculations might not be spot on, but in no case does he reveal his mysterious methodology. Since polyester is made from oil, and acquiring oil is very water-intensive, these figures cannot possibly be correct. Factor in something as water-costly as shale oil production or fracking (which the author covers), and the relationship is profoundly reversed. That polyester shirt is a water hog, compared to the cotton one.And it's worth noting that the cotton versus polyester thing is a false comparison in the first place. Polyester clothing stinks, which means people who wear it are likely to try to cover up the smell with water-consuming perfumes that are also toxic (promoting water-costly treatments for the illnesses resulting from taxing the liver with removing these toxins). I won't wear polyester, but not just because of the smell. In the electrical industry, it's a forbidden fabric because it melts so fast and when it melts it melts into the skin not just on it; the burns are horrific.It's also worth noting that he does not factor in the total (water) cost of ownership. If you properly care for a cotton shirt, it should last for decades. That is, use a non-abrasive detergent, use a fraction of the amount of detergent the bottle says to use (this not only prolongs the life of the fabric, it gets it cleaner), and don't completely dry it in a clothes dryer. This holds true for all natural fabrics, but cotton is a prime example. I've got cotton sheets that are over thirty years old and I have T-shirts that show no visible wear after twenty. Polyester, by contrast, starts pilling almost right away. And it looks tacky. I consider ""polyester clothing"" to be an oxymoron. But if you choose polyester, you are going to buy many replacements that would not be required if you chose cotton. So the water cost of polyester far outstrips that of cotton; this is exactly the opposite of the false conclusion the author reaches.Based on what I just said plus some other reasons, you have to take this book's ""facts"" and figures with a few grains of salt. In some cases, they give a totally misleading picture, as in the example just cited. In other cases, there is so much statistical deviation permitted by or inherent in the calculations that it doesn't matter which of two choices you make. For example, whether you eat an orange or a grapefruit will hardly matter in terms of water cost.But in other cases, it matters greatly. These cases are easy to discern. For example, eating meat. I have no idea why anyone in the United States continues to do this, considering how contaminated the meat supply is. I don't eat meat, wheat, corn, or soy, because these formerly safe foods are now very health-averse junk unfit for human consumption. Still, there are people who engage in this unhealthy behavior. It's not just unhealthy for the individual, it is also very water-costly.Another example is the stupidity of running water while grooming. I have never understood why some people cannot figure out how to operate a faucet more than twice in a given period of standing in front of a sink. What is so challenging about turning it off after wetting your beard, then turning it back on (then off) only to rinse the razor a few times and then turning it on (then off) to rinse your face? The amount of waste is staggering. This book contains many such examples, and regardless of the water use calculation methodology, these examples point the way to significantly less water usage.As a side note, I'm all over this already. My latest water bill showed usage that is 1/3 that of a ""moderate user."" One glaring way I ""waste"" water is I do organic gardening; else I'd be farther below that ""moderate"" line.Kansas summers are notoriously hot and dry. We actually get hotter than southern Florida, and many days the humidity runs about 15%. Plus there's a desiccating wind. I'm particular about how I water, to get the most benefit for my garden from the least water. I also wash my car, but again I use a methodology that minimizes water waste. In addition, I use a four-step sealing method to protect the paint and enhance the shine. Even years after it rolled off the dealer lot, the car outshines a brand new one. The author doesn't discuss how much water is consumed repainting or replacing a car whose exterior has not been properly maintained.Still, his core points are valid. We use far too much water, we could easily reduce the waste with some knowledge (which he provides) and some self-discipline. We won't solve the water shortage as long as many humans confuse themselves with rabbits and thus continue to overbreed and overpopulate the planet. But making smart choices can extend the water we do have, forestalling the day when we are simply out of potable water.One big step is to advocate to others that they boycott bottled water. Not only is this product extremely wasteful (as the author points out), buying it (nearly always) defies common sense for a list of reasons. Worse, companies like Nestle basically steal the water that they bottle and sell. Read up on the not so famous case in Wisconsin, which involved buying a superior court judge to overturn the legally correct and morally imperative decision of a lower court judge. When you buy bottled water, you support organized crime.The author provides a handy guide to other steps, most of which are very easy to take, in his eight-page water-saving tips section. He arranged the tips by bathroom, kitchen and laundry, outdoors, and lifestyle.While this book lacks the kind of academic rigor that would make it a solid work, it addresses one of the most important issues of our day. It provides keen insights and it provides helpful suggestions that all of us can follow to help save this very precious resource.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXB7BZJRPEWYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770852956#wasThisHelpful","RXB7BZJRPEWYO","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Except for working my back on my chinning bar, I dont do much with body weight exercises. One reason why is they generally dont give you the intensity you need for the adaptive response. Some body weight exercises are great finishers, for example doing slow, deep squats with body weight only after finishing a front squats/sissy squats routine.For the pecs, I have tried push-ups as a finisher but I dont get the range of motion. Normally, I do the bench and then flyes in the morning, and then in the afternoon I hit flyes again with 55lb dumbbells. I keep doing short-interval sets with as many slow reps as I can until I can do only one rep. Then I switch to 40-lb dumbbells. With the lighter weight, I stretch the pecs back and then squeeze slowly up; usually 3 or 4 sets of 2 or 3 reps. This works well; I have a 44 inch chest despite weighing barely over 150 lbs.But even this brutal workout doesnt recruit all of the fibers. That means Im still giving up some potential muscle growth. Push-ups at this point have not worked well for me. The main problems are the range of motion and the effects on the shoulder, hands, and wrists.These push-up handles solve these problems (and several others). For example, one reason I dont like push-ups is the negative effect on my palms and my wrists. These push-up aids put my wrist at an angle that prevents stressing the connective tissues and the pressure on my hands is spread out over more area. One reason I hadnt used a push-up device previously was I thought the surface area would be much less, but actually the opposite is true.OK, so any decent set of push-up handles will solve the problems I just discussed. So what makes these different?One really nice feature is they are stackable. I have my own Olympic weight set, which, even with an Olympic weight tree, takes up considerable space. Add to that the weight rack, triceps bar, etc., and the idea of adding more equipment quickly loses appeal. Anything occupying space in that training area has to really deserve to be there. These dont take up much room, and in fact Im able to store them on the little cart that also holds weight collars, bar pads, and other accessories.The handles come with a booklet that warns the user not to use these on linoleum and similar surfaces. The reason is if you are exercising the way most people do, you are likely to slip. Most people exercise with the goal of completing reps and sets, rather than working the muscles around a given joint (or set of joints). With proper form, you are not going to slip. But most people are nowhere close to proper form.So I decided to see how much force it would take to slide these across tile. It seems to be a little less than 10 lbs of lateral force. I would never generate anything like this doing push-ups, but thats because my form pretty much eliminates lateral force. Ive watched other people do push-ups, and most of them are focused on counting reps and that focus leads them to recruit their front and medial delts into what should be a pecs, biceps, and triceps exercise. This means they will slide on a tile floor.The same poor form exists in the bench press. Normally, when I correct the form of some guy who thinks he is bench pressing 220 because thats whats on the bar he can no longer lift it off the rack. When I drop the weight to 90 lbs, he has to struggle to do even one rep.The instructions also advise getting qualified instruction on how to use these training aids. Thats very good advice, given what I just said about the bench press.My first introduction to qualified instruction was when my grandfather showed me the right way to train pecs using the only device he trained pecs with. It was just a wheel with handles on it. Very brutal workout if you are working the muscles instead of just rolling it to say you rolled it X number of times. He had fairly impressive pecs even into his 70s.If you dont have weights, I think you could use these push-up aids for most of your upper body work. If you train to work the muscle and do slow reps with these, something else you will notice is your testosterone will be elevated for several days after your workout. Thats because the push-up is a compound exercise and when done correctly it takes a great deal of energy. That elevated testosterone signals your body to store calcium in the bones, burn fat, and build muscle. I dont know of anybody who objects to those three benefits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWMVFLTUEUM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBEVV8S#wasThisHelpful","R2FWMVFLTUEUM5","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These labels are beautiful, and a definite step up from the standard labels. My business uses this size label routinely, because we have to identify the language dictionaries on the translating scanning pens we sell and the product boxes are all the same. Obviously, we dont want something tacky like a handwritten sticker or a printed sticker thats hand-cut.A business reinforces the trust factor and reduces the chance of customers remorse with that initial presentation of the product when the shipping container is open. That's why so many manufacturers spend the extra money on artwork. An elegant label like this adds to that positive effect.I was impressed at how much better the finished box looked with this label versus the plain one. Something that I had a concern about was how well the material would perform in the printer. No problems there. The printing is crisp and clear.The one thing I dont like about the 90-label pack is the packaging.This can easily be improved. The outer envelope is plastic, instead of something green such as recycled paper. This plastic is a tight fit, so you cant use it for storing the labels. That means youre most likely going to store these in a file folder and the sheets will curve after a few weeks unless you clip the folder shut. To ensure you can see whats in it, you can wrap the Avery insert around the folder before clipping. Another solution is to buy the Avery 8164, which does come in a nice cardboard envelope. Use those up, then store these fancy labels in that envelope.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PM81DRMH7E2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZL23GU#wasThisHelpful","R2PM81DRMH7E2C","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start out by saying I'll be convinced that UFOs are extraterrestrial when all these people walking around with smartphones start producing real pictures and real videos. That does not mean I reject UFOs out of hand. It just means there is a huge chunk of ""should be there"" evidence missing.On the other hand, I question the official explanations that ""debunk"" current-day ""evidence"" and I also question the official explanations for the many artifacts (going back thousands of years) that ""debunk"" Erich Von Daniken and other writers. As a logician, I find these explanations don't pass the smell test. This doesn't mean Von Daniken is right; it would be a non-sequitor to reach that conclusion from the fact the official explanations fail. I'm just saying that nobody makes a conclusive case either way (though EVD makes very compelling arguments while his detractors make arguments that are intellectually insulting--at least in regard to the detractor arguments I have read).Regarding the tagline under the title of this book, conspiracy is a common attribute among national governments. Skullduggery is standard operating practice among governments. The stealing, lying, cheating, and other negative behavior endemic in these institutions is staggering both in its scope and in its cost to society. And it has been for thousands of years. In short, only a fool trusts them. Don't extrapolate from this that I'm an anarchist. I'm quite the opposite. I believe in the rule of law, but that concept is absent in most governments today (particularly in failed states with nondemocratic regimes--such as the USA).I also have to wonder about obvious questions such as why aliens would invest huge resources to visit this planet but then hide from humans except for a select few of low status and no influence. Think of how things would be with the shoe on the other foot. If humans visited another planet (or moon) with life, would we skulk around incognito? Granted, with the current situation in Washington, DC, there is the wry observation that these aliens are still looking for intelligent life on this planet. But humor aside, why would contact not be a momentous event? So I don't readily accept that we're being visited by folks from another planet.With that perspective in mind, let's proceed to discuss this book.If we were being visited by folks from another planet, they may have a compelling reason for coming here. If you're familiar with the Star Trek story, you know that the Vulcans waited to make first contact. They made it only after the first demonstration of warp drive. The reasoning there was humans were joining the league of seriously advanced civilizations at that point.But the same can be said for nuclear power, which seems to be the focus Salas has in this book. Setting aside von Daniken and other ""they came long ago"" theorists (I consider it a theory, not a mere postulation, and you need to understand the meaning of ""theory"" in science to get my meaning here), we see that UFO sightings really ramped up following World War II. Salas and many others attribute this to the fact this coincides with the dawn of nuclear power. But it also coincides with many other developments, such as jet propulsion, radar systems, and television. Some people try to ""correct"" me about television, stating it didn't happen until the 1950s. The fact is that the USA had an official, FCC-regulated network in 1941.My point here is that many things can explain the huge ramp-up of UFO sightings, including mass hysteria, approval-seeking behavior, and even ideas planted by television. Or it could be a combination of these factors plus activities due to technical developments such as jet propulsion.What about the abductions? It boggles the mind that aliens would go into people's homes, take them to a space ship, give them a rectal exam, and then bring them back home. That sounds more like something the IRS would do, but sans the space ship. I have two words that can give you more to think about on this topic: ""extraordinary rendition."" The USA ""government"" is no stranger to illegally abducting American citizens. I would look there, rather than to the cosmos, for an explanation of mysterious abductions.All that said, Salas could be right. And if our own species has no problem installing psychopaths into governments and those governments have no problem ignoring the dignity and rights of members of our own species, and those governments engage in abductions--what would bar aliens from doing the same thing? Or think of how those who study wildlife catch animals (or, in some cases, remove a hibernating bear from its den), examine them physically, then release them. We do this to those who live on our own planet. What would bar aliens from doing this to those who live on another planet?Also consider how violent the primates are. Chimpanzees have bloody, massacring wars between tribes. Humans do this also, taking the violence to a level of absurdity and psychopathy that should embarrass all of us. I note here that the main purveyors of this mass violence and destruction are ""governments"" rather than individuals.It doesn't follow that just because we routinely engage in savage insanity that intelligent beings from another planet do. Perhaps this is why they study us (as many presume) and why, in particular, they study us quite a bit since the advent of the nuclear age (as Salas presumes). Maybe they want to hide (as much as is practical) to avoid influencing our evolution or choices.These are the main themes (we are dangerous now, we need to be studied) that Salas explores in this book. Whether you believe in aliens or not, these themes are worth thinking about. And because of other evidence and occurrences, thinking about them in relation to extraterrestrials is also worthwhile. Salas presents that other evidence and describes several relevant incidents, making this a fascinating book.He cites several verified examples of nuclear arms facilities being inexplicably shut down. And these incidents happened while UFOs were present. An explanation other than extraterrestrials is possible, but I think you would really have to stretch the imagination to make it sensible.So to this ET doubter, the book is yet another nudge toward acceptance of ETs. I just need to see those photos and videos that are inexplicably missing.It's a good read, regardless of your views on ETs.This book consists of 9 chapters and an epilogue, running 195 pages. It also has a foreword, preface, and introduction. It's indexed and has bibliography that runs just over 6 and a half pages. Some of these references are unimpeachable, for example Science Magazine. A few are noted for not adhering to journalistic standards and thus spewing disinformation (e.g. Huffington Post). Salas also tapped personal memoirs of some people ""in the know"", in addition to books and websites. A pretty thorough job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EQFNC0S4EP1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601633424#wasThisHelpful","R2EQFNC0S4EP1I","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since starting with Website development in 1996, I have read many books on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is the third such book I have reviewed for Amazon. The other two are  CSS3 Foundations and HTML5 Foundations, by Ian Lunnt and Jon West, respectively. Among the many other Web development tomes I have, Jaworski's ""Mastering JavaScript"" is probably the most closely related to this book. With this background, I have some relative basis for judging the book in addition to judging it just on its own merits.Since the negative aspect is so small, let's just get that out of the way. As with other technical books, this one has its share of grammatical errors. Even so, the number of them is surprisingly small for this genre. And they don't interfere with comprehension.There's another negative aspect, but it's beyond the control of the author. Let me explain it with a similar situation. I write articles about the National Electrical Code (NEC). The current NEC runs 829 pages, not including its index. Obviously, the typical electrician doesn't carry a copy in his pants pocket. And the NEC is notoriously complex, difficult to understand, and tricky to apply.Many years ago, a colleague of mine (Fred Hartwell) gave an excellent presentation on an NEC topic. An attendee told Fred he hated the presentation, because it was too complicated and what Fred needed to do was focus his efforts on getting the NEC code-making panels to simplify the NEC. Fred responded that the application of electricity is complicated, and addressing those complications is what makes the NEC complicated. When Fred told me this story, I suggested we should get started right away simplifying electricity by eliminating a dozen or so laws of physics. Laugh, laugh....Complication is inherent in some topics, and thus with writing about them. So it is with any book on programming. Javascript, HTML, and CSS are really programming languages for Web developers. There is no way to make the explanation simple. That said, it is possible to lay the groundwork in a way that is simple enough for the reader to understand the basics. This is what Duckett does in this book. If you can understand the fundamentals of programming and particularly of JavaScript, then you can follow the more technical information presented in the book.But that can happen only with a clear, unrushed, ""start from the beginning"" explanation of these foundational concepts. And this is exactly how Duckett begins. The Introduction is lean on text, using a summary style to get the main points across quickly. I like the graphical organization technique used here. It helps move the reader right along, rather than bury you in dense prose or complex diagrams. If only authors of Calculus books would take this approach!And it's not just the smart use of graphics for organization that makes this book stand out visually. I don't think words can do it justice. Not even words like stunning or beautiful. You just have to see this book. The graphics aren't gratuitous eye candy, either. They aren't an afterthought slapped in there to meet the publisher's minimum graphics requirement. They are integral to the book. Jon manages to mix graphics and text in a way that makes less work for the reader. And they are really great graphics; the people who created these (and their names are disclosed on the Credit page) as masters in their respective crafts.Chapter One follows a similar pattern of graphics used to make the material more accessible, but with the complexity level raised a notch (as I think it should be). But it also raises the helpfulness of the graphical cues a notch. If you have zero programming or Web development experience, this chapter gets you in the game. If you've got that experience, this chapter makes for a good refresher.Chapter Two provides explanations and examples of simple JavaScript instructions. Something that Jon does as he goes along is point out which way is the preferred practice (and, usually, why). He also says you can do this or that, but it's a bad practice because it creates this or that problem; this is something that many coders never learn, and sloppy code is just a disaster waiting to happen.The next three chapters take you into a lot of jargon, and there a long stretches where it seems that all we're doing is learning vocabulary. For example, yada yada yada and we call that a function. Then yada yada yada and we call that a method. Then yada yada yada and we call that an object. While reading through this I was trying to think of how Jon could have done this part better. This issue takes us back to my earlier point about the NEC. Or another way of looking at it would be to imagine a medical student taking anatomy classes and not learning the names of muscles or other body structures. This just has to be done.Chapter 6 is about events; this is a key reason to use JavaScript. But if you didn't carefully read and thus understand the previous four chapters you will get lost here. Getting to the point where you can read and apply Chapter 6, however, is worth the effort. The payoff is you'll be able to adapt existing JavaScripts to do many useful things you want done on your Web pages. Or, with practice, you can write your own from scratch.Chapter 7 discusses JQuery. This language gets around some of the limitations of JavaScript, and thus it can be very useful to Web developers. Jon explains the what and why, using examples to help the reader understand.Chapter 8 is about Ajax and JSON, which might be useful for you. Ajax can load data into part of a page without requiring a refresh; applications for it are endless. JSON is a data format commonly used with Ajax.The next five (and final) chapters cover what I consider advanced topics. These include error handling, debugging, content panels (something I've implemented using Project Seven's scripts), filtering, searching, sorting, and forms.This book runs 622 pages (including the introduction). I doubt someone is going to sit down with this book (or any other) and become a fully competent JavaScript programmer. Once you get through the foundational material, the best way to use this book is to start doing projects that call for something it covers. Gee, you want an explanation box to appear when the user's mouse is over a word (this event is called a ""mouseover""). Turn to Chapter 6 and learn how to do that.So I see this book partly as a tutorial that gets you going, but mostly as a reference so you can build from there. Using its index and its table of  contents, you should be able to find exactly the guidance you need to get the job done.I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to go beyond basic HTML to make Web pages more compelling. There's no such thing as a ""light read"" in programming books, but Jon does an admirable job of bringing clarity to the subject of how to program in JavaScript.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVGSB0LXKVPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118531647#wasThisHelpful","RRVGSB0LXKVPL","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is an excellent commentary on the stupidity campaign that targets people who call themselves black. Liberal leaders (who aren't really liberal), in their usual way of mucking things up by pretending that reality does not exist, consequences do not follow their actions, and resources are infinite, have for some reason picked this particular minority to ""help.""It's worth noting that ""blacks"" make up 13% of the USA population while Italians make up about 6%. I am so grateful that liberals haven't decided to ""help"" us descendants of Italian immigrants.Also, it's worth noting that the n-word once included the Italians who came to America in the early 20th Century. So despised were my ancestors that Congress drafted laws aimed at preventing more of us from entering the country.RaceSince this book tackles racial issues, let's talk about race briefly. Race is an arbitrary concept. It has no basis in medical fact, though there are physical attributes by which people are commonly lumped into a particular ""race."" And what about the boundaries? At what point does a person become white or black? Did you know that Sicilians (my ethnic group) get sickle cell anemia? It's true, because even though we are required to check ""Caucasian"" on the race box our ancestors include the African Moors.Do your research on the origins of racial classification, and you quickly find there's no there there. So it's all bull---. As Dr. King said, let us judge a person by his character not by his skin color.Obama isn't blackBut if we are going to group people as ""black"" let's at least make it meaningful. Obama is not ""black"" and the lie that he is has served as a shield for his many egregious crimes. The first chapter of this book actually treats that lie as truth, and I think Mr. Riley erred in doing so. Some facts to consider:*  Obama's family had no history of slavery (Barry Soteoro, which is the President's legal name according to his Indonesian passport and there is no record of his changing it, is a first generation illegal immigrant whose father was a British subject on another continent).*  Obama has two Ivy League degrees, not exactly a member of the ""black culture.""*  Obama is a millionaire who has enjoyed many privileges that few others have enjoyed; not exactly a member of an oppressed class.*  Obama's mother is Irish-America, so if your thinking is so limited that you have to label everyone by race he is a mulatto not a black.*  Obama does not ""talk black"", so he's not ""one of us"" among those who talk this way.*  Just make a list of ten attributes that apply to a typical ""black"" person and you'll see Obama doesn't share a single one of them.You can look at ""black"" people who are remarkably successful, such as Kenneth Chenault at American Express. He has not used ""being black"" as a crutch; the man is simply awesome and is good at what he does. Through his good work, he has made more good-paying jobs available for people regardless of their race. Many, many such examples exist.DevastatingObama has been the most devastating and destructive president in our history, with--as Riley correctly pointed out--the fallout hitting ""blacks"" especially hard.Any capitalistic economy depends upon capital for its economic health. The more capital the government diverts from productive economic use, the sicker the economy becomes. This is simply how it is.Both World Wars combined cost us $2 trillion to execute. But in 2012 alone, Obama ran a SIX trillion spending deficit. His administration claimed it was ""only"" $1.2 trillion, but the GAO said that when you ""apply honest accounting methods"" it was actually $6 trillion. Contrast that to the deficits of other POTUS in the past 50 years and you see he is way, way way out there on the spending thing. Clinton had two years of budget surplus, by comparison.Drain capital from the economy this way, and it's the same effect as massively draining water from a swimming pool. It goes down.I would have saved the above commentary for last, but since the ""Obama is black"" issue came up in the first chapter I present that first. This is the only place where Riley errs. And the error is simply that of using the language used by the liars and con artists who would have us believe that what's historic about Obama's Presidency is that a descendent of plantation slaves is now the POTUS. It's a lie. There are many things historic about Obama's Presidency, such as increasing the federal debt by 80% in only five years or doubling the number of people on food stamps, but his being ""black"" isn't one of those things.In later chapters, Riley seems to acknowledge this. Now, let's move on to the other chapters.Riley's perspectiveIn the second chapter, Riley lays the foundation for his central thesis. The title of that chapter is ""Culture Matters.""People of color who don't feel bound by some arbitrary definition of themselves decline to accept the self-defeating victim culture in favor of improving themselves so they can thrive in the larger culture. Back in the early 1990s, Cleveland mayor Michael White (who happened to be ""black"") said on the Breakfast Club radio morning show that blacks need to get college degrees that would be valuable to employers. He pointed out that a manufacturer wouldn't have much use for a Black History major, but would have great use for an Engineering major. A friend of mine who is also ""black"" and is an outstandingly excellent engineer, said it was about time a black leader spoke this common sense.The reaction from the ""black community"" was to excoriate Mayor White. The typical cries of ""Uncle Tom"" went up and white liberals jumped in to criticize him. Now, think about this. Saying something that would actually help blacks got the mayor in trouble with the white liberals in town. This kind of pathology is what Riley talks about in his book. Understanding Chapter Two is essential to understanding why every point Riley makes is a dead accurate ray of sunshine into the darkness of liberal ""help"" for people who call themselves black.Some issues raisedOne issue Riley tackles is the racially discriminating college admissions process that counts being ""black"" as a plus. But there are only so many admission seats open, so it's a zero sum game. It's not just blacks and whites competing for the limited number of slots. Among other questions, Riley asks why it is somehow ""logical"" to punish Asian Americans for something some whites did to some blacks.Another issue he brings up is this infantilizing of blacks. I find this reprehensible. The assumption is that because a person is classified as ""black"" that person is too inept to handle his/her own affairs. This person needs ""help"" through discriminatory practices that tar him/her with a label of ""I made it not on competence and merit but on racial quotas so I'm not as good the whites I work with."" What kind of person thinks it's OK to label another person this way? It angers me that my enormously talented black engineer friend might, to those unfamiliar with him or his work, be thought of this way.I grew up in an unincorporated township. Some of my playmates were ""black"" though I didn't know until many years later that these people were supposed to be labeled as a different brand of human being. We had dogs who had puppies that came out in various colors. So the fact my playmates and I came in various hues just struck me as being no different from the fact they also came in various heights. Maybe this lack of training in racial stupidity during my formative years has blinded me to the ""need"" to identify and judge individuals based on their skin color.Well-intendedI've stopped giving the benefit of the doubt to failed liberal programs and policies that are presumably well-intended. The track record of profoundly negative consequences followed by a stream of yet more destined to fail programs and policies tells me that liberal leaders either have a zero IQ or they are malicious and getting exactly the negative consequences they intended. I'm giving them credit for at least a moron level of intelligence, and going with the malicious intention choice.Their efforts are not well-intended. They are malicious. You don't keep doing what causes great harm, unless you intend great harm. Or are just too stupid to know the difference. Our legal system does allow lenience for people whose IQ falls below a very low level, for example (I think) a person who is legally retarded is exempt from the death penalty in most (or maybe all) states that have that penalty.But many liberals hold jobs in academia and in elected office. Are they going to claim the retard defense? Or will they correct their reprehensible behavior?I think the problem here is not with liberals per se, but with malicious, hateful people who call themselves liberals and dress what they are doing in euphemisms and propaganda. The liberals who are ""in the laity"" often buy the lie (hook, line, and sinker) based on approval-seeking behavior rather than thoughtful analysis of the issues and the real facts pertinent to them.So let's not do any liberal bashing. Instead, we need the rank and file of the liberal crowd to stop accepting such lunacy as the ""help blacks"" programs that are having such devastating consequences. Don't let someone get by with inflicting this pathology simply because he dresses in sheep's clothing to falsely wear a label saying ""I am one of you"" while betraying every liberal ideal there is.If you're a liberal, this book is a ""must read."" I think for all other people, it's an important work that will leave you informed and able to correctly see how discrimination is hurting blacks (and others) today under the guise of ""helping"" people.Loud and clearIn the case of ""help"" for black people (even those who don't call themselves black), the pathology has gone way too far. It's time to stop the abuse. Voices like those of Thomas Sowell, whom scholar Paul Rosenberg says is ""the greatest commentator of our time"" need to be heard ""loud and clear.""Having read this book, I would add the voice of Jason L. Riley to that list of voices that need to be heard ""loud and clear."" This book is well-worth its cover price. It may help America become a civilized society, or at least one that does not single people out for abuse based on something as meaningless as what ""race"" they are labeled as.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V5ARE4N7YNA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594037256#wasThisHelpful","R2V5ARE4N7YNA5","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent toilet paper. You can actually save money by going with a premium paper rather than a cheap one; I will explain later in this review.Unlike some of the ""60 grit sandpaper"" products out there, Charmin Ultra Soft Toilet Paper provides ""burn protection."" It is very, very comfortable to use. But that's not my sole criterion. I looked at many factors and conducted several tests.Consider some attributes of the cheap toilet paper that employers mindlessly buy for their employee bathrooms:*Using it feels like you're getting your butt sandpapered. Not Charmin!*It may be rough, but it's also thin; so thin, your fingers poke right through it at the worst possible moment. Not Charmin!*Shreds on the roll, causing frustration and several minutes of tearing one sheet of a separated two-ply to get it back on track. Not Charmin!*Loaded with chemicals, such as fragrances and cheap oils. Not Charmin!*You might not convince your employer to show respect for its employees by using a quality toilet paper, but you can choose such a paper for at home use.How I tested thisMy first test was to tear off a square and wipe one lens of my reading glasses. Many tissue products, being made of low quality paper, contain cheap and toxic oils that make them seem softer. But you wipe this stuff into your behind, thus taking in chemicals suppository fashion. Because I don't want colorectal cancer, I use only unscented, un-lubricated bathroom tissue. Similarly, I use unscented, un-lubricated facial tissue.My second test was to just unroll some, reroll it back onto the roll, and repeat a few times. No problems here.My third test began by cleaning the toilet bowl with the toilet bowl brush, making sure to swipe the wet brush on the top of the bowl rim. Then I folded a sheet over twice and made a complete wipe of top of the rim. At no time did I feel the wetness below!My fourth test was something we need to apply to everything that comes out of the mouth of a politician. It's the smell test. While we just have to give up on the prospect of a politician's excuses or promises ever passing the smell test, we don't need to do that with our toilet paper.I could not smell any chemicals in this Charmin paper. It smells clean. Just to make sure, I recruited an assistant who happens to be a feline. She's very smell-sensitive and does not like ""bad odors."" For example, she'll chastise me if there is any onion smell whatsoever anywhere in the kitchen, until I get rid of it. She really hates anything that smells of chemicals. She sniffed the paper and then looked at me like, ""So what? You want me to eat this? It smells so bland.""Next, I applied the ""ass-id"" test. Now, I am already using an ultra-soft product produced by a competitor. So I have a ""gold standard"" by which to judge this Charmin product. It feels about the same.Trying to get more precise, I rubbed a sheet of each product through my fingers. Based on this, I gave a slight edge to the Charmin product.My final test, which is quite unfair to toilet tissue, was to tear off three sheets to approximate a facial tissue then use it as such. First irrigating my sinus passages with water, I then blew into the tissue. Of course, toilet paper is not meant to absorb this much moisture and so it failed the unfair moisture absorption part of this test. That's really too high of a bar, so this result can be ignored. What is important is whether the paper holds together after being thusly used. To my delight, it did!I've worked in a couple of different paper mills and understand how paper is made. Administering the test that I just described tells me quite a bit about the quality of the paper. This is some high quality stuff!Though the main intended use is to clean your behind, people wipe other body parts with toilet paper, also. And for many folks it even does double duty as facial tissue. A quality paper is always better than the cheap, low-quality stuff. It makes no sense that some people will easily squander money on such things as a $7 cup of coffee but then pinch pennies on toilet paper.Why it's importantPeople who eat a sensible diet by definition eat no processed grain. But we eat plenty of nutrient-dense, fiber-dense vegetables. Basically, we replace the ""grain"" part of the USDA's ""eat this way to become fat and sick"" food pyramid with green.This means several ""large emissions"" a day ""on the pot."" Of course, since there's plenty of fiber these sessions don't last long because fiber speeds movement through the system and you're just ""dropping a load"" rather than coaxing it out the way processed grain addicts must do.And, things are much cleaner for a variety of reasons. Still, you need to wipe when done. Two squares stacked on top of each other (vs a massive wad) does the job if you are on a sensible diet. If you eat right, you don't need much toilet paper. But you do need good toilet paper.Something like 30% of what comes out is bacteria, and of course fiber moving through the colon is cleansing everything. Grain addicts have a huge amount of colon plaque, while non-addicts almost never have any plaque. Just to give you a sense of how bad this gets, the average 53-year old American male has 6 lbs of undigested red meat fermenting in his lower bowels.This buildup is basically a cancer factory and emitter of toxic chemicals. That's one of two main reasons why colon cancer is now an epidemic (the other reason is most processed grain baked goods also contain hydrogenated oil, which is hugely carcinogenic). And as anyone can tell with a sniff test, there's a huge difference in odor between what comes out of a grain addict's behind and what comes out of a sensible eater's behind. If you're a grain addict, you do not want your fingers to poke through the paper.Even if you do eat sensibly, you don't want to poke your hands through cheap paper when you go; it's just gross. With Charmin Ultra Soft, that aint gonna happen.Saving moneyBy using a premium, soft paper you will use less paper per session versus trying to get by with a cheap paper. Based on the price differential versus the usage differential, it is more cost-effective to use the premium paper.The adage, ""If you don't have your health, you don't have anything"" does not resonate with most Americans. We are a profoundly unhealthy country, and it's due mostly (99%) to the food choices people make. Just based on my regular visual survey at the grocery store checkout lines (seeing what people are buying to put into their carts and thus their bodies), I would say less than 20% of Americans make sensible food choices. Anyone can change that problem instantly for him/her self, by shopping in the produce aisle instead of in the many aisles that exist for hawking processed grain products.Eating in a manner that isn't health-averse hugely saves you money (and tremendous misery). Choosing a toilet paper that fits a sensible food choice lifestyle also saves you money while increasing your comfort factor. Even if you choose the disease lifestyle, you'll find this paper a good choice just on the comfort factor alone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTRJ7J5QXBKRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNYXJ4E#wasThisHelpful","RTRJ7J5QXBKRA","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It might be easy to confuse this title with ""Think Smart"" by Dr. Restak. The two books are unrelated. The Restak book is based on medical research into the plasticity of the brain. This book is based upon the author's practical experience with critical thinking methodology.Think Smarter is an excellent addition to the existing literature on thinking, problem-solving, and intelligence (yes, all of those topics). I also recommend it for managers, engineers, programmers, executives, policy-wonks, and others who are frequently confronted by tough problems. Thinking your way to a good solution is not normal for people in these positions, it's exceptional. If you hold one of these positions, applying what you learn in this book can make your performance exceptional.Perhaps due to the author's practical, hands-on background, this book is practical in its presentation. That's true in several ways, such as these:* He keeps it concise. This is a hallmark of good instruction guides, manuals, and tutorials; all of which are practical in nature.* It contains no wild theories.* Every recommendation is doable by the intended audience.* The examples are realistic and representative of what the reader is likely to encounter when needing the tool set provided.* The language is practical, e.g., ""tool set.""A possible criticism of this book is it doesn't give you a ""best practices"" formula that any idiot can follow. If it did, it wouldn't be a book about thinking. So people who are looking for some 10-step system that they can implement without having to think are just out of luck. Personally, I consider this ""defect"" to be a huge plus. Many books on management, leadership, problem-solving, and similar topics are reductionist in what they actually cover, surrounding the ""meat"" of the book with long forays into the author's non-expertise based opinions on unrelated topics. In Think Smarter, you find that Kellet focused on helping the reader to develop thinking skills and to develop the ability to apply those skills in a practical manner.That last part is, er, critical. You can be the smartest person in the room but if you're not in tune with the situation you may have zero effect. Kallet provides many examples of how to apply critical thinking in a practical manner when you are part of a team. Rather than, for example, assert that the other person is wrong a more effective technique is to ask that person why he reached his particular conclusion. This can stimulate conversation that leads to better outcomes.Kallet has an accessible, engaging writing style. It is clear from how he writes that he has mentored other individuals. It is also clear that he is confident in his knowledge, because he uses simple language rather than trying to puff himself up with needless verbal complexity. So I found this book enjoyable in addition to being informative.But what about the content? Does Kallet really know what he's talking about? Or is this just a mental version of the many diet books that don't offer workable solutions? First, Kallet does have real-world experience. He runs a decade-old company that trains business leaders in critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity. That's a pretty good indication he's an expert.I give his information two thumbs-up, but does my opinion mean anything? I had quite an impressive track record as a plant engineer, wrote the Mindconnection problem-solving course, write a regular column on troubleshooting (for a trade magazine), and publish a brainpower newsletter twice a month. So, yeah, if I like what somebody says about thinking methodology that's probably a good endorsement.Now, here's one more thing to consider. Most people simply do not think, and that has serious implications.Thinking is a purposeful endeavor, and most of us are on auto-pilot. All the time. That's due to several reasons, including chronic sleep deprivation (rare is the individual who gets adequate sleep, according to the Sleep Institute). But maybe the main reason is few of us get the training needed to enable us to think in a systematic way. So the results of thinking (improperly) are no better than the results of not thinking at all. Thus, not bothering with thinking is the better choice because it takes less effort.This book solves that problem for you, by showing you how to think both competently (get the right answer) and effectively (make the solution happen). The effort you put out for thinking will pay off, thus making it worth doing.Really good thinkers in the USA are maybe 8% of the population. Suppose we could flip that ratio around, so really good thinkers are 92%.Would the crooks who currently get ""voted"" into office be able to get elected in nation of thinkers? Nope. Would we have an IRS terrorizing the populace while pretending to have something to do with funding the government? Nope. Would the national debt have increased 80% in just five years (starting in January, 2009)? Nope. Would unemployment be at its current level of 51% in the USA (that is the actual number, as only 49% of working age adults have jobs)? Nope. Thinking doesn't solve every ill, but the major problems we have today have resulted from a profound failure to think at all.On a personal level, just look back at poor decisions you have made. What if you had been able to think your way to good decisions, instead? How would this ability be life-changing, going forward?Competent thinking can pay off not just for the individual, but for society as a whole. If you purchase this book and incorporate what Kallet teaches, you will be part of the solution. Think about THAT for a while.This book consists of an introduction and 34 short chapters spanning 207 pages. This book is worth reading from cover to cover. But when you're done, keep it around as a reference and go back to it every so often to see where you can improve. You'll be glad you did. Better yet, buy a second copy for a a friend and make a point of co-mentoring each other on thinking better. Just have a 30-minute phone call on a regular basis (e.g., twice a week) to share your success stories and your ""oops moments.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NZ00XZTXVFWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118729838#wasThisHelpful","R3NZ00XZTXVFWW","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My feline companion is a real treasure, and I know many other people feel the same way about their companion animals. My first line of defense in keeping her healthy is to make sure that her kibble is free of wheat, corn, and soy. If you are reading this and don't know why that is so extremely important, then you have serious problems in your own diet and need to address those. Do your research, and start by looking up endocrine disruptors and neurotoxins. These do not belong in anyone's diet.I first came across this outstanding product at the local grocery store. Then they stopped carrying it. So I tried a similar formulation from a local pet store; it tasted quite similar to One Beyond. But it was not One Beyond, and this did not go over well with ""the boss."" Every time I served it to her, I got that ""look of disgust"" that cats seem to have a patent on. I let three neighborhood dogs try a handful of it, and they were ecstatic. Sigh. Cats are so picky.When the similar food ran low, I bought another bag of One Beyond. I gave the remainder of the other food to those dogs as treats. Note that this is real food, not the garbage most people feed their cats, so it will not make dogs sick to eat it. People, either.So my darling is back on One Beyond, but it's not available locally as far as I can tell. Amazon has it, so that's where I go for it.If your cat has not tried this food and you'd like to get an increase in nose kisses, order a bag of it. But be prepared to re-order, because your cat will probably not settle for anything less ever again.When you absolutely, positively, want the best cat food--here it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHM4OKWPNPQH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IN4LLO#wasThisHelpful","RHM4OKWPNPQH1","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of many Nick Redfern books I have reviewed. Others include The World's Weirdest Places and Keep Out, but I don't think any of the Redfern books that I've reviewed are similar in subject matter.I enjoy Redfern's books for several reasons. One is his somewhat hyperbolic writing style. As an editor (magazine articles), I normally find this grating to the point of intolerability, but for some reason I really enjoy it when Redfern does it. Only with one book did he go too far with this, and in Close Encounters he found his rhythm again.Because of Redfern's writing style and word combinations, I feel transported back to my youth, when I listened to Radio Mystery Theater or heard Rod Serling make his commentaries on episodes of The Twilight zone. Few can master this, and Nick Redfern has done so.Another reason I always enjoy Redfern books is the amazing research behind each one. These books are full of arcane facts. Maybe it's his writing style that permits the reader to enjoyably absorb them all, or maybe it's that writing style combined with how he threads them together combined with the fact they are downright interesting.This was, as usual for a Redfern book, a good read.In Close Encounters of the Fatal Kind, Redfern discusses 18 different accounts of mysterious death (or deaths, because in some accounts there are several deaths that are oddly related to a particular incident).As the cover art and subtitle suggest, a major theme here is UFOs. Actually, the theme is the many mysterious deaths related to UFOs and to such things as the Strategic Defense Initiative (Reagan's ""Star Wars"" system), which, according to Redfern, appears to be UFO-related.Maybe one or two of these deaths would not create a pattern with noticing. But when you gather these up, the sheer preponderance of them raises a red flag. And as you start delving into individual cases, things just get curiouser and curiouser.Some of these cases are surprising, at least to me. For example, I was surprised to find out that UFO concerns had something to do with the demise of James Forrestal. I had previously understood the reason for his demise was his insistence that we take care of the Soviet Union problem following WWII. Such insistence is probably why General Patton emerged unscathed from the battlefield only to die in a car ""accident."" A study of the Forrestal story would be quite interesting. We get only a slice of it in this book.As usual, Redfern digs up information that even avid readers can't have encountered already, adds in some things only the best informed of us already know, and stitches it all into a compelling page-turner of a narrative.As usual, there's the standard government cover-up in many of the bizarre stories. But then, we've come to expect lying and killing from a government that treats the law the way a dog treats a fire hydrant. So references to Men In Black, cover-ups that must have originated in high places, very questionable ""suicides"", and citizens inexplicably disappearing do not surprise anybody who has been paying attention.Perhaps a 13-page bibliography is excessive for a text that runs only 191 pages. But perhaps Redfern is deeply committed to doing an awesome job of actually knowing what he's talking about. For Nick Redfern, a freakishly long bibliography is normal.Is he just listing sources, regardless of their quality? Maybe some sources are dubious (for example, he lists the Huffington Post in his bibliography). But he steers clear of noted disinformation sources such as the New York Times (I didn't see it listed in a scan-through looking for it, and apologize if it is).Many of today's ""non-fiction"" authors are in the employ of state-run media outlets and seem incapable of differentiating fact from fiction. They have a particular worldview that arises from a lack of critical thinking skills, and from an insular way of accessing information (they access disinformation, almost exclusively). Consequently, their works are riddled with factual and logical errors. I have yet to catch Redfern producing such a work. Considering how many Redfern books I have read and how varied the topics are, that is saying a lot.Redfern just won't present something as fact unless he's verified it as such. Most major news outlets seem to take the opposite approach!The book is also indexed, which is helpful for those using it as a reference text. Given how loaded this book is with facts, that could be very helpful in discussions with others when such discussions turn to the many mysterious deaths of UFO researchers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PKP9XMF96OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601633114#wasThisHelpful","R30PKP9XMF96OI","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LED flashlights have been around for a few years, now. We usually recognize them by their honeycomb-looking array of small LEDs. And, like some of the people you have to deal with, they aren't very bright.However, this flashlight uses a single LED as the lamp. And it is stunningly bright. The output is 220 lumens. If you use an Li-Ion battery, it will cast the beam 171 meters (560 ft). I didn't test this distance with this or any other battery type; it's the mfr's spec. What I can tell you is that beam goes really far. Whatever the exact distance might be, it's impressive just from eyeballing.Now, this is not the 5 D cell Mag light that I carry in my car. You aren't going to be able to bash an attacker over the head with this or use it as a baton to stop a knife attack. In fact, at about 4 inches long it fits nicely into my fist. So maybe don't count it completely out as a weapon. But I think its main purpose is to be a dependable, very bright, multi-purpose portable light.It reminds me of the Mag lights that I own, because of these features:*Spare bulb in battery compartment cap.*Constructed of aluminum (not sure if it's aircraft grade, as used by Mag).*Adjustable focus (turn the barrel) from ""light the room up"" flood to an awfully narrow spotlight.*Adjustable intensity, from low to high.*On/off switch, separate from focus or intensity adjustment.*Water-resistant.*Shock-resistant.*Black color. Not a selling feature particularly, but my Mags are all black so it reminds me of them for that reason also (Mag makes lights in several colors, it's just that when I bought my Mags you could get any color as long as it was black).An additional feature is that it has a clip you can attach to a shoulder strap, pocket, or possibly a belt loop. This isn't one of those cheap ""watch me break, sucker"" plastic clips like the one on the SanDisk MP3 player, several models of Panasonic cordless phones, and other products that become far less useful once the clip is gone. This is a metal clip, and it is attached in a substantial manner.The flashlight's extreme output and light weight combined with its clip make it a great choice for hiking, biking, climbing, camping, and other outdoor activities. I think it would also make sense to clip one to a door pocket in your car. It's also a great light to have around the house for those inevitable power outages. Keep one by your bed, and you can temporarily blind a home intruder while you reach for your ""equalizer"".For climbers, this clip is not going to work with a 'biner but probably you can attach it to your harness. I did test it on my harness and found a few places it could clip to. It will not open wide enough to attach to the 'biner clips on  your harness.It accepts one AA battery, which is perfect for me because I use rechargeable AAs in all my AA-using items. In this flashlight, you can use an AA alkaline, NiMH rechargeable, or Li-Ion rechargeable battery. You'll get about an hour of output per battery. So if going on an outing, carry spare batteries. If using as an emergency flashlight, keep a bank of charged batteries ready.The fact this has an AA battery is a huge selling point for me because I have a ""rotate the batteries through the queue"" system for rechargeable AA batteries. Too bad nearly all smoke alarm manufacturers insist on 9V batteries; that's a bad design decision that is wasteful and toxic to the environment. Because this has AAs, I can just rotate the battery through my queue of AA batteries. That is much better than buying replacement batteries and sending the old ones to a landfill that will leach the toxic components out probably into somebody's drinking water. Use rechargeables whenever possible.The lamp should last at least 100,000 hours before you need to replace it. That's the standard spec for this type of lamp. It's actually quite a bit of run time. It might even be more hours than it takes you to file you federal 1040 taxes every year.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7DX15SQSA7UZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEMUOWU#wasThisHelpful","R7DX15SQSA7UZ","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best leadership books to come along in a long time. It's at the opposite end of the scale from Who Cut the Cheese or whatever that silly book was. A common theme in the leadership literature is some formula for how you can be a great leader. Another common theme is a set of requirements (usually 10) that you need to meet if you want to be a great leader. But we can look at great leaders like Ken Chenault at American Express or the late Steve Jobs of Apple fame and we see they did just fine without fitting the specific idea the author has in mind for what a great leader should be.In my own experience, I have worked under great leaders who also didn't fit the prescribed mode. But somehow, they managed to instill loyalty, motivate the troops, and avoid disasters. I have arguably been such a leader myself, though plagued by faults that are tsk-tsk'd in the leadership literature and not possessing the ""must have"" traits espoused therein either.Now I understand what the missing ingredient is. And it's an essential ingredient. While most leadership books try to tell you what you need to be and how you need to change, this one is telling you that you have to work with what you've got and be aware that it's never enough. You are going to have blind spots. How you deal with them is what matters.If this sounds crazy, then think about driving a car. You have blind spots. Being aware of them and taking appropriate measures is how you avoid having a nasty collision. The same concept applies in business leadership. I think it also applies in leadership positions outside of business; for example, how a parent leads a child (there are no omniscient parents).It's not a situation of ""Gee, I might have blindspots so I need to get rid of them."" You won't get rid of them. The key to success is understanding what your particular blindspots are (and what the blindspots are of those on whom you depend) and making allowances for those blindspots. It's not a matter of eliminating them, but of working around them.In business leadership positions, blindspots arise for a variety of reasons. Some are situational. Some are just the flip-side of the leader's own strengths. On that latter, Shaw uses the example of Steve Jobs. Basically, whatever is your strong point as a leader is also going to be your source of blindspots. For example, a highly analytical leader is likely to rely heavily on analysis and miss subtler cues. Shaw provides several case examples that illustrate this point.The introduction alone is hugely edifying and instructive. Don't skip over it. The main text of this book consists of three sections.In the first section, Shaw explains why blindspots matter. He talks about the dangers and rewards they present (Chapter 1), how to spot them in yourself and others (Chapter 2), the common ones that hold leaders back (Chapter 3) and why they are an ever-present challenge. There's no distilled sound-bite takeaway from this section (or the other two). I would be doing this section an injustice if I attempted to summarize it. But I can highlight something.In the fourth chapter, Shaw discusses, dissects, and illustrates (sorry, but all those verbs really do apply here) twenty blindspots that he has seen in his work with leaders. Now, just to be clear, this isn't a list of ""the"" twenty blindspots. And he doesn't say something along the lines of ""fix these twenty blindspots and you'll be a great leader."" A given leader who crashes and burns might do so because of having just one of these blindspots, while a successful leader might have five of them but is able to deal with them effectively.In the second section, Shaw explains how to identify (he uses the term ""surface"") and overcome blindspots. This takes up five chapters (five through nine). Same logic as in Section 1. Highlighting something for this review, in Chapter 6 he discusses seeking out that which disconfirms what you believe. This is actually an aspect of critical thinking, and it's something people are generally very resistant to do. Included in Shaw's advice on this are specific techniques any leader can implement.In both sections, Shaw frequently uses tables to help the reader more easily assimilate and mentally organize the information. These are quite helpful.So what about Section 3? It's titled ""Additional Resources"" and is organized into four appendices: Resource A, B, C, and D.Resource A: Blindspot Q&A. So you get done reading the book, and some questions are still in your mind. Following the FAQ model, Shaw presents likely questions, immediately followed by the answer.Resource B is a self-assessment. If you're looking for something that gives you a grade you can brag about, this isn't it. The idea of this assessment isn't to give you a false pat on the back, but to help you identify where you have blindspots. We all have them. They are neither good nor bad, so no shame there. What matters is knowing what yours are and then making allowances for them. This self-assessment helps you do exactly that.Resource C is a feedback worksheet you can use if you are seeking help from others in soliciting honest feedback. One use I see for this is you could use it in place of face to face discussions and make it anonymous. I think you still need those face to face discussions, but as Shaw repeatedly points out, people don't like to take the risk of telling their boss what he's doing wrong. So for this purpose, a worksheet can help remove the fear factor so you get the actionable and honest feedback you need.Resource D is a useful take on the traditional reading list. Each suggested resource is accompanied by a paragraph explaining why Shaw recommends it.This book also has extensive backnotes and an index. Something I look at in notes and bibliographies is the caliber of the references. Shaw took his research seriously. If you take your leadership challenge seriously and want to excel as a leader, this book will help you do that.This took less time to read than I had anticipated, because it's really not very long. I don't like length for length's sake, so I'm glad Shaw didn't feel obligated to add a couple hundred pages of filler just to get thud factor. His writing style is clear, and the text is accessible to leaders at any level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SQDXDSLVDYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118646290#wasThisHelpful","R21SQDXDSLVDYR","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an insightful book that brings attention to a serious problem. I disagree with some of the authors' views and arguments, and will explain why momentarily. Overall, I think this book is a valuable addition to the literature.One of the things I especially like about the authors' approach is they use real-life incidents and situations to illustrate their points. Often in books that deal with social topics, you get a lot of theory and supposition but not much hard data and not much connection to the real world. Those academic books are fine for stimulating academic thought, but they don't help you see what's really going on.As an example, an academic book might be based on studies and interviews to see what people think about how Coca-Cola values the environment. This book looks at the actual efforts of that corporation and actual programs it has implemented.Now, understand that the main product line of this corporation is ""osteoporosis in a can"" (or plastic bottle). So while the corporation does make some effort to make people feel better about what they do with the cans and bottles, the fact remains that this company hugely adds to waste disposal problems by peddling its poison in those containers. An honest solution would be for Coca Cola to exit that market entirely, and devote its resources to products that add value rather than destroy the bone health of its customers.Think about that for a moment. Do you see the conflict, there? This ""doing good at the margins"" while ""engaging in destructive behavior generally"" is the hypocrisy the authors are talking about in this book. Increasingly, people go along with token efforts and/or marketing hype in place of real reform. Most people just don't think about it very much, and thus just don't get it.Often, people don't see that the math just doesn't work the way they are led to believe it does. I like to explain to ""liberals"" (their mislabeling of their views, not mine) that when the organized crime cartel known as (much of the) ""the federal government"" takes $100 from you and gives back a dollar, you are not a dollar richer. You are ninety-nine dollars poorer. This same math applies to the corporatization of activism. It really amounts to a marketing effort that deflects any meaningful change in the status quo. In the case of the federal crime cartel (that occupies or runs much of the federal government), trillions of dollars flow to a few corporations while leaving the American people with staggering debt.Where the authors err is their equating of corporatism to capitalism. These are not at all the same thing. Capitalism is, by its very nature, a meritocracy. In a capitalist system, if you make a product that people want and sell it at a reasonable price, they will reward you for your efforts and competence by paying you for your product. Or, if you are incompetent you don't get those rewards; you have to adapt or die.The problem that people of low ability and/or character have with capitalism is it's a meritocracy. This is why they expend so much effort to subvert it.If you're ""stuck"" in a capitalist system and you're not particularly competent or industrious but are particularly greedy, you need to find a way to cheat. A level playing field is your enemy, so you to skew things in your favor. Enter, big government (aka, force). In the United States, we do not have a representative democracy or a democratic republic. We have a corporate oligarchy. And it uses military force against citizens to get its way. We have seen this in countless examples, including those the authors mention in this book. That is not capitalism.This oligarchy is why we see the same family dynasties over and over in our fake federal ""elections"" (choose between gangster A or gangster B, both working for the same criminal employers). And not just in the fake elections. Look up the name ""Biddle."" It appears in the bank battles fought by Andrew Jackson and, surprise surprise, the 2008 banking crime spree.This oligarchy is also why, for example, nobody went to jail for the egregious financial crime committed in 2008. The ""too big to fail"" lie was actually ""too big to jail."" Do a Bing or Yahoo search (please don't use Google, which violates its own guidelines and is more ad spam server than search engine) for the video where Senator Elizabeth Warren asked a simple question in a hearing. The employees of the Injustice Department gave her non-answers that are almost comical in their idiocy.So to demonize capitalism does not help. It is the solution, not the problem.Capitalism cannot exist without a legal structure that greatly dampens cheating. We do not have that legal structure, because the cheats simply ignore the law and nothing happens to them for doing so. We get what the analyst Jerome St Cyr calls ""unbridled capitalism,"" by which he means an ""anything goes"" environment that is toxic to ethical companies.The solution to that error in this book is to just add ""unbridled"" before the word ""capitalism"" wherever you see it appear. This unbridled capitalism has largely displaced honest dealings and real capitalism while falsely calling itself capitalism.Another area in which I have some disagreement with the authors is their view that playing nice with the evil-doers is selling out. In many ways it is, and they give real examples that prove this point. But as the saying goes, you can catch more bees with honey than with vinegar.A corporate take-over of America followed the war between the states. It was briefly interrupted by Teddy Roosevelt, who was shot in the chest while giving a speech about this very problem--ask yourself why schoolchildren aren't taught this and you get a keen insight into the reality in which we live.Since that take-over, it has become very difficult to get anything done by simply opposing the criminals. The authors themselves gave several examples of how this just didn't work. One example was the anti-bankster protest in Philadelphia. The police there egregiously violated the First Amendment rights of the protestors.Of course, First Amendment rights are just a fantasy in the United States. Speak up too much, and the Institute of Reprobates and Sociopaths will be on your back or some other group of ""government"" psychopaths will get their jollies silencing you. And that is why out and out protest are usually too dangerous and too ineffective to work in this country.In some rare cases, they do work. The civil rights movement that began after Wilson's second world war gained momentum in the 1950s and led to important legislative and judicial victories under President Eisenhower. The 1960s were more famous in this regard, most notably for Dr. King's stirring speeches, the bus boycott, and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1965, and 1968. But that was a highly organized, effort sustained over decades. And at root was the fact that the Constitution does not protect the civil liberties of some people while denying the civil liberties of other people. In other words, the basic tenet of that movement was a priori in the supreme law of the land.A movement to, for example, stop the externalizing of costs by corporations that dump toxic waste into a pit next to a school (real case) has much less going for it and isn't going to succeed. Even boycotts, once a powerful weapon for change, are fairly ineffective. First of all, even if it caused a particular brand to get no customers it would have little effect on a large conglomerate. Secondly the sheer number of zombies ready to ignore criminal misconduct means the brand won't suffer more than maybe a 1% drop. To verify this, just drive by any BP station or Wal-Mart.Those who want change will need to work from within to get it. The danger of working from within is the very ideals of those wanting change are prone to compromise. While incremental change of the offender is better than no change at all, change works both ways.And there's the other issue of being satisfied that you're doing something. But what are you really doing? I am very impressed with how the authors delve into this issue. As an example, they talk about how consumers can buy products that have some sort of eco payback. In one case, they looked at how Bono (rock star from the band U2) urges people to consume more of a particular item because every dollar they spend on it is helping. But the math simply does not work.Another aspect is when companies push an ""eco"" product and consumers buy it under the mistaken notion they are spending their dollars on better products so they are doing their part. An example (not given by the authors) of such a product is a dishwasher liquid made by Palmolive. It's their Eco brand, and the ""Eco"" features prominently on the container. It's phosphate-free so it won't contribute to the algaeal bloom problem.However, it contains chlorine bleach--totally lethal to fish and a powerful carcinogen to humans. Calling this an eco product is a lie. Yet, consumers buy this product because they think they are helping the environment. Worse, it forms a hard scale inside the dishwasher, causing premature failure of the appliance. So the consumer replaces the appliance with another one manufactured with environmentally damaging methods.BTW, Seventh Generation makes a dishwashing gel that is actually eco-friendly and is easy on your dishwasher.You don't have to be a raving lunatic to be an activist. But you don't have to ""sleep with the enemy"" to be an effective activist, either. There is a middle ground. I was thinking of this throughout my reading, and discovered much to my delight that the authors made this very point at the end of the book. You aren't ""doing your part"" by engaging in the PR stunt kind of activism that Bono helps promote.Nor by the way, are you doing your part by going along with environment-damaging, energy-wasting scams like installing CFLs in your home. Many environmental activists have been pushing CFLs, but they are badly disinformed about this particular technology.  It's better to shut lights off, use high-efficiency incandescent lamps (""bulbs""), and use controls such as timers and dimmers.The solution to the common problem of ""being led down the garden path"" is really think about your decisions and become informed rather than disinformed. What can you do to actually reduce your own negative effects, and why are those reduced? Look at all of your options, rather than just jump onto something that sounds good and doesn't take much thought or effort.What about political activism? Since we don't have a political system in the USA (at least not in the federal realm), you again have to think outside the ""low effort"" box. Choosing between Criminal A and Criminal B on the rigged ballot is not a choice; you are merely sending a message that you approve of the crime and nothing changes except the rhetoric.If you want to have any sort of actual influence, you need to join a group that is putting pressure on our mis-legislators to do something right for a change. For example, repeal16.org seeks to end the long reign of terror inflicted by a particular group of psychopaths. That long-overdue change is not going to happen by dint of non-choices made in a fake election.Similarly, low-effort ""contributions"" such as buying more of a bad product because the manufacturer tosses a few pennies at a charity aren't really helping. Boycotting those products altogether might not make a real difference, but you are doing your part and setting an example.If you drive a fuel-efficient car and combine your trips, you personally aren't going to end the pollution crisis or the energy crisis. But you are doing your part and setting an example. That's important. And sometimes, this kind of effort pays off. Look at the demise of Circuit City, a welcome change in the retail space due to consumer activism; people began following the examples set by activists who were incensed over the racism, age-ism, and other morally bankrupt practices of this company.You don't get an actual vote at the ""election"" polls, but you do get one at the cash register. Sometimes, enough people vote intelligently that way and we get change. And, of course, there are many other decisions you can make to help bring about positive change.I don't totally decry the making of bedfellows in activism. However, the authors correctly point out that it is hugely watering down the forces for positive change. I think if people are aware of this danger, they can make adjustments that help bring about the desired results. This book raises that awareness, and it does so in a way that is well beyond the superficial.If you're a corporate ""insider,"" thinking about the issues raised in this book will help you be alert to ""whitewashing"" and other such efforts arising from the corporatization of activism. You will know to ask some tough questions and help steer thinking along positive lines.Maybe you can help your corporation work with activists rather than absorb them into nullification. There are many examples of corporations that have done this and are still doing it. Even some federal government agencies have embraced and enhanced activist goals to produce very positive outcomes. A good sequel to this book would be a book about those success stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LVJOW3HGOBNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKGABJ6#wasThisHelpful","R1LVJOW3HGOBNO","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Any book on this particular topic is likely to get a two or three star rating and is nearly guaranteed to max out at a four. The reason? Most authors on this sort of topic follow the ""if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" approach. They have a particular expertise, and it makes a lens through which they see the problem. Their particular take on the subject may be very effective for some people, but it's incomplete. It may help in some other situations, be useless in some, or maybe even do more harm than good.So how did Dr. Roth manage to pull off a five star rating?By not doing what most authors on this sort of topic do. He repeatedly states he does have his own bias, so you might expect him to laud the virtues and superiority of allopathic medical treatments. Drugs, surgery, and not much else. But he doesn't do that.The core concept of the book is ""developing your core,"" a concept that most elite athletes have embraced for many years because a weak core has negative implications for your athletic performance.But it's also a concept germane to physical health. The ""normal"" decline we see in strength, mobility, and general vigor doesn't need to invariably begin in our mid-twenties. It can, through proper diet and consistent, programmatic training of the body's core, be delayed for two, three, or even four decades. As can the chronic aches and pains (mostly of the back) that afflict so many people.So, OK, a surgeon prescribes a cohesive exercise plan. Unusual, but still not a balanced approach. For example, what about chiropractic? Dr. Roth covers that, also. In fact, he describes its benefits as ""amazing"". But as with the many other treatments he discusses, he puts it into context rather than claiming to have ""the"" answer to back pain. Yes, programmatically working that core to keep it strong and supple is his main ""cure"" but he puts that into context also.I discussed this book with a retired medical professional. Coincidentally, she had seen Dr. Roth on The Dr. Oz Show. She's had two spinal fusions, a surgery that Dr. Roth performs. She said she'd been able to delay this surgery for quite a few years, using many of the treatments and techniques described in this book. Notably, she didn't do the core training. Maybe if she had....Very early in the book, Dr. Roth makes it clear that back pain (of some sort) is a normal part of being bipedal. You can't really end it, per se. But you can change the dynamics of it quite dramatically. You can dramatically reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of recurring pain episodes, for example. If you have chronic back pain, you can reduce its intensity and (very likely) change it to periodic rather than chronic.You have many tools at your disposal to make these improvements a reality for you. The problem for the typical back pain sufferer is finding an expert who can make the right diagnosis and point you in the right direction for treatment. This is where most of us go wrong. I personally happened to luck out by finding a chiropractor (Dr. Anderson) who has Dr. Roth's viewpoint.Dr. Anderson sees chiropractic as one part of a much larger tool chest and as part of a larger strategy. Most chiropractic patients see it as a ""cure"" for an acute back pain episode. That's what typically gets them into the chiropractor, but when their pain's gone they stop going. ""Who is this guy who is recommending these exercises and asking about my diet?""About 20 years into his practice, Dr. Anderson founded Anderson Physical Medicine, a clinic that provides a range of services (not just chiropractic and not just for the back) and treatments. Dr. Roth discusses many of them in this book.But it's unusual to find someone to help you navigate the maze of choices, and often the advice a patient gets is simply wrong. Fortunately, Dr. Roth provides guidance on this rather large issue in the last four chapters of the book.This book consists of an introduction and eight chapters, spanning 226 pages. In the introduction, Dr. Roth discusses how he discovered the hidden core. Here, he also discusses some aspects of training it, such as with the Roman Chair and kettleballs.The first chapter delves into the difference between health care and disease care. This distinction is lost on nearly everybody, and most notably with the Unaffordable Health Care Act which (in a failing way that defies basic mathematics) addresses disease care / medical care insurance but severely undermines health care. In this second chapter, Dr. Roth is basically saying you don't wait until you have pain to go about taking care of your back.Chapter two discusses pain, and chapter three prepares you for understanding the hidden core workout by explaining the anatomy of the back and why things work the way they do.Chapter four very nicely describes the Hidden Core Workout, and provides illustrative photos of each exercise being performed. The routine is a good one. If you gain the understanding from chapter three, you can modify this as you see fit to keep things from getting stale.But don't just change things without that understanding. Just to illustrate, I sometimes travel and so visit a gym to train with weights. I see people doing things that make no sense from a biomechanical training standpoint and many of these things are actually dangerous. They have changed an exercise without having a clue as to what they are doing. Don't make that mistake.If you're not well-versed in training principles, find someone who is. A qualified instructor in yoga, martial arts (most of them, anyhow), or weight training can guide you. What's critical is that you understand what exactly you're trying to work so that you actually work it (and safely) as a result of the form you're using to perform the exercise. You must know some anatomy and you must understand a fairly long list of training principles, else you're just engaging in trial and error. And it will be mostly error.This book has a logical flow to it. The first four chapters are really about health. That is, what you do to make your back far less prone to problems.The next three chapters are about medicine. That is, what you do to solve the problems that come up despite your best efforts at health. The chapter title are as follows:5. Diagnostic: A DIY Guide.6. The Nonsurgical Treatment of Back Pain.7. Surgery.The final chapter is ""The Back Genome,"" and it's a forward-looking take on how we might use information technology to build a sort of blueprint for accurately diagnosing any individual's back problems and developing a treatment plan. This would be accomplished by matching similar characteristics of many individuals.These characteristics include such personal data as height, weight, body composition, age, occupation, desired activities, and so forth. These are the characteristics that make diagnosis and recommended treatment good for one person but bad for another.Earlier in this review, I noted that Dr. Roth is basically saying you don't wait until you have pain to go about taking care of your back. So this book isn't primarily for those who have chronic back pain and want to end it. It's primarily for those who want a healthy back so they don't end up with back pain as a ""normal"" part of a miserable daily life.I will note here that Dr. Roth's Hidden Core Workout has benefits going well beyond creating a sort of shield against back pain. You can expect such benefits as improved circulation, improved physical appearance (in most cases, greatly so), and improved function of the vital organs.This workout also helps raise testosterone, the master hormone that signals the body to store calcium in the bones and reduce body fat. How can anyone not want those two benefits?Another, very important benefit is the relaxation effect. Not only is this exercise a good way to work off stress, but it induces the release of endorphins. So you get a double benefit.I mentioned improved appearance. Dr. Roth doesn't go into this in any detail. So this particular benefit might not register with some people. Have you ever noticed that some individual in a group, say at a party, just seems to have presence and stand out from everyone else? Take a closer look next time. The reason (in nearly all cases) is powerful posture; shoulders back, hips properly aligned. Exactly what you get from the Hidden Core Workout. Burning off calories, creating a beneficial hormonal environment, flushing your system with exercise-increased bloodflow, working your colon clean, and all the other benefits of this kind of exercise also improve your looks. They also improve how you smell!That testosterone boost doesn't just trigger calcium storage and body fat burning. It also triggers the body to build lean muscle. That's why some gym rat who doesn't do large compound exercises like dead lifts and squats will always have smallish arms no matter how many curls he does but the person who does the dead lifts and squats will have admirable arms without even doing curls.Get this book. You won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHXRRJ2J6HRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062197746#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHXRRJ2J6HRW","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every car enthusiast is familiar with the name J.D. Power, and rare is the car owner who isn't. Most of use take for granted that J.D. Power somehow watches over the auto industry and lets us know which are the best cars. Have you ever wondered who they are and how they came to be? This book provides the answers to those and other questions about this highly influential company.A fact that implicitly emerges from this book, and that is explicitly stated several times late in the book, is J.D. Powers is the reason car owners today have a vastly more positive car owner experience than in times past. With the automobile being so integral to our culture and way of life (except for those in big cities like New York or Chicago where, for many, owning a car isn't essential or even, in many cases, sensible), this is no minor thing.I remember in the 1960s those dreaded appointments to take my dad's car to the dealer. It was an all day event, and my mom would be tasked with doing it. There'd be some problem, which my dad (an accomplished mechanic in his own right) would diagnose for them and just want fixed under warranty. Usually, it would take multiple trips to get it resolved. This was such an ordeal. I was a kid then, and this ordeal turned me off to the idea of owning a car when I became old enough to do so. I didn't stick with that ""no car for me"" idea for long, but the ""dealers are terrible"" idea really stuck with me and it would be a couple of decades before I would even visit a new car dealer.Today if you bring your car to the dealer, they can diagnose the problem and usually fix it on the same day. And instead of a dingy, smelly waiting area, you are treated to a modern facility complete with many free amenities including free Wi-Fi and clean bathrooms. But another huge difference is the types of problems that result in needing a dealer visit are vastly different today. Most such problem that existed even when I was a kid do not arise today at all.And what has driven this change in quality isn't some idea among auto executives that it could mean a happier customer; in fact, at one time they had no idea what customers thought of their products. What has driven it has been the published results from the various surveys done by J.D. Powers.Not that Powers had an overnight influence. This company started in 1968. When did automakers finally get quality right? Maybe twenty years later? Thirty?Understand, please, that quality isn't something that happens just because you decide to do a better job of inspecting completed vehicles. In fact, it's not even related to that. Quality gets built into every facet of the complicated process of designing and building an automobile. I studied quality in graduate school in the early 1990s, and at that time Toyota was the object of many case histories and other relevant material. The ""big three"" were way behind Toyota at the time. From that standpoint, you measure quality in terms of defects. The lower the statistical occurrence of defects (e.g., instances of X defect per 1,000 units) the better your quality metrics are.Primarily by lowering defects, manufacturers were able to rate higher in consumer perception. As everyone raised their game, the ""quality floor"" kept rising. The level of quality today is orders of magnitude beyond what it was when J.D. Powers began. How and why J.D. Powers obtained the power to make this happen is the core story of this book. It's an interesting story, well told. And it presents lessons  for other industries.Something not mentioned in the book is it also presents a lesson for the number one consumer good in the USA, namely that badly broken institution we call the federal government. When statistics come out saying the approval rate of President Obama is 26%, many people wonder what's wrong with those people in the 26%. Similar remarks about Congress (the opposite of progress) get made all the time, though its approval rating is often in the single digits (I find it alarming that Congress has any approval at all). While I personally see this ""lesson to the gangsta government"" as a prime benefit of reading this book if you apply the lessons to other areas, I am also glad the authors did not take the book down that path. I'm just saying the same thing that worked for the auto industry can work for other dysfunctional, customer-deaf organizations. And no organization is more customer-deaf than the federal government.Something that may be off-putting to some readers is the book's coverage of Dave Powers himself is obviously one-sided. There's no scandal and the book lacks of negatives to balance all the positives. Often, the tone is downright fawning. But let's look a little closer at that. First of all, one-sided coverage is unavoidable in a book that clearly must have had the cooperation of, and sign-off by, people close to the main ""character"" in the book. Second, it may  very well be that Dave Powers' conduct really was that above-board.From my personal experience, I can cite two examples of high-level executives who led professional lives above reproach and whose grace and humility were as remarkable as what you see in this book.Bud Keyes, former CEO of Bailey Controls, was certainly a human with human faults and frailties. But when I worked at Bailey as a systems engineer, my coworkers and I spoke of him with awe and near adoration. Bud was a man of extremely high integrity, and he (echoes of Dave Power, here) put the customer first.I had the privilege of attending a ""CEO speaks"" sort of event featuring Boake Sells, former CEO of Revco. Subsequent to this, I had many interactions with Mr. Sells. Despite the fact I was (relative to him) a nobody, Mr. Sells accorded me respect and was very gracious with his time. I can't say enough good things about him.I've worked in trade journalism since 1996, and I am known for giving the straight scoop on things. I think if I had been tasked with writing a ""balanced"" piece on either of these two men, it would have read much like the commentary on Dave Powers in this book. There really are business people who are role models and heroes for the rest of us. Bud, Boake, and Dave are probably just three among many.So while this book appears to some reviewers to be one long press release, I don't see it that way. I have no doubt that Dave made mistakes the authors chose to ignore, but if Dave is like Bud and Boake (and I suspect he is), those mistakes are at the detail level and probably not very interesting. The book is a bit overly promotional and it is somewhat repetitive. So I deduct points for that. Still, it's a good read and it tells us how one company changed an industry that is integral to our culture.This book consists of a foreword, afterword, and 9 chapters in 365 pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QE1JIKN4THIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981833675#wasThisHelpful","R1QE1JIKN4THIW","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book until I got to the end. More about that, later. Overall, a wonderful book. Do not miss out on reading it.This book gave me great insight into one of the most profound bits of legislation to be passed in my lifetime. Providing an almost shocking inside view of the fight to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Todd S. Purdham takes us into the chambers where the battles were fought. We also get glimpses of behind the scenes discussions and manipulations.Half a century after being voted into law, this Act is a distant memory to those who watched President Johnson announce it on television. And it is just an historical footnote to younger folks. Today, it may be hard to understand what all the hooplah was all about. I think that's why a book that details the difficult birth of this Act is essential reading.Purdham does an excellent job of bringing the drama to life. Unfortunately, his writing has a strong political bent to it. So there is a bit of misrepresentation here and there. I think on the core message of the book (what it took to pass the Act), he is pretty straight. His bias shows in a few places, noticeably his misportrayal of Barry Goldwater.As for the Act itself, I've never really come to terms with the fact that it was needed. I just want to write the word ""Redundant"" all over this Act, because the liberties it protects are already protected by the Constitution. I have really two major problems with the Civil Rights Act of 1964:1. At the latest, the date should be EIGHTEEN 64.2. It's embarrassing that this Act had to be passed in the first place. The fact we needed an Act basically saying all citizens have the same civil liberties does not speak well of us as a people.This book reveals just how difficult it was to get this Act passed into law, despite the fact it wasn't attempting anything other than re-iterating existing law (just in more detail). What it took on the House and Senate floors and what it took behind the scenes to get that job done is astounding.Though I'm well-read on civil liberties in general and history in particular, the story revealed in this book was an eye-opener to me. My misconception going into it was this Act had very broad support and the problem was the usual apathy in Congress toward actual governance. That was not at all the case.This Act got passed only after extensive debate. I'm still at a loss to explain both sides of the ""debate,"" as I don't see where anyone draws from the Constitution (which is the supreme law of the land) that it protects the rights of some people but not others. Nor does it say anything about the artifice known as ""race"" except in the one unfortunate compromise made in Article 1, Section 2. We're talking about fundamental civil liberties; what is there to debate?Well, the other side drew arbitrary lines based on the artificial construct known as ""race.""  I also don't understand how it's possible to look a person in the eye and say she or he does not have the same civil liberties you do, based on something that has nothing to do with that person's character or behavior. But that was the mentality that many in Congress brought to the ""debate"" on this law. Many claimed it was actually UN-Constitutional, a defiance of logic if there ever was one. The goal of the law was to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens. How can that not be Constitutional?Making sure that ""people of color"" have their civil liberties protected has been a tediously slow and difficult process. Purdham didn't discuss the background aspect of this, a decision I agree with. He focused on the subject. This is a big enough book as it is; expanding it to provide all the background would have been a bad move.For those who need a little ""come up to speed,"" make a point of reading about events following WWII. That's when things finally began to gel. In World War II, there was some progress in the military but the GIs came home to a country where they were disrespected based on their appearance. After the war, the efforts to protect civil liberties ramped up. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has a date in its name because it's one in a series of Civil Rights Acts.And the job is far from done. Divisions, hatreds, and prejudices still remain. But legally, victims of various manifestations of these attitudes and behaviors at least today have extensive protection. Not complete, but extensive.If you can find the old Howard Stern video showing a muckety muck from the KKK explaining the complex hierarchy of hatred, get it. The format is a game show, and this guy is a guest who has to rank various ethnic groups from best to worst. The idiocy and absurdity exhibited as he explains his choices are what make the point Stern wanted to make. There's no rationality to racism. Yet, it persists. This kind of non-thinking was what allowed people to accept such indignities as ""white"" and ""colored"" drinking fountains, among other insults.Is this book uplifting? That depends. On the one hand, I found it a bit depressing that anyone could oppose such a simple idea--that Constitutional rights and basic human dignity belong to all citizens, not just some and not others. On the other hand, I was inspired by the accounts of those who risked their careers and important relationships to get this idea embodied into statute.Is this book worth reading? Absolutely.The twelve chapters and epilogue of this book span 339 pages. It also has extensive notes and an impressive bibliography. Well-written, and well-researched.About the endPurdum concludes with a short commentary that pushes the lie that Obama is ""black"" though Obama has nothing in common with blacks generally. This ""brain off"" propaganda is offensive and delusional. Worse, it's hugely damaging. And it ignores the plight of those who are disproportionately bearing the burden of Obama's extremely bad policies.Increasing the federal debt by 80% in 5.5 years (despite promising in 2008 to eliminate it) has had horrific effects on the economy. An economy depends on capital the way a lake depends on water. Drain the capital out, and the level of economic health drops. That's why only 49% of Americans of working age have a job and many of those jobs are part-time.The Unaffordable Care Act, Obama's trademark mislegislation, is a travesty that is devastating the poor, especially blacks, on top of the other stunts he's pulled. To tie anything about Obama to black progress is cynical at best. It's a foray into extreme ignorance and pathological denial.Anyone who fears it is somehow ""racist"" to object to Obama's predations would do well to look up E.T. Williams on Youtube to get his blunt and accurate analysis.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257D4HKZH9DTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805096728#wasThisHelpful","R257D4HKZH9DTJ","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting and informative exploration into how myths have managed to spread among cultures past and present. The book delivers on the promises made in both the title and the subtitle. To me, that's important. It's also unusual, today. It seems like someone who doesn't bother reading the book typically writes the subtitle, but in the case of Viral Mythology the subtitle nicely sums up what you're going to read.That said, the authors don't pretend to know exactly how this or that myth was propagated. But they do explore the possibilities, and that is what makes this book so interesting.This examination may also help readers understand how many myths of today get propagated. In this era of spin, propaganda, brainwashing, and lies spewed forth as truth, there may even be some lessons that will help the reader discern truth from fiction.The authors practiced their craft well and/or had an excellent copy editor. The text is in Standard Written English, a rarity. If Congress passed a law mandating English as our official language, most American authors would instantly become criminals. In addition to getting the mechanics right, the authors simply wrote well. The book has an almost vibrant style to it, somewhat tempered by an academic flavor.Maybe practice really does make perfect. The authors have produced several bestsellers. It would not surprise me if Viral Mythology joined the list that already includes such notable works as This Book is from the Future and The Trinity Secret.The authors ask how ancient cultures were able to widely spread (go viral with) information that was important to them, because they obviously did not have our electronic means of disseminating information. The answer is they embedded the information in other things, such as legend, art, and architecture (there's that subtitle again!).You can embed information into all sorts of things. One way very common to the ancients, and to people of today, is via storytelling. The story is captivating fiction and thus memorable, but in the story are the facts, ideas, perceptions, principles, or concepts that need to be spread or passed down. This is, despite believers' views to the contrary, the basis for stories of their religion. The authors touch on this rather delicate point in a manner that shows fairness and intellectual integrity.The stories of cultures that are widely separated by time and/or geography have striking similarities. The tell remarkably similar stories, often using the same symbology. Why is this? That's a question the authors deftly explore. Many authors, such as the famous Erich von Daniken, have concluded the explanation must point to help from aliens from another planet. The authors posit this possibility, among others, letting the reader puzzle over what the actual answer might be. Since we can't really know, and the authors are adamant we cannot really know, this approach maintains intellectual integrity.Many legends and fairy tales from ages ago have long been dismissed and merely baseless fiction. But with new knowledge gained over the past few decades, we are seeing that ""there's something to it"" in those legends and fairy tales. The information was embedded in ways that have made it difficult for us to pull it out of the background noise, but there's real information to be found. Cultural clues that make sense to people in one era have no resonance at all with people from another era or culture. If we can examine the stories in the context of the culture in which they were told, they can hold startling revelations.An interesting twist on all this examination of myths and legends is the authors compare the key elements to those of modern myths and legends, and older methods of communication to modern methods of communication. You do see patterns emerge. To me, the ability to see these patterns helps the reader see the patterns of deliberate disinformation as well. A great example of how this is done in film is the movie V for Vendetta. Other readers may see a different benefit of this comparison, such as how suppressed information can be coded and passed along; the authors give some examples of this.The main text consists of eight chapters spanning 229 pages. The first Chapter is titled ""Information Please: How We Spread It, How We Get It,"" and that title gives you a glimpse of the kinds of issues the authors look at. The book also has three longish elements preceding the text: a Foreword, Prologue, and Introduction. The text is followed by a chapter-length piece titled ""Conclusion.""At four pages long, the bibliography seems a tad on the light side. But the sources themselves are pretty heavy. Many authors today bloat out their bibliography with Wikipedia entries rather than primary or secondary source material. Some do even worse and use known sources of fiction and misrepresentation, such as the New York Times (whose fact checkers are apparently good at weeding out facts). Again, there's that intellectual integrity thing that these authors seem dedicated to maintaining.Overall, a good read. It might not be life-changing for you, but if you clearly see the communication patterns it reveals and apply those to the myths of today, it very well could be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEI0T2BX9B47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601632959#wasThisHelpful","R2VEI0T2BX9B47","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What an eye-opener for me. At the end of this review, you can get my personal take on ""social networking."" Until this book, I just did not understand the appeal.So what about the young person whose life is so bound by restrictions that social networking tools are a lifeline for social interaction? That's a very different situation from my own. I think I would use those tools, in that kind of circumstance. Boyd's research shows this is one of the major factors (there are others) that push teens into relying upon these technologies.Notice I said research. This book is far more than an opinion piece that makes intelligent guesses. Boyd did extensive interviewing across the nation, and across many demographics. The appendix with the teen demographics shows that she sought to avoid selection bias, and I think she accomplished that. She also bolstered her own primary source research with a huge number of written works; the 22 page bibliography is massive for a book of this size (184 pages of text from Chapter 1 through Chapter 8).She also explodes some pervasive myths. One that has long annoyed me is the idea that kids are inherently computer-savvy digirati. I don't know why this myth gets any traction. It takes time and experience to develop a digital skill set. Kids are inherently not computer-savvy. They have to overcome a relative lack of experience to drawn upon for understanding. When I've helped kids improve their digital skill set, I've not been able to use the same metaphors an analogies that work well with adults.What I have found, however, is kids generally don't fear the technology and are determined to be its master rather than the other way around. Adults who lack a technical background often expect to grasp things instantly, then go into a brain shutdown state of fear when they don't; as if nobody else actually struggles with these things. The reality is everyone has to climb the learning curve.Boyd was able to show a vast difference in the skill sets among young people. Her research validated an opinion I've spouted many times over the years. It's that digital competence is not an age thing. It's more complicated than that. For teens, but a key factor is the teen's socioeconomic status. For example, kids who grow up in a home with computers have many opportunities to interact with computers and learn, while kids who grow up without that access don't have those opportunities.In my own case, I first used a computer on the job (when I was a kid, we didn't even have pocket calculators yet). Work forced me to learn, because I wanted to succeed at my job. Working 55 hours a week with digital tools and being expected to produce results is very different from spending 30 minutes a week in the school library as your only computer experience.Now, I've just touched on some highlights of the ""it's complicated"" aspect of the digital social life of today's teens. This book isn't a lightweight treatment that I can sum up in a list of six points or a couple of paragraphs. The whole books is pretty much that summary, albeit with supporting material. Boyd followed the dictum ""write tight"" and there's no fluff in this book. It pulled me in because it just kept peeling back layers on the metaphorical onion.This actually surprised me, because she wrote a 28 page introduction that seemed to sum up whatever else she could say on the topic. But that wasn't the reality. The introduction really was an introduction. The book would keep building on that. When I finished reading, I looked again at the title and thought there is no way to come up with one that's more accurate.Despite the fact that the subject is nuanced six ways to Sunday, Boyd managed to explain things in a straightforward way. I found the book to be highly accessible. I also liked the fact that she didn't seem to have an agenda and didn't try to portray a complicated subject as a simple one.This book had word confusion errors, something that always annoys me. For example, Boyd repeatedly confused ""who"" with ""whom"" and said ""poured"" instead of ""pored."" But this was an uncorrected advance proof so probably this will be fixed in the final copy. Still a great read, even with these little glitches.My take on social networkingI've never seen any reason to use social networking (""social notworking"") sites or tools, such as Twitter and Facebook. I've never sent a text message, either--though in that case, I can see the value for certain situations. As a middle-aged adult, I've tolerated (but not understood) the teen practices of texting, tweeting, and posting. Thanks to Boyd, I now understand. And as the title of this book says, it's complicated.Just to clarify, I'm not a technophobe. I'm an IEEE Senior Member and past Chair of the Computer Society (a local chapter of it, anyhow). I handle about 400 e-mails a day, do my own IT work (and help friends with theirs), and simply must find the Wi-Fi or other Internet access while traveling. I've been writing technical articles for trade and professional publications for about twenty years.For one thing, I don't like being interrupted with tweets, texts, and other such things (for example, don't phone me and expect me to answer).Nor do I want to consume my time with these things or with managing a profile on a ""networking"" site. I see it as, ""life is too short."" I was an early adopter of the smart phone, but after trying that decided not to do the cell phone thing (I have one, and it's off unless I need to make an emergency call).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BV29Q9QH63L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300166311#wasThisHelpful","R4BV29Q9QH63L","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is one that just hooks you and keeps you going to see how the anticipated outcome will emerge. It reads like good fiction, in terms of how the authors pace the story and lead the reader through various clues. As with good fiction, the reader hits to cul-de-sacs, dead ends, and detours. And as with really good fiction, the suspense fluctuates its intensity and ends in a way you had not anticipated.So much for the fiction part. The sheer volume of the sources tapped (plus the consistency with other works) is substantial evidence that the authors went to great lengths to present a factual account rather than pursue an agenda.They even bring us much of the human side of Aribert Heim, something that, given the subject, must have taken great resolve. It's clear from the text that the authors share the nearly universal revulsion over the despicable acts of the Nazis (especially the attempted extermination of European Jews). So I'm not saying that they, in any way, minimize what happened and try to paint a sympathetic picture of those who committed these atrocities. This is the story of the pursuit of one alleged war criminal, one who was never brought to trial. He was probably guilty, but we don't have a proven case.I felt the authors tried to present a balanced account, and we did get to see into the mind of Heim. Was he merely engaged in denial and justification? By the end of the book, we aren't sure. But the point of the book is to tell about the search to bring Heim to trial, not take the place of a trial that never happened.Though many of the sources were books, some were periodicals. Unfortunately, the disinformation source ""The New York Times"" was used as a source, somewhat diminishing the credibility of the authors' research. However, sometimes the NYT is not totally ""alternate universe"" in its coverage and maybe that was the case with whatever the authors used from it. Greatly adding to their credibility are direct interviews conducted by the authors themselves.While the authors don't prove Heim's guilt (again, there was no trial), the circumstantial evidence they provide makes it hard t conclude he was actually innocent. And we do know for a fact that he worked at the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1941. The accusations against him came from prisoners who were there. The question, ""If he was innocent, why did he run?"" would seem to indict him, but that doesn't prove his guilt. In the USA today, people are routinely put on death row even thought they are innocent and running from the authorities when you fear you can't get a fair trial makes a whole lot of sense.The search for him actually outlasted him, and even after his death was reported the investigation did not stop. That might seem crazy, but the authors explain why this was the case. Nazi hunters had, many times before, been thrown off the trail by faked deaths.It also might seem crazy that so much effort was devoted to finding a person who was really a small fry. But again, the authors explain why this was the case. As old Nazis died off, the list of Nazis to chase down got smaller. The leaders, being among the oldest, had mostly died off by the 1960s. Heim (who was relatively young during WWII), rose to the top of the list by process of elimination.There were several other such oddities and questions that the authors explained. This book brought not just new facts about the Nazis, but new nuances about why certain things happened. Gaining a deeper level of understanding is never a bad idea.This book drills down into a part of world history that is worth exploring. I put it on my ""recommended reading"" list.Note: I reviewed the softcover bound galley, not the actual hardbound book. There may be minor differences, but the copyediting quality of the softcover version was extremely high. The version I reviewed ran 250 pages (including the Prologue) and was divided into a large number of small chapters (typically a few pages at most).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0OV51PB7BEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385532431#wasThisHelpful","R2E0OV51PB7BEN","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book to be both technically detailed and readily accessible. That is a very rare combination. I started with HTML in 1996, and it was pretty simple back then. We didn't have CSS, and even something like an included page (used for menu, for example) was considered fancy stuff. When HTML 2.0 came out, I felt a bit overwhelmed. As this specification has evolved, I have not managed to keep up.Part of the reason for my Neanderthal-level coding mentality is I have thousands of legacy pages, and I have several sites that have the old coding and old structure dating back from the pre-CSS days. But another part is it's just been difficult to wrap my mind around the changes while trying to do everything else. It's not just new abilities that you can tack on, it's a series of fundamental change in how we do things. Some best practices, such as using good taxonomy, have not changed. But many have, and what used to be good coding is now bad coding.If this book wasn't intentionally aimed at people like me, it hit the mark anyhow.I'm not a Web designer; I'm a site administrator. Mostly, I create content. The coding is just something else I have to do. It makes up a minor part of my total workload. Many site owners are in exactly this position. We don't go to HTML conferences, take Web design classes, or do other things that a specialist would do. There just isn't time (or money). We are, for the most part, out of the loop. And we're seldom doing a green (new) project. We're maintaining existing pages.On one of my (many) bookshelves is a book on HTML. The copyright is 2000. It's the only other HTML book I have. Ouch.Sadly, there's not a WYSIWIG editor that produces clean code. At least, not that I know of. I still use FrontPage for my static page sites because of structural issues, but I have to spend time manually cleaning up the bad HTML that FrontPage sticks into those pages. For my dynamic pages, I use Dreamweaver as my editor. I also use Notepad. This is just to maintain things and to make some smallish updates, and I run into HTML questions that I don't know the answer to. This book will help me immensely.As I said, I'm not a Web designer. People compliment me on my e-commerce sites (crystalkeen.com and mindonnection.com). While I'd like to take credit, that credit goes to Kevin Ford at MivaMan. Now after reading this book I understand some of the things that Kevin just gave up trying to explain to me. Now instead of just implementing this or copying that and not really knowing why it gets done that way, I know.If you're at all involved in doing any coding on any Website, even just maintenance, this book will help you better work with your Web designer. You can avoid making mistakes that your Web designer has to clean up for you (sorry, Kevin!), and you can be more realistic about what approach to take to implementing features on the site if you're the owner of it and need to understand the scope of the work.For the full-time coder or Web developer, this book probably holds some real nuggets. At the risk of channeling Donald Rumsfeld, I don't know what it is you know and don't know. But the detail and the organized way in which it is presented are good clues to me that you should get this book.If you're a ""part-time coder"" who's been at it for very long (a decade and a half, in my case) you probably share my problems with legacy code. I could spell them out here, but you know what I'm talking about. Not having access to classes or the other resources that come with training for a job, we ""wing it"" folks have had to learn the hard way. And we've not only missed many good things, we've learned many bad things. This book is ideal for us.In the Introduction, Matt said it's OK not to read from cover to cover. While I understand where he was coming from on that, I did read this book from cover to cover and will probably do so again. This book can really raise my game, and that's the main reason I love it.HTML5 Foundations consists of an Introduction and 14 chapters occupying 332 well-written pages, plus three excellent appendices, a detailed TOC, and an indepth index.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9IEEZ47W4V3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118356551#wasThisHelpful","RG9IEEZ47W4V3","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own a competing product to the Schick Hydro 5 razor, so have some basis for comparison. I like this product better than the one I was using.Before talking about the razor, let's do a line by by line analysis of the product description (as posted on Amazon).""Schick hydro 5 disposable razors are the only grooming products that hydrates your skin during shaving and reduces irritation.""*Translation to English: ""The Shick Hydro 5 disposable razor is the only grooming product that hydrates your skin during shaving, to reduce irritation.""*Analysis: Obviously a false statement. Shaving gel is a grooming product. What does it do?""Five ultra glide blades with skin guards, reduce friction between the skin and the cartridge for a less irritating shave.""*Translation to English: ""The five blades have skin guards to reduce friction between the skin and the cartridge, reducing irritation while you shave.""*Analysis: I found no evidence of guards on the blades. Maybe the writer meant something else, but I don't see what it is.""Unique hydrating gel reservoir lasts up to 2 times longer than ordinary lubrication strips.""*Translation to English: ""Lubricant in the hydrating gel reservoir lasts up to 2 times longer than the lubricant in ordinary lubrication strips.""*Analysis: Does anyone shave without a gel or foam? Why is there a lubricant on the razor? And I think those lubrication strips on the various razors I have used are just Teflon or plastic. They outlast the metal blades because they do not rust and hair is not going to abrade them away. So this statement strikes me as just so much hyperbole.""Only disposable with a flip trimmer. Engage the trimmer with your thumb and use on hard to reach areas for precise trimming.""*No translation needed.*Analysis. I can't find the flip trimmer.Now, you might be thinking that by this point I'm getting annoyed with Schick and with this product. Not so. I just found the product description to be inexcusably sloppy.What about the razor itself? The shave is not as close as what I get from the 5-blade Gillette I own. Maybe those mysterious skin guards are reducing friction between my whiskers and the cartridge.Thus, after my first shave I was not impressed. After about my fourth shave, that started to change. You see, something I really hate about my Gillette razor is the blades don't last more than a few days.Gillette's prices on the 5-razor cartridge packs are so high that I'm simply not going to buy any more. The last time I was going to buy these, I considered the price and walked away. The Gillette 5-blade razors might not gouge you when shaving, but you get gouged when you buy them. I have opted out.So on day four of using this Schick Hydro 5, I was still shaving comfortably. With the Gillette, it's dicey by this time. And, yes, I do dry off my blades after each use; maybe my method of patting on a towel doesn't get the moisture off the backside or something. I also tried keeping the Gillette in olive oil, but that didn't work out very well.I kept going with this Schick. It's been three weeks, which in Gillette blade time is about 25 bucks. I'm still on that first disposable cartridge and it feels the same as day one.That is impressive. I really don't care about getting a super close shave because, surprise, my whiskers grow back out and that ""close shave"" doesn't last long. It's just not worth the exorbitant price that Gillette charges.I can't tell you how long these cartridges last, because this one is still going strong after three weeks. I'm not merely impressed, I'm amazed.You save money with this product vs. the Gillette counterpart. Not only do the Schick cartridges outlast the Gillette ones by an order of magnitude, they also cost less to replace! You save two ways.To my way of thinking, Schick got it right. I'm going to stick with Schick.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GRKDYSQDOQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHF1GK6#wasThisHelpful","R1GRKDYSQDOQX","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is yet another good book by Weisman. I previously reviewed his 50 Ways to Protect Your Identity, which I also found useful. In that other book, Weisman underpromised and overdelivered, something that we typically see in reverse. In this book, it seems he went a bit too far trying to do the same thing. Adding a dash of nutmeg to a plain vanilla ice cream cone produces a pleasant surprise, but dipping it in chocolate first is going a bit too overboard in the ""here's more than you asked for"" department.I'll discuss this more, in a bit. My sister and I have been dealing with the eldercare thing for a few years now, and fortunately for me she's been carrying most of the water there. The many ways things can go wrong and the lack of easy access to information are both astounding. This book can help children of the elderly avoid the many pitfalls that, like economic IEDs, await them along the journey of eldercare.The number one cause of death in America is ""hospital errors."" The esteemed Dr. Atul Gawande wrote about this is his 2007 book (which I also reviewed), Better. The average death toll is about 780,000 per year and in 2012 the death toll was significantly higher than that. According to Dr. Gawande, most of the ""errors"" amount to staff not washing their hands before touching patients. Of course, these deaths are the ones not plausibly deniable by (mis)attributing them to something else and they do not include patients like my father who died later of hospital errors rather than in the hospital. The actual number is far higher than what's reported.Against this backdrop, we children of the elderly are supposed to somehow trust the institutions like hospitals, insurance companies, and (what poses as) the federal government, plus various state and county agencies, to provide a reasonably humane exit from this world for our parents. And we're somehow, during Obama's debt-fueled Depression, supposed to be able to pay for all of this. And while grieving over a dead parent, we're on the hook for cremation costs (a funeral is out of the question, due to price tags starting at around 10 grand).Yes, and we realize we are next in line. In twenty years, it'll probably be our turn. But the resource picture will be far different and not in a good way. Can you say ""stress?""A book like this is an essential part of anyone's library, because the issues faced are overwhelming even when you do have the basics down. I'm very glad Weisman took on this topic and covered this topic so thoroughly. I can also attest that his coverage is accurate, at least on the issues I am also familiar with. Given that, and my experience with his previous book, I believe the reader can trust every bit of advice in this book. And should heed it as well.Back to the overdoing it thing. Weisman took on what is often a dry subject. And he injected a little humor, which is nice. But I think he overdid it and in several instances it became an unnecessary diversion into the irrelevant. Trimming this back a bit would improve the book. Another way he overdid it was by spending too much time on topics not related to eldercare/elder planning issues. The first chapter was mostly a primer on what you should do to protect your personal assets. Great information, yes. But halfway into the first chapter, I began to wonder whether the book was about elder planning at all.One solution would be to put all of the non-elder information into an Appendix. Another solution would be to write another of these amazingly informative books for that purpose and just refer to that book. But the way this was done, it was like watching a two hour movie with the first half hour devoted to the background story. Let us start with the action, please.Weisman does correctly take digs at the extremely poor job done by what poses as the US Congress. No quality control there, as those folks really are apathetic about anything to do with governance. Those digs might seem like the diversions I referred to earlier, but the extremely poor job done by an extremely overpaid CONgress (the opposite of progress) is why we have the mess we have. People need to remember that at ""election"" time, when they think that somehow it's a ""choice"" to give their vote to the Gambinos or the Genoveses, er, I mean the Republicans or the Democrats. That kind of willful ignorance and non-thinking will only encourage more of the very bad situation we now have for the elderly (and the very bad situation we have in other ways also, such as the Pentagon Acquisition System that gets fieldable weapons from only 5% of the $21 million an hour of taxpayer money it spends; the other 95% is diverted to corporations for no benefit to the taxpayer). Maybe Weisman will treat us to a book about how to deal with CONgress and maybe get them to do something useful for a change.The text of this guide to elder planning consists of 17 chapters running 317 pages. It also has a nice resource section and an extensive index. I don't think Weisman wrote this book to be a ""keeper,"" I think he wrote it to be something you use up until it's dog-eared and falling apart. For that, Mr. Weisman, you have my gratitude.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFA8C5KTY72J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133091929#wasThisHelpful","RPFA8C5KTY72J","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you make a habit of acquiring and reading business books, you would do well to add this one to your collection. This book didn't dazzle me, and I don't think the author (Bill McBean) really cares about the dazzle factor. What struck me is he cares about helping the reader grasp the bigger picture of business in general and operating a business in particular. Good stuff to know, and unfortunately most small business owners fail before getting around to knowing these things.The subtitle is a bit of a thrown down gauntlet, but given the statistics on business failures it's likely to be accurate in a random sampling of potential readers. The title definitely matches the content, and that bucks a recent trend in book titles.Now, I want to caution readers that this isn't something along the lines of an instant MBA. As an MBA myself, I can tell you there is no such thing as a book that gives you anything even remotely resembling the equivalent of the knowledge required to earn an MBA. If you don't have an MBA, ask someone who does about the reading load or go look at the syllabi at various universities. Much to his credit, McBean does not pretend to condense an MBA or teach particular skills Cliff-notes style.I would also like to note that, as an MBA myself, I can tell you that an MBA does not make you a biz whiz. Somehow, the business press jumped on the ""MBA means success"" train and rode it right off the rails. I graduated at the top of my MBA class, but this didn't make me an expert. It didn't give me all I needed for success. Most of my fellow graduates, in fact, have outperformed me in business. Outside the MBA program, they learned some important things that I still don't know.Having a mentor, someone like McBean, for example, can make a huge difference. This book is a distillation of that mentoring committed to paper. At least, that's how it reads to me.What's usually missing in the business owner's training is an understanding of what business life is actually about. In a large corporation, you may find MBA's churning out mind-numbing reports. In the nitty gritty world of running a small or medium-sized business, the ability to do that is of no value. The things you really need to know are the kinds of things McBean discusses in this book.I think most businesses fail not because of doing things wrong, but because of doing the wrong things. This is what I have seen time and again. It's also worth noting that ""doing the right things"" was one of the seven habits in Stephen R. Covey's iconic book.McBean tries to teach the reader how to get the right mindset and how to develop the framework you need for successfully running a business through its major stages. He wants you to be able to figure out what are the right things to do at a given stage of the life of a business.McBean enumerates five major stages (which he calls levels) in the business life cycle:1. Ownership and opportunity.2. Creating your company's DNA.3. From survival to success.4. Maintaining success.5. Moving on when it's time to go.Prior to identifying these stages, McBean lists ""the seven facts of business life."" Starting with Chapter Three, he devotes a chapter to each of these and discusses that particular fact in the context of each of the five stages. So, he discusses the fact five times. While this process makes that discussion precise and highly relevant to where a business happens to be, it does result in some repetition. Normally, I consider repetition a negative but in this case I don't see how the repetition is avoidable without diminishing the value of the book.This book does have some negatives.First of all, it would read much better if someone familiar with Strunk and White copy-edited it. Especially for ""needless words."" An example is ""past experience."" Your experience is, by definition, in the past. A few cliches, such as ""at the end of the day"" also show up and you'll find misuse of ""impact"" a few times. However, these are mere annoyances. They don't leave the reader confused about what McBean is trying to say. I suppose not every highly successful CEO is also an accomplished grammarian, and expecting that is unrealistic. What we can expect is he can speak and write in cogent sentences so that you understand the point he's making. McBean does that.Second, there's the repetition I mentioned earlier (gee, I'm doing it too!). This book gives me the impression it was written as a series of independent articles. Maybe that can't be helped, considering the structure McBean chose. A point he makes repeatedly (and I am not complaining about that particular repetition) is various aspects of business are intertwined. This isn't a mindless tome like ""Who Cut The Cheese"" or whatever that little stinker of a book was called. It's a thoughtful narrative on each of a structured assembly of business topics. How a business owner exerts control at level three will have considerable overlap with how he exerts control at level four. The company isn't a completely different animal as it moves from level to level, nor are its markets or business in general.This book consists of 9 chapters across 324 pages. It's nicely indexed and has a thoughtful Foreword contributed by Ken Fisher. Mr. Fisher is a widely recognized name in the business literature, so his Foreword is a coup for Mr. McBean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Q7DOHD98X4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118094964#wasThisHelpful","R28Q7DOHD98X4C","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a pleasure to read. It's informative on several levels, but also ignites the imagination.Over the past many years, various professional magazines have featured articles on what is popularly referred to as 3D printing. Over the past few years, various consumer publications have featured articles on it. The Mindconnection eNewsletter has mentioned it in the Good News column as a counterforce to the economically devastating misconduct of our misrepresentatives in CONgress. And let's not forget how the movie industry used the concept in such hits as the Terminator series.I've read a wide range of facts and opinions on this manufacturing method, but until this book those have been in article format. Articles are great, and they constitute the vast majority of my reading. But they are necessarily much more limited in scope than books are; you can cover quite a bit more in 60,000 words than in 1,500 (unless you're the typical politician, in which case you essentially say nothing but spew thousands of words).This book has two authors, and I suppose both are knowledgeable. As the Preface said, there wasn't any delineation as to who wrote what. However, it seems to read with one voice. It's clear that the authors communicated and that a good editor was involved in this book project (though some copyediting errors did crop up).It's also clear that a whole lotta fact checkin' was goin' on. I didn't find any errors of fact, and for a review of mine that is really saying something. The references are extensive, and most of those look like interesting reading.I was pleased to see two intelligently written reviews posted prior to mine. My thanks go out to Paul Tognetti for his thoughtful, accurate review and the Library Picks Staff for theirs.Not the case here, but I often wonder if some reviewers are actually talking about the same book. In anticipation of those who inevitably add dross to the review section, a few comments:*As you read along, it seems the authors are hyping up the technology. It's not hype. The technology really is a game-changer. If you read the whole text (and generally, the whole context of the ""hype"" passage), you will see the authors balance out the positive attributes with cautions, notes on limitations, and ""now here's the downside"" sorts of commentary.*If you have been reading any of the technical journals, for example, IEEE Spectrum, the subject won't be new to you. That does not make this a retread (and anyone who claims so probably is borrowing someone else's journals due to being too brain-challenged to be a subscriber). You may have heard things discussed or read a puff piece in a consumer mag, and so reach the same conclusion. What's different here is the richness of the coverage.*The book contains many black and white photos, most of which are of marginal production quality. That does not mean the book is low value. It means the book is affordable. Big glossy photo prints are not cheap. That's why there's a smallish section of these in the middle rather than a whole bunch spread through out. The authors merely chose to focus their limited resources on substance rather than form. Dr. Lipson and Ms. Kurman could have published a similar book as a college text at a price of $75 to $100 (check out the publications and prices). But this lists for $27.95.*Oh, gee, it's nearly 300 pages. This does not indicate verbosity. The writing quality indicates judicious use of words, most likely through serious editing. The amount of filler isn't enough to even try to measure.The goal of this book, IMO, is to help the reader understand four things:1. What 3D printing is. It isn't really printing, but that label helps us relate to the idea of using software to instruct hardware how apply one material to another. Rather than applying ink to paper, these systems can apply particles of plastic (or other materials) to each other and they can do that in three dimensions.2. How the technology is presently used. As with personal computers in the mid-1980s, there's a small userbase and much of the usage falls under ""novelty.""3. Costs and benefits. Like any technology, it has its tradeoffs. The authors present a full and accurate picture of what these are. It is clear they were trying to describe 3D printing, rather than ""sell"" it to the reader.4. How the technology is likely to be used in the future, and how it may be used further on. We tend to describe the future as an extension of what is now (as the authors caution us). Thus, these predictions understate the potential.The authors are certainly capable of delving into arcane explanations of this technology and running us through the mathematical equations. But that is not the path they chose. They chose the more difficult path of relating the concepts to a lay audience. They did this in a way that makes the concepts not just accessible and understandable, but exciting. So it was a good read and an informative one. I think anyone who wants to understand a paradigm-shifting, game-changing, economy-saving technology would benefit from reading this book.Understanding what this technology is and where it's headed can help you be prepared for the massive changes it will make in the very, uh, fabric of society. It's not often a technology like this comes along, and we are barely scratching the surface of the benefits 3D printing can provide can provide. Nor is it often a book like this comes along, but we have the benefit of being able to read it now.Fabricated consists of fourteen chapters in 281 expertly written pages. Not included in the page count is the center section of color photos (most of these also appear in the text).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QM0Q5E1MUM86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118350634#wasThisHelpful","R3QM0Q5E1MUM86","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Jarrow lutein is the first lutein supplement I've tried. According to Wikipediea, this particular supplement is ""one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids."" You can get it only from plants.Carotenoids are micronutrients that have implications for eye health and cancer prevention. Some foods that contain them are sweet potatoes (which I consume nearly every day), carrots, and kale (which I consume every day). It's also found in egg yolks, and I consume 5 to 8 dozen eggs (non-factory type) a week (I never engage in the stupidity of discarding the yolk). The rest of my diet is almost completely fruits and vegetables (I do consume brown rice and raw oats).While I've never had my lutein level checked, it is almost certain I don't have a deficiency. Given this, what can I possibly offer regarding my experience with this supplement? I will show you in a moment.First, let's note that the typical American diet is woefully deficient in carotenoids. Look in the typical grocery cart, and this becomes sadly obvious.If you are on a grain-based, rather than green-based, diet you probably have a lutein deficiency (along with other problems, including low testosterone). Supplementing with lutein for a couple of months while you get your diet in order will definitely help your body recover from the effects of the lutein deficiency it's been through.You may not notice any difference, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. Adequate lutein is mostly a preventive thing, as far as I can tell. So the effect you will have by supplementing with lutein is you'll stop ongoing damage in its tracks. The cancer cells that were staying alive longer and longer in your body will die quicker and quicker, rather than morphing into a tumor. Your retinas will stop, and probably reverse, decline that was going on due to lutein deficiency. To protect the precious macula of the eye, you need lutein. Taking this supplemente provides that protection. So, good news there.Since my diet already provides me with more than enough lutein, what can I possibly tell you from trying this supplement from Jarrow? Several things:Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Jarrow does properly seal the bottle for consumer safety, but they do this intelligently under the assumption the customer might actually want to consume the supplement contained therein.Capsule quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart. This is bad. So I shook the heck out of the Jarrow container. No capsule failure, there. I've also seen capsules so thick that they don't look like they'll ever dissolve. I can pinch these and tell they aren't going to last long in my stomach's acid bath. Interestingly, these are a one-piece capsule rather than a two-piece. I don't know the implications of that for delivery; if you're interested ask a licensed pharmacist.Nausea effect. My major test was to try this with and without food, to see if it made me feel nauseated. Nope. I feel just fine, no matter when I take this.Dosage. If you look on Wikipedia, you'll see a chart showing how much lutein is in certain foods. I regularly eat almost everything on that list, including (in the summer), dandelion leaves (which I pick myself from my own yard). Raw kale (how I eat my kale) gives you 40 mg per 100 gms of kale. That's about 3.5 ounces of kale, which is about what I eat in a day. This supplement provides 20 mg. So, it's a safe dosage.If you are on the typical American diet, you need to replace grain with green. This is a foundational step in personal health care. During the transition phase, while your body is detoxing and nutrient absorption is probably encumbered, add a lutein supplement to your program. This looks like a good one, to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF87SX6WN6UU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OX9NC#wasThisHelpful","RF87SX6WN6UU4","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Jarrow 7-Keto DHEA is the first 7-Keto DHEA supplement I've tried. This particular supplement is a naturally occurring metabolite of DHEA. According to the label, it will give you many of the benefits of DHEA without the side effects.Wikipedia says, ""7-Keto-DHEA (also known as 7-Keto, 7-ketodehydroepiandrosterone, or 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone) is a steroid produced by metabolism of the prohormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 7-Keto is not directly converted to testosterone or estrogen, and has thus been investigated as a potentially more useful relative of DHEA.""Wikipedia provides three references for that one small passage. I think we can trust that citation.The biggest selling point of DHEA-related supplements is ""weight loss,"" which, translated into English, is ""body fat reduction."" You can lose weight by having your leg amputated or just sitting around until your muscles atrophy. That is not at all the same as changing your body fat composition such that your body fat decreases and/or your ratio of fat to lean mass decreases.This fat loss thing is also what so much of the marketing hype is about. I personally cannot test for this particular benefit and expect the test to be fair.My body fat ranges between 5% and 6%, a range in which fat loss is nearly impossible. Yes, professional body builders go lower but the effort to get there involves some extreme behaviors.The literature on DHEA's fat loss benefits shows that DHEA is a very effective fat loss supplement. So, what is there to review about Jarrow's version of this? Several things:Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Jarrow does properly seal the bottle for consumer safety, but they do this intelligently under the assumption the customer might actually want to consume the supplement contained therein.Capsule quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart. This is bad. So I shook the heck out of the Jarrow container. No capsule failure, there. I've also seen capsules so thick that they don't look like they'll ever dissolve. I can pinch these and tell they aren't going to last long in my stomach's acid bath.Nausea effect. My major test was to try this with and without food, to see if it made me feel nauseated. Nope. I feel just fine, no matter when I take this.Dosage. Back to Wikipedia, I see Professor Emeritus Dr. Lardy (interesting name, considering the fat loss benefits of this supplement) conducted a study using 100mg. This supplement contains 100mg.I mentioned earlier that I don't get much bang from fat loss supplements, because I'm already so lean. It's also true that people who aren't in that range will see no noticeable benefit without making some changes. For example, reduce portion size. Or do the large compound exercises that put your endocrine system into fat-burning mode.Think of 7-Keto DHEA as a multiplier. If you make some changes in your diet, they will be more effective when you use this supplement. Similarly, if you have been doing isolation exercises on machines at the gym and change to doing large compound exercises such as squats, your results will be more significant if you are using 7-Keto DHEA.There is no magic potion in a bottle, and there are no shortcuts. Building a leaner body is much like building a faster car. Changing from isolation exercises to large, compound exercises is like dropping in a bigger engine. Adding 7-Keto DHEA to the program is like adding a turbocharger.If you want a leaner physique, try this supplement and see how it works for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IG9TGVCTZY63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RYEETQ#wasThisHelpful","R2IG9TGVCTZY63","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of this book intrigued me. But the book falls short of what it promises. It's still worth reading, and for some people it could be life-changing. Mostly, those would be people whose days are consumed by fighting one problem after another. If you're such a person, get this book.For everyone else, this book is probably not going to be very helpful. Though I had originally expected it to be a source of great insight, it wasn't. Perhaps my expectations were unduly raised when I read the well-written introduction. Speaking of which, I found it odd that the author stated later in the book that people generally don't read introductions and then went on to reiterate some points from the introduction. If he really felt this way, he should have made those points in the text and not in the introduction.Where I found the value in this book was in Part One of the three parts. The other two parts didn't seem grounded in reality, nor did they provide anything that struck me as substantive.A key concept Mr. Blake makes clear is that you need to adjust your thinking such that you are for something rather than against something. One of his examples is ""weight loss,"" by which most users of the term actually mean ""fat loss."" This is no minor difference. People who focus on weight necessarily do not focus on body composition. So they follow Covey's example of doing the wrong things.But why focus on loss at all? Focusing on ""losing"" the fat puts you in a mindset of restricting your diet rather than optimizing it. During the winter, my body fat is usually around 6%. In summer, it's at 5%. This isn't because I ""lose fat"" but because I make positive optimization decisions that result in a slightly higher ratio of lean mass to fat. For someone with a bothersomely big belly, I suggest you stop thinking about ""losing the gut"" and start thinking about chiseling those abs.This same mental alignment works for any endeavor I can think of, yet I find that people tend to prefer fighting something than building something. Do you want to ""quit smoking"" or do you want nice skin, pleasant breath, and good stamina? Which way is more motivating?So getting the reader to understand the power of that alignment and providing some insight on how to make it standard operating procedure is what I see as the thrust of Part One. I like the way Mr. Blake gets this across.It's different from the mindless ""think positive"" advice that has you writing affirmations (lies) on little slips of paper or lying to yourself in the mirror at the start of every day. Self-deception can make you feel better, but it brings you no closer to solution. The caveat to that is if you're in a negative state such as depression, then this gambit can help you proceed more confidently. However, Mr. Blake's approach strikes me as really the one to use. It's the approach I typically use. After reading the first three chapters, I decided to use this approach consistently.I also like his tips on keeping your mind from being sabotaged by others. In particular, he was spot on regarding watching the news. I don't do the news, period. The content is typically wrong, nearly always negative, and seldom relevant to the life of the viewer, listener, or reader. By not exposing your mind to this pollution, you are already a leg up.Finished with Part One, I turned to Part Two. This is where the disappointment began. The premise here is you need to have a daily period set aside for what amounts to tapping into ""the force."" Mr. Blake wrongly ties this into Einstein's formula for mass and energy, a mistake that simple calculations will show to be a mistake. But even without the calculations, the causation he assumes just does not arise from this equation.He also goes on the redefine terms used in completely different contexts. For example, he says the Cohen brothers have it backwards in their portrayal of the matrix. In saying such a thing, Mr. Blake completely misses the point of the movie and completely misses the underlying problem with the Great Lies we are told by those in power.If Mr. Blake wants to say he's tapping into the matrix of nature or the universe or whatever, that's fine. But just because the word matrix is used in other contexts does not mean it's used incorrectly or that everyone is talking about the same thing. Mr. Blake's matrix and the one in the Matrix movies can co-exist without any conflict. Simply choose a different word to describe one or the other.When I finished Part Two, the author had not convinced me that I need to set aside 20 minutes a day to zone out, chill out, connect with nature, etc. Mr. Blake provided no evidence for the effectiveness of this, other than anecdote and a reliance on the idea that correlation equals causation. So it was with ""you let this reader down"" that I embarked upon Part Three.The title of Part Three is ""Transforming Ideas into Achievements."" I finished Part III not having found this subject addressed in any meaningful way. The basic concept is ""wish for it, and it will come."" So much serendipity here, and yet again a reliance on  idea that correlation equals causation.Upon finishing the book, I went back to the cover. What immediately struck me was the subtitle is not accurate. Pick up any map, and what do you see? Detail! This book, as its title states, is about three steps. It is not about the entire journey. The gap between thinking of an idea and making it happen is often filled with thousands of steps. Those are not discussed in the book. In no way is this a map to anything.I don't think Mr. Blake provided three simple steps. I think he provided one not so simple step, and that is the step of getting your head on straight. Does anybody not struggle with this, other than those who simply don't do it? Getting this right on a consistent basis is surely beneficial. But look at all of the famous and successful people who are nowhere close to this. If you think a little, you can probably work up a list of people who have this down pat but are struggling financially. I think it is one tool in a larger toolbox.Part One was about getting the correct mentality. Maybe the other two parts were about keeping that mentality in place. If you have a ritual for that purpose, whether it be spitting over your shoulder or communing with nature for 20 minutes a day, there's what I got out of part Two. In Part Three, the anecdotes seemed to point all toward recognizing opportunity when it comes a knockin'.This book runs 239 pages, including the introduction and the conclusion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UMJ9C5MUX7MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936661713#wasThisHelpful","R2UMJ9C5MUX7MP","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earbuds fit with reasonable comfort, and come with six sets of rubber tips. Nobody should have any problem getting a snug, comfortable fit with these. They also come with a handsome, soft-sided, zippered case. A nice touch, especially if you want to travel with spare rubber tips.I've owned many earbuds, over the years. This is one of the few that doesn't have the tangling cord problem. Kudos to Acoustic Research! This particular problem sometimes makes knots that are inordinately difficult to undo and the repeated annoyance can become quite frustrating. As an electrical engineer, I can tell you that Acoustic Research solved this issue the same way Samsung did. Instead of going cheap on the cord so that it tangles and/or breaks, they used a suitably thick cord.Not only that, there are two strain reliefs in the cord. I've seen many sets that don't have even one. So, this is a product designed to tolerate the occasional ""Oops"" where the cord snags on something as you walk past or your MP3 player suddenly takes a tumble.Wrapping the cord around your MP3 player does reduce the tangling problem, but it also shortens the life of the cord. So it's not really a solution. It's good to see that this manufacturer actually cared that users have things to do in life other than untangle earbud cords. They also seem to care that people don't like forking over money to replace earbuds they bought recently.I generally do not listen to music (the content adds little or nothing to my character, knowledge, or value as a human being), and don't use my MP3 player for that. What I use my MP3 player for is the brainbuilding experience of listening to nonfiction audio books, and the experience has the effect of continually being in university. But instead of sitting through classroom lectures, I learn while doing housework, yardwork, and driving down the highway (among other activities). Famous fitness guru Bill Phillips listens to audio books while on his recumbent bike.Because I don't listen to music and because I respect my inner ear parts (I've had them for a long time and have grown fond of them), the sound coming to them from my MP3 player is at normal conversation level. So I didn't crank the volume to max to test for distortion. That is not, to me, a relevant test. The earphones perform well for their intended use.With any earbuds, the issue of sound quality must be addressed in a review. For me, it's a matter of clearly delivering voice. I compared these earbuds to another model during my review evaluation, and these did slightly better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34C0ITLACK6CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALN54OI#wasThisHelpful","R34C0ITLACK6CP","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What impressed me immediately upon opening the package was how cool the canister looks. I also looked at the ingredients and was pleasantly surprised. So, Axe shave gel and I got off to a good start.See also my Review of Remington Alpahagel.I was a little put off by the fragrance. To me, any fragrance in a skin care product is a sign of contamination. The ingredients label does not identify what this fragrance is. In most skin care products, the fragrance is some health-damaging chemical cocktail. But in most skin care products, the entire product is some health-damaging chemical cocktail.Most of Alphagel's ingredients read like a laundry list of things you WANT to put on your skin; water and sunflower seed oil are near the top.After several days of using this, I didn't experience any skin irritation or allergy issues. While that's not a conclusive sign that the product is safe to use, most other products immediately cause my body's defenses to go to DEFCON 5.Most ""skin care"" products, including shaving products, are loaded with toxins and reek of various chemicals that allegedly ""smell good."" I use plain soap when showering, and was pleased to come across this particular shaving gel. I think any dermatologist would approve, as would specialists in endocrinology, toxicology, and pathology. Using products like this is an important part of eliminating the need for medical care and its associated misery and financial costs.It's interesting that most Americans think they are using soap, when in fact they are using a chemical-laden detergent that is harsh on their skin and puts who knows what into their bloodstream. Shaving products are similarly corrupted these days. For good information on soap and good soap products, check out Hawaiian Bath and Body. This is a great little company and I know the owners personally.With the Alphagel I reviewed, it's easy to control how much you use. Just swipe your finger across the tube opening and you have enough to put a comforting film on your face prior to shaving. With the Axe shave gel, you have to just barely tap the dispenser button. Else, you'll get enough foam for several shaves. Did I say foam, not gel? Yes, that is correct. This resembles traditional shaving foam, because foam is what you get out of the container.Another difference between these two products is you can easily see how much of the alphagel you have becuse the container is transparent. But like our federal government, the container of the Axe foaming gel lacks transparency. For the government, this is a hugely negative thing. For the shaving gel, it's not a big deal. It's just a product container difference. I think all of us are capable of giving the container a little shake to feel how much is left.One advantage the Axe has over the Alphagel is you can easily see how much is on your skin. I like that. I also like the way this feels on my skin, and the fact that it easily rinses out of my razor. I'm using one of those 220-blade (or however many they stick in there now, maybe it's 4 or 5 really) razors, which I plan to abandon after I use up the inordinately expensive blades that have to be replaced just as often as the reasonably priced ones.With some shaving products, you need a power washer system to rinse the shaving product out of the turbines, combines, or whatever they are calling these mega multi blade shaver heads these days.Nor did Axe do the childproof container thing (that's actually code for ""open-proof""). Executives of companies that permit the packaging of their products in such a way that the hapless consumer must use a chainsaw and three varieties of prybars just to open the container do not deserve their mult-million dollar bonuses. When even the Fire Department gives up after breaking a set of Jaws of Life on the stupid package, it might be a hint that the packaging needs to be re-engineered.Fortunately, the folks at Axe considered the fact that consumers might buy their product because they actually want to use it. So they packaged it in a consumer-friendly way. I think what's inside the package is pretty darn good, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBJGZ85TAW1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0J086C#wasThisHelpful","R2QBJGZ85TAW1H","A3BMMUPJUSXLLX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BMMUPJUSXLLX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The truth is that if you looking to permanently remove inches of fat from you waist there are no easy fixes or substitutions for a good diet and regular exercise.Wearing a waist trimmer alone will not remove fat without also making changes to your diet and level of exercise.

"If there is one thing I love it is mini LED flashlights. I find they come in handy and I own quite a few. I keep one on my keychain, one in my car, one at my desk at work, and one in every room in my house. You never know when a situation will arise that needs some illumination.It should be no surprise that I jumped at the chance to add another mini LED  flashlight to my collection when XFIL offered me their 9 LED Metal Encased Flashlight free in exchange for an unbiased review.This flashlight is a winner...It is compact and very lightweight making it perfect for my keychain.  For a mini flashlight it is very bright. It is as bright, if not brighter than other led mini flashlights I own. It is bright enough to illuminate a small to mid sized room nicely.Lastly, it is powered by 3 AAA batteries which are not included.If you don't already own a min LED flashlight, I highly recommend considering this one for your keychain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOL3ARE1NJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VPGFX0#wasThisHelpful","R1EOL3ARE1NJG","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love ginger tea so I am delighted to have been selected to sample, for free, Kazu's 100% Certified Organic Ginger Root Tea in exchange for my unbiased review. The tea has a subtle but distinctive ginger taste that is delicious and has a wonderful aroma.I love drinking ginger tea on cold mornings and nights because it really warms the belly. I also run to the ginger tea when I have an upset stomach or gas pains. Ginger aids digestion and helps the muscles in my stomach to relax and soothe my upset stomach. It also does a great job providing relief from gas pains.Drinking ginger tea on a daily basis is also a great way to lose weight. Ginger contains thermogenic agents that increases your metabolism and helps to burn off stored body fat.Whatever your reason for drinking this tea... enjoy but don't over do it because studies have shown that too much of this good thing may have undesirable side effects like diarrhea, heartburn, headaches, sleeplessness, and/or a racing heartbeat. I drink 2 - 3 cups a day of this potent tea and never experienced any of these issues.One other warning to individuals with gallstones... Ginger is best avoided by those suffering from gallstones because it increases the secretion of bile and if taken in large amount it could trigger a gallbladder attack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YNB9DYREADW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125PKVHY#wasThisHelpful","R1YNB9DYREADW2","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The truth is that if you looking to permanently remove inches of fat from you waist there are no easy fixes or substitutions for a good diet and regular exercise.Wearing a waist trimmer alone will not remove fat without also making changes to your diet and level of exercise. What the waist belt does is create an illusion of weight loss. If you wear this during an exercise session and work up a good sweat, you might find yourself 5 to 10 pounds lighter afterwards and your stomach may look a little smaller due to the water loss but it is not permanent weight loss. I call this weight loss an illusion because it is just water weight and it will shortly return once you start to hydrate yourself.Sweat belts like these are commonly used by wrestlers and other athletes to bring down their weight for weigh ins. Some professional wrestlers actually have suits made of this stuff and they wear them in the sauna before weigh-ins. These belts work great for this purpose and after a hour of exercise, my stomach and the inside of the belt are both soaked in sweat.This belt is of quality construction and there is no odor like some other waist belts I have used. I have been using the belt for a solid month during exercise and while doing yard work and I find it is comfortable to wear and it works great as a back brace. After a hour plus of mowing the lawn I would usually have a sore lower back but I had no pain at all after moving while wearing this belt. For this reason alone, the belt is worth 5 stars to me.* I received this free in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21OJ0MVCMBL80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YIA35LY#wasThisHelpful","R21OJ0MVCMBL80","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you can only own one piece of exercise equipment, choose a decent jump rope. Seriously, you can get a great full body workout by just using your jump rope.Some of the benefits of jumping rope are:01 Weight Loss - Forget about fad diets and supplements that promise weight loss without any change in your lifestyle. The most effective and healthy way to lose weight is physical activity. It doesn't matter what you do... run, walk, swim, jump rope, bike or frolic in the cornfield. Just move your body, work up a sweat, and get your breathing and heart rate up. You can burn roughly 300 calories by jumping rope for just 30 minutes.02 Increased Cardiovascular Fitness - Forgot about those insane 15 minute workouts. Low to moderate exercises that you can sustain for extended periods of time are best for cardiovascular health. Walking and jumping rope are two excellent ways to strengthen your cardiovascular system and increase your endurance.03 Increased Muscle Tone - Jumping rope is a full body workout. It works muscles in both your upper and lower body. Think about what muscles you are working when you are jumping rope... your calves, thighs, arms and shoulders. There are jumping variations that also give the muscles in your chest, back, and abs a good workout. It is also a great way to increase bone density with less impact on your joints than running.04 Relieves Tension and Stress05 It Is a Portable Workout - You can easily take a jump rope with you anywhere. Take it to work and go outside and jump rope for a half hour during your lunch.06 It Is Inexpensive - You are not going to find another piece of gym equipment that gives you a full body workout for less than the cost of a jump rope.Anoeky offers a plastic jump rope at a reasonable price. The jump rope is 9.8 feet long, has comfy foam handles and can be adjusted to your height with a little bit of effort.The box says it is adjustable but there are no instructions on how to adjust it so I will explain. First you need to pop off the the black caps on the end of the handles. I couldn't get them off with my fingers so I used the edge of a flat head screwdriver to pop them off. Next you pull the desired amount rope through the metal clip towards you and then tighten the metal clip to hold the position of the rope. I needed to use pliers to tighten the metal clip. Finally, tuck the excess rope into the hollow handles and put the caps back on.Have fun jumping rope and remember to wear a comfortable pair of shoes while jumping.

"I like to organize and label things so I was pretty excited to be offered these Chalkboard Labels and Liquid Chalk Marker for free in exchange for my unbiased review.I wasn't too sure if these would really work as advertised but it turns out they do and I'm loving them. No more having to go through the trouble of peeling off old traditional labels and using goo gone to clean off the sticky residue on the glass jars or plastic containers before labeling them again for something new.Now I just need to put one of these new labels on the container and use the included liquid chalk marker to label it. When I want to reuse the container for something new, I just wipe away the writing with a damp cloth and write something else on it. Simple as that.The set comes with twelve sheets of labels with six labels per sheet. That is seventy-two 2"" x 3"" labels. I found they easily peeled off the white backing paper and stick securely to my plastic and glass containers. They also peel off the containers easily when I want to reposition or remove the label.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLON0ME9MLJOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX9BTKE#wasThisHelpful","RLON0ME9MLJOX","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The lid set comes with five suction lids of varying sizes (4in, 6in, 8in, 10in and 12in). I was expecting ""traditional"" snap lids made of food grade silicone rather than plastic so I was a little surprised by the look of these lids. When I first saw them I thought there was no way these would suction on to a bowl or mug, let alone be able to stay on tight enough to lift the bowl like shown in the listing photos.I was wrong...I have been using these lids at home and at work for the last three weeks and I am very impressed by this handy gadget. One thing I have been using these for is to cover bowls full of leftovers. First off, it has been saving me some bucks by not having to use saran wrap or aluminum foil to cover the bowls. More importantly, these actually work. The lids suction so tightly on to the bowls and I am able to carry the bowls to the fridge by the handle on the lid. I could not believe it.This little feature is really handy when I have my morning and afternoon tea at work. At work I have to use the microwave to boil water for my tea and then carry the hot mug to my desk. It may not sound like a big deal but it is to me because I tend to spill. Now I can just put on a lid and use it to carry my mug. It hasn't come loose yet and I no long suffer spills and third degree burns.One other thing about these lids that impressed me is how easily the lids come off the bowls. The suction is so tight that I thought you would have to be a circus strongman to get the lids off. That is not the case, the lids peel off the bowls without any effort at all.One caveat about these lids is that they will only work with bowls or cups with round openings and without pouring lips. The company should work on another set of lids for square and rectangular shaped bowls.These Silicone Suction Lids from Qooware are something I never thought about ever needing but now that I have been using them, I don't know how I ever got along without them.* I received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CT1JDQ4L18S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZUPHMG#wasThisHelpful","R1CT1JDQ4L18S1","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cook with ginger quite a bit so I am delighted to have been selected to sample, for free, Kazu's 100% Organic Certified Ginger Root Powder in exchange for my unbiased review. The ginger is pure and very potent and a little goes a long way. It has excellent taste and aroma. Plus... it is organic.Ginger is a very common and delicious ingredient in Indian and Asian dishes. I find that ginger matches well with chicken dishes, sweet potatoes, and carrots. I also use ginger to flavor plain rice pilaf, as a topping on my frozen yogurt, and to flavor gingerbread.In addition to its culinary uses, ginger powder has other benefits people may not be aware of...01 Relieve Stomach Aches - Ginger aids digestion and helps the muscles in your stomach to relax. I will take two teaspoons of the ginger powder and a pinch of brown sugar and mix the two together in an eight ounce glass of carrot juice. It warms my belly and helps my upset stomach. It also works well for relief from gas pains.02 Soothe Arthritis - Ginger is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and can be used to soothe arthritis pain. You can easily make a tea from the powder by adding two tablespoons to a cup of water and bring it to a boil. I don't have arthritis but a co-worker of mine does and swears by this.03 Promotes Weight Loss - Drinking a cup of ginger tea every day is a great way to lose weight. Mix a teaspoon of the ginger powder into a cup of hot water and add a little honey for a delicious belly warming tea for weight loss. Ginger contains thermogenic agents that increases your metabolism and helps to burn off stored body fat.04 Skin Care - Ginger has anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties that aids in unclogging pores and killing off acne causing bacteria. You can use a mix of ginger and milk powder to make a paste for your skin. Apply the paste to your face and neck and let it sit for twenty minutes before washing it off. My wife will apply a facial moisturizer afterwards. Do this once a week to prevent breakouts.Before you go cooking or self-medicating with ginger, please note that in large doses ginger can thin blood and inhibit blood clotting, cause heartburn and diarrhea, and can cause heart palpitations. I have never experienced any of these issues but wanted to mention it and stress the importance of not over doing a good thing. If you follow your recipes, you shouldn't have any issues.I have been using this ginger two to three times a week for the last three weeks and I highly recommend this top notched ginger from Kazu.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQM7GF3R9S0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125CLKAY#wasThisHelpful","R2JQM7GF3R9S0A","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The wife and I recently bought a tandem bike and I spent the last weekend tricking out our bicycle built for two with this LED Bike Light Set.Pros:01. Easy To Install - The headlight is actually a LED flashlight with an adjustable zoom focus. It slides into a notch in the cradle that clamps down on my bike.  Installing the bike headlight is very easy and no tools are needed. Installing the rear bike light is also easy and no tools are needed. Just find a post on the back of the bike and strap the rear light to it. Simple.02. Sturdy and Weatherproof - The headlight stays locked in the cradle very securely and the cradle itself stays clamped tightly on the bikes front post. The rear light stays on my rear post tightly. Both stayed in place during a two-hour bike ride so I have no worries about either coming loose. Both lights and the cradle are all weatherproof. I wouldnt submerge them in water but it will survive if you are caught in a rain shower during your bike ride.03. Easy To Use - The headlight is just like using a flashlight. You just need to click the button at the end of the light once to turn it on. Simple. I usually use the light in its normal setting for maximum light coverage but you can also twist the head of the light into a tighter and brighter beam of light that is helpful when looking in smaller areas. If you click the button twice in quick succession you will activate the blinking strobe mode. Working the rear light is also easy. You just need to click the red button to turn the light on and keep pressing it to toggle through solid, fast strobe, and slow strobe modes.04. Bright - You will be able to see where you are going at night as well as be seen by motorists. The headlight is very bright for a single LED. It is the brightest bike headlight I have ever owned. The rear light is also very bright.05. Rechargeable Batteries - The bike light set comes with two 2500mAh 18650 rechargeable batteries and a 18650 battery charger. The headlight is powered by one rechargeable battery and lasts for about six hours before needing a charge. There is also a AAA battery holder so you have the option of powering the light with three AAA batteries but why use expensive disposable batteries? The rear light is powered a CR2032 cell battery. These are not rechargeable and cost about five bucks but there are four included in the set.06. BONUS Stuff - The headlight is a flashlight. I slide it out of the cradle when I'm not biking and use it as a handheld flashlight. I love flashlights so I find this to be a sweet bonus. I also found the inclusion of the batteries and the charger a nice bonus.Overall, the price is a bargain for this quality bike light set. I have seen headlights alone that are the same price as this set but not even close in quality.I highly recommend the Sunspeed Waterproof Rechargeable LED Bike Light Set.* I received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PG5XQQN1X61T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WS0V3O2#wasThisHelpful","R1PG5XQQN1X61T","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always used cotton washcloths and have never heard of washcloths made from bamboo. I was curious about these natural bamboo washcloths. How much softer than cotton could they really be? After all, a washcloth is a washcloth. Right?Wrong.The first thing I noticed about these bamboo washcloths from the Motherhood Collection is how plush they are. I don't know how they compare to other bamboo washcloths but they are markedly softer than any of my premium cotton ones. They feel incredible on my skin. If I close my eyes and you brush one of these across my cheek, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and a cashmere sweater.The luxurious feel of these washcloths are enough for me to highly recommend them but there is more...These eco-friendly washcloths are naturally antibacterial, hypoallergenic, and free of dyes, chemicals, and toxins making them perfect for anyone with sensitive skin.*I received these free in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1DPIPDTQKAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J9BYC8#wasThisHelpful","RU1DPIPDTQKAF","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I especially like the non-slip silicone handles which are easier to grip and more comfortable to hold than my old squeezer.03 Good Size - This is marketed as a lemon and lime squeezer but it is big enough for me to squeeze the juice out of mandarin oranges too.04 No More Seeds  I have been enjoying seed free orange and lemon juice thanks to this squeezer. This is a big selling point for me because I hate seeds in my drinks.05 Easy To Clean - I love that the squeezer is dishwasher safe.

"My wife and I just installed raised garden beds this spring. The sunny area of our yard where we needed to put the garden beds is also the darkest area of the yard at night. It is also in a quiet and secluded spot on the side of our garage. This is a bad combination because there is little to deter critters from getting into our garden. To solve our little problem we installed this solar powered LED landscape light.Pros:01. The unit is easy to assemble and setup. You just attach the stake to the spotlight and stick it in the ground. Turn the unit on and it is ready to go.02. The unit has four bright white LED bulbs that have been doing a good job deterring critters looking for a late night snack from getting in my flower and garden beds. I leave the unit on low and it comes on at dusk and goes off when first light reaches the solar panel. The LED bulbs do dim throughout the evening but it is still enough light to cover my garden.Results will vary based on lighting conditions but for best results position the solar panel to get maximum sun expose and don't forget to peel of the film from the solar panel. I keep my unit in the sunniest area of my yard and then move it to the garden when I get home from work and have been happy with the results.03. It may not be as consistently bright as an electric spotlight but I'm saving money by using solar power and it is meeting my needs just fine.Cons:1. The one thing I don't like is the stake that connects to the spotlight does not lock that tightly into place. That unit stays attached to the stake when it is left alone but I am moving it every day. When I tug it out of the ground it always separates and I need to dig out the stake. If you are having the same issue, here is a tip...

"ChoiceMMed's digital scale is head and shoulders above my plain old white dial scale and is a welcome addition to the master bathroom.First, it is aesthetically pleasing and really adds class to the bathroom. I love the sleek design of the scale and the tempered glass. One bad thing about the glass is that it easily attracts fingerprints and dust. Fortunately it easily wipes right off the glass.Second, I love that this is digital and not another dial scale. No more fussing with the dial to get the red needle to line up perfectly with zero. No more having to look at the scale dead on to get an accurate weight. All I need to do with ChoiceMMed's scale is step on the scale and get an instant reading.The third and most important thing about the digital scale is that it is accurate. When I first stepped on the scale, I was aghast by the readout. The first thing I said to my wife is ""this is a beautiful scale but it is wildly inaccurate"". She brought up a couple of her hand weights to test out the scale's accuracy. The three pound hand weight didn't register at all. The five pound hand weight did turn on the scale and the reading was spot on.After coming with terms with being twenty pounds heavier than I thought, muscle weighs more than fat I told myself, I weighed myself ten times in a row to see if I would get the same results. Nine of the ten readings were exactly the same. One reading was off from the others by a variance of less than a 1/2 pound. Not bad at all.A few more things to note:I first tried the scale with it on the bathroom rug and I only weighed seventy pounds. I don't know the science behind it but the scale must be on a hard flat surface in order to get an accurate reading.The scale is for individuals that weigh up to 396 pounds.The scale is powered by two AAA batteries which are included.*I received this free in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AQT3CFTSJHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W36T8T8#wasThisHelpful","R33AQT3CFTSJHJ","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I entered into manhood, my Uncle Alfredo shared with me that great virility is a dual-edged sword and must be wielded with great responsibility.I listened carefully to my uncle because I knew he was not as lucky as I to have someone share this cautionary advice with him. You see, as a young man he and his virility traveled the perilous road of amore. When you travel such a road, you need to think about protection and Im not talking about latex. What I speak of is known as the cornicello or little bull horn. When you have had as many spurned lovers as Uncle Alfredo, you most definitely need to wear one to ward off the evil eye.I was hoping to get a necklace with a 3 inch cornicello so I can display my virility to the world while protecting myself from the evil eye. My wife had other ideas so what I got instead, free in exchange for this unbiased review, is the Bamoer cubic zirconia white Gold plated round halo pendant necklace.When I first saw this necklace, I knew my wife would love it. My wife prefers small dainty jewelry and, as I predicted, she loves this necklace.The circular pendant is beautiful with a very classy looking design making it perfect for that big night out. It also looks great with jeans and a sweater so it works for more casual outings as well. The stones maybe cubic zirconia but they have nice clarity and really sparkle.The only negative thing I found with the necklace is the chain. It seems a little too delicate to me and seems to be prone to knotting. It isn't a big deal to my wife though. She says these are the types of chains you get in this price range and the knots are easy to undo so that is not an issue for her.If you are in the market for inexpensive jewelry, you can't go wrong with this necklace.

"The XFIL Adjustable Zoom Focus LED Flashlight is a nice addition to my growing collection of flashlights.The flashlight is made of plastic and is very light to carry around or hang on my belt.This flashlight is pretty bright considering its size and it only has a single LED bulb. I have brighter mini LED flashlights but this one is bright enough to illuminate a small to mid sized room quite nicely.The one feature this flashlight has, that my others do not, is the adjustable zoom focus. I usually use the flashlight in its normal setting for maximum light coverage but it is nice to have the option to change the light to a tighter and brighter beam of light for reading small print or looking in smaller areas.The flashlight does not come with instructions so I'm going to explain how to operate the zoom feature. When I first turned it on, for some reason I thought I should rotate the head of the flashlight to adjust the focus. I was turning and turning and the light didn't change. After a few minutes, I realized you need to pull out the lens covering in order to change the light to a smaller and brighter beam of light.Finally, the flashlight is powered by 3 AAA batteries which are not included.*I received this free in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJY8YI3R1ZLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DDM0N2#wasThisHelpful","R1OJY8YI3R1ZLJ","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to burn essential oils to freshen up the house and to enhance my moods so I jumped at an offer to receive the Amir Essential Oil Diffuser free in exchange for an unbiased review.I burn a lot of essential oil. I like to start my morning off by burning peppermint oil. I find the cool peppermint scent a very refreshing and invigorating way to kick of the day. At night I burn lavender in order to relax and quickly fall asleep. The scent of lavender really does help me get a deep restful sleep. I also burn tea tree throughout the day during cold/flu season and I will burn eucalyptus to help alleviate sinus issues due to colds or allergies.I would burn the oil in the two piece ceramic diffusers that typically come with cheap aromatherapy kits. I found these ceramic diffusers to be a pain. You place a tea light candle in the bottom one and put drops of oil in the top one. It is simple enough to use and they work well at first. The top piece where you put the oil is a pain to clean and it eventually ends up cracking from the constant exposure to heat. I then would continue to use the bottom one for the candle and above it I would place a piece of aluminum foil with the oil. This method worked well for a while until one night the oil ignited and started burning the foil. Fortunately, I was still awake and the diffuser was placed in the bathroom with nothing around it to catch fire so it burned fast and quick. It is scary to think of what could have happened. Needless to say, I dont burn essential oils like this anymore.Im really like the Amir Essential Oil Diffuser. It is easy to use, easy to care for, and most importantly SAFE.Pros:01 Easy To Use  It is as simple as adding water, adding a few drops of essential oil, and turning it on.02 Attractive  The unit is far more attractive than my old ceramic diffusers. A cool feature is that the diffuser will change colors. It will rotate through seven different colors on its own or you can choose one stationary color (there are seven colors you can pick from and two lighting modes: bright or subtle). You can also opt for no light at all with the click of a button. I find it relaxing to watch the colors change in a dark room.03 Moisturizes Too  In the winter and summer, I usually run a vaporizer in the bedroom to combat dry air. I think it is great this can effectively diffuse essential oil into the room and put a little moisture into the air as well.04 SAFE  Fire bad. Im glad I dont need an open flame to burn my oils anymore. The unit also has an auto off feature. When the water gets low, the unit turns itself off. This is great for me because I will use it a bedtime and I can just fall asleep without worrying about the unit overheating or the house burning down around me.Cons:None.Ive been using this non-stop for the last three weeks and havent run into any issues yet. I will update the review if I encounter any problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DRJLXSH9QDP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QMDYDI#wasThisHelpful","R1DRJLXSH9QDP5","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been using my four pack of ice ball makers from Teikis to make cranberry juice spheres for my orange juice and lemonade. The perfectly shaped 2.5"" diameter spheres melt at a nice slow rate and keep my drinks colder longer.The ice ball molds are easy enough to use and the flexible silicone makes it easy to pop out the spheres without any struggles.The ice ball molds are made from FDA approved food grade silicone and are 100% BPA free. I like that these are dishwasher safe and easy to clean. I also like that these are four individual molds with flat bottoms because it makes it easier for me to find places to put these in a crowded freezer.I suggest giving these a try.

"I have been using Acadia's Spikey Massage Balls daily and they have provided me great relief from tired and sore muscles.I sit at a computer for 8+ hours a day and the arm that I use to handle my mouse gets pretty sore on some days. I have been using the ball to massage my forearm throughout the day at work. I hold the ball in one hand and I role it up and down my forearm for about 60 seconds to ease the pain. It really helps.I also have been using the balls at work to soothe my tired and sore feet. I slide off my shoe and roll my bare feet over the massage balls. I'll also do this at home while watching television. It feels great. My wife loves to massage her feet with these as well.The set includes a 2.8"",3.5"",and 3.9"" ball so you should find one that is the perfect size for you. There is some give when I squeeze them which is fine with me. The balls can be inflated if you desire extra firmness.Included with the balls are three reflexology charts (two for the feet and one for the hand) printed on a 8.5"" x 11"" sheet of semi-gloss paper.

"I had another similar hose sprayer that I loved. It lasted five years before I accidentally dropped it. I was hosing down the car when my wife decided she wanted to have a water fight and blasted my in the face with the other hose causing me to drop the sprayer on the driveway which cracked the plastic spray dial. After burying the sprayer in the backyard, I jumped online to look for a replacement and found this sprayer from Coolife.Pros:01 Eight Spray Settings - Watering the grass, watering new seedlings, washing the car. Different jobs require different streams of water. This hose sprayer has settings for eight spray patterns: cone, jet, center, mist, shower, rinse, flat, and soaker. There is also a flow control knob to control the flow of water. Gone are the days of holding your thumb over the end of the hose to get different water streams.02 Comfortable - The shape and design of the sprayer handle and fits my hand perfectly. It also has a clip that securely holds down the trigger for hands-free watering.03 No Leaks - I've been using this for two weeks and have not experienced any leaking from the base or at the spray dial.04 Peace of Mind - There is a two year warranty against breaks and leaks.Cons:01 Plastic Trigger - The only improvement that I suggest is making the trigger out of metal like the rest of the sprayers body rather than plastic. It should be fine as long I don't drop this one on the concrete.I highly recommend this sprayer by Coolife and give it 5 stars. I will update my review and rating if the sprayer develops leaks or dies a premature death.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KBPK7ZWV6OWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YKT53I6#wasThisHelpful","R3KBPK7ZWV6OWM","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play.

"I was pretty excited when I was contacted by the seller to review this backpack in exchange for my unbiased review because Autumn is coming and I could really use a new backpack for hiking.The Enpassion backpack in the photos looked great but be warned, the backpack pictured and described is nothing like what I received and I am extremely disappointed. If this wasn't free, I would be furious.So why am I disappointed you ask. Let me count the ways...01 The backpack is much smaller than it appears in the photos. It looks like a kids book bag and is much too small for my frame. It does fit my wife though and she likes it. (More on that later)02 The description states there are many compartments...""You will be able to keep all your items organized with these three zippered compartments. The main pocket is large enough for all your items. The smaller pocket is great for things you would need quickly such as a map, camera or guide book. The inner zipper pocket doubles as a storage pouch and is the perfect place for credit cards, passports, cash, etc.""My backpack does not have an inner pocket, zippered or otherwise. There is only the main opening and the zippered storage pouch that the backpack folds into (this is a cool feature). I should mention is that the design of the storage pouch only allows the pouch to be zipped shut when the backpack is inside it. There is another pocket on the front of the bag that I won't use because it does not have a zipper. Without one, things can easily fall out or be quietly purloined by a pair of quick hands. There are also two grey mesh pockets that are perfect for water bottles but the mesh is not tightly woven like what is pictured and I can easily see it tearing with constant use.03 The photos in the listing does not really give you an idea of how cheap the shoulder straps are. They are made of a grey mesh material and are not padded. They are not durable at all and I would not use this backpack to carry anything heavy. It might be fine for light items but if you are planning to use this as a book bag on a daily basis, I can easily see that straps ripping within one month.04 One last annoyance for me is the color scheme. I wanted all black as pictured. The backpack I received has grey mesh pockets and grey straps. Worst of all, on the front of the backpack the name of the manufacturer is boldly presented in large white text. I find that rather tacky and would not have accepted the backpack for review if I knew if was on there.I usually don't include photos with my reviews but I am with this one so buyers can see what the backpack really looks like.When I was snapping my photos, my wife came along and picked up the backpack and said she really liked it. She always can find the good in everything. I guess that explains why she is with me but I digress.She pointed out that the inside of the backpack is made of a water/moisture resistant material which makes this perfect for her to carry her wet swimsuit, swim cap, and goggles home from the pool. I have to concede that the backpack would be good for that. It could also be used to carry home sweaty workout clothes from the gym. The inside is easy to wipe down and keep clean. There are too many negatives for me to rate this higher than two stars. My wife who is using the backpack likes it and rates it four stars so I'm giving this a median rating of three stars or its okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R363UW8GBZCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131EPSB2#wasThisHelpful","R363UW8GBZCV","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iPhone 6 Waterproof Case from Tethys offers good protection from the elements and is perfect for a day at the beach or any other activity where exposure to water, sand, snow, and/or dust is likely.Pros:01 The case is waterproof as advertised. I put tissue paper inside the case and submerged it in my tub for a half hour. I opened up the case and everything was dry. I also tossed the case in a bucket of sand to simulate dropping the phone at the beach. I opened up the case and there was no sand inside. I have no doubt this should protect my phone from water, sand, and dirt and would be a perfect case for a day at the beach or any other outdoor activity.02 In addition to being element proof, the case frame is made of hard plastic and seems rugged enough to protect my phone from a fall.03 I like the slim design of the case. It contours well to my hand unlike some of the thicker waterproof cases that feel bulky and awkward to hold.Cons:01 The case is not that easy to open or close. When I tried to open the case, I couldnt get the tab to budge using my thumb. I had to use a small screwdriver to pry open the case. When closing up the case, you need to line up everything just so and press hard around all the edges to make sure it is sealed up otherwise you could leave a gap for water to get in.02 Only Apple Headphones and Apple Lightning Charging Cables will work with the case.* I received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7807AV07KV6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HCPIWC#wasThisHelpful","R7807AV07KV6O","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summer is here and so is the heat. The central air conditioning has wreaked havoc on my sensitive skin leaving it rough and dry.Ive used grape seed oil on my skin with mixed results. It helped my dry skin somewhat but it didnt leave my skin totally soft. I figured I needed something a little tougher for the winter and summer months and moved on to almond oil. I have been using almond oil for a couple of years. I apply it to my skin daily after my evening shower and have been getting great results.Ive read about coconut oil but never tried it before as I have be happy with the almond oil. By chance, I received an offer for a free sample of Ellie's Best Fractionated Coconut Oil in exchange for an unbiased review. I gladly accepted the offer and have been using the coconut oil exclusively for the last two weeks. I have been applying it with lavender daily after my evening shower. The odorless oil quickly absorbs into my skin and does not leave it feeling greasy. It is doing a good job keeping my skin soft and smooth and also relieves the itchiness. It has only been a couple weeks so I cant say for sure if this is better than the almond oil but I am very pleased with the coconut oil so far and will continue to use it.I've read quite a few reviews where the reviewers did not receive their bonus pumps. I'm not sure what the issue was but it appears to have been corrected.

"3Cworld offers quite of few really cute decorative cases. My daughter is going through a little princess phase and this one was a big hit with my girl. She loves it. The artwork is absolutely beautiful.Artwork aside, the case is pretty basic, It is really easy to install your phone in it. The iPhone 6 slides right into the case with ease. The case is made of thin hard plastic that doesn't provide much in the way of protection if you drop your phone so handle with care. In all fairness, the big selling point of this case is more about art and style anyway than it is about protection. 3Cworld includes a screen protector and cleaning cloth with the case.If you are in the market for a beautiful inexpensive basic case this may be the one for you.* I received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OXJZ7LJRGPSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSTUDGS#wasThisHelpful","R1OXJZ7LJRGPSR","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work in an office and spend a good portion of my day at a computer. The arm of the hand that I use to operate my mouse gets sore after long periods so I thought I'd give these arm compression sleeves a try.I tend to avoid purchasing clothing online because sizing can vary so much from manufacturer to manufacturer and I dont want to deal with the hassle of returning things that dont fit. I was a little worried about what size to get but the sizing chart provided by the company is accurate and the sleeves are a perfect fit.In addition to being a perfect fit, the sleeves are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. They stay on tight and provide excellent compression throughout my work day and workouts. (I have also been using the full arm sleeves when lifting weights and have noticed less muscle soreness the next morning.)The compression sleeves are made well and all the stitching is tight. I like that the sleeves are made of 15% spandex and 85% nylon rather than being 100% neoprene like some other compression sleeves. These sleeves do not have a bad odor like neoprene sleeves that tend to smell really funky. These are pretty easy to care for too. They can be machine washed on cold and tumble dried on low.I found these sleeves are the perfect solution to my problem. The sleeves provide enough compression on my arm to solve my issue and Im on the computer now for hours and no more soreness.Now I need to find something like this to help put compression on my achilles tendon when I run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFWY10A0U20L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXATA0A#wasThisHelpful","R3UFWY10A0U20L","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I swim for recreation and exercise. We are not professional swimmers. That being said, we both agree these are very nice swim goggles for the money and perfectly suit our needs.Pros:01 The most important thing that I look for in swim goggles is a good waterproof seal. The seal on these goggles suction tightly around my eyes but is still comfortable to wear. The suction is so good that I really have to give these a tug to take them off. I've been using these for a week now and have not experienced any leaks yet.02 The headstrap is adjustable and comfortable to wear.03 The lenses have an anti-fog coating that seems to work. I haven't experienced any fogging issues.

"The weather has finally warmed up and Im looking forward to trips to the beach. It seems like the question of where to store my things always arises. Ideally, I want to keep my things in a place that will keep them dry and free of sand. Somehow, my stuff always ends up stuffed in the toe of my shoes. The 3Cworld Waterproof Pouch gives me a great place to keep my phone, wallet, keys and other possessions safe from the elements.The translucent blue PVC plastic pouch has two very tight ziploc style seals. These are not cheap seals that close with a glide of the finger and open just as easily. It really took me some effort to close the seals and pull them open. The second seal is right above the first and folds over the first for extra protection. That interior closure is kept shut by a flap. The velcro that closes the flap could be a little stronger but it keeps the flap shut. The flap is meant to face outwards but I wear it with the flap facing me so it is pressed against my body for added protection.I could tell by looking that the pouch is waterproof but I decided to test it out before using it with my phone. I put tissue paper inside the pouch and submerged it in my tub for a half hour. I opened up the pouch and the tissue paper was dry. I also tossed the pouch in a bucket of sand to simulate dropping the phone at the beach. I opened up the pouch and there was no sand inside. I have no doubt that whether I choose to wear my new waterproof pouch or stuff it in my shoe, my things will stay dry and free of sand. It is perfect for a day at the beach or any other outdoor activity.* I received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCLOOM29TYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXLHYXE#wasThisHelpful","R3CCLOOM29TYF","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to burn essential oils to freshen up the house and to enhance my moods so I jumped at an offer to receive the iHomeSet Essential Oil Diffuser free in exchange for an unbiased review.I burn a lot of essential oil. I like to start my morning off by burning peppermint oil. I find the cool peppermint scent a very refreshing and invigorating way to kick of the day. At night I burn lavender in order to relax and quickly fall asleep. The scent of lavender really does help me get a deep restful sleep. I also burn tea tree throughout the day during cold/flu season and I will burn eucalyptus to help alleviate sinus issues due to colds or allergies.I would burn the oil in the two piece ceramic diffusers that typically come with cheap aromatherapy kits. I found these ceramic diffusers to be a pain.  You place a tea light candle in the bottom one and put drops of oil in the top one. It is simple enough to use and they work well at first. The top piece where you put the oil is a pain to clean and it eventually ends up cracking from the constant exposure to heat. I then would continue to use the bottom one for the candle and above it I would place a piece of aluminum foil with the oil. This method worked well for a while until one night the oil ignited and started burning the foil. Fortunately, I was still awake and the diffuser was placed in the bathroom with nothing around it to catch fire so it burned fast and quick. It is scary to think of what could have happened. Needless to say, I dont burn essential oils like this anymore.Im really glad I was contacted about the iHomeSet Essential Oil Diffuser. It is easy to use, easy to care for, and most importantly SAFE.Pros:01 Easy To Use  It is as simple as adding water, adding a couple drops of essential oil, and turning it on.02 Attractive  The unit is far more attractive than my old ceramic diffusers. I like the faux wood appearance and it looks nice on my nightstand. Another cool feature is that the plastic top of the diffuser will change colors. Dont worry, It is not like a flashing neon sign. The colors are subtle and I find it relaxing to watch in the dark. You can also choose one stationary color or opt for no light at all with the click of a button.03 Moisturizes Too  In the winter and summer, I usually run a vaporizer in the bedroom to combat dry air. I think it is great this can effectively diffuse essential oil into the room and put a little moisture into the air as well.04 SAFE  Fire bad. Im glad I dont need an open flame to burn my oils anymore. The unit also has an auto off feature. When the water gets low, the unit turns itself off. This is great for me because I will use it a bedtime and I can just fall asleep without worrying about the unit overheating or the house burning down around me.Cons:01 Some people have complained they have a hard time opening this but I found it is pretty easy to open. Just a twist and it is open. Ive been using this non-stop for the last three weeks and havent run into any issues yet. I will update the review if I encounter any problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1FUDCGURB0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF6YTNM#wasThisHelpful","RM1FUDCGURB0C","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Director of my business unit is a pretty nice guy but lately he seems to be going through some strange mid-life crisis.One day he came into work wearing a Justin Bieber style wig. The whole company (aka The Hive) knows he is bald but out of fear of losing their jobs they all pretend the wig is his natural hair.The next week he stopped carrying a briefcase and starts wearing a backpack to work. He is often seen running from meeting to meeting with his backpack on. He turns up at our standup meetings with his backpack slung around one arm. He wears it everywhere. The Hive share a collective mind and, lo and behold, the next week 99.9% of the company are running around with backpacks. Things got crazy and my Manager called me into his office and started asking me why I dont wear a backpack. He really put the pressure on. It was like a CIA interrogation sans the water-boarding. Three hours later I am given an ultimatum, start being a team player and show up to work on Monday morning wearing a backpack or else. Oh no. The dreaded or else.It was lucky for me I found this backpack. I am impressed by the quality construction of the backpack. It feels very durable and I expect it last for a long time. The backpack is covered in polka dots making it fashionable and fun as well as a practical way to carry around my stuff. On the outside of the backpack there is a zippered pocket large enough to carry my wallet, phone and/or checkbook. There is a thin deep pocket on each side of the large pocket. These are perfect to carry your pens, pencils, ruler etc. On the fully lined inside there is a large pocket and 2 small pockets. It is roomy enough for my laptop plus additional items. It is also good for your books. In addition to being functionable (fashion + function), the backpack is also comfortable. The shoulder straps are padded and I find that it is comfortable to wear.I was very excited to go to work on Monday knowing Id be the envy of the office. Sure enough, my co-workers smiled at me for getting a backpack and joining The Hive. All day all I heard was the buzzing of co-workers whispering about me. I figured the backpack was a hit. A friend took me aside and broke the news to me. It turned out my co-workers were making fun of me for wearing a girls backpack. I felt my face get red from equal parts anger and embarrassment and ran to the nearest conference room with tears streaming down my face. In my upset state, I didnt notice the Director sitting in there watching Hip-Hop videos. I only spoke with him a couple times in the past but he was very personable and nicely asked me why I was crying. After I explained the whole situation to him, he reassured me that I have a very attractive unisex backpack and asked me where I got it.The following Monday, the Director rode his Segway up and down the aisles wearing his new Casual Style Polka Dots Canvas Laptop Backpack. There was no laughing or whispering from The Hive. In fact, by the end of the week the entire Hive was wearing one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VQTCYU8BXS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M80Z84I#wasThisHelpful","R28VQTCYU8BXS8","A17W587EH23J0Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17W587EH23J0Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a coupon in the mail from Harbor Freight Tools for a free Pittsburgh 30 ft x 1-Inch quikfind tape measure and off I ran.Being a freebie, I was expecting a poorly made, light-weight tape measure. I was wrong. This tape measure is very sturdy and the rubber wrapped case really gives it a real heavy-duty feel. The extra-thick blade alIows me to extend the tape out a good 5 feet without bending. Something on this tape that I haven't seen before is when you reach 13 inches, there is an additional reading of 1 ft, 1 right above the 13. When you reach 14 inches, the additional reading is 1 ft, 2 and so on. I thought this was a neat feature for who can't convert inches to feet on the fly. The only negative I have is that it can be a little tough to move the thumb lock. It does seem to become easier to move the more you use it and it does lock the tape into place very securely.This tape measure goes to show that the old adage, 'you get what you pay for', doesn't always hold true. It is a very welcome addition on my tool belt. I've noticed that since I've been wearing it the ladies are giving me a second glance.

"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, the dvds wouldn't play, and someone was even talking about dang tv logos at the beginning of the shows. I don't know if they got bad bootleg copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no tv logos and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode.

"I'm a huge Deep Red fan; they produce some very visually engaging and less run-of-the-mill stuff. I'm an active snail mailer and always looking to add postal themed stamps to my collection. What I didn't pay attention to, in my haste to finalize my order at the fantastic price being offered, is that this baby is a pretty good size!So yep, it's far bigger than I was expecting so just in case you missed it too: the overall dimensions are 3-1/2"" by 3-1/4"" and the image produced is obviously nearly as big. Now, that's not exactly gigantic, but is important to note if you happen to not own a block large enough to accommodate it or planned on using it as just a small touch on little envelopes. But it makes for a very arresting and kinda old-timey image (lots of graining and speckles but still remains crisp) and is ideal for 4x6 (or larger) cards. Postal fans will appreciate the shout out to the Postmaster General and the raised flag. What's more fun than raising that little red flag to tell the carrier you've got something to mail?! Sadly, few practice that anymore, but, regardless, this mailbox has lots of fun post-stamping additional deco possibilities; another quality piece from Deep Red.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MN9WVUIMOEYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLJUDT6#wasThisHelpful","R2MN9WVUIMOEYT","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very nice wood-mounted rubber stamp set. The images produced are crisp; even beginner stampers won't have an issue working with these charmers as the image is always consistent (without having to hold your your tongue just right). I really like that the newspaper stamp has a very old fashioned look but isn't overtly ""scrapbook vintage"" a la the more mass produced Tim Holtz stuff. (I love his stuff, just saying this isn't a set you'll see frequently duplicated or on every craft store shelf). The book stamp is technically big enough that if you had fine precision pens and were willing to write at a cool slant, you could title your mini tome. All in all, a good value and am pleased to add it to my growing collection.

"A great stamp to use for scrapbooking or penpalling or whatever paper craft project needs a melodic touch. I find stamps from this brand to be rather hit or miss, but this one is deeply etched and produces a fairly crisp image if you apply even pressure. This is a classic wood mounted rubber stamp --so you don't have to go searching for long acrylic block!As for the review that stated it was ""very small and ugly"", well, there's no accounting for taste so it may indeed be an unattractive option for some, but as a stamper with a fairly large collection, a 4 inch long stamp is definitely not considered undersized!  If anything, this is a touch too big for some of my card projects as it's so whoppin' long. But it was priced right and the scrolled curl makes it more visually appealing to me than just a flat bar.

"I love Deep Red stamps--rarely do I ever get a dud from this brand and this one is no exception. It's foam mounted and so of course you'll need a separate block to properly use it. (When I was new to the world of stamps the whole 'acrylic block' concept sounded so weird to me...but if you're new too, just search for a block of appropriate size and really, you'll figure it out very easily and never look back).This stamp produces an image just large enough to write a few words on; if you write with a fine tip pen you can customize your clapper--a great little touch for a movie night scrapbook page or for sharing your favorite films with a snail mail pal.Cut deeply, stamps cleanly, good crisp lines.

"I'm an active snail mailer and use these page protectors, in my compatible Avery binder, to store my dozens and dozens of postal stamps; trying to remember what denominations and designs I already had was becoming annoying, so his way I'm protecting the stamps and saving myself time.  Obviously a real philatelist wouldn't dream of using a system so crude, but for just a quick perusal, the page protectors turned out to be of much higher quality than I was anticipating (compared to the inelegant vinyl binder ordered at the same time). It's an absolute ideal system and the price, on my day of purchase, was rock bottom.The pages aren't too stiff or wrinkly and with 7 holes, it's likely they'll work with other brands' binders beyond Avery. They're perfectly clear, they're nicely thick but allow for easy page turning, and I've yet to experience any rips or tears. They don't curl on the ends either. Understand the size Imitations and just exactly what fits, and I don't think you'll be too disappointed.Leaving poor reviews for these pages protectors (which include accurately stated dimensions) just because they don't happen to properly fit your intended use ...is kinda unfair. I just love these things and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. They fit several sheets of paper, but for my purposes, I was more ticked to discover that very thin sheets don't fall out if the binder is turned upside down.

Obviously a real philatelist wouldn't dream of using a system so crude, but for just a quick perusal, this binder is absolute ideal and the price was rock bottom.Because I rarely remove pages from this binder, the fact that the rings are stiff and quite dangerously stubborn and sharp, doesn't affect me. But if you're going to be frequently inserting or removing pages, definitely spend the extra few bucks and get the 'touch' version or the more forgiving D-rings. Eeegads. How did I not lose a hand back as a second grader?I really appreciate this binder has a preview window (which was not reflected in the description) and has both a front and rear pocket; this is useful for storing slightly larger sized sheets of paper or in my case, stamp sheets that are just a hair too wide for the page protectors.The plastic is the cheap splinter-y vinyl I knew it would be. So be prepared for some peeling and discoloration if you order in white. This not archival quality, folks. But I also paid next to nothing so my expectations were low. At just one inch, you'd be surprised how much you can fit in this before it reaches capacity. Understand the limitations and what size of paper this system takes, and you won't be too disappointed. Don't let old school office/school supplies flummox ya too much--this is a clunky organizational alternative in a digital age (and has received some needlessly critical reviews).

"I use these for my outgoing address labels for mail art swaps as they're the perfect size for smaller sized correspondence like postcards; the fairly matte finish takes ink and markers well; the rounded corners offer a less generic and utilitarian appearance.Avery makes a similar size that's removable, but I purchased these because the adhesive is mighty. Can you remove them if you just lightly apply them to non paper surfaces? Technically, yes, but it's not their prime function nor would I recommend it.Avery's full sized sheets of this label size, for inkjet printers are, in my experience, usually more trouble than they're worth because the templates are a PITA and rarely as 'universal' as claimed. Unless you need a massive amount of identical labels, these are a more than adequate alternative and adhere far more securely than the adhesive offered on the full sheets.Of course you can also trim these and create smaller labels for little detailed labeling projects. A solid value. There's 4 labels per sheet, 32 sheets, totaling 128 labels. The math works!My local big box office supply store had a very limited number of options in small labels and what they did offer was only sold in bulk. As most individuals don't need a case of these, Amazon to the rescue.

Let me share why the chisel tip offered here is my MOST favorite of the product line:I adore the versatility of this tip because you can use it while working on just about ANY surface. I frequently do projects just sitting cross-legged in bed, using nothing more than a ratty old king sized pillow as my 'desk'. The other popular tip from Zig, the fine ballpoint squeeze tip, works beautifully for precision jobs but requires a hard surface to press against in order to achieve a consistent flow. Zig's jumbo tip, while superb for larger scale projects or for young hands, is simply too broad for detail work. I love that this tip type and size allows me to work on-the-fly and provides reliability no matter what surface or work condition.For those unfamiliar with the Zig glue system, the pen-style grip is super easy-to-use and offers two bond types: blue (wet) is for a more secure and permanent bond, while applying it when it's white (letting it sit for a few moments before adhering) makes for a more flexible, removable adhesive. Really, it's amazing stuff that doesn't curl thin paper, discolor your project, or suddenly release unpredictable blobs of glue!Old school glue sticks just are too gooey and unforgiving, rubber cement can be a total nightmare, and some glues targeted at scrapbookers I find are either too gentle for permanent bonding or they are too wet to easily work with. But of course even a great product like this has a few pitfalls and the uninitiated should know:Apply swiftly: The glue goes from blue to white in a matter of seconds so if you want a permanent bond, get to it.Work cleanly: If you have ink or paint stained hands and over apply this so that it seeps around the sides of whatever your gluing, this will gum up rather easily and potentially stain your work if your attempt to 'roll' the excess away with your fingers.Use judiciously: It doesn't take much, folks. While it does dry clear, a little goes a long way so don't be tempted to over apply it; exercise patience if you need to remove excess; depending on your material, I've used rubbing alcohol to clean up any excess residue.Go gently: Don't vigorously rub this over your intended target; the tip isn't impervious to damage so it will stain the tip if you use it over dark inks and it can get a little 'chewed up' and raggedy if you go totally bonkers on unorthodox materials and surfaces.Craft patiently: If a permanent bond is what your after, let it dry and more importantly, let it 'set' before immediately applying other techniques or placing your project near other items that might accidentally stick to it and damage your work. Conversely, if you're after a very light bond with plans to peel something off, work in segments after ensuring your glue is good and white.It's a little overpriced for a single stick here on Amazon but the bulk price is amazing. A tube lasts a long time but since this stuff doesn't dry out quickly, consider buying a larger lot-- I suspect you'll be as big a fan as I've become.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYM0V99I7YN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ODUPNY#wasThisHelpful","RHYM0V99I7YN1","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an active penpaller and mail artist swapper and so I go through paper supplies like crazy! There was little feedback for these at the time of my purchase, so I wasn't sure what I'd get--plus I was unfamiliar with this brand. Having just left poor feedback for another set of envelopes, I'm all too aware of how much can actually go wrong with a item as deceptively basic as a simple envelope. But these are stellar!The boring but vital stats: These are classic #10 sized 'business' envelopes in ""Kraft"". Though the description says they're 70lb, nothing on the packaging confirms that and I highly doubt they're that thick because your average scrapbook-quality card stock is about 65lbs--and these are way more flexible than that. However, they aren't too flimsy and I can pack in several sheets of paper and a few pieces of ephemera or a small photo or two without worry. I ordered a 100 pack, I received 100 (I counted). They're all evenly cut, no weird inconsistencies in size, color, or texture. They don't stink of cheap glue (these aren't self adhesive). However, the glue doesn't quite span the entire length of the envelope so you may need little pieces of tape to secure the ends--be aware of that. It's a small gripe but must be mentioned. I also don't suspect these are inkjet printer compatible. Ok, now the fun part.......I have no idea how the average person plans to use these, but I discovered these are AMAZING for those of us who like to do fancy address lettering; they take a pencil, but more importantly, an eraser sooooo well! So forgiving. I go over my pencil work with a Posca metallic pen and outline/highlight with a Gellyroll or Spica Glass--and it looks seriously incredible. The paper is a tad more pulpy than a standard smooth white envelope; it can't take all tip types (some fountain pens may struggle) as if it gets too wet the paper may ball a little and no one likes to drag their nib, but there's no significant bleed through and this accepts virtually all art pens I've tried. I adore how my guide lines just vanish COMPLETELY, without at all compromising the finish of the paper, when I erase them. No more freehand for me!The definition and texture of ""Kraft"" paper wildly varies so this is my best description::Some cheapy Kraft paper is really flat and basically just like dyed brown standard printer paper--this isn't. Some Kraft paper is more like disposable 'butcher block' paper and has a kind of slickness or blotchiness I can't work with--this isn't. Then finally, some Kraft papers are thick with fibers and 'hairs' and are uneven and rough in texture--this isn't. So I love how ideal these envelopes are for art work. The shade is just a touch lighter than most grocery store sacks.I'll be ordering more and pursuing other paper products from this brand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTP05CBHY507/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDMV7PI#wasThisHelpful","R1KTP05CBHY507","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm an active snail mailer and go through envelopes very quickly; I'm always on the lookout for affordable, but high quality options. I find that 6x9 envelopes--which can be mailed at USPS first class 'letter' postage rates as 6-1/8"" is the maximum height for mail qualifying as a 'letter'--are ideal for mail art swaps, any correspondence that requires a little more room, and 5x7 photos. The value here for 50 booklet envelopes, on the day of my purchase, was fairly reasonable...yet I have two small, but not insignificant gripes:The 24lb paper, while nicely bright white, is VERY easy to see through. Based on little feedback reporting this issue, I almost wonder if there's been a change in manufacturing? I certainly don't require lined 'security' envelopes for my correspondence, but I can clearly make out any contents or read any text placed inside these envelopes--even in dim lighting conditions. No bueno. As the package flaunts these are ""for all your check and business needs"", I would expect a little more. Just way too thin. I have white 24lb printer paper that doesn't suffer from this problem so I except the same from my envelopes.Secondly, the glue strip for sealing (these aren't self adhesive) is not remotely even-- it doesn't span the entire length of the envelope so it requires a little piece of tape on both sides should you desire an actual secure seal; on one side, the glue stops short about an inch from the end, and on the other end, it's about a fourth of an inch short. No biggie to some folks, and I suppose this flimsy seal might make it a breeze for my recipients to open, but I have oodles of envelopes that manage to extend the seal the entire length.I reserve these for lightweight, infrequent use as the quality is suspect. And that's a bummer. Yes, I'm picky. But paper companies don't exactly need to reinvent the wheel to produce a consistent product that I'd be happy to buy time and time again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMB9TJPIIX63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O14OD2M#wasThisHelpful","R3TMB9TJPIIX63","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a total Instax mini junkie so I own (and review) a lot of photo albums. When I initially purchased this, there were zero reviews so I wasn't sure what I'd end up with. For those less interested in reading the gritty details, here's my quick takeaway now that it's in use: it's really lovely, I'd purchase again, and despite some gripes, the album is a superb value.THE SPECS:By Deahun (arrives in open-ended plastic packaging/no tags)External Measurements: approx 7-3/4""H x 6-3/4""W x 1-1/4"" DHolds 120 pics/40 pages/3 pics (w/ adjacent blank ruled lines) per pageDoes NOT accommodate Instax Wide/classic Polaroids--APPEARANCE: 5 starsThe leatherette is VERY well done, feels great to the touch--especially compared to similarly priced, cheap vinyl/plastic-y albumsOffered in several beautiful shades from pastels to deeper hues it's the best album I own in terms of overall display...it doesn't feel disposableThe separately affixed brass-colored corners on the album's cover offer a more serious, grown up look--compared to the slew of cutesy, tween-targeted albums on the marketSome people may use this for Polaroid Mio shots, but the majority of folks are using mini Fuji Instax--so the album's embossed ""Album de Polaroid"" (and the inclusion of ""business cards"" and ""memo"" featured on the cover) is a small gripe and reveals this isn't aimed for U.S. consumers--STORAGE/FUNCTION: 5 starsDesigned to generously expand--a fully loaded album isn't too ""fat"" and holds its shapeThe book-like design makes this stiff enough to store in a bookshelf or stand upright under its own weightAwesome scrapbook-inspired spiral binding (no cheap-o sewn or glued in main seam) means flipping through the pages is easy and satisfying and, best yet, the album doesn't flop open right to the middle--the typical default position in lesser quality albums--INTERIOR: 3 starsThe ""DYI"" in the description refers to a tiny field of 5 blank-ruled lines that are adjacent (on the left) of each photo sleeve (3 sleeves/fields per page)I like that I can make a note per photo (rather than using a sticker or pen directly on the photo) but the paper is slick so you need to chose your ink wiselyThe plastic sheets are one solid page--meaning individual photo sleeves, per page, are separated by 4 sealed dash-shaped impressions to create the slots; the dashes each measure about a half inch longThe translucent sleeves are a little more prone to wrinkling (see above) than some of my other Instax albums; there's an allowance for easy in/out but to preserve the integrity of the thin sleeve, tread gentlyPhotos fit snugly and securely and no part of the photo will stick out the side of the sleeveThe album's native orientation for landscape shots makes this less ideal for people (like me) who prefer portrait shotsThe paper, under the sleeves, features a very busy chevron pattern that I find quite distracting: a mini Instax photo will not fully cover over this patternBOTTOM LINE: For the price I paid, I am very satisfied and will buy again. The more casual instant photo fan, who hasn't experimented with different album types, should also find this a great option. Lose the chevron print and up the quality of the sleeves and it's a 5 star offering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VDFCUUNZTQH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMPYX6W#wasThisHelpful","R1VDFCUUNZTQH2","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite acknowledging that Moleskine makes quality products that inspire intense brand loyalty, I've never hopped on the bandwagon; as a notebook enthusiast, I find most Moleskine items a tad overpriced. But when I spied this case on one of my favorite pen & paper websites, I was intrigued. I love all things 'mini' and am an organization junkie to boot. Amazon's price couldn't be beat so I took the plunge.First things first, when Moleskine calls this ""XS"" they really and truly mean EXTRA SMALL. Similar versions of this case are available in larger sizes so definitely peruse those if you need room for oodles of stuff or for an e-reader, camera, smart phone, etcetera. Double-check the external dimensions as Amazon has them listed under ""Product Description"" at mid page. My tape measure clocks them at approx 3.5"" W x 5"" H x 2"" D. Deduct a bit for actual internal storage. Yep: Teeny!The possibilities with this case are endless if you carry a lot of tiny items (or just want to protect one or two important things). I ultimately purchased this to store travel-ready mini craft items I use for Fuji instant photography: business card-size blank card stock, mini scissors, mini pen, used film, sticker sheets, washi tape (flat pack), and a few other odds and ends. Yes, a person could use a little zippered pouch or pocket that would serve a similar purpose, but this product allows more for security, basic organization, and mobility.The back of the case has an adjustable attachment feature that allows you to affix the case to a strap--in my case, the handle of my camera bag. It takes up so little room and I appreciate that the adjustable design enables it to be tightened to a flat strap OR rounded handle--it does slide around a bit tho on my slick nylon handle. But the Velcro, a material I'm usually loathe to compliment, is impressively rugged and secure.Inside the shell there's a black terry cloth material with a netted pocket on the bottom of one side and a loop (ostensibly for a key ring) atop the opposite side. The internal features are not configurable/able to be unattached.The shell itself feels great to the touch; it's a nice low profile matte finish. The dual rubber zippers run smoothly. The stitching is well done, and the entire piece is very durable. I cannot speak for shock absorbency but *I'd* trust this with a pricey MP3 player or the like. Perfect for earbuds too.Absolutely love this to pieces and recommend it to anyone who wants to wrangle their bobby pins or hair ties or tweezers or flash drive or gate keys. Understand its limitations re: the size, and you'll never be reaching into your purse or briefcase trying to find that impossibly small item again. Travel convenient and then some. Moleskine hasn't converted me to their notebooks, but I'll definitely consider checking out more of their cases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQTUHTEKP36F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8866138096#wasThisHelpful","RAQTUHTEKP36F","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though in my heart I may still swoon for Hello Kitty, the reality is I'm a 40-yr old looking for a sensible, but attractive travel bag for my Instax Neo Classic 90--you know, the instant camera Fuji designed for the grown-ups too. I'd been using one of those ubiquitous after market black hamburger-style cases but I hated the way it looked and functioned. My search for a more appealing and practical carrying case only offered up a dozen highly questionable options, all of them lacking in some frustrating way. The market here doesn't support many Instax accessories so it's slim pickings.Then I stumbled onto this. Prior to ordering, it seemed to fit my specific criteria:-Not pink or pastel or branded in some giddy print-Not vinyl or PU 'leather'-Room for at least one extra film-An external slip pocket-A little bit of cushion/protection in case of dropping-Adaptable to a variety of travel conditions; Vespa-friendly-Comfortable to carry for long outings-Not so bulky that it can't be easily stashed in a larger bag if necessary-Ability to be easily wiped clean due to my dusty, pet-filled home-Proper fit and balance/ease of taking camera in & out quicklyDid it end up delivering? Bottom line, YES! Or read on...BRAND:Sktr bags are a division of a company called Itoya. I did a quick search prior to purchase because I'd never heard of them; discovered stellar reviews for the bags they're apparently known for: portable artist's cases & portfolios.AVAILABILITY:Quite limited; currently not Prime-able; few sellers; low stock on some colors. I ended up NOT purchasing through Amazon due to the inability to verify stock for 3rd party sellers. I purchased at an online camera outlet. I typically don't write reviews here for non-Amazon purchases, but because thorough feedback for this bag is nearly non existent, if you're loathe to purchase in the dark, I hope this helps. IMO this bag is worth the hunt.PACKING/WHAT'S IN THE BOX:My bag arrived with just a hang tag, in a plastic wrap.BUILD QUALITY/MATERIAL:The nylon 'puffy jacket' material is very cool and is of decent quality; thick internal seaming; the stitching at some external seams does pucker a bit but is secure. The dual rubber zippers are substantial and run smoothly but don't quite ""seal"" the bag quite as tightly as I'd like--when zipping shut, there's a mm or two of a gap.WEIGHT/COMFORT:Super duper lightweight. Adds very little weight to a fairly substantial camera. I can carry this over my shoulder for hours or toss into my handbag.FIT:The fit for my Neo Classic 90, though not truly custom, is roomy; the camera fits in the upper compartment at both the portrait & landscape position WITH room for the charger too. It's not as snug as I'd envisioned, the camera moves around a bit. (Beyond the Fuji Mini 8 and 90, I cannot vouch how this would fit older model Instax or Polaroids. I only suspect this would not work for that new Lomo'Instant OR the Fuji wide 210.)STRAP/LATCHES:The somewhat flimsy adjustable and removable strap is nothing too impressive, but isn't stiff; It will accommodate cross body/shoulder wear for both tall & short folks. The latches are sewn onto the strap securely but are a tad undersized and dinky, some paint chipping has occurred on the black finish.ADDITIONAL SPACE:I can easily fit TWO spare film cartridges and 1 mini card case style album in the bottom zippered compartment--which is separate from the main body of the case; I use the external slip pocket for a variety of little things: small sleeve of stickers, a pen, and some card stock for writing down what settings I used to achieve a shot. Could I technically jam in even more? Yes, but it's not designed to hold the kitchen sink and will sag a bit if overstuffed.ZIP IN & OUT/BALANCE:I can quickly grab my camera without having the balance and topple issues of my stiffer, zippered wrap-around shell case. The 'purse style' is very convenient for grabbing on the go because the perfect shot waits for no man.APPEARANCE:Offered in black, white, and silver. I ordered in silver, which is kinda a fun space age look for an delightfully analog device. Hubby isn't embarrassed to carry it, 'nuff said.PROTECTION:The case provides adequate cushion for the common tumble but I've yet to experience a severe drop. It's not as shock absorbent as a harder shell case. This is the ideal travel bag but probably not designed for hard core protection.SPECS:Overall external dimension is approx 6-1/2"" W x 7"" H x 4"" D.VALUE:Considering all the 'toy' cases floating around at the same price point, this bag is a solid bargain at list price.I love the whimsy that instant photography offers. But at 70 cents a pop for a single shot, most people who stick with Instax for the long haul are invested in the medium as more than a passing fad or nostalgic chuckle......so that's why I believe a fun camera still deserves a serious bag. I'm grateful to have found this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NYQONS9TN9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OS261M2#wasThisHelpful","R37NYQONS9TN9A","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In order to satisfy a free shipping minimum, I picked up 2 of these, in white & green, when ordering a camera bag from this same brand, Sktr. (I didn't purchase from Amazon as it was one of the rare instances that I found a better price elsewhere; these also aren't currently Prime eligible).Offered in two sizes, I opted for the Small which only holds 20 mini Fuji Instax shots--21 if you count the cover preview window. I have several Instax albums that hold 100+ pics, which are ultimately more practical for storage purposes, but I like that I can utilize this album's modest capacity to curate photos of a single theme or occasion.Additionally, the convenient size makes these ideal for travel or stashing in your camera bag; they're exceptionally lightweight. The bad news is the album is not nearly substantial enough to merit the price.The hard cover linen fabric sets this album apart from all the flexible pleather and vinyl albums out there. Tho I doubt I'd repurchase one of these, some consumers might appreciate a few more color options in darker, richer tones.The internal sleeves are low glare polypropylene, of decent thickness. A lot of other ""Instax"" albums were actually made as business card holders (since Fuji Instax shares very similar dimensions) but this album appears to be designed specifically for Instax film. Your entire picture is covered by the sleeve; no part of it will hang out the sides. Which may be a good feature for some--but does make grabbing/rearranging your pics a bit more challenging. So far I've not had any sleeve tears or rips.I happen to take far more portrait pics than landscape, so the native orientation of this book is fine for me. (I'm still waiting for a quality Instax album that offers sleeves, on the same page, for both display orientations.)Due to the storage limitations, this album is a cinch to quickly fill up. I think young photographers (or anyone who realizes how pricey the film is) would still feel quite accomplished to complete this album and offer it as a gift w/ a personal touch. It would also work OK for folks who may not take as many pics as I tend to.Unfortunately, the flimsy construction and that slightly disposable ""Made in China"" quality reduce this to more of a party favor than a must-have item for Instax junkies. Another gripe: the internal binding--it always opens to the middle. I know that's the default position for albums of this ilk but it's a gripe nevertheless. I hate looking at the cheap plastic seam.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVD9RCJHOJOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSA6GMO#wasThisHelpful","R3FVD9RCJHOJOK","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently purchased and reviewed Volcom's ""Lolita"" bag--another affordable fabric carry-all featuring the same casual west coast vibe. That bag had everything I wanted in a slouchy piece except for interior organization. So on to the Epic Stranger.I ordered in Astral Aura; the colors are muted blues & purples and true to Amazon's online images. It's 100% cotton and sorta kinda soft...but not nearly as soft as I was hoping. The colors look like a hippie beach towel but the bag doesn't feel plush like one. And unfortunately the burlap-y weave easily snags, ditto for the rope cinchers. (I won't remove a star for how hideously wrinkled my bag arrived--that's an Amazon issue. But the DEEP creases from packing make this economical bag look, well, cheap; they still haven't relaxed even 2 weeks later. So be aware.)The bag is about the size I typically prefer to carry and is true to Amazon's dimensions. I'm not too petite so it doesn't overwhelm me, but some may find it too bulky for everyday use. The cinch top gives the illusion of more structure; however, the bag is overall really slouchy and is a true north/south style. So the 2 interior slip pockets are needed. The lack of a zippered pocket is a slight annoyance but I knew it didn't have one prior to ordering so I can't fault the bag.The double closure may annoy some, it does me. I'm OK with the drawstring but it feels bulky when fully cinched. And you have to kinda fiddle with the over flap to keep the bag looking finished and ""shut"". (Obviously this style of bag won't keep your purse contents very secure as it's lacking a zipper.) But this incredibly thin, far too narrow piece of fabric Roxy decided to use for the flap is not doing the bag any favors. If you opt to keep the bag uncinched, the flap just hangs there looking sloppy. And I really dislike the super frayed edges on the end of the rope. Looked cute online but not so in person.I picked this up on a deep sale and with an additional holiday promotion. If I'd paid full retail it would have been promptly returned. It's just 'meh' at the end of the day. It'll look decently cute with sandals and a sundress but IMO it's limited to a street fair or trip to the pool. The fabric and cheap-o closure flap just let me down and is, for this already super casual girl, still a touch too casual for a practical every day bag. Think: tween headed to the pool or skatepark. And even for that demographic, the quality doesn't justify the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVJFF0O5R52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4N3BAC#wasThisHelpful","R1PVJFF0O5R52","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a total Instax junkie and these particular albums are my very favorite to store/browse my MINI instax photos. (This won't work for classic wide instant film.) I'm on my second one, with another coming soon. It's already been pointed out that these really weren't designed as photo albums but rather for business cards. Regardless, these still more than do the trick!This one is a muted cream, not ""white"". The inside pages are a dark shocking pink--not my favorite color but it does highlight pics really well. This album style is offered in a variety of colors but the color of the cover rarely matches the inside pages...so you'll have to pick a combo that suits you best. The pleather is surprisingly soft and not too vinyl-like, and, because it's synthetic, is sturdy and easy to clean.In cheap photo albums it's actually the binding and spine I worry about more than the outside cover because sometimes the spine or the plastic internal binding is too flimsy, or conversely too stiff--making turning pages really annoying. I want a satisfying, smooth and quick flipping through the pages feel without worrying the whole thing will come apart at the seam or get stuck or hung up after repeated use. This delivers the ease I like.Additionally, the inside sheets and slots in other albums are prone to rip and be brittle or too 'sticky'. Out of 120 slots in this one, I've only had tears on a couple--and that was due more to my carelessness. The slots fit Instax minis perfectly, not too loose nor too snug. Yes, the very end of the pic will stick out about a 1/4 of an inch but personally I prefer this as it makes grabbing them and rearranging them a breeze. Also, if I'm feeling girly or channelling my inner 6-year old, I may decorate some photos; the slots aren't so snug that they won't accommodate a sticker or embellishment or two and the full page doesn't get too weighed down if sliding anything else behind the pics.***If you're a stickler about such things, do note the design of this album means landscape Instax are the native display. I file all my portrait shots at the back of the album and work my way front, thus kinda creating two albums in one and eliminating the need to constantly rotate.Once totally full, the album still closes easily; the simple closure is more than adequate and the album doesn't get so ""fat"" that it looks weird. Bottom line is these hold up well, fit the pics, is easy to stash in my camera bag but attractive enough to display, and won't break the bank.***For 90 Neo Classic users, here's a little trick I use: because of the extra bells and whistles on this model and because the film ain't cheap, I slide a mini index card behind each photo in this album showing the settings I used/time of day/lighting conditions. This has saved me a few bucks because macro, double imposed, etc., can be surprisingly tricky so it's nice to reference past settings on successful pics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPRLIBFEJTWK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GYICAC#wasThisHelpful","R1JPRLIBFEJTWK","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty cute fingerless hand warmers with just the right amount of sparkle--any more flashy and they might read a little cheap. But the quality is decent, they're sewn well, they're not too scratchy, and they're priced right for what you're getting. Sometimes when little bits are sewn on to knit, you end up with some dangling rhinestones or an unfinished look, but I was impressed by the quality application of the bling. There was just a hint of unraveling at a finger hole or two but nothing that compromised their use.I think there may be a mix up from the warehouse regarding the color. I ordered in charcoal gray but received the midnight blue though it was marked as gray on the external packaging. No biggie, and didn't wanna mess with the return, but if you're a stickler, be warned you may end up with midnight blue if you order gray and vice versa. The midnight blue is actually a very lovely shade and if you don't pair it with actual gray, in low light it reads gray anyway. The midnight blue ended up looking adorable with jeans.The fit is on the small side, something you might pick up in the juniors department. I appreciate the more snug fit as pieces like this tend to easily stretch out from frequent on/off. If you're more sturdy boned, these should still accommodate you but I would first recommend them for more petite frames or even older little girls. My mom is a teeny 5 foot lady, weighs right at 100 lbs and these were still snug on her bony frame.Also, the pair I received was not quite as long as what appears in the online images; they extend well above the wrist but not as far up the arm as on the mannequin.Cute, affordable, and if you don't mind chilly fingers, still way more convenient than most ""texting"" gloves--those never seem to consistently work.

"I recently wrote a lengthy review for the unscented/unflavored 3-pack version of this formula which is my favorite of the Out of Africa lip balms and rescued my lips last winter...making me a die hard fan. The unscented version is more earthy and slightly more difficult to apply if it gets too cold, but at the end of the day I still prefer not to actually taste my lip balm.However, when the unscented formula was unavailable for some time on Amazon, I determined orange cream sounded the most palatable from the remaining options. It contains generous amount of Shea butter (30% for this formula) and, though it indeed tastes just like an orange cream popsicle, the flavor is mild enough to not overwhelm.  Here are the ingredients directly copied from the OOA website:""Ingredients: Pure Unrefined Shea Butter, Sunflower Oil, Candelilla Wax, Grapeseed Oil, Orange Cream Flavor, Cocoa Butter,  Vitamin E, Rosemary Extract, Calendula. No Parabens, Sulfates, Petrolatums or Phthalates. Cruelty Free & Eco-Friendly""It's difficult to find a good lip balm that doesn't contain petroleum, mineral oil, or lanolin. This made in the USA formula doesn't trigger any reactions in my very allergy-prone skin.The application is fairly smooth, my tubes don't have any chunks or too much earthy bits--a common complaint in products that contain a lot of unrefined shea. If you're accustomed to using Vaseline-like lip treatments, you may find it ""pulls"" a little. It's not thick or greasy tho still too emollient to use right before lipstick. It's colorless but does dull the color of your lips a bit until it absorbs... and also doesn't provide a sheen like some higher end lip treatments, but as I'm after long-lasting true moisture, these are not negatives for me. A few swipes to warm it up is all the application requires; it will sit on the lips for a few minutes until it sinks in. And when it does, it's a true salvation to parched lips.One tube lasts a long time even with daily application. However, because it is so effective, I don't need to reapply several times during the day. I'm down to just overnight application for the summer months. The price is right too.One note: some of these Out of Africa balms are sold as ""3-packs"" while others are ""3-counts"". If you order a 3-count you will receive 3 loose tubes. There's no manufacturer packaging at all. No biggie but it did surprise me when 3 tubes just fell right out of the packing envelope. Each tube is individually sealed with a little paper adhesive but not shrink wrapped or with retail packaging. Great for the environment but not so appealing to the germphobe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLW3Y2KMAZQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IK8QKS#wasThisHelpful","RWLW3Y2KMAZQ2","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find this to be a fantastic value. I originally purchased this model 4 1/2  years back based solely on price and its size. Threw it into my Amazon cart without reading, at the time, the few available reviews. I just needed a cheap clock for my mom's patio, wasn't picky. Even though this is not designed for outdoor use, we hung it up in her partially covered patio. It kept perfect time, required only a couple of battery changes, and was still going strong through 4 brutal Dallas summers and several freezes until a gust finally sent it shattering. (It had actually fallen several times prior and never actually broke...this thing is the Energizer Bunny of cheap wall clocks!) I ended up buying the exact replacement, thanks to looking it up in my Amazon order history. The new one is just as solid and I anticipate an equally lengthy life.Because it's outdoors, we don't notice any loud ticking but I'd happily chose this model for indoors if the need ever arises. The style fits most decor, the hands and numbers are super easy to read from several yards away, and we're just so impressed by its hardiness and accuracy. I've paid much more for supposedly higher quality clocks that turned out to be duds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AE2LTYDHO2ZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EN7NH0#wasThisHelpful","R2AE2LTYDHO2ZK","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to metal sensitives, I'm just trusting the claim that these are 14k and truly nickel-free. I ordered in white gold but because of the miniaturized size--making reading a stamp, if there is one, virtually impossible--and with zero documentation in or on the gift box or internal packaging, your guess is as good as mine. Typically manufacturers include a sticker or more clearly label genuine 14K gold products to justify a price point. These are supposed to be 58.5% pure gold and ""hypoallergenic"" but that term is flung around as lightly as supermarkets claim their veggies are ""organic"". Not too worried about it. But it's important to note--especially if giving these as a gift or have an allergy severe enough you need to more definitively ensure the authenticity. What metals comprise the remaining percentage tends to vary by maker. I'd feel better calling these nickel-safe than nickel-free.I got these for a second ear piercing; it's recommended to wear earrings 24/7 the first year. But I'm a side sleeper so that makes most studs uncomfortable for overnight.Based on reading all the reviews I was expecting the itty bitty size--in fact that's solely why I purchased--but obviously these function for me as a cuff rather than a hoop. I have exceptionally average sized ears and yes, while these are indeed dinky tiny, I was still a little surprised that so many people reported these too small for infants. Because technically I think I could get them in my regular ear piercing.  So mileage varies. Be aware of the dimensions and I don't think you'll be disappointed.The on/off is easy peasy and I'm usually all thumbs in that department. However, if you happened to receive a pair that didn't 'click' closed, as they're intended to, these would need to be promptly returned--they could slip off far too easily.  But my pair is made well and comfy and the closing mechanism is solid. Wish I had more certainty regarding the metal content but only time will tell. I like them well enough to consider purchasing in the yellow gold as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1IGGRHHQZGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1S20SE#wasThisHelpful","R3G1IGGRHHQZGY","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit of a sucker for a supple, high quality leather handbag. But as summer is upon us, I decided I'd look for a fun, more affordable fabric bag that could handle trips to the lake and being flung around in the Jeep floorboard.Firstly, based on the online images, I was expecting this bag to be absolutely gigantic--on the model the proportions look nearly comical. I'm not exactly petite but I did wonder if this thing would dwarf me. However, in person, while definitely on the large side, this isn't some crazy weekend trip/diaper bag. The actual dimensions are true to Amazon's listing but the imposed photography on the model is, IMO, way off. Think big. But not kitchen sink big. Could function as an overnight bag, depending on how one packs for an overnight but there's no way I could pack 2-3 days in this. More of a single towel and swimsuit. Bottom line, size wise, *I* actually found this to be a smidge smaller than I was hoping.I ordered in zebra. When the Lolita arrived I found the print very cute (the white bits aren't glaringly bright white, more of a eggshell white) and the bag very soft but...very, very thin. At this price point that's OK but it could easily rip if you're rough on your bags. Zipper pull works nicely, better than some of my bags that cost 5x more. The dual handles are comfy but too short to crossbody. It's fully lined, that's a nice bonus but......I'm withholding a star due to 0 interior organization. Not a slip pocket, a zippered pouch, nada. Even if your intention isn't to use this as a true everyday purse, most girls need a single pocket to stash a phone, a lipstick, anything you don't want to be fishing around for. I love a sloppy, unstructured hobo bag and that's exactly what I got. A bag, not a purse. It's cute but limited in function. But at Amazon's sale price w/current holiday promotion, it's still a recommend.FROM THE LABEL: 100% rayon; Made in India; wipe with a damp cloth if needed","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XSLFC1DKNCJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWDJJHQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XSLFC1DKNCJS","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not an audiophile nor remotely close to an expert on earphones and their accessories. But I am a wife of a guy who loses earbud covers like there's no tomorrow. So the quantity over quality vs price is why I gleefully added these to my Cart. But then when these turned out to be a far higher quality than we were expecting, um, SCORE!Hubby routinely falls asleep wearing his earbuds. He's kinda a violent sleeper so these doodads tend to go missing in the night. He needs a foam cover that not only fits properly but that is comfy; these do the trick. His Sony buds are 14mm. These covers are likely intended for the old school Apple buds--measuring a few mm larger than his Sonys--and while the fit is just ever so slightly loose, these absolutely work. I wouldn't recommend these for earbuds measuring much over 18mm or so....though as I mentioned, I'm no expert.Our local Radio Shack wanted $11 for 2 pair of these--arguably, they were of slightly higher quality, but as this is the sort of item that even reasonably responsible people can easily lose or rip, having an entire bag of these things has proven so helpful. These covers don't muffle the audio, stay put, are comfy, and best yet, you don't have to remortgage the house when your kid steals a couple for miniature dollhouse chair cushions. A solid recommend! Will promptly order more because this 24 pack is about a 6 month supply for us. Who sleeps with earbuds on?!  I'm certain there's a little foam graveyard behind our headboard and Lord knows how many get caught up in pillowcases and put through the washing machine.

"The Aranha ""Hits ll"" is the most current version of this shoe, but this review is for the original. Purchased in the solid black, I received a shiny plastic sandal with glittery bits adorning the upper. The shoe is represented well in Amazon's online images, tho they're more glossy in person.I was anticipating the sandals might have strong chemical odor--like PVC rain boots--but instead, I was greeted by an overwhelming flowery perfume. Not sure if that's just the particular pair I received, but it's really, really strong. My husband tells me that a certain ""sweet"" smell is associated with some plasticizers. If this it that, YUCK. My pair still isn't fully aired out AND is still so strong that the odor transfers to my feet. Gotta say, I'm not a fan of a plastic scent so strong that it transfers to my actual skin.The fit is TTS in terms of length. I'm a 8.5 in most shoes but ordered the 9 to ensure my piggies had plenty of room. Width is on the narrow side. I wouldn't recommend for a really wide foot tho the plastic certainly has some give. The only part of the sandal I found a tad stiff was the tip of the closed toe, not terribly comfortable. The sole, however, is flexible to the point it goes convex. They'll need some wearing in to eventually conform and ""memorize"" your foot. The outsole has some basic ribbing, not rugged outdoor gripping, but slippery pavement shouldn't take you out. Of course there's 0 arch support but anyone eyeing the Aranha is probably not planning to walk for miles in these.I have a very, very low instep and bony ankles, so I'm able to fasten these and slip them on and off without messing with the buckle each time. The buckle is a highly shiny, glinty gold which is isn't my favorite finish, but I suppose it ""dresses"" up the plastic. Several of the holes on the strap were not punched through all the way--something I typically associate with lower quality brands. But once you've worked the notches through, there's about 2-1/2 inches of play in the strap that should accommodate higher insteps or wider ankles. Nicely adjustable.The overall look was a bit more juvenile than I was excepting--not necessarily a bad thing--but I wasn't surprised when I discovered Melissa makes a popular baby/kid line of these exact sandals. Since they're forgiving for Spring puddles, slightly more chic for the beach than most flip flops or Crocs, and are travel friendly, they are a more practical addition to my closet than a fashionable one. They're decently comfy but I should have realized, based on my wardrobe, they aren't the every day sandal I'd convinced myself they'd be. There's matte finishes offered as well, and I suspect those may be more versatile.Even at Amazon's sale price, these sandals may strike most as overpriced for what they are--a 100% synthetic shoe--not unlike those jellies we paid $5 for in the '80s. This version has the VW logo attached onto the t-strap and this is what you're paying for. The quality is moderately good but in a jelly shoe it's a stretch to say your feet know it's ""designer"". If you want a vegan sandal to hit the boardwalk or feel suffocated by the average galoshes, I recommend. But as a tee and jeans girl in the city, these don't skew as the casual rubber sandal I'd hoped for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R66B4C5U2DYRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMA8BYU#wasThisHelpful","R66B4C5U2DYRY","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Absolutely adorable. I ordered in Ivory for my mom. I'd admired this little cap since I first spied it on the BCBG site but didn't want to cough up the full price. But Amazon has it marked down so I pounced.It's really great quality, sewn well, and the little sparkly touches on the owl's ears and nose add a nice touch. I guess with the added bling this is as 'sophisticated' as an over-the-ear hat shaped like an owl can get. ;-)The fit on my mom (she's a 7-1/4"" hat size) was snug, as these sort of caps should be. The piece is surprisingly heavy but she wore it comfortably. The goal to keep her ears warm was achieved. In style. Much better than bulky ear muffs. The knit is soft but stiff enough to hold its shape. Meaning it won't flop down or lose its shape. No flaccid owl ears here.Every time she wore it out in the recent bitter NYC winter, she was repeatedly complimented. When grumps on the E train are loving it, you know it's a winner. It's just that undeniably cute. If you like cozy, whimsical pieces this is winner. But if you're tempted to purchase for a child, be sure to note this is indeed adult sized.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R135E8ZTO9ZW15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA3PTDE#wasThisHelpful","R135E8ZTO9ZW15","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on numerous reviews here (and elsewhere on the Web) claiming this shoe ran very small, I ordered up. Bad choice. Either Bed Stu is producing new stock with more accurate sizing, or I received a weird, accurately sized pair. I typically wear a 8.5-9 but ordered a 9.5 based on the Internet feedback yet the 9.5 was way too long. A 9 or even an 8.5 would have worked.  I also read the strap is so short some people couldn't even get it to buckle across their foot. I had the opposite issue--too long of a strap and if it stretched just a little I'd have to add an additional hole. Granted, I have low instep. But why would you order up if you have a wide foot/instep just to have a shoe too comically long in length? So I wouldn't advise ordering a full size up.As for the shoe itself, I was underwhelmed. I love beat up vintage leather (a la Freebirds, Kickers, or Frye) but the pair I received in ""Black Lux"" wasn't very weathered and looked exceptionally dull. Just like a regular old dark gray leather flat. One of the rare cases where a shoe is much cuter online than in person. Not to mention the outsole is ridiculously slippery and even on carpet it was like ice skating.Tho my biggest gripe was the stiffness. One of best things about a quality Mary Jane or ballet flat is how soft and pliable they become, virtually conforming to your unique foot. The Shuffle is is not the first pair from this brand that I've found stiff, tough and stubborn. I'm ok with that in a rugged boot but a non malleable Mary Jane is always uncomfortable and I found these rubbed badly against my heel and across the toe bed. Painful. They weren't gonna give no matter how long a break-in period. I love artisan shoe makers but this was a big miss for me. I expected sizing woes but just ended up with an uncomfortable, startlingly blah shoe.

"Ordered in the black. I'm a hat junkie and have had success with hats from this brand-- this piece is no exception.SHAPE/LOOK: In a plain black hat, I prefer a round crown as otherwise they tend to skew a bit witchy-poo. So this hat's shape works for me as does the moderately-sized brim (so it doesn't scream vapid starlet at Coachella.) The wireless brim is technically 'floppy' but is ultimately still structured. It's dynamic while remaining a little more low profile. I own one too many menswear-inspired fedoras so was after something more feminine. I love cloches, but they don't jibe with edgier looks. This is a versatile silhouette that can be dressed up or down and ticks all the right boxes as my go-to fall/winter topper.BAND: I wasn't thrilled to discover that the 1"" faux leather band is not one solid color all-around; this is not reflected in Amazon's images. In the front: black band. In the back: metallic silver. Not a huge fan of silver--though thankfully it's not too too shiny-- so I may attempt to remove/replace the band. (This is typically not difficult to do as long as you have the correct glue and use a replacement band that is not more narrow than the original.)FIT: As with many BCBGeneration hats, it's adjustable via a kind of pull and tighten string that's threaded into the sweat band. I have a big noggin for a chick (approx 7-1/12) and so this fits me without needing to utilize this feature--I cannot vouch for how effective the adjustability system truly is. However, I feel confident that the circumference will work on all but the most extreme hat sizes.SIZE: Nothing too exaggerated here. The hat may be called Asymmetrical but as far as my own measurements reflect, this hat is not. The brim is a versatile 2-3/4"" all around, a fashion brim as opposed to a sun hat. The inner circumference is approx 23"". From the base of the band to the top of the crown is approx 4"". The floppy-esque brim can be fiddled with a bit but not to the point that I'd call the visual result 'asymmetrical'.MATERIAL/CARE: 100% wool. Fabric care label: NO washing or dry cleaning (despite Amazon's description). It's soft and warm, not scratchy, but quite sturdy. It can be stored without fuss because it doesn't have the classic indented fedora crown, though this isn't really a 'roll and go' packable hat.**SHIPPING: If you're a frequent online purchaser of hats then you probably know that stores tend to absolutely destroy the structure of a hat when they cram it into a box or shipping bag; this trend unfortunately afflicts basement bargain sites to really high end shops. Mercifully, my hat arrived with a full sized heavy plastic inner shaper, a protective band, plastic wrap, and having been placed in an amply sized box. Refreshing. Thanks, Amazon.PRICE/VALUE: It's soft, stylish, comfy, and a great deal cheaper here than most other retailers. I've had other hats from this brand and they wear very well--can take some beating. This is a winner.**ETA 2 months later:  I like this hat so much I ended ordering the wineberry too. (I've worn the living daylights out of the black one and it's held up marvelously). Anyhoo, this hat is indeed great but I wish I hadn't bragged about Amazon's stellar packing; typically I don't include shipping issues in product reviews but as a hat is something that must be packed carefully to prevent possible permanent damage, shipping care is crucial. Different warehouse, different day...because my second hat was completely crushed, flattened, and placed in  2-1/2"" high box. Shameful. I will add the color is awesome tho, true to online images. And it's regained its shape, thankfully.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IP2JO0QLPQER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K54GSY8#wasThisHelpful","R1IP2JO0QLPQER","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was startled over how difficult it was to find one of these ""old timey"" zipper pouches on Amazon. They were a staple of my youth but now they seem rather overpriced and of seriously questionable quality.Sadly, this one is very stiff, even for vinyl--it has not proven helpful in storing the light weight items (mainly stickers) I use in a scrapbook organization binder. I suppose asking for a plastic to be both sturdy yet quite flexible is a feat too daunting. (?!)The punch holes aren't cut widely enough so I have to hold my tongue just right to flip past this in my standard 3-ring binder. If it was more malleable it would prove more useful for my purposes. Yet it's so thin I can't see even using it for a few standard school supplies --as any actual bulk will make the zipper even more stubborn.Speaking of, the 'zipper' is questionable, at best. In my grown up hands I can gently maneuver it; young children will likely grow frustrated attempting to slide it back and forth. Most kids aren't accustomed to 1960s technology. (And this model hasn't been improved upon since.)It's a binder pocket pouch so it's a low expectation kind of item that doesn't exactly merit my harsh criticism. Yet it really doesn't work well... so you find yourself writing 200 words on Amazon warning fellow consumers to skip it and continue their zipper binder pouch quest elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVKT4Q1APFHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AS888C#wasThisHelpful","R3SVKT4Q1APFHH","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Average to below average in every way. I'm hardly a professional musician and I'd venture to guess most folks seeking out this 'always brings a smile' instrument aren't aspiring to the philharmonic, but I know enough about melodicas to decipher this one is nothing special. Most cheap melodicas (and in fairness, often even pricer ones) tend to be delivered already out of tune...or quickly arrive there. Unless you can tolerate sharpness straight out of the gate, with enthusiastic and frequent play, definitely expect to be tuning this frequently. Melodicas are typically not tuned via A 440 so they may sound sharp regardless but they at least should be consistent within that range. (My middle A key was tuned to 'makes the dog howl', not in the A443 stratosphere at all).An exercise in patience, pay no mind to the description claiming it stays in tune, brass reeds, la la la. All melodicas need tuning. Some much sooner rather than much later, like this one.The plastic housing is on par with similarly priced pieces and the keys have a decent heft to them. However, a few keys on mine arrived with an annoying loose 'clicking' and this is unfortunately the quality control issues so many mass produced Made in China/Tawain/etc., instruments suffer. If you stick to the middle octaves it's not so bad, but why add the fuller 37 range if the lower/higher keys sound awful both in tone and in clickety clack construction?Effectively cleaning a melodica is not for the faint of heart and is a PITA in general, but this one proves especially tasking and seems to require a longer than usual drain time. My first melodica was a child's toy by Schoenhut (that still sounds great) and yet cleaning it was/is a dream comparatively. This gives you some indication of how far this model needs to go. ""Not really much better than a bona fide toy"" is not a ringing endorsement.In that vein, I've used better flex tubes from a melodica purchased in the toy department. This one manages to be both flimsy and stiff all at once: a real feat! While this is an easily replaced item, I still would have appreciated a higher quality extension piece included. Additionally, the plastic mouthpiece (spit valve to some) on my particular instrument was scratched so there's a possibility I received a previously returned product. Or...Hohner, once again, fudges quality control.The oft enthusiastically mentioned gig case is certainly decent. But..it's a textile gig case and kinda hard to mess up. I'd discourage anyone to purchase this on the appeal of the case alone! (Nearly every melodica comes with a surprisingly professional-looking case.)This model is one of the least expensive 37-keys on the market and, feeling frugal, I took the plunge. I wasn't swayed by the brand name because I know it isn't the brand it once was. Because I now only play a handful of times a year, this works well enough for a brief duet session with my hubby. Fun and games. But musically inclined folks who hate out of tune instruments or anyone more seriously exploring the melodica would be better served looking elsewhere.I'm befuddled how it makes the list of 'recommended', even if anemically so, by several melodica sites.

"Cursed with a zealously pesky mustache area no girl should have to suffer, and after getting fed up with harsh bleaches and waxes, I began tweezing my upper lip. But...After plucking sessions, I began to experience what appeared to be contact dermatitis--something beyond simple irritation of the follicle. The skin above my lip IS sensitive (thus the cessation of bleaches) but this was an odd, specific, non seeping rash that tended to pop up 48-72 hrs post-plucking. I was using ancient and kinda grody tweezers. And then I recalled that in my 20s (two decades ago) I would get flaky, weird skin right under my brows--literally the only skin problems I ever had--but I was an obsessive brow tweezer. Now as I no longer pluck my brows: Voila, I realized I haven't experienced weird brow flakes/rashes in years! So...an internet search led me to a possible nickel sensitivity; this link between dermatitis & plucking felt too compelling to ignore.I have not seen a dermatologist and by no means do I trust my self-diagnosis. But this brand was recommend by several skin allergy-sufferer sites and so I tossed out my tweezers of unknown metal content. I opted for the pointy tip as for whatever reason I feel I have more control than with the slant tip (plus for splinters and other non-cosmetic tasks the needle tips prove more versatile). I had my hubby sterilize them as these are supposedly surgical grade, and, again, come recommended by nickel allergy suffers. So far, so good!! My follicles aren't hating me thus far and, though I've made sure not to overdo it, after 4 days post-pluck, I've not had a flare up. (Apparently in mild cases, you can eat nickel-laden foods and even use other products containing nickel on other parts of the body but still experience facial reactions, e.g. earrings, tweezers, etc.,.)The balance is good, they're appropriately sharp, and the heft is just right. These are nearly 4-1/2 inches so if you're used to minis or cheapy lightweight tweezers these may take some adjusting to. Whether or not you're exploring these due to sensitivities or you just merely want made-in-Germany quality for your first aid or cosmetic kit, I recommend these.FROM THE PACKAGE: Tweezer, Needle Tips, Anti-Allergic""Destined (sic) for professional use by sterilization""PRINTED ON TWEEZERS: LANCET, Niegeloh, Solingen GermanyStainless Topinox 19018","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQTS0JRI8IL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017Q3V1G#wasThisHelpful","R3LQTS0JRI8IL2","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Read enough reviews of ANY skincare product and you'll encounter a person who experienced an adverse reaction. So, tho this cream reeked absolute havoc on my eyes, take it with a grain of salt as this formula has a lot of fans--and interestingly enough, fans claiming to have sensitive eyes. I'm learning my eyes are just ridiculously sensitive: on the evening of the 3rd day of use, my eyes felt as they'd been doused with chili peppers and then set on actual fire. No good. No good indeed. This went beyond just a 'Ohh this stings a little and feels itchy' kind of sensation. Also, I don't wear contacts. I'd applied it lightly (and correctly) but alas, even up to my eyebrows it was a 4 alarm ordeal.So, though I'm an occasional fan the Basescu line, do beware that the SECOND listed ingredient is a known irritant: Polyglycerylmethacrylate; used as a kind of film-forming agent, it's often downright unkind to truly sensitive eye suffers. I didn't thoroughly explore the ingredients prior to purchase but after my reaction, I hopped on my favorite makeup/skin care reviewing site and discovered I was hardly alone in the '3 days later' reaction. Add in the generous oil content and milia sufferers may wanna consider skipping it too.It went on creamy, the formula can be worn under concealer, and I loved the price. (Though I'm not a huge fan of non-tube packaging). I hate preachy reviews so If it works for you, why shouldn't it be recommended? I just wish it had worked out, but as an unmitigated disaster, it's a 1-star formula for moi.I didn't purchase this on Amazon but as I frequently consult Amazon for product reviews, this is just a heads up to fellow super sensitive-eye gals.From the MB website: Deionized Water (Aqua),Polyglycerylmethacrylate (and) Propylene Glycol,Carnation (Mineral) Oil,Propylene Glycol (and) Water (and) Euphrasia (Euphrasia Officinalis) Extract,Cetearyl Alcohol (and) Ceteareth-20,Vegetable (Olus) Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice) Gel, Polyquaternium-24, Hyaluronic Acid","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSY8JNB9HQU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015Z2XD6#wasThisHelpful","R3FSY8JNB9HQU6","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has what I was looking for: unrefined shea butter as the 1st ingredient (w/other all natural ingredients...tho just because it's natural doesn't mean it's incapable of causing an allergy/irritation so your mileage may vary.) I was trying to avoid fragrance & petroleum so this formula works for me. Despite the exotic moniker, it's made in the USA and sold here as a 3 pack.Researching reviews of this brand on other sites, I saw reports of a grainy texture and a less than ideal application due to it--that may be caused by the product getting a little too cold. For the uninitiated, shea butter can be difficult to work with and as this contains generous amounts of it, it definitely is not a formula you can just mindlessly swipe over the lips--rather, you do need to work with it and warm it up a bit. This means using a finger and that's a negative for some. I don't find it ""grainy"" as much as I do thick, with occasional earthy-like chunks. Again, not for everyone.Tho it's not greasy, to wear under lipstick you'll need a light application; if you're accustomed to a product that absorbs very quickly, this is not for you. Even with my winter parched lips, a few generous swipes of this sits on the lips for awhile. I prefer this as I want true long-lasting conditioning, not just a lip that feels momentarily, superficially smooth. It's not tacky or too waxy, but it IS robust. After 15 or so minutes it begins slowly absorbing and it feels...awesome and soothing.Aesthetically it doesn't offer a shine like some lip treatments and, because it's buttery balm, until it absorbs it does dull the natural color of your lips. This isn't going to provide a Snow White sheen effect or offer a tint that us cosmetics junkies call ""your lips but better"". Nope.On initial application I occasionally get a very brief bitter sensation, but not an unnatural taste that lingers even if repeatedly licking your lips. I'm super sensitive to scent, with fragranced lip products as the biggest offender, so this passed my test with flying colors. It is also available in flavored versions like orange, peppermint, strawberry, vanilla cream. Whatever floats your boat.A lot of people have sensitivities to petroleum, mineral oil, and even lanolin so this appears an ideal alternative. It functions as a superb protectant against wind and winter conditions (or sitting under a fan for hours at a time). After a few weeks of use, applying 2x a day, I've not had the typically painful, peeling and flaking lips (and lip line) that has plagued me every previous winter. So it's a real success in my book.

"NOT WINDCHIMES:First things first, these aren't anywhere in the family of wind chimes, barely a distant cousin. If you're expecting gale force winds and haven't yet evacuated, perhaps you'll hear them peal.FUNCTIONAL?Yep, they ARE functional and I use mine, indoors, to actually summon my own occasional farm animal: the hubby. However, I'd say they were marketed as purely ornamental pieces and I wouldn't expose them to extreme weather or precipitation.SIZE:Will these properly fit in your shabby chic urban farm space? You get 3. They are: 10""w/ a 10"" rope; 7"" w/ an 8"" rope; 5-1/5"" w/ a 6"" rope. So the total appropriate length of the pieces with the attached noose-style rope would be 20"", 15"", and 12"". These measurements vary from the listed description, but, like precious snowflakes, I doubt any two are just alike. Width is approximately 5"", 4"", and 3-1/2"". They're all imperfect so measurements were tricky and they're a little lopsided too. One is more of true round circumference while the other two are oval-y shaped.FINISH:The goldish color on the outside is pretty brassy, kinda cheap looking and would never pass for a true antique. The intentionally weathered external treatment can, and will, flake off if you mishandle them. If you sport a claw-like manicure, be gentle. The inside of the bell is...well, it's rough. It looks kinda farm legit. Read: dirty. And please, wash your hands. I feel at one point a family of birds may have built their nest inside them.SOUNDS LIKE:The tone they emit is truly pleasant and you may have to look down to check for cow patties underfoot--so true a bona fide cow bell do they mimic. Not cling clangy and annoyingly high pitched (even from the tiny one), but deep and rich and non headache-inducing. The ringer is not very long but there's enough dangling down that you can grab it and give it a good wiggle. But they're designed to be grabbed and shaken all over. Don't rely on the ringer to produce the sound independently.HANGING:The rope is a loop so you'll need a toggle bolt to securely hang these. Or remove the rope and do your own thing. They're not particularly heavy but substantial enough that you shouldn't crudely tack them up with just a nail.ON ARRIVAL:I made the mistake of opening these on my bed. Ugggg. They were packaged decently well but in transport, lots of little chips and shaved bits and dirt of exotic origins spilled out. So do yourself a favor and don't rip into them on the same linens you eat or sleep on, kay? Good.ON THE HANG TAG:Made in India. Item #26719. That's all, folks.VERDICT:Either you'll be all like Hey, Cool 3 Bells for Twenty Smackeroos or Oh...I Paid an Entire Andrew Jackson for These?! Keep expectations low, gain a neat conversation piece for your rustic themed kitchen, and step back in time before home intercoms, texting your family from 2 rooms away, or my fallback: just yelling your head off.

"Is the Asphalto your first stab at a Kickers brand shoe? Well good luck. I happen to own a few pairs and positively ADORE them: they look beautiful, age gracefully (if not at all), and are lovingly crafted from high quality materials. However...Poke around the reviews of other Kickers styles and discover for yourself how oddly sized they tend to be. I'm well versed in translating UK/US/EU sizes but it's still a total crap shoot when ordering Kickers. The issue is made even more complicated by the FREQUENTLY inaccurate labeling on the box vs the size sticker inside the shoe vs the size stamp on the outsole vs the ACTUAL size they end up being. Confused much? You may receive a pair that says UK 39 on the box with a US 6 on the shoe but they fit like a 7. Fun! Guys, there IS a way to translate shoe sizes, a simple and typically accurate universal conversion chart. Kickers kinda throws that to the wind. Ha!Soooo...these ended up going back because they were waaaay too huge for my mom. She's a US 6.5 and we ""think"" we received the 37 (it's what we ordered) but when they arrived they fit like rain galoshes and not like the roughly size US 6.5-7 they should have been (and what Amazon called a US6). Oh well. Frankly, even if they'd fit, the style was not her thing; these have a masculine quality. One *I* appreciate in a winter boot but isn't for everyone.The dual zippers are a great touch for easy on/off. The leather is thick, high quality; it's pliable and sturdy without feeling stiff. These are a superlative example of a no nonsense, streamlined boot that will appeal to girls who don't like a lot of bells and whistles or brand advertisement on their footwear. Hardware is a subtle, antiqued brass. Arch support is minimal but there's light padding in the bed. Outsole is a non-slip w/o appearing overly rugged or lug soled. The shaft is about 7 inches; the circumference is narrow so don't expect to tuck jeans in unless it's the skinniest of skinnies. Width is a solid US M (yay, they managed that ok) but you're on your own with the length. Don't give up on his brand, do exercise patience.The Asphalto isn't exactly a moto, engineer, combat, or Chelsea boot. It's is own thing and I adore the simplicity. But I can't recommend it if it's your first foray into Kickers as the sizing is definitely off, perhaps even more so than in their other styles. 5 stars for quality and style, 2 stars for fit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LL7NFSMZLQTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDZ5ZXY#wasThisHelpful","R1LL7NFSMZLQTG","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these in the black and gray for my mom. She's a 6.5 in nearly every sort of shoe, but based on multiple reviews that this fits really, really small, we sized up a 1/2 size to a 7. Verdict? We definitely could have just ordered in her typical 6.5: the pair we received was not at all undersized. The off-reported, weird 'sewn-in tongue' was also not an issue. Her foot is on the wide side of a standard M--with an incredibly high instep too--and she had zero problems sliding into the shoe...even with the laces only slightly loosened. Arch support/padding is minimal.Our issue is with the outsole. It's dangerously slick. I mean like iceskating on an oil spill slick. Unless you plan to wear these exclusively on carpet, prepare to find some concrete and shuffle vigorously to break-in/roughen up the sole of these puppies before you dare to walk on any hard surface... OR pay your friendly local cobbler to have the sole modified. You wanna mess with that? Prolly not.These shoes at original retail would be a huge 'no thanks' but based on Amazon's current listing, they were basement bottom priced-- that's literally the only reason dear ol' mama's gonna keep them. The style is truly cute: a feminized, fuzzy version of a guy's dress oxford. But we can tell the knit portion will pile horribly. Not to mention the synthetic leather looks, well like synthetic leather. Not all 'vegetarian' leather is created equally. The Shayleen doesn't look expensive but at this price point, our expectations were low. Yours should be too.

"Super cute, well made jacket that's on trend for winter 2014. But know before you buy: the scant photos provided do not represent the accurate color of the piece!I ordered in the gray for my mother (who is fully embracing the fun faux fur/teddy bear textiles this season). We were surprised to find the coat is indeed a lovely (very light) dove grey but with a dark charcoal back; there's actually THREE colors going on here that are impossible to determine from the online images. In the images provided, it looks like a really flat and one dimensional color story. But due to the nature of the pile, it's actually a tri-colored charcoal, ivory, and gray. It's NOT a solid color. Only the bits at the very end of the Sherpa-like fur are truly just gray. Rub the coat a different direction and there's all kinds of other stuff going on. This actually makes it a more versatile jacket, but we were surprised nonetheless.We ordered both a small and an x-small for her petite 5' 1"", 106 lbs frame. The small swallowed her. The x-small fits much better but is still generously cut to accommodate bulky winter layers. If between sizes, I'd err on the side of sizing down. This Generation label of BCBG is essentially marketed to juniors so we assumed it would fit a tad smaller, but they've clearly embraced the slightly oversized trend with this piece. However, the sleeve length was not ridiculously oversized; if you're petite you shouldn't experience the waaay too long sleeves that end up hanging down mid-hand. This was appreciated.The addition of roomy-- but virtually invisible pockets--is great touch and it's SUPER soft. Like an infant's first plush toy, soft. The tiny but sturdy eyelet closures (there's 5 or 6 of them) run the entire length of the jacket so it's up to you how fastened up you opt to be. The lining is a silky poly blend on the sleeve and an interesting sweatshirt-like material for the rest. It's warmer than it would appear and it's heavier than we were expecting. The length (slightly longer in person than Amazon's measurements) ensures it covers the rump--you can sport some super skinnies without being on display.If you're ok with the tri-color material, this is a sincerely adorable piece for lovers (of any age) of more whimsical fashion. Curious to read reviews from anyone who buys in ivory to see if that version, too, is more than it appears.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KQECO1XY9L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA52B24#wasThisHelpful","R5KQECO1XY9L3","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At a whopping half inch smaller than my typical go-to brand, Field Notes, these flexible kraft paper notebooks (made with recycled paper) weigh in at 3.5x5 with a mere 32 pages. Their featherweight stats promise they're even more pocket friendly than competitors. Streamlined for brevity.The brand offers this""Keeper"" line that travels beyond the blank/lined/grid notebooks (which they also offer) with themes like ""music keeper"", ""project keeper"", etc., but the critic inside me chose the ""review keeper"" as I love the idea of tracking and reviewing purchases, cheese & beverages I've sampled, new restaurants....whatever can be documented and given, quite literally, a 1-5 star review.Atop each page (printed front and back) there's a thin rectangle shaped box to title your review, followed by the outline of five large stars that you can shade in/circle to reflect your pleasure or lack of, followed by 6 college-ruled lines. The bottom third of the page contains a large, bordered blank field for....well, not sure on that one. For the wordy amongst us (guilty) you may find yourself disappointed that there's so little of the ruled area. The space utilized by the star field is a bit wasted, and, for my purposes, so is the bottom third. I have decent handwriting but I NEED a lined rule or I go all crooked. Perhaps this box at the bottom is meant for a doodle, free form rant, maybe even a large sticker? The idea is you can do whatever you'd like in the space. And that's nice...especially if you're a person of few words or don't want to be limited by them. But I'd prefer more ruled lines.The binding is two staples; you can easily rip out pages but ripping out more than 3 or 4 can, and in my case, does, compromise the integrity of the entire notebook. The notebooks don't lie flat unless you really abuse them or remove pages, but at this price point I wouldn't expect them to. The thick chipboard cover can be ripped too, these aren't indestructible like a Field Notes ""Expedition"". This flexibility in a cover--roll it up if you want--is a boon in some situations but will discourage more rugged use. It does, however, accommodate a clipped pen w/o the cover rolling down or experiencing serious damage.The front cover is blank except for carrying over the outline of the 5 stars. Back cover provides a field for ""belongs to; a contact field; start date/end date"". The notebook has rounded edges for easily flipping through. The paper itself is pleasant to write upon, neither slick nor too pulpy. However...Unfortunately, my pen of choice is either a Le Pen or a Stabilo Point 88 and so there is considerable bleed through on the pages. Even tho both these pens are very fine tipped, the Scout books (and in fairness, most of their competitors too) can't handle anything even approaching a felt tip. Stick to a ballpoint and you'll be fine. The pages aren't as lush as Moleskine, obviously not as plasticky as an Expedition, but ultimately far, far superior to any drugstore notepad you'll ever encounter. I haven't tried Rhodia or Word or the handful of other popular pocket notebooks to compare.I have no true gripes and would buy again. (And have). I've enjoyed keeping track of odds and ends and these are fun companions to list lovers and will aid general jotter types who desire more organization or clarity of topic/theme.

"I had assumed the paper would be nearly as vibrant as the cover images. I was very disappointed to discover the gift wrap is quite muted and doesn't remotely pop like the fetching cover. It's still lovely in terms of the print, but I had absolutely fallen in love with that rich pine green. So to find a kind of dull, rather matronly color palette with no sheen---and with hues SEVERAL shades lighter than the cover--was a real bummer. Dull is hardly the word I would associate with William Morris patterns...so this collection is, to me, a disservice to his designs. Yet here it is.Additionally the deep creases in the paper--and mind you I knew it would arrived folded in book form but there's a way to package these where it's still more versatile and serviceable--mean this is suited for wrapping very small gifts. Trinkets really. I am thinking of projects that could somehow utilize the entire sheet without drawing attention to the creases, but even framing it is challenging as the paper is so faded looking. I love kraft papers, when they're marketed as such, so am fine with low gloss or matte wrapping, but these papers look like they've been sun faded to the point that I suspect I received a defective batch.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G33I026SFSXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486268209#wasThisHelpful","R1G33I026SFSXB","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Diesel is one of my most favorite brands and even tho I'm way too old for their adorable juniors line, I still couldn't resist the price of this beanie.It's very soft, sewn well, and in the black & yellow I ordered, you'll be as impossible to ignore as a bumblebee. However, this is a VERY roomy beanie--huge even. For a chick, I have a large head (sz 7-1/2 in most structured hats) and this kinda swallows me. While in theory the super generous fit should allow for more styling options vs a more conventional slim profile 'stocking cap', if my hair is too squeaky clean I find I can't keep this on my head. Slippage city. You really need to wear it pulled down well over the ear to keep it on...and unfortunately I prefer my beanies to sit back a bit w/the band behind my ear. If my mass of coarse curly hair is less than shower fresh I have more luck keeping it on. But you may want to reach for a bobby pin.At less than the equivalent price of 2 fast food tacos, I hardly regret buying this. On chilly nights I grab it to curl up in front of the TV. But, for me, it's too high maintenance with its sloppy fit to wear out of doors. A 'bohemian' look is one thing, but I think I could fit another whole person's head in here along with mine. And because it's not a super tight knit, it's not ideal for super cold outdoor temps. But it IS super soft and that counts for something and it doesn't seem like it's going to pill badly and it doesn't shed.

"Decently well made hat at an absolutely awesome price. The color is bright and cheery and totally on point with the current plaid trend, but alas, on my particular head it was just too lumberjack-y. Though there are styling touches that definitely prove it's marketed for women, it turned out to just not be feminine enough and I couldn't help but think it would be cuter on a fashion forward teenage boy. I typically like cadet-style hats but in this color combo I was just waiting for the hubby to yell TIMBER!I wear a L in a Goorin or a Brixton and for a chick, I have a rather big noggin. I buy hats in usually a 7 1/4-1/2.

"Really cute bag. I've grown weary of the intentional distressing fad, but as a huge fan of Liebeskind, I couldn't resist Amazon's price even if it IS last season's bag, I had to have it. My experience with this brand has only been positive; I'm rough on my purses, especially when I travel, and Liebeskinds hold up really well.Liebeskind's all-leather bags tend to weigh a ton, so I hoped in denim this piece would be comparatively lightweight. It is! The bag is soft, sewn well, and the typical quality I expect from the brand. It's not quite as huge in real life as the proportions appear on Amazon's model, yet roomy enough for all the essentials plus some. The hardware is awesome (not shiny & cheap or needlessly heavy), the zipper pulls buttery smooth, and the distressed rips, holes, and gashes are done just right; the distressing is on the front and the back. The leather accents are quality.I don't use the detachable cross body strap and frankly it's a hair too thin and narrow for the proportion of the bag anyway; it's adjustable but only via a limited belt-style fastener so forget radically adjusting the length if you're petite; there's about 8"" of adjustable play to the cross body strap. As for the top handle, regardless of a bag's size I tend to carry all my shoulder/hobo bags like a shopper's tote--just in my hand--or sometimes slung over my wrist. So I can't offer any insight on how long term comfortable/practical the shoulder drop is. I will say that on the rare occasion I carry it over on my shoulder, I like that it's a single strap as maybe I just have slope-y shoulders, but in a double strap I always experience one strap slipping off and/or the straps feel too cumbersome and tricky. I know the drop here will accommodate winter wear without strangling your shoulder blade or interfering with standard movement.**One small issue that has me withholding a star: the TOP zipper opens up into a half pocket--it's large enough for a big wallet, cell phone and a few small items but doesn't run the length of the bag. The FRONT zipper is the main compartment. That's a little weird and can cause some confusion and imbalance issues if the bag is super packed or you carry lots of heavier items. Not a deal breaker for me but the potential customer should be made aware of this rather unorthodox design choice. Things could fall out of any side/front loading bag if you're not careful. Most girls prefer the security and convenience that a true top loading bag provides. You simply can't tell from the online images that there's actually two zippers/separate compartments on the bag.**This isn't a north/south or east/west bag, it's more of a rounded square and not very deep, so it is fairly easy to find your items inside. The fabric lining in a flower power print is kinda garish and doesn't exactly jibe with the edgy exterior.I ordered in the Used Black and it pairs so well with my black/gray-centric winter wardrobe and looks especially fetching with plaids. I personally dislike the 'ladies who lunch' kind of handbag so this very casual bag is great for anyone who favors a more downtown style. Dust bag included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QYHOUAG97E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J57C4YO#wasThisHelpful","R6QYHOUAG97E1","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ordered the Teal in a 39. I'd hoped it would fit like a generous US 8.5 since in some boots I flirt with a 9. Unfortunately the 39, when paired with socks, fits more like an 8. Worried the 40 will be too big, I'm not sure where the sweet spot is with these fairly adorable boots--I'm in limbo about exchanging them. Width is true, if not a tad on the narrow side; no heel slipping which is great. But I'd say length wise they run a hair small and anyone with a W+ foot wouldn't find them comfy.I'm pleased w/the hardware: not glinty or cheap looking. The side zipper functions well for an easy in and out. The leather is a little thin & flimsy on the shaft yet the leather on the toe is a tad too stiff for my liking, but overall it's a decently well made boot. I'm worried if they get wet that they may bleed a bit of color as the dye job seems more superficial than the techniques used by other 'artisan' shoe brands. I'm also flummoxed how these could be called teal as they're completely green, no blue tone at all. So I would have called them emerald or jade but never... teal. The outsole is urban jungle friendly, no slip risk in winter. Arch support/foot bed padding is minimal, at best.I picked these up during a promotion and frankly, at the original retail, they're seriously overpriced. But if you're a fan of brands like Freebird, Bed St, or Kickers UK you'll be cool with the slight imperfections of this moto x engineer boot. Just size up if planning to wear winter weight socks and maybe wait for a sale.****ETA: I indeed ended up ordering the next whole size up, the 40. It swallowed me. Even with thick socks and an insole, it was a no go. I kept the original sz 39 and just pray that it'll stretch just a bit so my toes don't go numb. Because the more I hang out with these boots, the more I adore them. Hopefully you'll get lucky w/not being exactly between sizes. If you are, prepare to compromise comfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0L7LPNEZ36H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M94MM60#wasThisHelpful","R3G0L7LPNEZ36H","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While it's wholly possible I just got a dud, this caddy has proven to be a total headache! Quite a few gripes here but I'll start with a compliment or two: it looks lovely from across the room. Simple & stylish. It's quite small so it doesn't take up too much space--forget sticking a bottle of ketchup in it; each of the three flatware slots are only about 3x 2-1/2 inches and the napkin compartment is very narrow. Amazon's listed dimensions for the overall size are nearly accurate.Gripe 1: I have a oodles of bamboo kitchen accessories by various brands, and, nearly without exception, adore them all. Bamboo is typically smooth and pleasant to handle but the handle on this caddy feels a bit like sandpaper. Really odd. The entire piece just feels unfinished and coarse.Gripe 2: Unbalanced and then some! So....were you planning to carry this thing from the kitchen to the table...'cause it is, after all, a caddy? Well good luck! When mine is loaded with a mere flatware for 4 (a cheapie IKEA set, not heavy duty solid silverware) due to the dividing slots being only on one side, the holder tips wildly forward; there's an utter lack of stability/stiffness on the folding handle. So keep steak knives and small children away. Huge fail at weight distribution vs the structure of the handle. Sure, you could place a heavier object in the narrow napkin side to balance it out a little, but that's an unnecessary and impractical extra step you shouldn't have to bother with and there's no way to adjust/tighten up the handle The other option is to carry it from the bottom by not using the handle at all. Again...but it's a caddy. Mobility is the selling point.Gripe 3: Remember how I said this looks nice from across the room? It does. But close up you'll find that when they attached the handle to the holder, they scarred the bamboo on both sides to do so. It looks like two staple gashes.So, I use mine for storage for flatware/straws/cheapie plastic items that needn't travel. Just sitting in one single place, it'll be fine. But I cannot recommend this for a family who wants to occasionally tote their flatware around or is expecting a nice smooth-feeling addition to their bamboo accessories collection. Skip it. You can do much, much better at an even cheaper price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3637MQHP4C7FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00272S3GC#wasThisHelpful","R3637MQHP4C7FM","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do I love my Edison Petit lamp? Yes! Am I equally wild about the shade? Um, nope.There are several one star reviews for this product that are completely unfair due to customers believing they were receiving an actual lamp AND shade. To reiterate: this product page is for a thin piece of plastic that wraps around the corresponding Edison Petit lamp, also sold here on Amazon.The shade arrived in a gigantic box as this shade is packed flat. I was operating under the impression it would be like a cling film or high end removable sticker, but it attaches to the lamp by a series of tabs. It is an exceptionally simple design (not even a single line of instructions included) but while I appreciate that the shade doesn't reduce the light output, the interlocking tab design seems cheapie; a pretty snazzy 21st century lamp with a pretty disappointing optional ornamentation.Because the shade doesn't ""stick"" to the lamp, one can change out their shade on a whim w/o risk of damaging either the shade or the lamp. The shade pops on in seconds (lace up the tabs first, then slip over the top). My issue is that the tabs stick out at the back like a woman in a corset two sizes too small. Perhaps they will relax with use, but my ""Fatima"" shade fits awkwardly--because of the exceptional mobility of the Edison, I move the lamp around where/when needed. But take care; the shade, with any handling at all, creeps up immediately so that it leaves the bottom half inch of the lamp 'naked' while the top of the shade sticks up OVER the lamp. Bummer.For just under a Andrew Jackson, you're getting a piece of very thin piece of plastic that very nearly could be brilliant. If you leave your lamp in one spot, always, and plan to turn the ugly lace up tabs to the wall, I'd anemically recommend. I'm ultimately grateful that I wasn't dealing with a sticker that could bubble or crease, but the Fatboy team hasn't quite perfected this one yet. It feels a few millimeters too small--it should fit like the custom glove it's intended to be. This feels more like a kid's toy.PROS: doesn't reduce light output;  easy to use;  if can afford it, can change the look of your lamp as your mood dictatesCONS: pricey for what it is;  doesn't fit as well as it should;  tabs stick out at the back, betraying the sleek modern design of the Edison;  with even light handling, the shade pops up higher than the lamp itself","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8W1VRKMW1TKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMC8PYG#wasThisHelpful","R8W1VRKMW1TKW","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these Zig markers with the express purpose of decorating/writing on the very slick surface of Instax pics (photos like Polaroids). I'd hoped to save a few bucks by using ""Sharpie CD/DVD Twin Tips"" (Amazon ASIN:B0017TKW74) but though they wrote without smudging, the tips dried out sooo quickly and 2 of the colors were dried out upon arrival! Very frustrating. These Zigs are FAR superior and my only gripe is I wish I'd ordered them sooner.I'm thrilled these do exactly what I need them to do. The colors are vibrant, they haven't smudged (I do allow the ink to dry for a few seconds), all 5 colors are properly working w/o drying out, and the write quality is excellent. I don't know that with heavy, more industrial use they'll last for years, but for my light decoration purposes, these are absolutely ideal.Note: the tip is 0.7mm. So not too too fine. I believe the ""2mm"" in the description refers to the lead holder? I'd love if they made these in a wider version, but unless you need to cover a very large surface or write microscopic, this all purpose tip will do great.Amazon's online image is out-of-date as it appears they've updated the packaging. Also, one of marker caps looks pink but is in fact, purple. Violet. So is not a carnation pink like you might suspect from the online image.

"Absolutely ADORABLE stickers if you understand what you're getting:-TINY TEENY! Each sheet only measures about 7x4 inches. With an average of 40 stickers per sheet you can expect these to be super small. Amazon's images, if you're unfamiliar with this brand, do not clearly illuminate the scope.(I use these to decorate Instax photos which are the size of credit cards; works awesome for my projects and they'd be great for a small journal. But these won't cover large areas!)-HARD TO PEEL? Aided by long fingernails, I have little difficulty removing these from the sheet. But it can be tricky. Not kid-friendly.- ALL STICKERS? About 98% of a sheet is indeed a peel-off sticker; not every single image on the sheet is. However, once you've completed a sheet, it's possible, tho still challenging, to cut into the background to grab the image you want (that wasn't pre-cut).-ENGLISH? Yes, many cute phrases & words. But some of the adhesives, especially the teeniest ones, include what I believe is Korean lettering. I'm not bilingual so am clueless to their meaning.-ALL CATS? It's primarily kitty-centric so if you're looking for a less specific theme then these may disappoint.-REMOVABLE? Not particularly. Translucent backed, these grab on for dear life. Washi these are not.-VALUE? You get a ton of stickers for the price and I'll find uses for them all.If you're after really small stickers, a fan of kitty cats, and understand the limitations, I think you'll be pretty tickled with this offering. It's darn cute, vibrantly printed, and excellent quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X26GB7027WRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZGDZ20#wasThisHelpful","R2X26GB7027WRD","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a middle aged woman so feel a little silly getting too excited over girly sticker frames. That stated, if you're an Instax mini fanatic of any age, these are very well made and pretty darn fun. I'm sold!The stickers peel off easily without being too fragile; I've yet to rip, crease, or ruin one! I'd love if they were a tad more removable after placement  la washi tape, but basically once they're on, they're on. If you don't press down too hard during your initial placement, it's technically possible to recenter them, but with a careless hand or for a young child, do know these fit the Instax mini photos exactly, with no room to spare. They border the entire photo, perfectly.Though there's several varieties of sticker frames made by this same brand, these particular frames have a space at the bottom for a message/date/label...whatever you desire to write. (I've found that using markers made for writing directly on CD/DVDs work really well to write on the bottom white border space on an Instax. But with these stickers you can use most ordinary pens to write your message without a great fear of smudging.) If you DON'T want sticker frames that include the cutesy blank message field, don't order these because all 20 pieces have them.You actually get a bonus sticker with every frame because the rectangle center part--the piece in the middle that you remove to reveal the frame--can be used to decorate something else. Kinda cool.The online images of the patterns/colors are accurate. The stickers are not glossy. They're not totally flattest matte, but there's zero shine or glitter and have a paper-like finish you'd find in a business label.If I recall correctly, the packaging does not include any English and is clearly not produced for the US market, but that's no biggie as these really don't require instructions!I'd love to find these in less 'precious' and overly tween-centric designs, but they're very well made, stick beautifully without bubbling or creasing, and really add flair to your shots. They're priced right, too. In the price bloated world of anything resembling 'scrapbooking', I feel these are a great value vs cost and a superior alternative to purchasing the expensive pre-printed theme film from FujiSince one of the joys of instant photography is a giving away a pic that is truly unique, with no other copy on earth, jazzing it up with one of these message frames makes it just all the more special.

"What you're ordering here:This particular product page is for ONE Skinneeez chicken toy, not 3. Ya can't rely only on the image; Amazon can be tricky like that.Also, the product dimensions listed include the retail packaging--the paper card the toy is attached to. The chicken itself is teeny! About 2x3, maybe just barely.Finally, it is catnip filled, supposedly, but don't expect your cat to respond to it like many other catnip toys by brands like Yeowww or FatCat. If you're purchasing this thinking you'll get a super potent catnip toy, well, nope. This should probably be marketed only as a plush toy.----------------I happen to have a very toy-crazy cat, one of these types that will play with just about anything I offer him. (And frequently with things I do not). As kitties are known to be discriminating, I find it difficult to write reviews for cat toys because what my cat may love, your cat dismisses with scorn. That said...IF your cat enjoys small, not over stuffed plushy toys, this is a real winner. We had a few of these Skinneeez toys in the teaser form (""Ethical Skinneeez Forest Friends Cat Wand"" sold here on Amazon) when my guy was a kitten and they were a huge hit! I think his little brain was imprinted with a love of this style/brand of toy. Frankly, we still prefer them in wand form. But my arm isn't titanium so if I'm lazy, just tossing this across the room does the trick.They're well made and though the legs are a thin soft rope material, unless you have a real Jaws on your hands, they aren't easily shredded. As mentioned above, I suspect they have only trace amounts of catnip and even the most potent catnip toy can go stale. Regardless, my guy really gives these chickens the business and seems to thoroughly enjoy tossing/carrying them about. Due to popularity, they get a little...gross and saliva-y. Just sayin'.This version of Skinneeez is so small it's quite easy to lose; one could argue they're overpriced for what they are. But for *some* cats these chickens are total kitty crack. So IMO, it's worth a try if your feline prefers a very soft flat toy over a plastic jingle ball or the stiffer canvas-like catnip toys like Yeowww makes. My cat likes all the above but still seeks out these Skinneeez.Though stuffing-less, if you have a large dog who loves Snowball's toys, be advised of the potential choking hazard. Also, a few reported a nasty chemical smell; we've not encountered that and I'm pretty sensitive to such things.Bawk bawk!

"I own the Fuji Instax 90 Neo Classic.WHAT FITS:I can fit the 90 (sans strap), a single foil cartridge of film, and a small package of sticker border frames in this case. I removed the strap from the camera in favor of a thin wrist lanyard because otherwise the case felt overstuffed. If you swap the film cartridge for the wall mount charger, that'll fit too.I'm a little surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reviews as this case has some odd design flaws and questionable craftsmanship.CONS (for me):1. The inside ""divider"" isn't stitched all the way to the bottom so batteries/pics/stickers will just slide to the other side. The divider does keep, for better or worse, the camera on one single side of the case.2. The zipper wraps completely around the case so there's a risk if you're not holding your tongue just right or being careless by zipping too far, the camera could fall out. It's 'tippy' to say the least, especially if you're removing the camera from the case while it's on your shoulder. I make sure to place the camera in the case the exact same way/direction every time so I know if I'm in a hurry to get a pic, I know which side is weighted. The top of the case is not as deep as the bottom and I'm not sure this aids the design.3. It's a hard case but has virtually no internal padding. I wouldn't trust it to fully protect from a serious drop. It's more than adequate to protect from dust and debris while in a handbag, etc. But I view this case more as a storage option than a security measure.4. Shoddy materials. The included strap is...awful. The huge plastic clips are not only difficult to grip, making it tough to put on/take off the case, but it feels like they'd easily break or crack. And the super cheap, rough material of the strap meant I felt zero guilt when I tossed it out and replaced it. Additionally, on my case the Instax placard is crooked. A small gripe unless you're a bit Type A or get distracted by aesthetics; every time I glance at it, I just wanna re glue it straight!***ETA: I'm now having issues with the zipper catching the fabric of the 'divider'. Having the zipper get stuck as often as it's now occurring may be a deal breaker. I've fiddled with it and experimented with adding/removing different items from the case in hopes it was just an issue with imbalance. Alas, this is just a cheap case and I need to stop expecting it to behave like a case 4X the price. Carry on...WHAT'S TO LIKE:1. It's likely the modest price that people, even picky ones like me, respond to...and the fact that it does provide minimum protection for cameras not known to be the most sturdily built.2. In a world of extremely girly tween-centric Instax accessories, the plain black look of the case kept it off *my* cons list. A lot of people dismiss Instax as a toy, but this case reminds us that indeed, adults like instant photography too.3. It's difficult to find affordable, easily obtained Instax accessories in the US market. If I wanted a truly quality case to custom fit my 90, I'd have to order from an Asian site that would take weeks to arrive or order from a US niche store that charges beaucoup bucks. I need my extra $ for the film! A 2-day ship for under $10 is hard to beat.BOTTOM LINE:A decent starter case. Priced right, even with only minimal protection, I'd recommend for infrequent use or storage. I use my camera a LOT. Like daily. So ultimately I need a better designed and more shock absorbent case. But because there's very little to chose from for us instant photog lovers, this will have to do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZH27NJ1DCBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BWYDTI#wasThisHelpful","R1QZH27NJ1DCBX","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review would be 5 stars if they were still making the nice super fluffy, fat rainbow-colored poms of a year or so back. The new Chase'm poms we received are noticeably smaller. Which makes me a bit nervous as my cat has been known to swallow things he shouldn't a la his not-so-bright canine siblings.The last 2 packages I've ordered, about 4 months apart, are not like the online images-- rather they're a deep aqua & purple swirl with no white at all. Frankly, the color makes little difference to me (or probably the cat) but with the color change came the size reductions in both dimension and overal fluffiness. I'd say these are no bigger than a shooter marble; if you're not old enough to have any idea what that is, I'd say these are not much bigger than a standard jaw breaker, a Gobstopper.Because my cat adores these and because my cat loses these constantly, we'll likely keep ordering them. But do be advised to the ever shrinking size. Additionally, these 30 balls arrive in a cheap sealed shrink bag with loose, low quality catnip sprinkled inside. The poms themselves are not stuffed with 'nip. Be careful upon opening because you could cause a mess if you haphazardly rip open the bag.We store ours in a cat-proof cupboard because, as the mainly positive reviews reflect here, most cats REALLY dig 'em. It's just unfortunate the manufacturer could be cutting down on material costs in an already very cheap to make product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZ1L4OXDO2Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055C46Y4#wasThisHelpful","RFZ1L4OXDO2Y3","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I began with just the Give a Hoot shower curtain by Creative Bath but decided to fully commit and buy all the coordinating accessories. The product line may be a tad juvenile for this 30-something, but life is short; whimsy is ageless.The can is VERY heavy, probably a good 5 lbs. I was immediately impressed with the heft and quality of the resin. One of my dogs has rarely met a can he can't topple, but this stymies him. So rest assured, the bin may be pricey but you're getting a solidly made piece. If your bathroom floods, this isn't going to float off too easily!As another reviewer mentioned, the 3 owl figures (in bright pumpkin, oyster white, and Caribbean blue) are only featured on the front of the can. But a cool detail is the brick wall pattern that is carried over from the curtain--it borders both the top & bottom of the can; the fact that it's cut into the resin, not painted on, is a lovely detail that points to high quality workmanship.The color is a pale mint, not the vibrant candy apple green that repeats in the other accessories; the leaves of the branches wouldn't have contrasted as well if the can wasn't lightened to the more subdued green. The finish is nice and glossy making it a breeze to cleanDimensions vary a tad from listed: 8-1/2"" W (top), 7-1/2"" D, 10"" H;  6"" W, 4-3/4"" D (bottom)I hate using a can liner in this because I want nothing to distract from how adorable these owls are!

"My review is based on an alternative use for this baking sheet: a giant coaster for my hubby's office/man cave. He reappropriated one of 'my' beautiful, high quality wooden coffee tables for his space; I knew he'd go rogue and it would just be a matter of time before the table was damaged beyond repair.Instead of buying a coaster set that wouldn't conveniently accommodate every size glass/mug or might fail to be used at all, I slapped down this generously sized silicone mat in the middle of the table and voila!  I've got water rings/stains, scratches from his 239 remote controls, and stray ashes from his pipes/cigars all covered in one fell swoop.Cleanup is a breeze, I just wipe off the mat instead of reaching for wood polish every time. It's decently thick, not too flimsy, and low profile. I couldn't have covered so much space, for the same price, with individual pads/coasters. A woven or fabric placemat would be more difficult to clean; the silicone, while not truly non-slip, is much more forgiving than a slippery vinyl or cheap-looking plastic placemat; its utilitarian function/aesthetic works with hubby's dislike of frou frou design.There's plenty of reviews extolling its virtues for baking, but this has turned out to be a really cool purchase for an entirely different purpose!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSX2AKTSLXDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002MH2FM#wasThisHelpful","R2NSX2AKTSLXDH","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband, like another reviewer, is a HAM operator and this hobby seems to require a lot of space for his ever-growing acquisition of yet more radio/lab stuff. He also collects, of all things, Commodore computers; they're not tiny. So space in his man cave/lab is a commodity.We were VERY pleased with the high quality vs low price of this spacious table. We ordered a lot of other office/lab storage-related items along with this table and they all had a manufacturing defect or packaging issue of some kind. But not this!

In hubby's tight work space, if we knock it, we don't fear the table or its contents will go tumbling. Additionally, the support beams don't interfere with leg room on all sides like some similar tables.The extremely thick tabletop is matte with a very slightly textured finish; it's not slick coated so that your items (or a table cloth) go sliding right off. I also appreciate that it doesn't have a cheesy fake marbling pattern like the folding tables of my childhood.We have another similar utility table, by a different manufacturer, in the same room as this model. The difference is like night and day--one feels flimsy and disposable, this one built to last. I'd say the only drawback is that it might be difficult for a single individual to frequently transport it as it's so solid & heavy. It's huge!We love that this brand offers the same table in a variety of dimensions; we'll be back for more because it always seems one is needed for yard sales, swap meets, fairs, pet adoption, additional seating, etc. Just slide under the bed or stick in the garage and you're good to go.A great fuss-free, affordable option. Recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLLJTRCJH80U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ED4X2I#wasThisHelpful","R1YLLJTRCJH80U","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hubby needed a test lead rack for his home office/electronics lab. The Fluke name, while pricier than many of its competitors, is known for high quality products--making this selection an easy choice.Zero issues on arrival; the listed dimensions are accurate, it has a nice heft/super solid, is well constructed, and mounted perfectly flush. The yellow (more of a orangey yellow than a ""safety/caution"" yellow) is exceptionally bold...if you'd prefer a rack to blend in, consider another color. But the finish is superior--no chipping paint! Nothing flimsy or disposable here.It can hold additional items like screwdrivers and various other equipment; our rack is mainly used for the intended purpose, but I could see all sorts of alternate uses beyond test lead storage. Anyone who desires organization in their work area will benefit.While this is a pretty standard size for this type of rack, if you have dozens upon dozens of test leads or thicker coax cables, be advised that though each of the 10 slots can hold multiple alligator/banana/mini grabbers/multimeter/oscilloscope leads, etc., a single rack may not do. For typical home lab use, it's more than enough storage and won't hog valuable wall space.You can't wax too poetic about a metal test lead rack. This Fluke model does what it needs to, arrived as described, and, most importantly, is clearly built to last. A solid recommend for an item you want to buy once and then not hassle with ever again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DDQEU93XFQ0S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VRJGOI#wasThisHelpful","R3DDQEU93XFQ0S","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm typically long winded and attempt thoroughness in all my reviews but I'll keep is short and sweet:This is a crate liner. An overpriced one at that. In our household, crate liners and dog beds are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. This should be marketed as a crate liner and was not. Full stop. A crate liner.So...as a crate liner, doghouse pad, or travel mat,  this is adequate. As a comfy or remotely supportive dog bed for daily use? Well, my pets can't speak but if they could--and granted, they are grumpy seniors--it would go something like, ""Um, NO THANKS"".Even if this ""bed"" had been properly stuffed and cushiony, the ""fleece"" version has a bight white slick fabric bottom (which is not shown in the photo) and that's the least forgiving color on earth. Again, in a crate:  doable. On the hardwood floors of a multiple pet home? Gracious, me!Sometimes I opt for quantity over quality as I like to replace beds as frequently as possible, but I've picked up less expensive, actual BEDS at big box stores for less. Here's a rare occasion where I'm less than satisfied w/an Amazon purchase.

"I had been searching for just the right drawer pulls for my recently revamped vanity, when I stumbled onto these. It was more than I wanted to pay for 6 knobs, but I have to admit: these have a 'grandma's costume jewelry' look to them that I found oddly appealing. Had to have 'em! I'd first struck out w/these much higher quality  pink glass knobs but they were just too subdued.I'm not terribly familiar w/Lisbeth Dahl, but searching around I discovered it's a real mixed bag with this line. Some of Dahl's unusual designs look to be of great quality while other items are quite shabbily assembled. What would I get with these flower pulls?Well....hot glue, for starters. Out of 6, 3 of them had really awful threads of hot glue surrounding all the 'stones'. Like strands of it everywhere. It looks cheap, is annoying to remove, and frustrating that $60 got me 'a 6-yr old with his first hot glue gun project' knobs.And we're right back to glue AGAIN because I had to go buy some super glue in order to carefully affix some clusters that had fallen off from the base of the petals. The good news is inside the packaging I located the pieces that had fallen off. If they were missing completely, I definitely would have had to return them. I won't even get to the weird, dark stains/glue residue/burned-like areas that are on the backside of the knobs. I'm just too glued out at this point.A set of 6, some were individually wrapped, others were not. Again, hardly points to high quality. And frankly, based on the provided description, I have no idea what is acrylic vs stone. It all looks the same.The color on the petals is less ""mint"", as described, and more of a jade. The clusters are a light Caribbean blue.The rough diameter of the knob is just shy of 2-1/2"". The screw is also 2-1/2"". I have no idea what the ""3.54 inches"" in the description is referring to. I measured every conceivable part of this knob and nothing equals 3.54?! If you took the circumference of a pentagon (?!), fiddled with every known division of it, you still don't get 3.54. The closest I can come up with is that it's the area. But I'm not sure that including the ""area"" dimension is particularly practical as it applies to drawer knobs; it could be potentially misleading.Hubby drilled new holes in my vanity drawers but said the mm size of the screw was ""standard"".These looks pretty cool and kitschy against my glittery gold drawers but only if you don't look at them close up. Additionally, they're a little rough on the hands due to the flower shape and some unevenness, rough edges, and the pointy ends. Irregularity dooms these, to say the least.Low quality materials, even lower quality workmanship, and a staggering price makes these more appealing in online images than in reality. And best believe, I'll be keeping yet more glue handy for the inevitable repairs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8H5O286BS6V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F57PS8#wasThisHelpful","R8H5O286BS6V7","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this for my husband's office/man cave. The room's theme is ""industrial site"" (biohazard shtick, OSHA compliance signs, safety cones, et cetera) and his predominant color is 'caution' yellow. Initially, I just needed an inexpensive trash can that would match the garish color scheme, but this bin turned out to be pretty awesome! (It's also available in less jolting colors like white and grey).--Size? Because this model is identical in style to the giant-sized garage/curbside bins, the online image may briefly fool you. But it's a 10 gallon container measuring approx 17"" H, 15-1/2"" diameter (top), 12"" diameter (base) w/ 3"" long handles.--Sturdy? Yep!  It's incredibly durable and thick (nearly commercial grade plastic) and can easily be hosed out and routinely abused. A good thing...since my husband has never used a plastic bag liner in his life; moreover, he considers food stuffs, of any type, to be appropriate for disposal alongside paper items and your more benign household debris. This is convenient for indoor use but ruggedly forgives carrot cake smothered fax cover sheets.--Lid? Nope. However, Rubbermaid Commercial Brute coordinating lids (#2610) are available and we bought one...because (see above) Hubby's trash is our dogs' 2nd breakfast. I'll review the lid separately but it fits nicely/tightly; I'd recommend a lid for use outdoors so as to reduce odor and discourage vermin. My indoor pests, which we just shorten to ""pets"", are equally stymied.-- Appearance? This won't win any interior design awards but if you've read this far, you're not after frou frou. It's a nice smooth finish w/o plastic-y frayed bits and has fortifying ridges at the base. The can's ""Brute"" moniker is a way too visible for my taste--tho it does accurately describe its owner on his worst days-- but we've well established my tastes are irrelevant since my husband actually chose 'toxic waste' as part of his his design story.--Balanced? Very! Sturdiness is great and all, but bins are still prone to topple if poorly designed. This container, on carpet, can survive the across-the-room-over-the-coffee-table 3-point shot without tumbling over. Ray Allen would approve!Not in any way as disposable in quality as the trash it holds, if this solid, easy-to-care for, and reasonably priced bin can survive my man's test lab of a man cave, it should last years at your house too. If it was self-emptying, it would be just about perfect. In yellow, at least it'll get emptied once or twice a decade as it's real hard to miss!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3RE70QVI2BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KDALYC#wasThisHelpful","R1K3RE70QVI2BM","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because I'm prone to be high strung, I've always found this reversal on the infamous WWII English poster ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" a more accurate and amusing reality.But on the day of my purchase, no dimensions were listed so I had to order in the dark. I wanted to hang this on an area of my wall that had limited space; poking around, I did manage to locate the dimensions of its sister sign but I just hoped I could keep calm if it arrived grossly undersized or laughably gigantic......it did not. It's conveniently sized at 7"" W x 13"" H x 1-3/4"" D.The soft white lettering is clear and visible from a nice distance. The dark charcoal/off black color shows up nicely on my light walls. The finish/font is meant to look a little weathered but this is not an intentionally 'pre-distressed' piece and the print is smooth to the touch. Thank goodness.The wooden box frame is substantial and crafted beautifully; everything is cut correctly, centered properly, etc. Great construction!There's no wall mount hardware but because the frame is open in back, it hangs easily and securely on a single long nail. It's sturdy enough that it could rest against a wall or sit on a dresser, too.Nothing about this sign makes me panic or freak out. It's just very well made and a pleasant surprise considering the very reasonable price point. I've seen similar signs at 3X the price at trendy shops.This a whimsical reminder that outside times of true crisis, some of us--heck, more than may like to admit to it--are wired a wee bit differently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3239ZIWN0CIHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FQZRCC#wasThisHelpful","R3239ZIWN0CIHZ","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a brand that typically churns out high quality items, I was quite disappointed in this frame.It fits an 8X10 print with a few mm to spare. The wood is of decent quality and cut smoothly. I love the baby pale pink color; it's very charming. The glass is not very thick but fits the frame correctly.Total outside dimensions: 13-1/2"" X 10-1/2""The frame arrived in a gigantic cardboard tray with cardboard corners, but not sealed in plastic. So beware if considering it as a gift. Unfortunately, probably due to the lack of a plastic wrapping (by the manufacturer, not Amazon), my frame arrived marred. A nice big blue smudge with an accompany scratch greeted me, right snack dab on the woodwork.I purchased this to hang vertically, as the description says a wall hanger is included. But a good inch of the black easel is visible when hung on the wall. Not a good look to see it poking out.Because there's no civilized or practical way to remove the easel without permanently damaging it, I had to rip it off. So once you've opted to use it as a wall mount, commit fully. This is obviously a non-issue if you plan to only use it in easel mode, but at this price point and based on the claim it's mountable, versatility is expected.The backing is just a cheap poster board material with only 2 clips to hold the backing in place; I have spent far less for frames that provide several clips and that include a velvet or higher quality back.  Additionally, the wall mount rings are the sort you find on frames from the big box discount store--you can bend them with your finger.Feel like a sucker for paying what I did. Because the dimensions are so large, the price may be justified, but many of the materials leave much to be desired and have a disposable quality.A truly high quality frame must not only look presentable from the viewpoint we all see, but also on all the parts we don't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KQYXYERKLSST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B5ECR8S#wasThisHelpful","R2KQYXYERKLSST","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mobile of choice is an iPhone 4S. Does this little bean bag securely hold it? Yes, barely. And with limitations.I always use my phone in portrait mode. So naturally I propped it up in the beanbag that way. However, all sounds and tones are completely, fatally muffled in portrait. This is obviously less an issue when placed in landscape, but hey, everyone uses their phone differently and I'm unapologetically a portrait gal.I purchased this to place on my vanity and to use only for a few minutes a day; in the mess of the loose mineral makeup I wear, I needed some kind of perch to keep my phone safe for when it invariably interrupts me. But to use this for daily, frequent use? No can do.The base of the bag doesn't have any texturing or grip so if you're in a rambunctious household, the bag is so lightweight it's easily toppled. Personally, I wouldn't use this while charging.It's cute enough, I ordered in the lovely grass green. But the attached tags, sewn into a seam, are HUGE. And I fear if I remove them (under penalty of law and all) that it will permanently damage the bag. So I have to tuck them under the base; it's rather unsightly.Because beanbags are so malleable, and this truly is just a miniaturized version of the real thing--thus all the ""We're using it as Barbie furniture"" comments--I like that I can fiddle and press at it to create the ideal pillow for my phone. But it's that same malleability that makes it less than ideal for heavy use.Once the manufacturers weight this down, add a few inches to accommodate the larger screen sizes of non-Apple smart phones, add some simple non-slip material, and tweak the ginormous tags, I think this could make for a dandy storage solution...But with all those needed edits, this feels more like a novelty. I hope they go back to  the drawing board tho.

"I purchased this to affix to a mannequin head as part of an art installation. I'd gladly have tried it on my self, but since I didn't want to be picking silver glitter out of my hair and scalp for days, I passed.On arrival, I found it crammed inside a thin plastic wrapper, stapled shut--the sort of packaging reserved for cheap toys and made in China party favors. Probably because it IS an item you'd buy on the bargain aisle of a party warehouse.The glitter was my real problem; it scatters everywhere and I'd made the mistake of opening it on my bed. I sleep like a fairy princess now as I swear cheap glitter never truly goes away!The hat and headband are separate pieces. There's two crude slits on the flat base of the hat; the hat isn't hollowed out like a 'real' hat. The headband is wrapped in a satin-like light sliver fabric. Be very careful threading the headband through the slots; I felt like I might be crushing the hat in the process.Once on the headband, you can adjust the angle of the hat however you like. I opted for it cocked extremely to one side as it would be (even more) ridiculous to wear it straight up. My mannequin has standards!The veil is detachable; if desired, it can be affixed to the band of the hat via a strip of Velcro. There is also a single string of silver sequins on the hat brim.The veil measures 8"" wide by 9"" highThe diameter at the base of the hat is 5-1/2"". The top of the hat is 3-1/2"" at its widest.For a single night's use at a costume party, this may be hardy enough to don. For my mannequin perched 9 feet in the air, it will definitely do. But to repeatedly adjust on one's head, handle frequently, and then find a glitter-friendly area to store it, all without crushing it? Um, NO. I got a real belly laugh from the ""dry clean only"" instructions listed in the online description.The price? Well in terms of hats and paper currency, it's a good Abraham Lincoln too steep. We're talking cents of materials here: a thick cardboard hat that won't live long.  But the glitter is forever.It's a cheap prop and that's how I used it.

"I needed a collar for use in an art installation; my purchase was NOT for use on a dog.  However...As a lifelong pet lover who has 3 dogs snoring it up on my bed as I type, I've learned that many collar companies tend to confuse things by how they list collar dimensions. So in case you're new to the game: determine if they only offer a measurement from end-to-end (total length) rather than the measurements for an actual neck size (how it fits buckled).But on the day of my purchase, BOTH sets of measurements were listed so there shouldn't be any confusion or ""this doesn't fit"" issues. My own tape measure confirms: this will fit a neck size of 11-14"".As for the material itself, this is just ""PU leather""; in some parts of the world you cannot legally insert the word 'leather' into a PU product because it's such a misrepresentation. This collar, like most all PU is a split/bycast leather that's smothered in polyurethane and then embossed. So it does feel a bit stiff. The good news is PU won't stretch out as much as genuine full leather, it's super easy to clean, and pretty darn durable.The stitching looks decent. The collar has heft. The studs are well done, placed nicely, appear secure, and are pretty shiny. The backside of the studs are smooth, flush, and should not pull out fur. However, the sharpness of the centimeter-long bullet studs that run through the center are disturbingly sharp. Beware. I mean ouch already.Being a multiple dog owner, I personally shudder at the thought of my rambunctious guys roughhousing and poking their eye out on a studded collar. But if you've come to this page  it's safe to say you want your pet to reflect a certain image...and this collar will do it!A tad over priced considering the materials, potentially dangerous depending on your particular breed/its lifestyle, and, like most collars with ornamentation designed to fit a range of necks, the studs will look off center if you fasten it on the loosest notch. But the color is true to the online image, the dimensions accurate, and since genuine leather studded collars go for 3X the price, if you're in need of this style collar, I'd offer an anemic recommendation as PU has its benefits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TCWG211CQWTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009BD81VM#wasThisHelpful","R1TCWG211CQWTM","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really sweet, well crafted oval glass knobs. Something about an oval shape makes them seem a bit more special than a boring ole round option.They have a decent heft, arrived with no chipping or flaws, and have a nice vintage look. The listed dimensions are completely accurate and the hardware is quality; installation was a breeze. They feel sturdy in the hand when opening a drawer. I'm impressed. But...Unfortunately, the pink knobs I received are not even remotely as pink as the online images. I know computer monitors can display inaccurate colors from time to time, but every pink knob style offered by this manufacturer is shown to be a lovely carnation pink--not a terribly bold 'in your face' pink but it indeed registers as a definite PINK. Perhaps professional lighting was used for the photos, but on my goldish-beige vanity drawers these barely reflect as pink... they're that faint. From across the room, and with every lamp turned on, these are so very pale. I was hoping the light would play off them and draw out the pink but....nope.The little raised dots that line the outside of the knob don't have as much dimension in person as in the photos. There's no satisfying visual contrast between the center convex and the edge work; it kinda just all runs together.So if you are after a REALLY pale, baby pink with mere a hint of color, these would be ideal. I needed 12 knobs but only ordered a 4-pack to see how they'd look. I'm keeping them but won't be ordering the rest as I was hoping they'd offer a real pop of color.

"I ordered this sweet little basket along with another so called 'shabby chic' utensil caddy from a different manufacturer. I just left a scathing review for the caddy as it was the worst that shabby chic has to offer. (Lately it seems shabby chic is term they just slap on any cheaply made and sloppily distressed item to make it sound more desirable).Thankfully, this basket is VERY well made and a convenient size for displaying a myriad of treasures. The metal finish, tho it appears 'aged' or like a relic of a bygone era, is completely even throughout and not remotely ""rusty"" as one reviewer experienced. It may be small, but it's sturdy!The listed dimensions are accurate. I'll add that each 'square' of the lattice is a half inch by a half inch. So only super tiny things could fall out.It doesn't have any loose bits or twisted wire pieces that could snag you or your things. It also doesn't give my fingers that awful, dirty metallic odor that comes from handling similarly crafted items.Rather than just glued on, the handles are carved out to accommodate the wire that curves around them; they're sturdy and smooth.This would make an ideal receptacle to present bath soaps, a practical storage option for garlic or dried herbs, or, in my case, to set on a vanity to hold various cosmetics. One reviewer mentioned using it to hold wooden eggs. This would make an adorable Easter basket for a sophisticated tween.If this was on a shelf at any boutique or knickknack shop, I'd expect to literally pay 2X more. I'm tickled pink; I didn't expect to feel so giddy over a silly basket but this one turned out to be especially appealing.

"This mustachioed fella makes a pretty nifty wall hook, plus it's of a substantial weight. And in a world replete with flower/butterfly/bird hooks, it's nice to find a whimsical piece that isn't so girly. The super flat finish stands out nicely in a sea of glossy hooks without looking too utilitarian and bland. Long live the mustache!A lot of reviewers overlooked the dimensions and were surprised at how teeny this guy is. But guess what? The hook I received IS smaller than the listed measurements. Nerd that I am, I whipped out the tape measure and sure enough, it barely made it to 3"". True, a half an inch is no big deal, but I'm persnickety about accuracy; it's an already small piece crafted even smaller than claimed.Hardware isn't included but you can play around with the screw tops to give this gentleman an ""iris"" of any color.Though it's cast iron, I was surprised to see mine had a serious gnawed looking bit on one of the eyes--like someone scraped part of it out. Again, no biggie, but if I was giving it as a gift I'd have to return it. The piece comes boxed so I don't blame the seller/shipper, it's probably a manufacturing issue. So be aware that this kind of design, in this particular material, is not likely to look perfect each time it's cast.I mounted mine my pretty high up on the wall to use with shirt hangers; if it was at eye level, the imperfections might perturb me...but its overall charm wins out.

"I purchased this to drape over an antique mirror I have hanging in my vanity/dressing area. I was going for a cheesy boudoir look...and this boa achieved it!When I first opened the package to pull it out, I got a fistful of feathers. A bad sign. However, because I'm not actually planning to wear this, a bit of shedding is no big deal and to be expected with any cheap boa. It's essentially a novelty piece; if you need it for a one time only costume party, great. If you're a nightly burlesque artist, safe to say you have your own supplier. This isn't great grandma's heirloom boa so my rating is based on getting what I expected in a few cents worth of Made in China materials.The color is really gorgeous; it's a deep, rich saturated teal--more blue than green. It's accurately named as teal is sometimes misidentified.The ""45 gram"" weight meant nothing to me as I wasn't quite sure how heavy I needed or anticipated this boa to be. For the novice like me: it's heavier than those little girl dress up boas that are all fluff; it's definitely lighter and less dense than what was wrapped around Mae West.It's 2 yards but not exactly 6 feet as the dangling feathers aren't an exact science. It's actually softer than I was expecting so that made up for the feather loss. Handled gently, I expect this to last a long time...and I expect it to be self dusting too. No?I'm tickled enough with it to explore other colors; lately I can't seem to get enough frou frou and this makes me smile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVBQGS1T6XAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UZ9QIA#wasThisHelpful","R2FVBQGS1T6XAU","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this to place on my vanity to use as a little carousel for cosmetic items like lip liners and mascaras. I was really exited to start using it and tickled pink that the particular seller I purchased from had wrapped it in girly tissue and even included candies. But that's where the fun ended.The finish is a disaster. I'm quite fond of shabby chic but unfortunately not all shabby chic is created equal. This is all shabby and no chic...The oyster colored paint, already chipped and weathered, would have been perfectly adequate; the addition of a truly ugly shade of dark brown paint, smudged here and there was one step too many. However, what really did me in was the ""rust"" effect. It seriously looks like someone squeezed on Elmer's glue and then sprinkled it with paprika. It's truly bizarre! This orange 'powder' technique, I can only assume, is to mimic the flakes of genuine rust. Just comical. And you can't make it out in the images.If you can get over the finish, stability is a real issue. Mind you, I'm using this to hold very lightweight items. If you plan on placing actual quality flatware in the 4 baskets, eh, be very careful to balance the weight equally. My piece is held together with a screw and doesn't sit flush.It's possible I received a rather poorly made one, but looking at the reviews for the exact same caddy in the silver/pewter finish, I see I'm not alone in my complaints with stability.For the sake of being thorough, here are the measurements:7-3/4"" W and D, 10-3/4"" HThe individual baskets are 2-1/2"" at the base by 3-1/3"" at shortest H and 7-1/2"" at tallest H.The scrolled metal work itself is decent enough, tho flimsy, and the cottage-y look would have been awfully sweet if they'd not fussed with the awful distressing process. It's not technically defective so I'm keeping it only because I'm too lazy to return it and would be stuck w/return postage.The description claims this is like a ""antique shop find'. Um, not even close. Except for the antique shop price tag!","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BWYG8UWZ5KGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LIWIWY#wasThisHelpful","R3BWYG8UWZ5KGB","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm fond of unusual knickknacks AND a total shoe-aholic. So when I spied this this little brass piece, I knew it would be a perfect addition to my vanity table; it's a really creative way to store my bobby pins.First, it's teeny. I mean if you're a smoker, don't expect to stuff more than a couple of butts in here. It measures 4"" L x 1"" W x 1"" D. See what I mean? Tiny. But that's why I love it. As a functioning ashtray, though it does have a carve out to rest a cigarette, I can't see it being too practical.The shoe was packaged securely and very well bubble wrapped. (Being brass, I wasn't fearful of damage during shipment, but I always appreciate any seller's effort toward proper packaging.) The product looks identical to the online image.The piece is quite heavy for just 4 inches! It would make a nice paper weight too. It's a slipper but not a slip of a thing,The inside of the shoe--mind you this intended for use as an ashtray--is a little tarnished and dirty. I'll polish it out before use, but this an import item and reflects that.I'm really pleased to add this to my collection--another tangible reminder that a girl can't have too many shoes!

"A former problem drinker, my sobriety, while a blessing, left me weary of Diet Cokes, club soda, and cranberry juice. I don't particularly love health smoothies and I can't drink coffee. Most restaurants are woefully unprepared to serve up virgin drinks much beyond kid's stuff or sugary pre-mixes. As I already had all the tools of the trade, I decided to entice my tastebuds right here at home.To best enjoy this title (and really any other virgin drinks books) you should be prepared to:--Already own or be willing invest in essential bar tools (A shaker, zester, strainer, and blender are the items I reach for the most.)--Understand you may spend a tad more than you'd hoped liquor-free drinks would actually cost. Just because you don't need booze doesn't mean fresh fruit/herbs, tea, etc., are cheap.--Experiment with ingredients that may be unfamiliar and visit shops off the beaten path.--Possess a little patience for allowing refrigeration times, infusions, etc., and of course a sense of adventure with new flavors.So now that we've covered that, don't feel discouraged as there are PLENTY of recipes here that don't require more than a regular ole glass, a quick trip to any supermarket, and literally 3 minutes to create!!The book is separated into sections for fruit drinks, hot drinks for winter, dairy, etc. I particularly appreciate that the hardback edition has a spiral binding as the other alcohol-free recipe books I own* do not--and frankly that's a hassle (and potential mess) unless you have a book easel.Of the recipes I've tried, very few are clunkers and the instructions are easy to follow; I don't cook so I cannot understate how vitally I require clear, simple language. I'll whip you up a drink, but I'm very kitchen-challenged. The author hasn't given me too much over my head.There are ample full page photos but there isn't a photo for each drink--so you can use your imagination when it comes to garnish/serving. This isn't all ""Martha Stewart-y"" where you'll feel easily shamed at your results.I've ended up pairing ingredients I never would have dreamed up on my own. The results: delicious. There's truly something for everyone. There's a few here that I'll literally be making for a lifetime, they're that tasty. Other offerings have a more novelty appeal.There does seem to be an abundance of recipes with Indian-centric ingredients and spices; I happen to live in an area where those are readily offered and not considered exotic, but unlike my other drink books, this title does seem to really emphasize Indian flavor profiles.There are also a lot of vegetable-based drinks which aren't my particular thing but if you're health conscious, you'll be in heaven. This is NOT a ""add 4 cups of sugar"" title. There's guilty pleasures, yes, but the bulk of recipes are not syrupy horrors.Most of the recipes serve 2, so thankfully (for me anyway) this isn't too punch-heavy or all pitcher drinks intended for batches; fractions ain't my thing. Though just about all the recipes can be modified for 1 or for entertaining.I'd recommend this title to anyone who is bored of the same old same old and is willing to put just a little effort into exciting their taste buds. But this isn't the most ideal book for someone looking for ginger ale based punches, considers paprika to be exotic, or anyone on a super tight budget.*Last month I purchased 4 alcohol-free beverage recipe books. Along with this title I bought ""Zero Proof"" by Scott, ""Ultimate Liquor-Free Drink Guide"" by Herbst, and ""Green Tea"" by Heiss--all titles available here on Amazon. Each guide has something different to offer, but this offering is a great choice, second only in recipes to ""Zero Proof"" which I'll review separately.But this is an EXCELLENT choice for both the amateur mixologist and veteran alike. It will take me months to create all the recipes, but I'm grateful a good 70% of them are drinks just about everyone can be excited about. Plus this offers a lot of actual info on how to whip up just about any conceivable type of virgin beverage. Recipes w/o practical guidance are kinda useless for me, but straight info w/o yumminess is pointless too. This succeeds at both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G3VIM03V798Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936140780#wasThisHelpful","R1G3VIM03V798Z","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first spied this tropical wristlet back in the Endless.com days (a moment of silence, please) when it was going for original retail price. Unlike the reviewer who stated this is crafted from ""rich leather""--I wish!!-- it's just PVC....so I couldn't justify the price. But now that it's much more reasonable, it can perch on my wrist!Though the outside is plumed and fabulous, the actual capacity is dinky dink. I typically carry the kitchen sink but afterall, this isn't intended as an everyday bag. But just know that if you sport an iPhone in a giant bunny ears case, don't expect to fit much else in here. It's just a very snazzy lipstick, cash and ID holder.The zipper action is good; like most Betsey stuff the quality is pretty decent. The strap is secure...I always worry about hitting the town wearing a wristlet because I'm paranoid the strap will break or the contents will just fall out. This is indeed light weight but substantial enough that you feel you're carrying an actual bag.I'm not positive, but I think this bag made have been manufactured by Betsey before the Steve Madden buy-out. If so, I love it just a teensy bit more. The colors pop, it's buttery (for PVC) and I happen to like little Toucan Sam touches in my life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DRRDG4MJBB4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T2WI5C#wasThisHelpful","R3DRRDG4MJBB4K","A3DE0SNPHU1RZG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DE0SNPHU1RZG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am one of those people that like fruitcake and not specialty ones, just the classic dark ones. I will say the ad for this was good and perhaps set my expectations too high. Overall it was actually bland, especially the candied fruit, almost flavorless. The cake is a little light for fruitcake also bland and lacked that rich taste, it was too dry. It also needed more nuts, more fruit and better quality fruit.Given how small it is, and it is small, I actually had a half inch slice left over and that is very rare for me, I tend to nibble on it between slices until its reduced to a few crumbs.For the cost I expected a lot better, I'll go back to the ones in a tin can from the supermarket next year.Could not recommend to anyone but will say it does not taste bad it is just not good.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BQQQISF6NTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NDXOYS#wasThisHelpful","R29BQQQISF6NTA","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has worked very well in the week or so I have had it, it charges 3 batts as fast as 1, 3 batteries is all I have so until more batts show up 3 is the most I can do right now.What I like is that it has all of the protections you need, over-charge and shorting so you can just hook them up and forget about them until your next flight. I also like how it gives you a positive indication when any given battery is fully charged, the LED for that port turns off and you know it is ready. The one thing I wish it had was a conditioning cycle but I knew it didn't when I bought it so no points off.So far it seems to give each battery a full charge, in fact, I get about 1 minute more flight time than with the charger that came with my quadcopter.You do need to have a USB power source and while you could use your computer I don't think that is the best way, PC USB ports vary in what they can handle and it is also dependent on what else you have plugged into your USB ports. I got a very cheap 21W USB power supply to go with this, it also has protection in it in case this box shorts or pulls too much current.The description says it comes with 4 adapter jumpers but it comes with 5 as pictured as well as the USB cord.I have a UDI 818A Quadcopter and the batts that go with it and this has worked out very well.Pros:Charges 5 Batts in the time of 1Over-Charge Protection (no need to babysit it)Short circuit Protection -- Nice with the stories of batts swelling, leaking and even catching on fire per Amazon reviewsPositive indication when charge cycle is overComplete charge, I got an extra minute on average, which is about 20% longer.Cons:Needs external power from a USB port or charger (although most people have at least one USB charger)No conditioning cycle to restore battsI would easily recommend this to a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y10S77P7W6GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QHUONLE#wasThisHelpful","R2Y10S77P7W6GA","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This quickly reminds you how well things Made in the USA can be. When my can opener of 40 years finally needed replacing I did not think twice about and just picked one up from the supermarket which lasted less than a year and was never very good to start with. This is the same sturdy construction as my last good one, they are heavy and clearly made with quality steel.This goes through any can lid like a hot knife through butter and really grabs the can, I have not had one walk-offs as I call them when the opener loses its grip and walks off the edge making to reengage it. It so far has easily punctured every can I have tried so far on the first try.

"I looked for a while before selecting these knives, and not that I have been using them a few weeks I can say I am pretty happy with the set. My set came in perfect condition and the block is very nice, much smaller footprint than my old one so I get a little bit of counter space back. The scissors are pretty handy with jar opener in the handle, flat screwdriver type end and a can opener on the handle end, the scissors are sharp and cut well.Now for the knives, because of my last set I am already in the habit of rinsing and wiping dry after each use so I have no issues with rusting as I saw in a couple reviews, mine came very sharp and seem to be holding the edge reasonably well, like a lot of good knives it does not hurt to hit it with a few swipes on the sharpening stick, again force of habit, I have been still doing that every few uses/The knives have a good feel, not too heavy and certainly not cheesy feeling (think Ginsu) I would put them just one notch down from my older Cutco knives in feel. The lengths and types are just right, nice serrated blade for bread and such, 2 butcher style, one with the little indents that I assume are so potatoes and things like it  don't stick to the blade,  and it sort of works, the other is a smooth blade, classic butcher style.I think the price / performance is perfect on these, not too expensive in cost and not too cheap in the product, I would recommend these to a friend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137XVZ0E0C63F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RL9EU2#wasThisHelpful","R137XVZ0E0C63F","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a major disappointment, my fault for not reading the reviews first. I was very much anticipating this figuring how could I go wrong with Amish Country, their Apple Butter and outstanding. Well they seemed to use the same approach on the pie filling, it was pureed, pure mush with no pieces of rhubarb or strawberry.There is also zero zing to the filling, no real hint of rhubarb at all but oddly not too sweet. Given all of the trouble it takes to make a pie, 10 extra minutes to cut up some real rhubarb when in season is the way to go but I was hoping this would be good out of season. The ad for this should say it is mush with no pieces intact, much like orange juice tells you the pulp content these days. I think everyone pretty much knows the texture and consistency of rhubarb pie and this was way off the mark, enough to rate mentioning.Thankfully I used a Marie Calendar crust, had I made a crust from scratch I would be really unhappy, the crust was clearly the highlight of that pie. If you are looking for real rhubarb type pie filling look somewhere else, you will be disappointed with this for sure.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQMYDSXL01QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037QWTS0#wasThisHelpful","RNQMYDSXL01QO","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not sure what to expect, after reading a lot of reviews I picked this as the price and features were about right for something I might destroy on my first try. I have no experience with RC cars, planes, or other devices, this is my first remote controlled vehicle but I have used game controllers so the controls were not that hard to pick up.I fired 818A up after charging the battery and just had a blast! It was a lot easier to control than I had expected from the reviews, I had to start in my basement, was very windy and dark out when it was ready to try. It took just a few minutes to get it to reliably hoover but I had to keep adjusting it to keep it in the same spot, I used the trim to take most the drift out but it still drifted a little but was easy enough to control. I manage to do a level flight 360 turn (not flip), but took a 360 degree video of my basement, it looked totally cool on the video.Making your first goal to attain level stable flight really lets you get a feel for the controls without much risk of breaking anything, once I could hold it in a spot then I tried cruising it around, again it is not hard to get the basics, just remember to just kill power if you lose control, at 4' off the floor dropping does not hurt it at all.I had bought and charged 2 extra batteries and was getting 5 - 8 minutes per battery but this is because I was not running it hard, the basement area is 20 feet by 14' with 7' ceiling, most of the time the power was around 30%. The next thing I plan to do is get a few more batteries.As I noted the video was great, it was night and I was in the basement with just the basement lights on and it captured pretty good video.When I first unboxed it, I was pretty worried it was going to break easily, it feels really flimsy, as it turns out this is an strength, everything flexes and bends easily, which comes in really handy as you bounce it off wall, the ceiling, and everything else in range, drop from 7 feet landing upside down on a concrete floor, no problem, just flip it over and go again.I really took some good crashes and not even the propellers broke, so over all I am totally happy with this and it gives you enough ""feel"" for the hobby to know if you want to drop a grand or more on a more professional grade quadcopter.Pros:- Easy for first timer to fly- Very durable- Comes fully assembled- Can be flown indoors provided you have at least a 10'x10'x6' clear area, I typically hovered at about 4 feet- Spare parts and batteries readily available, this model is for sale everywhere so you can get parts locallyCons:- Battery life, plan on 5 or so minutes, so get several- Trim Control on remote needs to be done every time you turn it on, no way to save it- Manual is a joke -- But has all key info to get it going- Power Charger does not work like the manual says, on mine a red light means it is chargedI would easily recommend this quadcopter for first time flyers, love the size and stability in still air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYTSINNYU7YY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3IN11Q#wasThisHelpful","R1SYTSINNYU7YY","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are working with SMD's this is a very good tip for spot work and clean-up. I still prefer a wider blade tip for most smd work, I use the smear and hope approach to soldering them in, that is, I preheat the pins and then drag a flat blade tip down the pins. Most of the time that woks perfectly but occasionally it leaves bridges between pins and that is where this time comes in handy. It is small enough to heat just one or 2 pins and I used this tip on my solder remover.This time is also good for any fine / small component work, smd or through-hole. It is not as good on larger parts like relay or switch pins, 1W and larger resistors, and other parts with a lot of bulk to them, the tip is too small to hold the heat, I took no points off for this because I knew it going in and did not get it for big parts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R87AKZGJLFQOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007IS2IW#wasThisHelpful","R87AKZGJLFQOC","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been helping a kid fairly new to electronics get a good base collection of parts, this kit is well priced for the selection and it is a good selection that will have the right value caps for all but bigger electrolytic caps. If you are planning projects like power supplies, higher power audio amps, or even 555 circuits where an electrolytic cap is used in an RC network for timing you'll need to augment this kit with some bigger ones.Other than that this has any cap you'll generally need and each value is packed in labeled re-sealable pouch that can be used for years and just refill as needed but have them nicely organized and not need a half a wall of parts bins. Until you get good enough to design around the parts you have or modify designs you find to use them, having a good selection is key to quickly building most of the vast number of published schematics on the net.You can put together your own collection easy enough but unless you are buying a lot, it will be hard to beat the price, I would easily recommend this to anyone starting out, and then hit places like Goldmine Electronic for surplus cap grab bags to refill this kit as you use them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KKT1QQ59G501/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SVHFXO#wasThisHelpful","R1KKT1QQ59G501","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I downloaded the latest drivers as they suggested and then plugged it into a USB port on my Lenovo ThinkPad running Win7 64-bit and it just jumped to life, no messing around at all. They supply the drivers on a DVD so you can get them if you don't have a connection yet, I had a wireless to grabbed them from the web site.It had no issues playing Windows Media Center recorded TV files (WTV) from my home network, far better than the wireless does. Also copying 3-4GB WTV files from the network to the laptop was noticeably faster than wireless from the same laptop.Hard not to be happen with it, has network and traffic LED's, is compact and good for travel and best of all just worked out of the box.I would easily recommend this to anyone that needs and easy to install and fast Ethernet to USB adapter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDMVA3IBGMNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQM8586#wasThisHelpful","R1SDMVA3IBGMNZ","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overview --I amazed at how slow this is compared to my prior Panasonic model the BDT-210. I got this as I am always looking for faster with Blu-Ray, specifically load to play and navigating. The BDT-210 was such an amazing improvement over the Panasonic I had prior to that so when the BDT-330 touting fast loading and navigation I when in with high expectations.These expectations were lowered to, wonder if it will ever play the disc upon loading the first disc, Gravity in 3D. My expectations were lowered some already from navigating during set-up and then looking to see what might be new over the BDT-210, the menu performance is outright sluggish, enough so that I found myself pushing the button again.Pro's --- It works is the best accolade I can give it.- Set-up was easyCon's --- Slow loading, takes over twice the time as the BDT-210 to load the same disc- Menu navigation, also very very slow- Smart Apps, you guess it, slooooooow- Popping when audio changes- HDMI CEC Turns stuff on randomlyThe defining attribute of this unit is that it is really slow, sorry to have repeated it so many times this early in the review but this is like 2 generations behind in speed. The other thing I did not like was when audio types change, like through the previews or any menu with a sound track it produces a nasty switching pop.For the rest of the review just assume whatever is discussed unless I say otherwise, is slow :)Set-UpSet up for me was a breeze, but this is my 3rd Panasonic Blu-Ray so I am very accustomed to their ""style"" which is a little different in like selecting option to change, still pretty easy. I let it go wireless first, it had no issues at all, when it found my network if popped up a keyboard to put in the password. For wired network, it just required clicking OK when it was done.The set-up wizard makes set-up pretty easy and given this is HDMI only it should always get what it is hooked to right.RemoteSmall but has all of the keys you use often in good spots and one press. Range is really good, I use it from 12 feet away.Smart Features:It is fully loaded with the typical smart apps, a browser, huluplus, Netflix, Twitter, Skype, facebook, YouTube and many others. The ones I tried all worked but I could not really use them as long as everything takes. Once streaming starts it did very well, I have a wired connection and there were no drops or buffering.MiraCast -- The ability to push the picture out to a table or phone is coolDLNA -- Unusable for most video, this is more the nature of DNLA in general but this kind of the worst of the bad but it does work.HDMI CEC --This is one of those wiz-bang that sounds really good on paper, the theory is that you drop in a Blu-ray disc and it turns on the TV if it is not already on and the AV receiver, and selects the correct input on them so you don't have to mess with the remote. This can work very well, but not in this case. I found that with it enabled that after I shut down everything, driven from the TV's CEC and being turned off, that part worked fine but in the next few minutes the 330 would turn on the receiver and sometimes both the TV and receiver, but oddly did not turn itself on... This behavior goes away as soon as you disable HDMI CEC in the settings menu on the 330.Picture  Audio Quality:The video was very good and on par with most players and the 3D was very clean and well done. The 4K up scaling works on some things and not others, like for Top Gun sky scenes it looked really good, like you could see the difference, most of the time on m 55"" Samsung F9000 4K TV, audio to me is not quite right but I can't put my finger on the issue, just seems a little washed out, but what is annoying are the sharp click/pops it makes when the audio changesOnce you get to watching a movie the load and nav slowness are not factors, it of course had no issue playing them, with great video and acceptable audio, Streaming wireless was hit and miss, some streamed just fine, Netflix was the best and most consistent, and YouTube not so much. Wireless is probably fine for a movie but I did not test it long enough to see, I use the wired option and that so far has been flawless.Conclusion -- 2 Star, below average not a good value.If this unit was under 100 bucks I would give it 3 perhaps even 4 stars but at this price it is not a good deal when performance is considered and really that is what you mostly pay for when you go mid-range like this. I would look for another unit and am, this is going back.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPJ06C1PRBX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYB3OOY#wasThisHelpful","RGPJ06C1PRBX8","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been extremely impressed with this power supply, I tested it from fully loaded on all 3 rails to so marginally loaded it could not measure the current draw and it is amazingly stable and very low ripple. I did have to take two stars off for how it handles over current in Constant Voltage mode. I would have to take all stars off but once you know you can protect against its actions.Pro's --- Readout for each Voltage and Current for both variable supplies (0 - 30VDC / 0 - 5A)- Voltage Stability under varying load- Ripple under all loads was significantly lower than the specs- Flexibility, being able to put them in series, parallel, or independently adjustable is great, doubles the output (0 - 60VDC @ 5A in series and 0 - 30 at up to 10A in parallel.Cons --- When current limit is hit voltage erratically drops to zero, no over current indication, so this is short protection only- Voltage and current adjustments are touchy, a fine adjustment would have been nice- Noisy when adjusting voltage, relays clacking all the time until you are dialed in- Manual, barely covers the basics and covers so many models it is hard to fish what applies to whatThis thing is a real beast measuring about 15"" long, 10"" wide and 6"" high and build like a brick you know what, weighing in at a tad over 20 pounds. That is actually a great attribute, it takes beefy parts to do this job right, and good power supply should be heavy and big.The back is lined top to bottom with massive heat sinks for the regulators and though the vent slots you see a massive toroidally wound transformer that is ideally suited for this type of work and partly explains why you can hit with a 10 amp load change and not see the voltage move much at all.I tested this with various resistive and inductive loads (lights and motors) and it was consistent in providing clean DC power with any load type, I was impressed with the inductive load, had a motor that is 4A @ 12VDC and you hit the supply full force that the 12VDC moved 0.2V for about 10mS and was right back at 12VDC. I also saw no noise from the motor on the other two rails, so it must have some nice filtering going on inside.It also has short protection, it says current limiting but this is not really accurate when compared to how a bench supply should work. When my old bench supply see a short it kill the power to that circuit at once, but if the circuit wants a little more current than I have set it for, it warns me with a light that get brighter the more extra current it wants, it does not give that current and does not change the voltage. Just tells me it wants more and then I can decide to give it or not.When in constant voltage mode, the most common mode, you set the volts to say 12VDC and set the current knob to just past the minimum so you know it is limiting to probably less than 250mA, if your circuit, say after a relay engages it wants 300mA instead of telling you it needs more current the voltage erratically drops to 0 and it is slow about doing it and if you were working on a circuit sensitive to this then the smoke will escape and it will stop working, just as always happens when the smoke escapes from electronic stuff. When I breadboard something I generally keep the current limited to a RCH over what I know it needs and this way if something goes wrong it usually does not smoke anything since it just can't get enough current, this approach is not really viable with this unit.The only way to protect from this is to just turn the current knob all the way up, but at that point you have no current limiting protection and any mistakes will result in a smoked part. It also give you no way to know how much current it is set for in constant voltage mode, you find out when something uses it, until it uses too much in which case it shuts down. In my case when it got low enough that the relay dropped back out it snapped back to 12VDC and then shutdown again as the relay kicked in, I am sure it would have oscillated like this forever had I not stopped it. For something otherwise designed so well this is really a big miss. What I do now is use a resistor to get the current setting I want, then hook it to my circuit and try to ensure I don't cross it.The other thing that takes a little getting used to is there is no fine adjustment for the current or voltage and getting them exactly where you want takes a bit of playing around.The V & I controls have a nice heavy feel, like a very high quality volume control on AV gear, has that fluid feel. The controls, On/Off, Independent / Series / Parallel, and V / I adjustments are all clear and easy to understand although the manual is confusing on how to best rig it when using it in other than independent mode where it is 3 separate power supplies.The 5VDC rail was very tight, measuring 5.002VDC with no load to 5.028 under a full load, no ripple to speak of.Ascetically, the unit I got had the exact brand name on it as the ad, the unit looks a lot better than the picture, and the LED displays are bright and very easy to read and look way better than the picture. I was surprised at this price how solid and clean everything is from the heavy duty detachable power cord to the terminal posts and the very handy handle on the top.Any hobbyist and most pro's will find this supply meet the demands of most project builds and I find more of my projects these days need more than one voltage, typically 5VDC and something else, like 12 or 9 or 24VDC, prior to getting this I had just a one rail supply and it meant setting it to the highest needed voltage and using like 7805's or 7812's to regulate the other voltages I needed, this takes care of that nicely.I have not popped the cover yet but looking through the vent holes it looks very clean inside, well laid out, good wire management, heavy gauge wire where you would expect it and so on.I can't speak to durability as I just got it, the bench supply I had been using I bought in 1976, and it was used military equipment when I bought it surplus, if this lasts half the time I will be happy! This has all of the apparent attributes, the weight, the heat sinks, transformer that one would expect from a device like this if it is well built, so now time will tell.I would recommend this to strangers and even people I know.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HM2K5WJ7BC3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2EJCH8#wasThisHelpful","R3HM2K5WJ7BC3V","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are well priced and work, but they take a long time to be shipped, in my case a month and I did not notice the ship time, being electronic parts where the norm is overnight or 3 days tops I was not paying attention, my bad.Other then that they seem pretty average and so far the ones I have tried all worked so if you have the time to wait, this is a good buy but if your project is laid out on your breadboard and you need this to finish it up or you need this for a repair you don't want to wait a month for then I suggesting hitting one of the US based parts places.

I only have one light left in the house that is not CFL or LED, I just can't seem to find a color temp in either CFL or LED that does not hurt my eyes when reading (not damage them, just makes them water after an hour or so of reading by them).These came very well packed and I looked at them all, none broken, and they produce that classic incandescent light we all know and love, I can read for hours with no eye strain or watering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2J3F6R66I2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQPXFK#wasThisHelpful","R1E2J3F6R66I2Y","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No matter if you are calibrating you big new TV by eye or with test equipment this is a great disc.Almost all TV's 50 inches or bigger can benefit from some calibration to get a better picture, they often come out of the factory a little on the bright side and the colors slightly tweaked to the blue side as that is more appealing to the eye. To be clear, those that never calibrate still get a very nice picture and this is a value add step not a requirement.For those adventurous or those who want to get more out of their picture this is a great Calibration Disc. It contains detailed instructions for not novice and all of the test patterns needed to tune your picture to reference standards or as close as your TV can get.There are 3 levels of tuning the way I look at it, Basic tuning is just using the common controls, Brightness, Contrast, Color, and Tint, the ""knobs"" all TV's have. This disc will fix you right up and tell you what order to make the adjustments in. Next is Intermediate, where you get into a few more controls to by eye get everything to match what it supposed to look like. Finally there is the Pro tune, this is where test equipment is used to adjust the picture to an objective standard, you can buy or rent the calibration and do it yourself or pay a pro from 300 - 500 to do it (I would advise against hiring a pro unless you are a real purist and videophile, that last ounce of tuning is barely perceivable.No matter which level you are going into this at this disk is one of the best you can get to assit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GPV1MAWNRCWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKWI13O#wasThisHelpful","R3GPV1MAWNRCWR","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really thought I did my homework on this, read the ad, the reviews, looked at other options and it seemed like it was going to be just right so I bought one of the queen sized ones.Holy No Fill Batman, I put it in a new pillow case just right in size, tossed and on the bed for a test drive and the next thing I know my head is enveloped in the pillow, it had sunk so the pillow where the bank of my head met it was compressed all the way to cover touching cover, the two side had wrapped my head and covered both ears.As a estimate I would guess that with 25% more fill this would be outstanding, I crammed another pillow into the same pillow case and that makes it useable.There is nothing ""firm"" about this pillow, it is soft to a fault and I am amazed that anyone could find it comfortable but a lot of folks have so perhaps I got a bad one or just have an entirely different notion of how firm applies to pillows.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNWZ3TKDGR2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMRP9NI#wasThisHelpful","R3DNWZ3TKDGR2F","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:- Picture, just stunning!- Controls, outstanding control of every aspect of the picture- Smart Features great if you have a keyboard- Easy Set-up, it does most of the work- Integration with Home Theater receiver and STB- Built in WiFi and Wired Ethernet- 4 HDMI, 3 USB, 1/1 Component/Shared CompositeCons:- Need a stand as wide as the TV, most of the weight falls on the last 4"" of each end (5 feet)- Internal speakers - this is pretty much the case with any large TV these days- Need a very wide stand, looks good but needs a stand to fit the full width if not wall mounted.- Annoying error screen when switching sources to tell you there is no HDMI signal (can be bypassed at the cost of other features)Overview:The overall 5 rating is based 90% on picture quality, the rest to me is a small part of the decision,  if I add in Sound from the internal speakers and Smart Features and other measures it drops to a 4+,so an outstanding TV. This 64F8500 is at the top of the game in picture quality and while it offers nearly endless tuning options, you are just fine with your eyes and the basic picture controls we all know well;  Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Color, and Tint, and Cell light. The good news is that out of the box you get a stunning picture, and using your preference and eyes you can tune it to your liking just fine so no need to be worried about most of the settings, the factory values are very good. Most are going to be very happy with  some basic adjustments and that will be the last time you need to bother, more on calibration later. When you add in the smart features with the great picture it is hard not to have a smile on your face unless you are watching a sad movie.I have mine on an AV stand, it is not wall mounted but can be with a standard bracket and various styles. I had to get a new stand as this needs to be 6"" side, most of the weight sits on the last 4"" of each end and I don't think it would do well without the ends resting on the stand. The other option is the wall mount it, it has a standard mount so you can buy most any style.Overall this is by far the best Plasma TV I have owned or any kind of TV for that matter, this brings together the best of LCD/LED and Plasma in one set and should hold me over the few years it will take for OLED to get its act together, I saw no material advantage in OLED, not that you can get a 64/65 inch yet. Not only are the prices too high, they still have a lot of bugs to work out, OLED is only for true early adaptors who enjoy the early flaws and all and have a healthy budget.Picture Quality (PQ): 5This to me is the first and most important measure. Out of the box the picture is just plain stunning before messing with any settings and there are 4 picture ""modes"", 6 if you are a little adventurous and care to dive into the ""forbidden"" service menu, the 4 you get are: Dynamic, Standard, Relax, and Movie. Dynamic is typically for use with game consoles or PC's hooked to the TV and on some animated movies like Shrek it can really punch the picture up. Standard covers typical TV viewing, Relax tones things down a little for less eye strain that too bright of a picture can cause (common in LED/LCD sets), and finally Movie which is how Ron Howard thinks it should look :) - this is supposed to align to how the producers wanted it to look. If Ron ever drops by it is nice to know you are all set. Seriously though Movie sets a base line for true reference standards.I found the F8500 Picture after an a few minor adjustments to be as good as the Pani ZT60  for everything from Blu-Ray movies to HDTV from cable, both are just great. There are two places where I think there is a noticeable difference, and to my surprise they were both on the Samsung. The F8500 seems to hold its color better in a room lit well enough to read in, and far better in a sun lit room.  I also liked 3D on the Samsung more than one the ZT60, seemed a lot more vivid.As to the overall picture, you get deep blacks to bright whites, the best whites I have ever seen on a Plasma, true white. The colors look true and I measure that by them not standing out (except where they are supposed to), red things should look red and not make you notice it if you know what I mean. Flesh tones are outstanding, again they look like they should to the point that it does not call your attention to it, they just look right.When watching a blu-ray under darkened conditions the F8500 really starts to show its stuff, when they say a picture tell a thousand words that is an understatement when it comes to the picture and I traded up from a top of the line 50"" Panasonic Plasma. The subtle details add a lot to the movies, things in the shadows to spectacular explosions are the best I have ever seen. As for things like dealing with on-screen motion I have found this to be the best set I have owned so far still not perfect but the best to date.Bottom line on picture quality out of the box just does not get much better than the Samsung F8500 series the colors are vibrant without looking cartoonish, the whites are the best I have ever seen on a Plasma set (finally watched a hockey game where the ice was white and not grayish or bluish and approached that of LCD/LED sets, the black depth allows the subtle shadows to show themselves adding the kind of richness and depth usually only seen at a theater.3D PQ: 5++If you are a 3D fan then I would not even consider the Pani it is just too dark to really get the full impact of 3D, the Samsung being brighter has produced the first 3D I have been willing to watch on my home TV, it is near theater quality, it will make you duck! The TV comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses and additional glasses are reasonably priced. I watched Star Trek - Into the Darkness in the theater 3D and later on the F8500 and WOW is all I can say, while not quite as deep as in the theater I was awed by it, and the most amazing part is how the effects are so clean it does not distract from the movie but adds to as it should.PQ Calibration: 5There are three levels I break picture calibration into, basic settings (brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Color , Tint and Cell Light) adjusting the picture with live content, ie watching TV, this is how most people adjust the picture, then an intermediate level where it is calibrated by eye with a calibration disc like the Disney WOW disc that gives you the test patterns and advice on how they should look and what ""knob"" you need to turn,  and finally the professional calibration that runs from 300 - 600 buck and attempts bring it to a reference standard. The F8500 is a 5 for all three, I did use the Disney WOW on mine after 300 hours of running the TV, but this is not required, I just like to know I am at a good starting point before adjusting to what I like.Sound Quality: 3 (internal speakers) / 5 hooked to a home theaterThe sound is very acceptable out of the internal speakers to watch most TV, but is far from ideal, this really takes a surround bar at minimum or surround AV receiver to pull the best sound out and unlike the professional picture calibration talk, it really does require using external speakers and an AV receiver if you want the sound quality to match the picture, however if you start with just the internal speakers or if you are like me and do not always want to fire up the home theater system, this set has sufficient sound quality to enjoy most TV. For sports and movies it really does pay to add the external audio, it truly makes a noticeable difference. This is the same with any TV, so it is not Samsung specific.Smart Features: 3+This has a ton of smart features and are of the same quality and diversity as any TV in this price range, so if you want to stream movies from Amazon or Netflix or a pile of other streaming services you are all set. The Samsung comes with wireless Ethernet or wired, I found the wireless WiFi to be pretty darn good, watching HD movies from a streaming sources was very good, no lags, artifacts, pauses, blocking or other noise. This depends more on the quality and performance of your wireless router and internet service than on the TV. The best connection for streaming is still a wired Ethernet connection if you can swing it and there are a number of ways you can do this without running wire if you are a little adventurous.Once adding a keyboard (about 30 bucks) the browser goes from virtually useless to acceptable but this is the early days and it will get better over time with firmware upgrades. Bottom line, do not count on this to become you mainstream browser.Count on getting a Bluetooth keyboard if you want to get the most out of the smart features, the remote is only practical for very limited use. One downside, not all Smart Apps work with and external keyboard, I just don't use them, the on-screen keyboard or smart pad is too awkward to be usable.Key smart features include:- Things like, YouTube Facebook, Twitter and Skype that works with the built in camera, apps include a number of streaming services like Amazon Video, NetFlix, and several more, these are app paid services, so you get the app for free but the movies generally cost you (except Amazon Prime of course) Other apps include a mix of paid and free things like Weather, News, games, sports and such. If you use the full TV functions you have a full TV guide and you can play content from a USB stick for Photos, Videos & Music: Play back photo, video, and music. Has a pretty cool camera app, nice field of view.- The DLNA is OK and on par with most DLNA clients but it allows you to stream from any DLNA source you might have, I have it hitting my HTPC for movies and other stuff we have recorded using Windows Media Center and a tuner card. If you have a large collection of movies and tv shows the navigation is pretty rough.- Android App, is very hot, if you have a smart phone or tablet then you can control the TV via a free Samsung app, I use it with a Samsung 10"" Tab that came with the TV and both Samsung's free App but also a few free/shareware apps. A cool feature is the ability to push whatever you are watching from the TV to the tablet or phone, and keep watching from there while you leave the room for whatever reason, then you don't have to pause the show to wait for someone to come back. It does an amazing job pushing the show to the tablet, very smooth and sounds great. There is also a number of cool remote app.Smart Control Features -Controlling the TV by Voice commands and/or motion gestures I put in the novelty section, yes they sort of work and are very impressive when showing this off to family and friends but on a practical level I found them worse than useless, so turned them all off and only use them now when I am doing a gee-wiz demo for folks. Voice triggers too easily, misses too often and after a while feels like it does when trying to direct a 3 year old on what to do, you repeat yourself a lot. The motion controls are just insane in my view, some may like them but I just can't bring myself to sit there flapping my arms around to control the TV, seriously what are folks thinking... The one gesture I am really good at is not very polite and it does not understand it and when it does it turns the volume up :)Operation: 4 (not counting smart control)I measure operation by ease-of-use, when I want to watch TV I like things simple. Samsung now ships this with 2 remote controls, the little Smart Remote and a big ole conventional remote, I prefer the conventional remote for most of what I use but the smart remote is pretty slick also and often best when using the smart features, I just happen to like a real button for selecting and controlling common functions. The on-screen menus are the best I have ever used, they are generally very well placed and sized, as well as ordered in a way puts the things you want most often one click away. It loses a point on the keyboard deal, given that many of the smart features I like are nearly unusable with the on-screen keyboard or gestures on the keypad, I think one needs to be included, sort of like a new car delivered with no tires.This will interface with your cable/Sat set top box (STB) using the included IR (Infra-Red) blaster that you position in front of your STB, I found this to be very reliable but like any IR blaster will sometimes be a little flakey. I would say that it hits 95% on the first try and the 5% it missed it does not do anything, which is good, this is with a Comcast STB.If you are using an AV receiver for your audio the Samsung will integrate with most newer receivers and allow you to control it thought the Samsung remote, at least for volume and channel, offering a simpler operation experience in not having to juggle remotes, but don't count on getting rid of the AV receiver remote, it is not that complete. You can put the STB remote in a drawer if you use the IR Blaster that is included, so one less thing to mess with while watching TV.It can be a little flakey when using the integrated control to the receiver, I use it with a Sony STR-DA1800 and 99% of the time it is fine, 1% of the time it gets confused and turns off the receiver, or will no longer adjust the volume, but for me it is rare.Final Thoughts:I would easily recommend to friends and if I had to make the decision again today, this is the set I would buy to hold me over until they get the issues worked out with OLED. Now after having this for a couple of months I find I never think about the settings, rarely even change picture mode (which is very easy).My Home Theater:Samsung 64F8500 / Sony STR-DA1800 AV Receiver / Infinity 7.1 Surround Speakers / Panasonic Blu-Ray BDT-210 / Comcast HDTV Set-Top / HTPC computer","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKIMT778H2D1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCPH3YS#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKIMT778H2D1","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking to see a Sandra Bullock movie you can skip this one, it seemed that she did. This is basically ripping the cop pairing dynmaic from her Miss Congeniality roles and trying to turn it into an entire movie. I rated it a 2 instead of a 1 because I was able to make to the end, but there was more relief that it was over than anything else.Nothing really works in this movie, unlike the last mis-fit cop pairing, you don't end up liking either one of them, and her partners role is so over the top it is just not believable and it does not help that she is a mix between all of the bad things about Betty White and the worst of Rosanne Barr in one loud mouth person that would never be allowed to stay on any police force, not even in GITMO.Very glad I just rented this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WUTZJY90RKAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4YK53Y#wasThisHelpful","R1WUTZJY90RKAB","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for something to light up the wall behind a 64"" Flat screen TV and this worked perfectly, the ability to lock into a specific color makes it perfect for the job as well as the dimming feature to hit the right light level, since it is LED it does not get hot and can rest on the cables without risk, and when not watching TV it makes a wonderful display in Fade mode going through the rainbow of colors.I am getting 2 more to remove the shadows created by one just one light source.While mine are stashed behind a mountain of electronics, the unit actually looks really great and would look good sitting in view, I also like that it is powered so I do not have to worry about batteries, the construction is also really solid, this is not ""cheap"" looking or in feel.All in all a great little product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JV3DZFM8DSNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054H2BBK#wasThisHelpful","R3JV3DZFM8DSNH","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"- APC J25BNote: I added two Customer pictures for this, one that compares Utility Power to the ACP Power on battery and the second is a picture of the J25B unit with the rest of the Home Theater Equipment.Pros:- 865W UPS is well sized for all but the more extreme Home Theater Systems (you want your average load to be about 1/2 the max, so 432.5W)- Power Conditioner for power plus cable and phone line protection, but also plays well with power conditioners if you have one you want to keep- Home Theater PC Integration (USB) with PowerChute to orderly shutdown your HTPC- Form Factor / Style that compliments Home Theater equipment, looks great with the other components (See Picture)- Information Display with -- Batt Run time at current Load, Current Load in Watts, and input Voltage and Frequency- Dead silent when not on Batts, fan only comes on when the batt is charging or if you are running off of batteryCons:- Display does not actually Dim as the manual and ads say, the only display options are On/Off, when Off you need to hit a front panel button to see it, when it is ON it is at full brightness and is too bright for Home Theater setting, I prefer a true dim option as the rest of the components have.- Stepped sine wave, very well done but still stepped, there are some TV's and receivers that do not work well with stepped sine wave power no matter how well done, APC makes a true Sine wave version of this unit but it is very expensive, I would only get if this impacted your system. (See Picture)Review --Having used APC products for over 20 years both at home and the professional grade gear in our data centers I was glad to see an APC UPS in this form factor/style to fit as a component in a typical Home Theater AV stand. Most of the products are more form over function and I knew there was no way APC would just make something just look good and not still have the APC engineering one expects behind the name. The J25B UPS is classic APC put into an AV gear style case at 17"" wide and just under 4"" high, it looks like the rest of AV components and fits well.I picked the J25B over the J35B because in my opinion less is more when it comes to messing with the power. To adjust utility power means more active parts in the power path, the J25B picks a low and high voltage point and goes on batt, it does not attempt to adjust utility power, less things to go wrong and less things in the main power path. The J25B lets you change the threshold voltage to go on batt and how reactive it should be, I found the defaults just fine.My core components, are a 64"" Plasma TV (Samsung 64F8500) and Sony AV Receiver (STR-DA1800ES) on average runs at about 400W and peaks at 720W so this is just the right size. Watching TV it will give me about 15 minutes, everything turned off about 3 hours, which will more than cover most power outages. The 720W peak leaves plenty of room for transient spikes, the J25B will shut everything off is the things plugged into exceed the 865W it is rated, I have not tested it but from prior experience in computer UPS's, it is pretty quick, enough tolerance for power on spikes and not much more.Overall I give this a solid 4 - The lack of real dimming was worth a point to me as it is designed to be in a home theater where it is important.Note: This is the second unit, the first one I got was bad out of the box, it had a 60 cycle hum any time the power drawn hit 450-500W and by 650W it sounded like something was struggling, I unplugged it and removed the battery, then opened a case with APC and Amazon and they exchanged it with free shipping. I have 2 APC Tower UPS's for computer in our home and have been using their UPS's for years and this was the first that ever had an issue, so I went for an exchange and so far so good, this one is absolutely quiet under any load.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRZ1CXFPGNU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GSLL2E#wasThisHelpful","R1PRZ1CXFPGNU5","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is being used PC that is about 50 feet from living room where we use it (it is a home theater PC). After trying wireless and finding it highly intermittant when it worked at all at 50 feet, I tried this cable to bring the USB port to the living room where we need the remote IR sensor and keyboard to work from and it works great.Given that 50 feet is over 5 times longer than the USB max length of 9 feet for non-powered devices and the IR sensor being senstive it was great to this does exactly was it says it will do.Two notes on installation -- I initially hooked this to a D-Link powered 7-Port hub on the PC side and the cable did not work even though Windows loaded the device driver, I plugged it into a USB port on the PC and it worked. I tried several ports on the Hub and another hub and it did not work unless plugged directly to the PC. This was no big deal, I had a port free, the hub was just easier to get to.Next, put a D-Link 7-Port powered hub on the living room end and plugged the keyboard and IR sensor in and they both work great. So it works fine with a hub on the device side but needs to be plugged directly into the PC on its side.The device driver is the second note, I thought this would just look like a cable and not something the hardware and windows would notice, if you plug in a regular 3 foot USB cable with nothing on the other end, windows nor the PC ""knows"" you plugged the cable in, when you plug this cable in Windows loads a device driver that it already has. I am using Win7 64-bit, I don't know if the cable works without a driver but you might want to check if the USB port you want to extend is not on a PC or Win7. However, like a plain cable it comes with no manual so you have to hunt around to see what it loaded as device drivers (Composit device).As for durability, after testing it out, it survived being pulled 50 feet, and through the computer room and living room floor. I put a cap on the ending before pulling it, I have a cable tray that runs the length between the rooms in the basement so it did not really get stressed on the pull. I will not be unplugging it often but the connectors on both ends are snug like they should be. The cable is not as stiff as I had expected so it made it easier to manipulate routing and dressing. Thankfully the amp is in the last 10 feet on the cable and not in the middle as the picture might imply so I did not need to pull it through.Overall this really worked exaclty as needed and if I ever need another 50 foot USB 2 cable I would get another one.Devices attached: (Win7 OS)- D-Link 7-Port USB2 Powered Hub  - eHomeTheater WMC IR Receiver  - IOGear Wireless Keyboard Receiver","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G1H7VQA9A82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040IG1A6#wasThisHelpful","R39G1H7VQA9A82","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is for the 50 Foot HDMI cable. I had tried a couple others, actually more expensive long cables all with poor results, this has out performed them and at a great price.My set-up is tricky as it is HTPC (nVidia GT 440) I need to drive 50 feet from the computer room to the living room and then it hooks to an AV receiver (Sony STR-DA2800ES) and ultimately to a 64"" Plasma TV (Samsung 64F8500).I sitll needed a in-line amp and used the Tripp Lite 24Hz model and it worked perfectly with this cable, where it did not work with the other cables I ahd tried.

"I must admit I was not holding out much hope for this after trying a couple others and an in-line amp built into the cable and none of them solved the problems. I slapped this on and it cleared up all of the issues, I can play TV, Recorded TV from Windows Media Center, DHCP protected content, streaming programs from Netflix, Comcast, and Amazon and no issues with any source.I have a 50 foot 24 gauge HDMI cable run from my Home Theater PC (HTPC) to my AV receiver (AVR) and it did not work well at all, I would get 3 main errors, DHCP failure, HDMI failures, and sometimes it would not recognize the receiver at all. I am using a 24 gauge HDMI cable. (do not use anything less than 26AWG, most HDMI cables are 28 gauge and will not work well, Tripp Lite sells a pretty good cable.Installation: This is pretty easy, just place it on the end of the long run cable on the TV/AVR side, make sure to have the ""source"" side of this plugged into the long cable, and plug a short cable between the other end and the TV/AVR and plug in the power supply, that is it.Don't bother trying it without the supplied power supply, they say it may not be needed but it did not work at all without it and the LED was on without it, just no signal, as soon as I added this the picture popped right up.The Basic Signal chain looks like this:PC NVidia GT440 Video Board ---> 50' 24AWG HDMI cable ---> Tripp Lite Booster ---> HDMI Detective ---> AVR ---> TVIt says you only need it for 75 feet or longer but they really can't say that as each situation will be different, mine definitely needed it.If you are hooking this to an HTPC you might need an EDID stabilizer.The Gefen HDMI Detective is an expensive little box but it keeps the PC from getting confused when you switch sources on your AVR, no more handshake issues or the PC getting confused due to lost EDID. EDID is the code that the TV or AVR tells the source, in my case the HTPC, what it is and what kind of audio and video it can handle. Anytime this gets lost the devices have to renegotiate and that can take up to a couple minutes and often will not work at all, meaning a reboot.Relevant gear:TV -- Samsung PN64F8500, 64"" PlasmaAVR -- Sony STR-DA2800ESHTPC - HP Pavilion with a nVidia GT440 video card / RealTek HD AudioEDID Stabilizer -- Gefen HDMI Detective PlusHDMI Booster - Tripp Lite B122-000Note 1: On an HTPC running Win7 it can get real confused and if it does you may have to go into the control panel and put your TV/AVR back into the mix, if it does not see them or does not see them right Windows will disable the device, in this case the Audio to the TV/AVR. If all else failed, reboot.Note 2: HDMI is very tricky at any distance over 16 feet, much depends on how it was implemented in each device in the signal chain, not all HDMI were created equal. There is no sure thing, this may or may not work for your situationNote 3: If you plan on hooking this to a Blu-Ray player I suggest you get the next model up, this only supports 24Hz, not 60Hz. In my use I did not need 60Hz, everything is off the PC and I do not play Blu-Ray from the PC.Warning: While HDMI is technically ""hot-pluggable"" I strongly suggest powering down the devices while messing with the cables, otherwise you risk frying something (low risk but risk none the less) and if nothing get fried, your PC will get real confused.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KM5QAVZ0HNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N5YF9Y#wasThisHelpful","R18KM5QAVZ0HNT","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is rare I find something as bad as this, it has every fault IR can have in one nice package.The first issue is that both the reveiver (side you are on) and the transmitter (whatever you what to control side) are highly sensitive to any RF interference, this includes Cell phones, WiFi, within 3 feet of a typical computer, or anywhere near your AV equipment, especially the TV.So while ""installing"" this is about as easy as it gets, making it work is nearly impossible in a home with things you want to control with it.After an hour of finding quiet RF spots, it finally worked, sort of, it is very spotty on picking up the IR signal and seems to get the command wrong more often than not, you push volume up 10 times you will be lucky to get 3 or 4 actual ticks up.This is going back.BTW -- Batteries are not included so if you decide to chance it and get this anyway have 2 AAA batts handy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R884UIX15F6WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVVV1TS#wasThisHelpful","R884UIX15F6WA","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note: I exchanged the Panasonic 65ZT60 for a Samsung 64F8500 due to the fan noise that for me and my setting was excessive, however I had it for a week while they arranged the exchange. The fan noise is why I gave it a 3 and not a 5, and the picture was why I just could not give it a 1 even though I exchanged it.When I wanted to move from a 50"" to a 65"" Plasma TV I had little doubt that it was likely going to be Panasonic Plasma, I have been using them since the second year Panasonic made consumer Plasma sets, however for this kind of money I did some pretty deep comparison shopping and research. The selection very quickly came down to the Panasonic 65ZT60 and the Samsung 64F8500, they both have an outstanding picture and roughly equal smart features. The Panasonic is also now the #1 Plasma picture on the market, near perfection to the reference standard. Which sounds great but as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. After many side-by-side viewings with my own selection of Blu-Ray discs I went with the Panasonic.However, it did not give the best picture under all conditions, in low light to ideal lighting, the Panasonic has to me a better picture and this is untuned out of the box. Tuned up it gets even better. However in a normal sunny day lit room the Samsung was equal and then in a bright room, like curtains open on a sunny day, the Samsung well out performed the Panasonic amd also on 3D, the brightness of the Samsung gives new life to 3D.  The Samsung is a little brighter than the Panasonic so it holds the color better in a room light enough to read in. Also note that to get the near perfect reference picture from either of these requires a professional calibration, but do not worry if you don't get one, they look great out of the box.The delivery guys put in on the stand and I put in the HDMI from the cable box, turned it on, and even before the picture pops up, I hear the fans, and not a steady whirr but an undulating woo-woo sound that some describe as a refrigerator sound.It turns out that it is not just the fans, but also the air flow through the case, there is a rather long discussion on the issue on the AVSForums (they host Audio-Video equipment forums). Panasonic has an official fix which most report as reducing the noise a lot but not eliminating it.To be fair, the ambient noise in a lot of settings may be high enough that you would not hear it, and even if you do hear it, it might not bug ya, but if you are in a quiet setting like I am, make sure you can retuned based on being ""unsatisfied"", it really did bug me so in the end I exchanged it for the Samsung.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F041DKDVL8ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BC4SNMK#wasThisHelpful","R3F041DKDVL8ZX","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:- Great Mid-Range and Highs- Voice Match to Primus Series is very accurate :)- Size is great for Front-High SpeakersThe Bad:- None for my applicationOverall: 5These sound great mixed with other Infinity Primus speakers, I upgraded my AVR to a Sony STR-DA1800ES and it supports HD-D.C.S. (High Def - Digital Cinema Sound)and requires additional Front L/R speakers that are position above the Main Front L/R speakers adding height to surround depth. I already had Primus speakers for 5.1 surorundm but much larger ones, (Primus 363 Front/163 Surround/351 Center) and needed something go in the new Front High L/R.I was a little worried that these being so small would be tinny and Infinity Voice Match would be more hype than reality, there was nothing to worry about. I mounted these on the wall above the main front speakers (they are front ported which helps) and re-ran the Auto-Calibration on my receiver adding these as Front High L/R. The Auto-Cal hit the distance to the inch and only had a 0.5db offset from the rest of the speakers, so far so good.Next I fired up some reference tones, and was surprizes at how pure these sounded compared to the rest of them, of course they have some limitations on the bass end, no getting around the need to move air to get good low bass. Happy with it all I put in Top Gun cranked it up, 143's were very clean even at high volumes, any bass they might lack was covered by the rest of the speakers so I did no notice.At low volume they are just as clean, and unlike many small speakers there was no tinny sound in these, for my application these were perfect.With a nice sub, these would make a great set of surround speakers where space is an issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCN4CGPHH47U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044D3R7M#wasThisHelpful","R3QCN4CGPHH47U","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:- Sound Quality, nothing else matters if this is not right and Sony nailed this.- Sound Fields and decoders, with great Front High Speaker Support HD-DCS Digital Cinima Sound (can't tell you how good this sounds)- Direct control of nearly everything, allowing good integration with Programmable Remotes like HarmonyThe Bad:- The Menu system -- very slow, no volume OS display- Odd exceptions to features, like PIP only working with two sources. Ironically anything can be plugged in to those two making it even stranger.- Auto-Set up getting speaker size wrong and no way to force it to auto-cal with the right size- How hot it runs when in stand-by/off. I use HDMI pass-through and that keeps some of it on all the time and it throws off a lot of heat.Overall: 4The Sony DA1800ES is a very solid AV receiver with great sound but the feature set is a little quirky, there is so much right in this receiver it is a shame that Sony appears to have rushed this to the market to get something in the high quality audio line up at a lower priceIn the end I care most about sound quality and the 1800ES lets you get at a high quality sound on a moderate budget. The ES amp is the star of this show and over-powers its shortcomings in the menu system. Most of the places it falls short are more or less superficial, but annoying none the less.Sound Quality: 5This is where Sony pulled no punches, this is their solid ES series sound, this sounds as good in 5.1 and a lot better in 7.1 than my 2400ES and way better than the Sony 1040. The 1800ES holds solid with a rich and full sound from very low volumes though rocking the house down. Toss in a great pre-amp with one of the widest selections of audio codec's in mid-range systems and the 1800 is a totally winner for sound quality. The highs are crisp, mid-range and voice crystal clear, and deep bass that I could not drive to muddy, and the surround blending is natural not imposed, feels closer to real.I went with 7.1 where the extra two speakers are Front Left and Right High, these are placed above the front main speakers to add height to surround, I thought it would be a gimmick but it is truly amazing. The sound optimizer does a very good job when listing to TV at low volume, usually these really flatten the sound, while flat-er it is not bad and still effective.Set-Up: 3Set-up was so-so, it got the speaker size wrong which is easy enough to fix but nailed distance to the inch. The bigger pain was one of the defaults, you pick from your speaker arrangement with the high speakers and he defaults another setting to where it does not work, forcing you back to the manual (more on this later. One really odd one is when you pick front high speaker arrangements, and another setting defaults to a mode where 7.1 does not work, back to the manual again... Pass-Though HDMI also did not default On and Set-up does not walk you through these, you need to go find them.Controls/Operation: 2I have had Sony receivers for over 20 years now and this just does not have the same attention to detail and flexibility usually found on Sony receivers. There are a lot of caveats to certain features, like PIP (picture in picture) only works if you have DVD or BD selected as the source?? (the PIP is also too small to really make it practical. Or when the On Screen Display works and does not work, that they can't figure out an overlay on a Blu-Ray HD movie so it kills the video when you need to change something. When you change volume you get no on-screen display, the manual is your friend with this unit, I don't usually need the manual much, but with this I did. Tip on the manual, get the PDF, makes life a lot easier.The good news is once you are using the receiver normally other than the lack of OSD for volume changes, you don't really interact with the menu's a lot.One highpoint in the controls is the Sony Tablet / Phone app for controlling the receiver, one of the better ones I have used, I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 dedicated to our Home Theater system. Integration with remotes like Harmony or pro RS-232 systems is outstanding and sure beats using Sony's menu's.Features: 4This is almost a 5 but had to take a point off for the menu again, your path to the features. What a great balance, 3D, 5 Movie and 12 Music Sound fields, HD-Cinema (Front-High), Air-Play Wireless/Wired WAN, Streaming music and AirPlay. The DLNA is a little weak I think and of course music only, but gets the job done, 24p pass-through, HDMI pass-through in standby, 6 HDMI ports, 4K passthrough, and the list goes on, once you finally find them or get to them, the features make this a very flexible AVR.Our Home Theater Setting:25 x 20 Room (no special treatments) / Samsung 64F8500 Plasma TV / Sony STR-DA1800ES AVR / Panasonic BDT210 Blu-Ray / HP HTPC / Infinity Primus speakers 7.1Front L/R -- Front L/R High -- Front Center -- Surround L/R -- Subwoofer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1LEZZ2EDS6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00965J7HM#wasThisHelpful","R3R1LEZZ2EDS6D","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just put in a home theater system and needed these to dress the cables (make them neat) and put them out of sight, these did the trick perfectly, I just stuck them where needed then ran black zip ties through them.I took it down 1 star for what royal pain the thin plastic that protects the sticky side are to remove, there is no cut corner or anything to get a purchase on it to pull it off. I finally found a trick, using a box cutter blade I would pierce just a tad with the razor at the corner and then ""flip"" it up quickly and that would lift it in a try or two. Would be nice if these came with black foam, the white makes them jump out so I used a black magic marker on the edges before sticking them onto something. (no points off but it would be nice)The foam tape on the back of these is wickedly sticky and hold a lot without peeling off, at the biggest point I these hold a bundle holding 6 HDMI, 2 RGB Component, 2 TOSLINK Optical, Coax Cable, and Sub-woofer cable spaced 6"" apart on wood and they are holding great, and another with 8 power cords also routed mostly on wood and a few on metal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HEVWM0GSUO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUB81DC#wasThisHelpful","R29HEVWM0GSUO7","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall: OutstandingMy Application: From Comcast High Def Cable Box (Pace ENG-110) Component+TOSLINK to HDMI to the TV (Samsung PN64F8500)The Good: Does the job very well on both SD and HD channels and on HD passes 5.1 Surround perfectlyThe Bad: HDMI has to do a handshake on resolution changes , this results in 1-2 seconds of a black screen (this is the nature of HDMI not the box)The Annoying: Radically bright power LED on the box for a home theater application, small piece of electrical tape took care of that, no light now.What you need: This box + RGB Component cable with RCA connectors, TOSLINK Optical or Coax cable, and an HDMI Cable.Installation: Pretty simple, plug in your RGB + TOSLINK(Optical or Coax)cables to the box, then HDMI between the box and the TV, then Power from the included slim line wall wart to the box. I added a piece of electrical tape over the power light and that took care of the insanely bright level they used for this applicaion. The box feels solid, little brick, the connectors are nice and tight and nothing wiggles, appears to be very well built.Use: It has so far worked perfectly watching TV, since this box does not upscale to a common resolution, when resolution / screen format changes there is a 1-2 second delay for HDMI to renegotiate, this is a short blank screen. For me this happens always when going from SD to HD or the other way, I do not do this while flipping channels so not an issue, occaisionally HD channels will change resolution or screen format and blank for a second also, but that is rare. Also rare is being on one channel and have it change resolution between the show and the commercials, but it happens and like going from SD to HD, you will get a second of so of blank screen.If you can't live with this then you should consider a converter that also upscales, but get ready to drop about 200 bucks to get one that does that and not mess up the video overall. This is way better for picture quality unless you getr a top of the line unit, like from Gefen, I have tried cheap ones and they are just not worth it.If you must upscale do it through a good device like a mid to high end AV receiver.This introduces no blurs or lag, does not alter the color, brightness or any other video attribute. It also takes Digital Dolby 5.1 surround from the oiptical cable and puts it on the HDMI and does that perfectly also.All in all this is pretty good investment if you need to get component to HDMI, the max resolution is 1080i, which is also the max for component so no quality loss in any video mode.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZ70T4KAFDTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034HWQ4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1FZ70T4KAFDTQ","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for as little reminder of those saturday mornings filled with cartoons, when as kids in the 50's we got control of the only TV in the house, well until about 10AM when we were thrown out of the house for the day, they used to call that going outside and play :)Besides the full season of episode cliff hangers there are the ""and Friends"", Improbable History with Mr. Peabody and his Boy Sherman, my personal favorite Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop & Son, these break up the episodes of Rocky just as they used to, the only thing missing are the commercials for pure sugar breakfast cerial. (Illegal in all 50 states now :)I have this DVD in a second player and a number of other Sat morning cartoons and like to start a movie off with with a cartoon like the Drive-In, the kids love it but surprizingly so far nearly everyone we have done it with (adults) like the added touch to a home theater movie, add some Sugar Pops and Coco-PuffsRocky and Bullwinkle have two shows built into one, the political barbs and commentary in off-handed remarks is amazing all buried in there for the adults watching, the more you know the history of that era the more fun these are, and if not Rocky and Bullwinkle stand on their own at face value just fine.The good and the bad, on the great side is picture quality, they look great the video is fantastic, the audio is great also but it is modified from the original at times due to the original being to degraded to restore, frankly I had no idea, seemed like the original to me but I am not a pro on Sat morning cartoons from the 50's and the music is not different enough for the average bear to notice...All and all a great value, lots of fun.BTW -- If you are a prime member you can watch this on-line for free, I did that first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWUPXCQ91Q102/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003DJ2JC2#wasThisHelpful","RWUPXCQ91Q102","A1D27BCSYV7VWH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D27BCSYV7VWH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've never had one of these before, so I can't compare it to other mandolines, but it sure beats slicing thinly by hand or with a hand grater. So far I have used it for firm vegetables, potatoes, apples, cucumbers. I'm sure it will work with a firm cheese. It's easy to set the blade depth and very easy to clean and store. That said, it's not for everything. The hand guard is about 3inches in diameter, so if you wanted to slice a cucumber or zucchini long-ways, you would be able to use the guard sitting on top of the vegetable, so I think near the last slices when that vegetable is thin, it probably wouldn't work as well. But, improvising with some other type of hand protection might work... I think it will work great for 90% of what these are normally used for, so I am pleased with it and I could afford it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCXL6PJZTF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ9MFYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3LCXL6PJZTF9","A37LY77Q2YPJVL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37LY77Q2YPJVL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author had my attention up front dropping the f bomb! This story is written straight up so you can relate. If it needs to be said it will! I'm not about to retell the story for you but I will reflect on the ""big picture"" of this book. It's a little less subjective. What the author does is cleverly and expertly open your mind to new lifestyles and beliefs. Or maybe not ""new"" but rather less accepted. Judging is a serious problem in our world today that creates heartache and pain for many. The author reminds up that growing up is tough, figuring out your identity, especially when it does conform to traditional societal expectations is even tougher, heartbreaking in some cases.Maldon does such a great job levelling the playing field with great characters, descriptions and plot. You can't help but relate on some level and before you know it you are opening up and understanding and even cheering. Or maybe that's just me! Lol Wouldn't the world be such a better place if we were ALL supported in who we are? Gay or straight, black or white, it shouldn't matter, not ever.

"This Candida Diet guide simplifies this nasty infection in an attempt to deliver practical useful information instead of overloading you with technical jargon. I like the fact the author is up front with this. So if you are already familiar with the basics this book may be too basic for you.Other than a few minor formatting issues this book flows start to finish, brief and to the point. I like how the author focuses on 'natural' preventative measures with food, talks about the floods to eat and stay away from, and follows up with a few good recipes to try. I was disappointed in the symptoms chapter a little. I feel more description is needed to help the reader recognize and relate. It does cover enough to get you started though!This is the first health and wellness guide I've reviewed by this author and with almost 2000 reviews under my belt I will say if you are looking to start taking control of your health and learn the basics of the Candida yeast infection with better eating tips for prevention, this is the guide to start with!Looking forward to reading more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBY0GFHRN1DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UY4LT1Q#wasThisHelpful","R3JBY0GFHRN1DJ","A37LY77Q2YPJVL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37LY77Q2YPJVL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Stress Relief Wisdom guide is going to make you think! What caught my attention was the author trying to open my mind to see more that what's right in front of me. Weirdly it makes sense. As a child I played many sports. Two of which were hockey and figure skating. When I slipped into my figure skates it wasn't about skating, like a hockey player might see it. For me it was an expression. Art and dancing across the ice. Some of which I took back onto the ice when I played hockey. And if you were just watching with no experience playing hockey it would just like like some rough and tough bumping, shooting a puck around and skating.I know I'm rambling but I'd like you to know is through well explained strategy the author shows you how to ""see"" and create your stress-free living.

"The Full Cup of Murder is a light murder mystery. I say ""light"" because it's also humorous. The main character Allison or Ali is cute and funny, she draws you in with her nonchalant attitude and makes you want to learn more. I like how the author sets scene and jumps right in. Raised by her hardworking father, her mother died when Ali was 6, Ali spend most of her childhood helping her father in the bar, kinda like her home I guess.It's fitting that just a few pages in Jones smacks you in the face with a murder in the bar washroom, which initially looks like a chap that's had one too many.Not the case...poor Ray.From there the author continues to dip and dive you through a mish-mash of events after the unlikely murder in this sleep small town. So small there's only one other bar around. Of course there's panic and paranoia, as the author slowly starts unraveling the story bit by bit with a few unlikely twists and well thought out turns.I won't tell you the ending because I write reviews to intrigue you to read the book, not tell you the story! lol That's the author's job.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to you.

"There are some reviews here that make the claim that these are just as soft and comfortable as the OEM earpads.  This is not quite true.  I had made the purchase based on those reviews, but after trying them on, I've found that the foam is a bit denser and less well-padded.  So lets be honest: they're not quite the same as the OEM earpads.That said, I do not regret this purchase one bit.  While these Bluecell pads are not quite as good as the Bose replacements, they are 95% as good and the leading paragraph is me being particularly picky.  Installation was straightforward with no tools needed, and function is all there.  So for about 1/3 the price of the OEM pads, it's a no brainer.  Just buy these and skip over the overpriced Bose pads.  They're not quite as good, but they're perfectly good for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5OLZ43WXMA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080BK4I4#wasThisHelpful","RK5OLZ43WXMA9","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had put off buying a proper springbar tool for a long time, trying to make due with the cheap/free springbar tools such as the one I had from one of those 18 piece watch repair kits that you can buy for $6.  Those were rather frustrating times, especially because those tools often couldn't fit into solid endlinks to change bracelets.After trying the 6767, I immediately noticed the difference.  The tool feels very solid in hand as it should for a tool that costs about $25.  It is substantial in hand and feels like a real quality piece.  Then I tested the function.  The FINE fork fit into the gap in the end links of my Omega Speedmaster Pro bracelet and worked perfectly.  There was no hesitation, no squirming around to try to fit in forks that were too big, and I had the bracelet off in seconds.  The pusher on the other end also worked perfectly to adjust micro-adjust in the clasp.  I will never go back to a lesser tool and expect the Bergeon to last a lifetime based on the build quality.  Also, if I accidentally snap the fork, replacements are available for about $3.If you change straps somewhat often and don't currently use a proper tool (I'm looking at those guys who cut a notch in a fine screwdriver), just put down the money and buy one of these tools.  It'll make your life so much better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Y4H7RZTGT3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IZT8R2#wasThisHelpful","R36Y4H7RZTGT3D","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you own a dangler (Munroe, Tek, Gear-pull, pickpocket, etc), you should definitely own some of these Micro-Lock S Biners.  The lock definitely works; haven't had the S-biner come open in my pocket yet.  (Knock on wood.)  If you have fat fingers or particularly long nails, you might have a hard time unlocking the pivoting plastic lock, but I haven't had any issues with it.Right now, I'm using a micro S-biner to attach a Rexford RUT multitool to a Munroe DTS dangler.  And I also have a Peak Eiger Hi CRI flashlight and Victorinox Alox Cadet attached by 2 of these S-biners to a Munroe Mega dangler.  So yes, if you're into Every Day Carry, this is a great alternative to the harder-to-find McGizmo clips.

"Shin Ryoku is easily my favorite green ink, and my favorite iroshizuku ink.  It's just dark enough to be taken seriously, but has that vibrant pop of color that makes your class notes or a handwritten letter stand out on the page.  The flow characteristics are awesome.  I have my TWSBI 580 (fine) dedicated to just this ink, and it writes fantastically--never skipping, never drying out even after taking numerous pages of notes.  Even though the TWSBI has a steel nib, this ink makes the pen write like a much more expensive pen; the flow really is just that good.

"First things first, the wrist rest is soft, supportive, comfortable, and stays in place on your desk.  The faux leather looks nice, is relatively durable, and is easy to clean.  Those are the positives.However, one thing well worth pointing out is that the material is not breathable, and it may cause your hands/wrists to get hot and sweat.  I don't even have sweaty hands--no problems with shaking hands, and I barely use chalk when I rock-climb.  But sitting in a room at about 75 degrees, I find my palms getting moist and sticky against this wrist rest.  Sounds uncomfortable?  Believe me, it is.I had originally been using the plastic wrist rest built into the Logitech G710+ keyboard.  It wasn't particularly comfortable, and at first, I found this 3M product to be a huge upgrade in terms of comfort and support.  But after about 20 minutes of use, I saw the benefits of plastic over gel--I never sweat on the plastic.  And if you're at a computer for hours at a time, that's important.So if you were wondering why this product had to be antimicrobial, now you know.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PED5XYF3JKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WU4H5C#wasThisHelpful","R10PED5XYF3JKT","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Das Keyboard 4 presents a number of notable improvements over the last version, that easily make this keyboard well worth the $30 premium ($169 MSRP vs $139 MSRP).  In descending order of importance, these improvements are as follows:1. Dedicated media keys - This is by far the biggest upgrade because most people use media and volume keys frequently, and using an ""Fn"" key just didn't cut it on the old model.  The volume knob is attractive, proud, and has a tactile clicky turn to it, which feels better than the free-spinning volume wheel on the Logitech G710+ keyboard.2. USB 3.0 hubs moved to top right edge of keyboard - Now you can plug in your mouse or USB headset, or charge your phone, without the cable getting in your way; this is a very welcome improvement.  The speed of USB 3.0 is also great when you need to transfer large files--but more than that, the placement of the ports is a huge plus.3. Aluminum top panel- They have replaced the glossy plastic top panel, which attracted fingerprints, with a very sleek aluminum panel that gives the keyboard a high-end feel.  Now, this keyboard looks very premium, even to the non-techie passing by your desk.4. Thinner- Due in part to the aluminum, they managed to make this keyboard thinner without losing any of that well-built feel.5. Sleep Hotkey- Not sure how many people put their computer to sleep; I usually just lock it with Windows + L when I walk away, and let it hibernate automatically if I don't come back in time.  But I guess Das Keyboard is doing its part to help save the Earth.6. Magnetic footbar- Not as huge of a bonus as they claim, and quite doubtful that you'll ever actually take this off to use this as a ruler...it just isn't that practical.  But the option is there if it's an emergency.With these new features (primarily media keys and aluminum top panel), the Das Keyboard 4 has jumped to the top of the leaderboard for off-the-shelf mechanical keyboards.  For those uninitiated, mechanical keyboards really are that much better than membrane keyboards.  Believe the hype.  Your word-per-minute speed actually will increase with mechanical keyboards, and your keyboard enjoyment will likely be that much higher too.  The price is admittedly a bit high; but given that we interact with our computers through only two primary inputs (our mouse and keyboard), it is likely worth the price if you spend a lot of time in front of a computer.  With this model, you have four options:Professional MX Blue (traditional/clicky)Professional MX Brown (traditional/quiet)Ultimate MX Blue (blank/clicky)Ultimate MX Brown (blank/quiet)The ""ultimate"" version with all blank key caps is certainly less-practical than the ""professional"" version which has marked keys.  However, the coolness factor of the ""ultimate"" is simply unparalleled.  It is possibly the best-looking off-the-shelf mechanical keyboard available on the market.  This version utilizes the ""clicky"" Cherry MX Blue switches which are fantastic.  If you need something a bit more quiet, the version with MX Browns is also a good choice, with nearly as much tactility--but at the same time, nearly as much noise for those who are not acclimated to mechanical keyboards.The Ultimate Clicky is really targeted at typists who crave that particular typing experience.  In a professional setting, the ""professional"" model is likely more utilitarian because you can find keys like ""delete,"" ""F7"", and ""print screen"" when you actually need them.  And the browns are probably better for most people because the blues are quite loud...I can hear them over Bose QC20s at moderate listening volumes.  The keyboard also lacks fancy features like macros and backlighting--which are certainly niceties in themselves (especially if you are a gamer), and are available in many competitor's keyboards in this price range.  But if you want to type quickly and accurately, and look like BOSS doing it, the Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate Clicky is the keyboard you have been waiting for.  It was certainly the one I had been waiting for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LN045FGIDC8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKQSGWE#wasThisHelpful","R1LN045FGIDC8G","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got my nail clipper, I thought it was defective because it couldn't clip my nails.  And I realized it was because the clipper wasn't engaging all the way closed.  It'd go 3/4 of the way closed, without fully completing the clipping motion.  I thought I had gotten a dud, but after a bit of experimentation, I realized that I needed to go through an extra not-so-obvious motion of pulling back and pushing forward to properly engage the lever-arm of the nail clipper to allow it to fully engage.  It was not defective...just a bit less intuitively designed than expected.I am a male and had planned to carry this in my wallet.  However, if you have a nice leather wallet, I would NOT recommend carrying this in the wallet (unless perhaps you have a coin pouch in it) because it will wear through the leather.  So without a keychain attachment on the leather carrying slip or on the nail clipper itself, it has found itself relegated to my desk.  And in that case, there are many better nail clippers for the money.  I highly recommend the Seki Edge for less money, and less trouble.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23U47LX03JZFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A9JPKK#wasThisHelpful","R23U47LX03JZFY","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TWSBI pen shipped very quickly from TWSBI and was a pleasure to un-package: an external cardboard box with their logo opened up to an elegant clear plastic display that housed the pen.  It was impressive for a $55 pen.As for writing performance, the Fine nib writes well.  It isn't as smooth as some have claimed--but one cannot expect a steel nib to be quite as smooth as a gold nib.  Then again, I do enjoy the little bit of feedback that I get from the nib.  The piston filler holds a ton of ink, and the ink looks awesome twirling around in the pen body.  The build quality of the pen itself is consummate with the price of the pen, if not better.  In particular, the red TWSBI detail accent on the top of the cap is very high quality.However, my biggest gripe with this pen is that it was actually intended to be written with uncapped.  While it is possible to ""post"" the cap, it throws off the balance of the pen.  Also, the cap attaches to the twisting portion that manipulates the piston.  So you can imagine the danger if you attach or detach your cap carelessly and end up with ink all over your pants.  So I don't even bother capping this pen any more.  If you're prone to losing pen caps, this might not be the pen for you.But otherwise, for a very attractive, and well-performing, high-value fountain pen, this is probably one of the best choices on the market.  The closest competitor for the money to consider would probably be the Lamy Al Star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRQ2OQZGRZQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT1BLRU#wasThisHelpful","R1PRQ2OQZGRZQA","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I very much prefer to write with unlined notepads and this is the perfect size for short notes--consider it the Goldilocks size.  If you do need to write with lines, the paper is thin enough that you can put a sheet of guide-lines underneath to follow.  So really, blank paper is probably the best of all worlds--unconstrained but with that flexibility to accept structure.The paper works fantastically with fountain pens.  Nibs just glide along it, so if you like a bit of feedback, this probably isn't your paper.  But there is minimal bleed through and almost no feathering.  And this is in spite of the thinness of the paper.  It definitely doesn't feel like heavy-duty quality stationary, so it's not the most impressive paper if you're handing a note to someone written on it.  The thickness is similar to that of plain copy paper.  And really, that's my only gripe with it.  If it had heavier paper, (ex. 80 lb), I would probably enjoy it even more.  Then again, if it were thicker, you might not be able to use it with guide-lines underneath; so that might be an intended design compromise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XCEDJVD1YTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DC9I5M#wasThisHelpful","R21XCEDJVD1YTD","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Blue-Green Al Star is the limited edition color for 2014.  If  you were considering this pen, here are the top five things I think you should know:1. The Blue-Green color is much more green in person than the Tiffany blue that appears in the pictures.  It is nevertheless, very attractive, and has a metallic sheen underneath.2. I prefer 0.7 Gel Rollerballs, and the Lamy Fine point is a good approximation.  It writes like a steel nib (because it is a steel nib), but is adequately smooth.3. The grip section is triangular, so if you prefer round grip sections, this may feel a bit uncomfortable.4. Like the rest of the Al Star line, this pen's body is made of aluminum, which makes it feel like a quality everyday carry pen.  The clip also works well for that purpose, and clips nicely to any pocket.5. You will need to buy a converter if you want to use this pen with bottled inks.  The Lamy Z24 converter ($5-$6 depending on where you go) is the recommended converter, although it also works with the Z26.Hope that helps.  I personally think this is one of the most attractive limited-edition Al Stars ever released, and while you may be able to get it a few bucks cheaper at a few places, Amazon Prime shipping makes this a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B62N3DX3QGG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J39MTIU#wasThisHelpful","R1B62N3DX3QGG9","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a reason the Lamy 2000 is on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art.  It's a beautiful pen.  The design is over 40 years old and will likely remain a timeless design for decades to come.  From the moment you un-box the pen and hold it in your hand, you can tell that it is a fine writing instrument.  It fills the hand perfectly, has great balance wit the cap posted, and is just the perfect weight.The real reason I bought this pen, despite wanting the fountain pen was convenience.  If you want the Lamy 2000, but don't have a collection of bottled inks (as the FP does not take cartridge refills), the rollerball is the way to go.  You get the same great bauhaus lines as the fountain pen, but with all the convenience of regular rollerball and gel refills.It takes the Lamy M63 refill by default, but can also take many similar-sized refills if you use a spacer.  My preference for a good balance price and function is the Pilot G2 Blue 0.7.  But you've got a lot of options.This is certainly one of my favorite rollerball pens--and is probably the best option in a +/- $25 price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3UUPHWJKLZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UTQ5ZK#wasThisHelpful","R1W3UUPHWJKLZ7","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the moment you pick up the fiberglass body, it's clear that this is a nice pencil.  The body has almost a synthetic woodgrain feel to it--like an air-dried piece of ebony and feels quite classy--while very different from the lacquer you'd typically see on other high end writing instruments. But then you try to advance the lead.  There is a tiny bit of slop in the movement--about one mm between starting to click and the actual engagement point where lead is advanced--so that's a bit unfortunate.  In fact, the clicking action is not the most pleasant.  Perhaps the pencil needs a longer break-in period, but the click is actually a bit scratchy (audibly so)--and the reason the travel-slop in the knock mechanism is made more evident because there is a very clear ""break"" for the actuation of the lead advancement mechanism.  So instead of feeling like a smooth paved highway, clicking the mechanism on this pencil feels more like grinding along a gravel road with a speed bump in the middle.  That's a bit dramatized, but gives you an idea of what the action feels like.Another iconic German pencil in the price range is the rOtring 800.  I like both.  The Lamy 2000 is lighter (easier to write with for an extended period of time), fills the hand better, and seems to have better balance.  The rOtring 800 feels more solid and durable, has a retracting tip which is both fun and practical, but feels slightly more difficult to write with for extended periods of time due to the heavier weight and slimmer body.  It's difficult to choose between the two, especially since both have minor flaws.  But if you like pencils, I think you'll learn to enjoy both of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RILKCWICA3RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002T3YCA#wasThisHelpful","R1RILKCWICA3RR","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far my favorite pen holder.  I have it horizontally on my desk, with seven comfortably spaced pens neatly displayed in it.  It's certainly more elegant than a traditional pen cup--and much more so than having random pens strewn across your desktop.  The blue rubber fingers look very neat inside of the bamboo exterior and the block is a great conversation piece.I also own the Big Idea Design ""PHX Organizer"" ($70 retail) which is very similar in concept.  This item is superior in every way.  The quirky allows both horizontal and vertical placement.  The fingers are packed much more densely and hold the pens more vertical.  And subjectively, even though the PHX Organizer is a heavy block of aluminum that looks super sleek against a Mac setup on a clean modern desk, I think the Quirky block looks even nicer--and more unique.  Oh, and it's significantly cheaper than the PHX too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KCGBO4PSSX9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC2728G#wasThisHelpful","R3KCGBO4PSSX9I","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At about $2 each, they are expensive.  But if you haven't tried a Palomino already, they're worth a try--and IMO, the Pearl is the best of the series.The Blackwing line In order from lightest to darkest is: 602, Pearl, Traditional.  And I've found that the Pearl is the best compromise.  It's the perfect mix of tip strength and dark lines.  If you've read the hype, you might have heard that you get darker lines with less pressure with Blackwing pencils.  Indeed, versus a regular $0.20 HB pencil, the writing experience is a night and day difference.  You can write faster and with much less effort--almost as if you were using a rollerball pen.  Is it worth 10x the price?  Probably not.  But if you've read this far, you're probably the kind of person who could appreciate the improvement in quality--irrespective of price.I replaced the erasers with Palomino's green replacements, which I think look great against the gold and white.  But the stock black ones look sleek too.  Unfortunately, neither is very good at actually erasing--you should get a dedicated eraser for that.  But the flat shape keeps the pencil from rolling (more-important than you'd expect) and also gives it that characteristic look that is always a conversation starter--especially in today's high-tech world.

"This sharpener is identical to the Automatic Long Point sharpener manufactured by KUM.  I bought this specific model for its color and because it had Palomino on the side.  If you're spending $2/pencil for Palomino Blackwings, you might as well get the sharpener you really want even if it does cost a bit more.It does work fantastically and produces a very sharp and long tip.  This is similar to most electric sharpeners--but is a rare feature for manual sharpeners.  I only wish there was a way it could sharpen the wood and the lead in one shot rather in two stages.It also comes with two extra blades.  (If you can't find them, don't worry, you didn't accidentally throw them out with the box; they're stored in the body of the sharpener.)If you need a portable pencil sharpener, there are smaller ones, there are cheaper ones--but this is the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22F36IA6KN5NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P50ONQ#wasThisHelpful","R22F36IA6KN5NK","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First the good: very cool orange cover, waterproof, dot-grid ruled.  Those are the key differentiators that set this special edition apart from the standard garden variety Field Notes.However, for me, this couldn't make it into the everyday carry because I never EDC a pencil--but rather a pen.  And my EDC pens, almost without fail, use gel or rollerball inks, because I prefer the way they flow and write.  That said, even my Fisher Space Pen cartridges would smear if I didn't leave enough time for the ink to dry on the page.And for that reason, the Pitch Black edition is probably the way to go if you are looking for a special cover and dot-grid ruling: you can write on it with any type of pen you may be carrying.

This EOS lip balm was clearly designed for the purse, as it does not fit into trouser pockets particularly well, but the cool sphere looks great on a desk top.

"I only wish I had discovered the Braun Series 7 earlier.  I had been using Gillette manual razors ever since I started shaving--Mach III, Fusion Proglide, etc.  They worked fantastically-well: simplicity combined with a close shave.  However, once I started to need to shave every day (guess those unkempt college days are over), I found myself loathing the 5+ minute routine every morning of lathering my face with shaving cream, washing the manual razor cartridge under the water every few strokes, and cleaning my face again thoroughly after shaving to avoid any residue shaving cream.  And that led me to the Braun Series 7.I can now complete the daily shave-routine in under 3 minutes.  That may not seem like much of a difference, but believe me, when you're trying to get out the door to catch public transportation into downtown in the morning, those few minutes help--any fan of the snooze button can certainly attest to that.  And sure, the shave isn't as close as the manual razor, but it's 80-90% as close and definitely gets the job done.  There's also no thinking about accidentally cutting yourself like you might with a manual razor.

"I handled a Burnley custom Kwaiken at a knife show and fell in love with everything but the price.  So thankfully, Boker has manufactured one for the masses.  The knife looks great, but if you wanted to send your knife for some after-market modding, I removing the Boker Plus and AUS-8 markings on the blade make for a much cleaner look...because nobody is particularly proud to have paid $100 for AUS-8 steel.  (Note: I also have the ""flipper"" mod done to my Kwaiken and unfortunately it does not work particular well since the Boker version just was not designed as a flipper.)The detent on mine was on the strong side, so I took the knife apart and bent out the locking liner to loosen it a bit.  Much smoother action now, and just rockets open with solid lockup in all directions.  The major downside is this: YOU CAN SLICE YOUR FINGER EVEN WHEN THE KNIFE IS CLOSED!  If you run your finger along the bottom of the knife (which has a semi-open design) the blade comes close enough to the edge of the liner that it can catch the meaty part of your finger--especially in the areas close to the pivot.  So beware.  I cut myself once and will be more careful around that design flaw next time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDXV73C8R2G21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCYAKC6#wasThisHelpful","RDXV73C8R2G21","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finally upgraded from my Kindle keyboard 3G, no ads to the Kindle Paperwhite when I realized I be coming home later from work via public transportation and therefore, would be reading more in the dark.  I opted for the ad-supported version to save a few bucks, and that was a great decision.Pro tip: If you don't connect to the Internet for about a month (because you transfer books from your hard drive to the device), the Kindle stops showing you ads altogether...supposedly because it wants to show ads that are new and paid for by content sponsors.The battery life is great as promised, but the device ends up about the same weight and feel as the Kindle keyboard because of the larger battery that makes a device thicker and heavier than it otherwise would be.  So that was a bit of a let down there.  I keep my brightness setting relatively low and have never had a problem with running out of batteries.  The text is definitely crisp and easily readable.  I've enjoyed this Kindle for hours before bed, while on airplanes and in airports, and on the way  to and from work on the bus.  You don't notice the backlight when you're reading in well lit conditions and it's there when you need it in the dark.  If you're still thinking about upgrading from an older version of the Kindle, I would highly recommend the Kindle paperwhite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33W8L29VOS4DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OZNZG0#wasThisHelpful","R33W8L29VOS4DV","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I realized I needed a new mousepad, I decided to upgrade to the best on the market. I saw that Steel Series, marketed itself as being the most used mousepad and gaming, so I was naturally intrigued.  I decided to buy the QCK+ because it promised to be an extraordinarily large mousepad and something different from what I would be used to.  Indeed, it was large as promised, but I still find myself only using a small portion of the pad due to the high mouse sensitivity settings that I prefer.  As for the surface it is smoother, and my mouse is able to glide along effortlessly.  I would say that the surface also helps to pick up more of the mouse's subtle movements.If you looking to buy mousepad and willing spend the money, this is probably the best there is out there.  Just make sure you have the appropriate amount of desk space because this thing is BIG!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9WRL70R8CO25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UYCRQ6#wasThisHelpful","R9WRL70R8CO25","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I decided to try these glasses after hearing the hype for several years.  Long story short, these glasses do work.  I experienced less eyestrain after long gaming sessions.  They are very lightweight and almost feel cheaply made the frame is flexible and fits well.  The reduced coverage from the smaller lenses is not a problem because they are roughly equal to standard eyeglass lenses.  There is some slight magnification from the lens, which is a good feature.  The anti- reflect also helps and works as advertised.One comment, is that the packaging was one of the most difficult to open for a modern tech product.  That aside, the glasses do what they were advertised to do.  It's just up to you to decide whether you're willing to spend the money for yourself.  Personally, I don't think I would do it again.  But I will be using these during long computing sessions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS9U3AM7CS0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003MQU6V2#wasThisHelpful","R2OS9U3AM7CS0I","A2FE2DBHMLSFCU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FE2DBHMLSFCU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The At-A-Glance 2016 Weekly and Monthly Planner was just the thing I needed to keep track of doctor's appointments, social dates and meetings of my local civics group.  The cover is faux leather and quite rugged.  The planner has a full monthly calendar for each month spread over two pages, followed by spacious entry pages week by week (with room for notes).  The generous writing space is so large, the planner can double as a journal, or be used just for that purpose.  The back of the book has space for contacts and events, plus a list of holidays and even a time zone map of the US.

"My roommate insisted that I give this a good review.OK, I admit it  my stuff stinks.  Its not really my fault (is it ever anyones fault)  I have a multitude of chronic health problems and take many medications.  One of the side effects of the meds I take is a strong odor attached to my bathroom visits.  We previously tried everything; sprays (before it smelled like someone took a dump; now it smells like someone took a dump in a patchouli patch); candles (everything from scented vanilla to huge torch-like doubles), all to no avail.  When I saw the ads for Poo-Pourri I asked myself, Could this be the answer at long last?  So, when Amazon Vine offered me a sample I said OK, lets put it to the test.On the day the Poo-Pourri arrived, it coincided with a strong need on my part to use the john.  No candles were lit and no spray was used in order to maximize our assessment of the product.  The package suggest three-five spritzes directly on the water (I used five) before using the commode.  I held my breath and wondered aloud if my roommate would need to do the same (as usual) two rooms away.  The first thing I noticed about the Poo-pourri was that it had a strong citrus odor of its own (never mind that this was vanilla).  I finished my business and after I flushed and washed up, I invited my roomie to give the bathroom a sniff test.  I held my breath as he entered the john and pronounced Poo-pourri a winner!  For my part, all I could smell was the lingering citrus-like odor of the Poo-pourri!  What do you know, it actually works!Although the price is relatively high, we expect to purchase more and split the cost.  I, for my self-pride, and my roommate for his peace-of-nose.  Definitely recommended for the strong odor-maker in your household!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NKQUHD3HU03R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108Y8JHS#wasThisHelpful","R3NKQUHD3HU03R","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Two people who did not know I have been using this product remarked within the past few days that I am looking well-rested and thats proof enough for me.The dispenser is interesting, allowing just a small amount of the cream to come out of the jar at a time, so you can place it exactly where most needed.  I have found myself looking forward to applying it each night, as each application leaves the skin feeling noticeably tighter and yet more supple.

"Please note that this review contains several spoilers concerning the initial hour of the film.  It does not contain any spoilers on the middle or climax of the movie.The first thing I feel compelled to say is that INTERSTELLAR is definitely not for everyone.  The film requires commitment in both time and thought, and therefore will not be to everyones liking, including some devoted fans of the science fiction genre.I will admit I have an affinity for films that require multiple viewings for the observer to digest.  Of course, I am no genius, but I was frankly amazed at how much of Christopher Nolans INTERSTELLAR I managed to understand on my first viewing.  When I saw it a second time, I was equally amazed at how much Id missed, and how beautifully it all came together.  I would not say that INTERSTELLAR requires a degree in quantum physics or an understanding of Einsteins theory of relativity, but they sure would be helpful.  Yet it turns out that the underlying theme of INTERSTELLAR is nothing more than an exploration of the power of love and what makes us human.  After my first viewing, I emerged from the theater with many questions, yet I had the feeling (and I still do) that INTERSTELLAR is perhaps the greatest science fiction film ever made and even possibly the best film I have ever seen of any genre.  I do not make these statements lightly.  I am a film buff who enjoys many different types of movies, but Sci-fi, drama and fantasy are perhaps my favorites.  INTERSTELLAR employs elements of each.The first portion of the film can be described thusly: Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) is a former NASA space pilot living in the near future, where a large-scale disaster (there are hints that it may have been climate change) has killed off much of the Earths population, and left the planet unable to sustain life beyond one more generation.  Dust storms blanket the planet and crops fail constantly.  One by one Earths crops have become history until corn is all that can be grown.Coopers daughter Murph and son Tom are above average students, but like other young people, they are encouraged to study farming to help sustain the dwindling food supply.  Murph complains of poltergeists in her room and is soon attempting to decode cryptic messages that appear in the dust near her bookcase.  When she and her dad discover that one of the messages contains geographic coordinates in binary numbers, they set out to discover what they may at that location.What they find is a secret NASA complex presided over by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) who is trying desperately to save the species by discovering a new, habitable planet while simultaneously exploring the possibility of launching a massive space station to evacuate Earths doomed people.  We soon learn that a crew of explorers has already been sent into a wormhole near Saturn.  The wormhole, which appeared suddenly 48 years prior, opens into another galaxy, where several potentially viable planets await.  Professor Brand convinces Cooper to leave his family and pilot a spacecraft into the wormhole, while he (Professor Brand) works on a problem concerning the space station.  Cooper is to be accompanied on this mission by Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) and a crew of two more astronauts, plus two robots called Tars and Case.  Murph doesnt want her father to leave, because she understands that he will not be back for many years, if at all.  Believe it or not, this is only the beginning.  Be warned that the movie runs a hefty two hours and forty-nine minutes, all of which require sustained attention to absorb the films myriad details.With INTERSTELLAR, Christopher Nolan has fashioned nothing less than a modern classic, a film by which I believe future sci-fi films may be measured.  The music, by Hans Zimmer, is breathtaking, and so effective as to draw the viewer directly into the story.  The visual effects are stunning and the drama intense.  All together, they make for a highly potent and entertaining film.  During the final 45 minutes, I found myself in tears several times, particularly at the climax.I liked it so much that I did something I think Ive never done before  I went back to see it again the very next day.  The second viewing was even more rewarding and helped to answer many of the questions I had after my first screening.  While I did not understand it all the first time around (an understatement if ever there was one) I did understand enough to know that I was viewing something beyond extraordinary.For those who insist that this is Christopher Nolans worst effort, please note that up until now, I have not been a huge fan of his work.  But I believe he has more than come into his own with INTERSTELLAR, a film of amazing beauty, vision and heart.Interstellar is highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KF3M70M0P84N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7GCJK#wasThisHelpful","R3KF3M70M0P84N","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mead Five Star Spiral Notebook sets a new standard in the otherwise common world of spiral notebooks.  The cover is made of durable plastic and resists spills and tears.  Each separator in the five-subject book has a reinforced pouch, that keeps and holds notes securely in the book.  The book contains a generous 200 pages and is thicker than other notebooks of the same type.  Each page is pre-punched with holes to fit a standard three-ring binder, so you can easily transfer notes directly into a permanent binder.

"Author Tommy Rosen holds advanced certification in Hatha and Kundalini Yoga.  In his new book, Recovery 2.0, he expounds upon his own recovery from alcohol and drug addiction and explains his own philosophy of combining traditional 12-Step recovery practices with yoga, meditation and holistic approaches to diet and exercise and their uses in treating advanced addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling.The book is divided into three sections.  The first details his personal descent into the world of extreme addition to drugs and alcohol.  I found this portion of the book rather slow, but I was glad that I stuck with it.  The second section, Recovery 1.0 is a new-age overview of the 12 steps, which any recovering alcoholic or addict will find both familiar and refreshing.  In the third section, Recovery 2.0, he goes beyond the classic 12-Step approach to include spiritual practices such as yoga and diet to overcome all kinds of addiction.  It was this portion of the book that I found most fascinating and useful.  His modern explanation of the 12-Steps, combined with his very practical methods and advice, make a refreshing change in self-help books that I appreciated tremendously.As stated earlier, the initial portion of the book is rather slow, however, if the idea of a combination of the 12-Steps together with a holistic, new age approach to recover appeals to you, I believe you may enjoy this book very much.

"The Unchartered Ultra-Lite Packing Cube is a wonderful idea whose time has come.  Every time I pack for a trip, I get tired of shoving all my items in a suitcase, only to find that I have poorly organized and forgotten my socks.The ultra-lite packing cube is exactly as its name implies; three separate pouches that you can use to compartmentalize items neatly arranged inside your bag.  The title ultra-lite does not begin to convey how lightweight the material is.  I have never felt such light material in my life.The three pouches measure 11.5 by 14.5 inches; 8.5 by 11.5 inches and 5.5 by 8.5 inches wide.  The two larger pouches are three inches deep and the small pouch is two inches deep.  My one criticism is that they could have made them a tad larger; nevertheless, by compartmentalizing my suitcase, they make it less likely that I will forget my socks underwear.  The 11 by 14 pouch is supposed to be for shirts, but I really wouldnt say that dress shirts would fit into it.  However, it does fit several rolled-up t-shirts and so certainly is useful.I like the look and practically weightless feel of the packing cubes and I am sure I will find all three useful when packing for my next trip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DLMQS3Y0WUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWWBKVM#wasThisHelpful","R9DLMQS3Y0WUF","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in October 1987, where it was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and audiences alike.  The narrative is based on four fairy tales, using versions by the Brothers Grimm (Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel).  The plot blends the familiar tales with an original story about a baker and his wife and their attempts to undo a witch's spell.  The musical boasts music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, the most respected theatre composer of the last 60 years, and a book by his frequent collaborator, James Lapine.Historically, fairy tales by the Grimm Brothers have been viewed as being darker and more realistic than versions of the same stories written by other authors.  Consequently, and because Mr. Sondheim is seen as one of the most (if not the most) challenging composers of modern theatre, it must be noted that Into the Woods is not a piece that was conceived with an audience of young children in mind.  Rather, it is a sophisticated adult experience, a fairy tale for grownups if you will.  While some of the darker and more provocative aspects of the story have been muted for the film version, the fact that the film has been produced by Disney has led many parents to assume that this is a film for small children.  It is not.  It is a moral fable for grownups; most children under the age of fifteen or so (unless they are very mature) will not be able to appreciate the story, and many parents of small children will find the material unsuitable.For the uninitiated, Mr. Sondheim has long been known for his extremely clever rhymes, and his intellectually provocative lyrics and scenarios.  Since 1957, he has written both music and lyrics for such heralded shows as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Anyone Can Whistle, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Merrily We Roll Along, Sweeney Todd, Pacific Overtures, Sunday in the Park with George, Assassins, Passion, Bounce and, of course, Into the Woods.  He also wrote the lyrics only for West Side Story, Gypsy and Do I Hear a Waltz.  Whole revues have been assembled around his songs and even the songs he'd dropped from shows before they reached Broadway.  Nevertheless, aside from the lyrics to West Side Story and his most successful song, Send in the Clowns, he is largely unknown to all but regular Broadway audiences.  Yet many audiences are already familiar with the stage version of Into the Woods, either from Broadway, touring companies or the DVD of the complete show (with the original cast).  Like most of Sondheim's other works, Into the Woods has been praised for its witty and intelligent lyrics and its extremely humorous book.  It has also proved to be one of his most popular endeavors.Devotees of the stage work will find that, like Sweeney Todd before it, several cuts have been made in the story and music for the film version of Into the Woods.  Having purchased the soundtrack and now having seen the film twice, I would say that about one third of the story and one fifth of the music has been removed from the film version.  I was a bit more disappointed at the deletions of the choral portions of Sweeney Todd than I am in the music cut from Into The Woods.  The film works quite well, with a good deal of the music and humor intact.The following songs have been deleted from the score for the movie:I Guess This is Goodbye / Maybe They're MagicFirst MidnightAct II Prologue (So Happy)Agony (Act II Reprise)And the following songs have been replaced by instrumental versions:Ever After (Instrumental)No More (Instrumental)This is not surprising; what is surprising is that so much of the score has been retained for the film.  The original stage show ran over three hours, plus the intermission.  The film clocks in at just over two hours, which means that more than an hour of music and plot have been trimmed.  Many may disagree, but I believe this makes for a tighter, more structured story and score.  Considering the length of the stage work, some cuts simply had to be made.It is recommended that those previously unfamiliar with the score acquire the complete soundtrack (with the libretto included) and follow along with the words as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works) how incredibly witty and sophisticated the lyrics are; on first listen you may miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who takes the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  Into the Woods is no exception, despite the cuts.The cast of the film, led by Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick and James Corden are uniformly excellent.  I expected a faithful adaptation of Into the Woods as soon as I heard that the film was being directed by Rob Marshall, who brought the musical Chicago to the screen.  Mr. Marshall presented a faithful adaptation of Chicago, and once again he does not disappoint.All in all, Into the Woods is a towering achievement.  Few of Sondheim's musicals have been successfully transplanted to cinema.  Into the Woods may very well be the best of them.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ITQMWM7W750/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHUSN0#wasThisHelpful","R25ITQMWM7W750","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been looking forward to this film since I learned it was being made.  Stephen Sondheim's INTO THE WOODS was one of the highlights of the 1980's Broadway scene.  With a book by James Lapine and Music and Lyrics by Mr. Sondheim, the witty, fast-paced and delightful story/score charmed audiences young and old when it debuted on Broadway on November 5, 1987.  At this writing I have not yet seen the film, but the Soundtrack arrived from Amazon today and I have listened carefully to it.Based on a combination of Grimm's Fairy Tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, and Rapunzel) the classic stories are woven together and combined with an original story about a childless baker and his wife and their efforts to remove a witch's spell.The score is magnificent, and represents Stephen Sondheim at his very best, although those of us who are fans of Mr. Sondheim agree that - from West Side Story through Passion - every show he has touched has had its own magic.  Stephen Sondheim is known as much for his deliciously witty, complicated lyrics, as for his rich, rewarding melodies.  Judging from my initial listen to this soundtrack, the score is almost completely intact when compared to the stage version, unusual for a musical film.  As he did with his masterpiece, Sweeney Todd, Mr. Sondheim has made some minor lyrical changes for the film which enhance rather than detract from the score.Some will be upset at the omissions.  Based on the Soundtrack, the following songs appear to have been deleted from the score:I Guess This is Goodbye / Maybe They're MagicFirst MidnightAct II Prologue (So Happy)Agony (Act II Reprise)Witch's LamentPlus the following songs have been replaced by instrumental versions:Ever After (Instrumental)No More (Instrumental)I suppose if I had my preferences, I would restore the Act II reprise of Agony, just for my favorite laugh in the show (""Dwarves are very upsetting...."").  The song ""No More"" never really clicked for me, but ""Maybe They're Magic"" proffered the witty line, ""If the end is right, it justifies...the beans"".  I do regret the deletion of ""The Witch's Lament"" from the second act.  Oh well, I would rather rejoice at what's been retained than bemoan the deletions.The CD includes a complete libretto.  The Soundtrack also includes a wealth of incidental music.  Fully half an hour of the ninety-minute soundtrack is instrumental.All in all, what remains of the score is extremely satisfactory.  If you are a fan of the show, or even if you are unfamiliar with this work at all, I promise that the Soundtrack to INTO THE WOODS will make you believe in movie musicals again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EAVK6R2V0JYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAIK7BC#wasThisHelpful","R1EAVK6R2V0JYI","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Warning: spoilers galore:Scarlet Marlow is on a quest to find the Philosopher's Stone, an ancient mythological treasure that can turn base metals into gold and grant eternal life to those who find it.  How original is that?  In a harrowing and well-directed sequence that opens the film, she manages to photograph the Rose Key, which contains the secret to finding the Philosopher's Stone.  As this was her father's life's work and the cause of his madness and suicide, she is determined to find the elusive prize.  After leaving Iraq she connects with her translator George in Paris and elicits his help in translating the Rose Key.  He promises to help her translate but refuses to provide her any further help; this caused me to deduce correctly that he would soon be joining Scarlet in her search.  After visiting an ancient church, she determines that that the Stone is hidden somewhere in the ancient Paris catacombs.  Scarlet then obtains the assistance of Papillion, a self-styled expert in the Paris catacombs and apparent graffiti artist, promising him the spoils of the search.  At this point, I thought that Steve McQueen must be rolling in his grave.  Together with Papillion's ""team"" they sneak into the catacombs and begin their journey.From here the plot goes from murky to ridiculous as the promising beginning is sacrificed to a story that degenerates into a tour through the catacombs beneath Paris in pursuit of the mythical Philosopher's Stone.  I found this part of the premise of the film to be intriguing, as publicity for the film boasted that the search was filmed in the actual Paris catacombs.  Unfortunately that promise did not come to fruition.The balance of the film treats us to a claustrophobia-inducing, endless tour of the catacombs, many of the tunnels being barely large enough to squeeze through.  As the group progresses through the catacombs, up into tunnels, down into water and back again, I kept wondering where this was heading, and glanced at my watch a lot.  There are endless clues and some frightening moments, but much of the action is ruined by an overwhelming sense on the part of the viewer that these tunnels are leading to nowhere.  As they continue to travel, sometimes seemingly moving in a circle, the plot makes less and less sense as our intrepid explorers penetrate deeper and deeper.  Admittedly there are a few spooky moments, which would have improved the film if they made any sense.  The end of this mess was one of the most pathetic non-events I have ever encountered in a motion picture, and I scratched my head as I experienced a ""Huh?  That's it?"" moment.  As I filed out of the theater with the other half-dozen moviegoers who sat through this atrocity, I was extremely grateful that I had made use of a free movie pass that a friend had given me.  Bottom line: extremely claustrophobic tour of the Paris catacombs combined with a nonsensical plot and too few scary moments made for one of the most disappointing trips to the movies I've had this year.  Avoid at all costs.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VMC3T1J21GKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N5AHZRS#wasThisHelpful","R3VMC3T1J21GKE","AQQFI7YHMRL7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQQFI7YHMRL7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sphere Gadget Technologies Lightphoria, 10,000 Lux Energy Light Lamp. I, (like many people around the world) have a vitamin D deficiency. Mine was so severe, in fact that it did not even register on a blood test a few months ago. I was given an Rx for a massive dose of vitamin D, to be taken once weekly. I was really uncomfortable with that after doing some research on possible side effects. Now, I take 2,000 IU daily. I have also been using this lamp, not only to possibly help with that but also to relieve my seasonal affective disorder. In the past, laying in a tanning bed had a significant positive result for me but I am not willing to do that to my body anymore. My most recent blood test showed a vitamin D level of 19, (around 100 is normal) so at least it is improving. I cannot say whether this light effectively raises vitamin D levels. I can only say that I enjoy using it & I am hopeful that it will help to keep me from becoming depressed in the winter months when there is so much less sunlight. I use it when I wake up, which I believe also helps my body to wake up & understand that it is time to become active. I like the light a lot & the compact size of it is great. It is super portable, so it would be easy to travel with. I keep mine on my vanity in my master bathroom but it would be quite simple to move to another location. It is easy to use & it has a timer that can be set. I believe that it doesn't hurt to try things such as this, that may improve my symptoms. It is supposed to stimulate the brain to release 'euphoric' hormones, making the body more energetic. If there is even a little bit of that going on, I am all for it! I purchased this product at a discount for testing & review. I am happy with it & I would recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RML41PN31NFHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JF3G08#wasThisHelpful","RML41PN31NFHU","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purelux 100 Inch Extra Long Double Lock Stainless Steel Replacement Shower Hose. OK, everyone this shower hose is absolutely awesome! I have three showers in my house & all of them had hoses that were too short to adequately reach low enough tocomfortably bathe my dogs. Now, my fur kids are Mastiffs, so it's not like they are low to the ground! My husband & I were both thrilled at the opportunity to test this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. We were able to attach a spray nozzle that has a trigger, so it can control the flow of water on & off without having to manually turn the water on & off each time we are shampooing & such. This means that we have a much more consistent water temperature & we are conserving water, too. This hose is very well made & was a breeze to install. It easily reaches the dogs from end to end & now they can take a nice bath while their royal washers are much more comfortable. No more stretching & straining to reach with a short hose! We are super happy with this product & I highly recommend it, along with the seller. They have fantastic customer service & are super friendly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11EMJ9MWF4USR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OJEPNC#wasThisHelpful","R11EMJ9MWF4USR","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glass Drinking Straws with Cleaning Brush Clear (4 Pack). These drinking straws are well made & come with a cleaning brush, which is extremely useful. They came in a nice box, so they are perfect for gift-giving, perhaps along with someone's favorite beverage as a hostess gift. I would much rather have re-usable straws that are better for the environment than plastic, disposable straws that wind up in a landfill after a single use. However, I didn't think it through all the way & since I drink out of glass containers, (usually mason jars with screw on lids with straw holes) I am nervous that the glass on glass will cause them to break. I am being careful, though & so far, so good. My lids have a piece that keeps the straws in place, so they aren't clanging around loosely in my glasses. If you like eco friendly products, I would recommend these for sure. I know that sometimes it seems like there isn't much that any one person can do but that's not true. Every little bit helps & you can make a difference. By using eco friendly products, reducing waste & recycling, every single person can make a difference.

"Fruit of the Loom Women's Cotton Heather 6 Pack Low-Rise Hipster. I have been on a search for some time now, for the perfect fitting underwear. I purchased Victoria's Secret bikini panties for many years until about five or 6 years ago, when they drastically altered the cut & they no longer covered my backside properly. I am not a large person, maybe a size 6 or 8 but I do have normal female curves & I like my panties to cover my rear & stay in place. So, I have been buying dozens upon dozens of different styles & brands on a quest to find some comfortable panties. A lot of them are way too high waisted, even though they claim to be, 'bikini' style. Since I am already short waisted, these nearly come up to my under-boobs & are not comfortable or cute at all. The biggest problem that I have encountered though, (aside from consistently inconsistent sizing) is that nothing seems to cover my backside comfortably. Well, I do want something that is low rise but this product takes it to the extreme! They are indeed low rise, so much so that they nearly show too much. I don't find that particularly comfortable, especially when wearing them under jeans. I like my undies to ride just below my belly button, not several inches below it. I wish that there were clear indications of rise on each underwear package. I believe that brands like FOTL, (which I have spent a lot of money on, only to have piles that I don't wear because they either make me look like Steve Urkel, or they don't cover my cheeks) should have high, medium & low rise categories. These definitely fit extremely low rise. I took photos of them with a pair of FOTL bikini panties in a size 7, as well as with a pair of the new VS panties in a size L for comparison. I hope that these pics will help others to decide if these are right for them, without wasting money if they are not. I know that I rely heavily on other reviews when shopping for clothing online & photos with a point of reference, along with sizing info. is super helpful. As far as sizing, I ordered these in a size 6 & they seem to run a little smaller than the size charts suggest, as I feel most panties do. Colors are assorted & not exactly as pictured, although I don't mind.  (I received black, purple, turquoise, orange, pink, gray).  Also worth mentioning is that these are definitely not 100% cotton but rather a cotton poly mix & they are softer than my FOTL bikinis. They seem well made & are pretty soft. They do actually cover the backside, which makes it all the more frustrating to me that they are so very low rise because they would have been perfect if they were an inch or two higher.  If you are someone who likes super low rise panties, then I would recommend these.  If you found this review helpful, please click the, 'Yes' button below.

"aden + anais Classic Toddler Boys Bed in a Bag, Liam The Brave. This appears to be a top quality bed in a bag set. I had never heard of 'Liam The Brave' before but he is just too cute! The little dog with wings makes me think of an angel dog. This print is all over with soft blue clouds on the white background. The fabric is so soft, I think that kids will be begging for their naptime! If you've never felt cotton muslin, it reminds me a bit of the gauze bandaging wrap, except that it is much softer. It's kind of hard to explain. The softness is just yummy, much like the luxurious feel of bamboo washcloths. I do advise that this should be laundered with care. Otherwise, it seems to be a lovely set. I am giving it as a gift to a family member who has a baby, as well as another young child. I'm sure that this will be much appreciated. The fact that the sheets are attached at the bottom is really cool & will no doubt, save mom some time wrestling with making the bed each day. The package came wrapped in a plastic bag, in addition to the zippered bed in a bag pouch but I was able to open it & feel the amazingly soft fabric.

"Purelux Hand Held Water Sprayer Nozzle. This is exactly what we needed to bathe our giant fur kids, while still being able to conserve water! The sprayer, (while good for other purposes such as kitchen or laundry room sinks) is the perfect solution for people like us who like to give our dogs baths in the shower but don't want to keep the water constantly running while lathering them up. Also, it is really nice to be able to keep an even water temperature & this sprayer allows us to do so because it is not necessary to turn the water off & on. You just press the trigger on the nozzle for water & release when you don't. It's so great! We had a similar one that was accidentally left at our old house when we moved. This is much more convenient than using the regular shower head, even if there is a handheld one in your shower because you would still have to stand up to turn it off & on. This works great & our fur kids are clean & happy! I received this product complimentary for testing & review. I would recommend it to anyone who has pets to bathe, as it is a real life saver!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ERMNPGIKNKH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODYAE2#wasThisHelpful","R2ERMNPGIKNKH9","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kids Vanity Set from Teamson Kids - Zebra (Aqua Blue/White). This is a dainty children's set with a vanity that has a three piece mirror that can be attached, (or hung on the wall if desired) & it also comes with a matching stool. It is little & is not recommended for people over 100 pounds. I chose the blue/white zebra color but it is actually much more of a pale, mint green than blue. It is still really cute, though. It has a functioning drawer for hair accessories, hairbrush, play makeup, etc. The design of this is absolutely adorable & I sure would love to have the matching jewelry armoire! The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that mine arrived with damage. I try to keep that separate from the actual product review if possible but I contacted the manufacturer several days ago & have not received a response. The mirror is broken & there are other dents & such. I will add photos soon & I'll happily update if & when I receive a satisfactory response regarding the damage.

They are definitely small but they are really tough & stand up to a ton of rough play. Nearly a month later & there are really no signs of wear. The price point is fantastic & really, you can't find a cheap plastic toy at this value. Even if you could, I doubt that any plastic toy would hold up as well as these do. For many reasons, these cat toys are a winner in my house! I took lots of photos of the cats playing with these little mice but they go so fast, it's difficult to get everything in the frame. I will post a few that made the cut. You can tell that the cats love these by the photos.

"Secura 1.8 Quart Stainless Steel Electric Water Kettle. This electric kettle was exactly what I needed! We don't drink coffee in our house, (gasp)! so we don't have a coffee pot & whenever I want a hot cup of tea or hot chocolate, there is no easy way to go about making it, other than the microwave. Since I am not a fan of frequently using the microwave, (due to the health implications) I was super excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product at a reduced price. I had been looking for an electric kettle but they were all super expensive, (the ones that I liked which had stainless steel lining) or they were plastic where the water went. Well, This thing is perfect! No fuss & super easy to operate. You just plug in the base, fill the kettle & turn it on! I timed it & it takes just three minutes until the hot water is ready. When it's done, it turns off. That's it! Of course, you should unplug the base when not in use but this thing could not be more simple to operate. You can pour the water out just as it is, or you can push the button on the top of the handle to open the lid, if needed. To clean, it simply says to run two full loads of water through it. That's all. There is no plastic touching my water & I can enjoy all of the different lovely teas that this world has to offer in only three minutes! I am one happy camper with this product. It is a bit larger than I expected but it's sleek design blends in well on my countertop & will be a permanent fixture in my kitchen. (I don't even leave the toaster out on the counter, so that is saying something when I like a product enough to leave it out all of the time)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2583A5UX41L6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BE7V8W#wasThisHelpful","R2583A5UX41L6R","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PROLOSO 9.8""x9.8"" Ultra Soft Bamboo Fiber Baby Washcloths 6-Pack. I L-O-V-E these! I never knew what I was missing until I recently purchased a gift set of bamboo washcloths for a friend who had a baby. Oh my goodness, they are so soft! I really wanted to keep them for myself, so when I was offered the opportunity to review these complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion, I was thrilled! The bamboo fibers make the washcloths so much softer than regular cotton or polyester. It is really quite a challenge to describe, you just need to feel the difference for yourself. I love to use these to wash my face & it makes it difficult to ever want to use a regular cotton washcloth. I am in heaven with this fabric! (So, if anyone else has bamboo cloths for review, please feel free to let me know)! The pack that I received arrived inside of a plastic, zippered pouch & the colors are different than pictured in the stock photo. Instead of two each in yellow, green & pink I received one each of light pink, dark pink, light green, light blue, light purple & white. This is fine with me but I thought it worth mentioning in case anyone is after a particular color scheme. My bathroom is mostly white & blue, so I was pleasantly surprised by these colors. At any rate, these are the best, whether they are being used for face, body, baby or adult. If I had enough of them, I would even share them with my fur kids but they get my old cotton ones! (I have Mastiffs, so they drool a lot & require frequent wiping in order for me to avoid getting slobber showers)!

"RFID Blocking Leather Wallet for Women from Leopardd. This is a nicely made, compact wallet that holds a lot of essentials in less space. It is much smaller than my previous wallet, so I am still getting used to the difference in size. (I took photos showing this wallet next to my old wallet, as well as a $10 bill for size reference).  It is packaged nicely & appears to be a quality made product. The double zippers function smoothly & reveal sides with ample room for money, credit cards, identification & so on. This is not a wallet to use if you like to carry large amounts of change, though. In this age of technology, it seems less necessary to lug around things that can add to the weight of one's purse, (such as a pile of coins) even though that is what I have always done in the past. I have a shoulder injury, which makes it all the more necessary to lighten the load that I carry. I mean, there aren't even pay phones anymore, so what do I really need like $8 in change for? I cannot speak for certain of the efficacy of the RFID blocking of this wallet but I feel better with the added layer of protection that it claims to give. Identity theft is a huge problem, so why shouldn't one take as many precautions as possible to minimize the risk? While I do always keep a few spare dollars in my wallet, it is true that credit cards have become the norm for payment of most things. It's safer that way & my shoulder is thanking me for switching to this wallet. I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.

"Lace Babydoll Lingerie Sleepwear Dress with G-string from TaiPo. This is an adorable babydoll with soft lace & satin trim. The color that I received is a gorgeous shade of deep mulberry, as pictured. It said, ""Purple"" but there was also a Dark Purple to choose from, so I wasn't sure what I was going to get. Luckily, I got the color that is more of a rich plum, as opposed to a traditional, amethyst purple. This is what I was hoping for. The material itself is softer than a lot of lingerie that I have, including the very expensive kind. The design of it is really comfortable because there are no underwires, the cups are padded & there is elastic around the ribcage area, as well as in the adjustable straps. However, it is sewn a little crooked & it runs super small, even compared to the given size chart. I ordered an XL, figuring that I would have a little breathing room but it just barely fits around my 31"" ribcage. I am a 34/36B & the cups cover but are small. It does fit me but anyone larger should size up. The problem really lies in how close together the cups are sewn. Unless someone is extremely slim, their breasts are just not that close together, thus so many reviews of 'the girls' spilling out. It's a bummer because this is such a soft & pretty nightie but it seems built for a very small person. I am usually only a size 6 or maybe an 8 but it is still ill fitting on me. They need to take into account that when someone is larger than an XS, their breasts are going to be larger & give a bit more space in between, too. If you are thin & not large chested, you may be able to scoop these up in several colors. The price point that these are offered at is a great value if you are the correct size. If they fit me better, I would get one in every color. I hope that this helps others to choose the correct size, as I often refer to other reviews to help decide which size to order when shopping online.

"Blue Wind 7ft/2m 20  Warm White Copper LED String Lights. This little string of lights is so beautiful & delicate looking! I played around with it & filled a few different clear jar/vases with different colors of iridescent marbles, along with this strand of lights. It was not as easy as I had expected to make it look as good as the stock photos in the listing, (they are really quite amazing) but I think that after some practice, I got the hang of it. I will definitely be adding several photos of my creations. This light set is bright for such tiny lights & all you need is a few AA batteries. There are so many different ways that I can think of to use these! They would look stunning as centerpieces for dinner parties, on tables at a wedding reception or just to jazz up a mirror or vase at home. One only has to use their imagination & the possibilities are endless! It's really cool how the lights are on a wire, which allows it to be bent or wound to suit the shape or size of whatever is being decorated. I had initially thought that I would string these across my antique mirror that is hanging in my bedroom but now that I have them in a jar with some iridescent marbles, I will likely leave them as they are & arrange my candles around it. I burn candles daily & I like to decorate the area where I light them. This strand of lights would look glorious strung around a garland or flowers, or pretty much anything else! I may get some more to wind around my glass grape clusters that we are going to hang from the ceiling in our kitchen, inside the opening of our skylight.

"VertX Mens Polarized Sunglasses Sport Cycling Running Free Microfiber Pouch - Black Soft Rubber Coating. I ordered these sunglasses as a gift for my husband. I had purchased a pair of the same brand that I meant to give to him but upon first look, we both knew that they were totally my style. So, I had to try again & I was super excited when I found these because he is really rough on his sunglasses & these have a rubberized coating, which helps to keep them from breaking as easily as plastic does in it's own. These don't look or feel at all cheap, (which I was a little afraid of when choosing the rubberized coating) & the included drawstring pouch is cool, too. I am really impressed with the quality of this brand of sunglasses & I am admittedly picky when it comes to my shades. I used to save up for the really expensive kind, only to be devastated when they would they become scratched or broken. I don't have the luxury of spending a great deal of money anymore but I still have a taste for nice things. So, I was very happy to purchase this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review. They are lightweight, comfortable & the lenses are clear. They are rated for heavy sunlight, which is perfect for my husband since he works outside in the sun a lot & also spends several hours every day driving in the daylight. I should mention that he is picky about his sunglasses as well but I know that he will love these. They aren't quite as large from top to bottom as some of the photos suggested & I am quite happy about that. They wrap around & block out light on the sides, which is great & if they fit my large head comfortably, I know that they will fit my hubby, too. I would recommend VertX sunglasses both for the comfort & the quality. For the low retail price point they are at, it would be difficult to find anything that compares.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLTDVBU9191R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZTNEQG#wasThisHelpful","RQLTDVBU9191R","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blooming Jelly Women's Sexy Bandage Plain Deep V Neck Lace Up Long Sleeve Blouse Tops. This is a super cute top with an adjustable lace-up front. The material is soft & stretchy, just like my favorite t-shirt. When I first took it out of the package, I was a little worried that it wouldn't fit & that I had made a mistake in getting this. It looked crooked at the lace-up part & I was afraid that it would look like a bad Halloween costume. However, once I put it on & adjusted the lace-up cord, I was pleasantly surprised. It looked great! It is form fitting but not at all too small as I had worried. It doesn't cling to the body in the wrong places like it appeared that it would, it lays smooth & once the lace-up neckline was adjusted to my liking it looked really cute! (it could be adjusted more for a sexy look but we'll keep it G-rated). The arms are a little long on me but I am super short & have short arms, so that is to be expected. I can scrunch them & it looks cute. It's not as low cut as it seems in the stock photo, so I expect that the model is wearing a smaller size & has it pulled down really far to show more cleavage. I am not sure that it would easily stay in that position, due to the stretch in the fabric. I ordered an XL according to the size chart & I would say that it is pretty accurate. For reference, my measurements are 36 - 30 -36 & the XL fits me well. It's not baggy like I wear a lot of my shirts but the fabric lays nicely. Overall, I am happy that I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M60T1L4HY9HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016F9WZF2#wasThisHelpful","R2M60T1L4HY9HP","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Utopia Wear Men's Jersey Lounge Pants - size XL, color Black. I ordered these pants for my husband after reading many reviews from other customers. The general consensus seemed to be that they fit slim in the legs, so I was expecting that. I'm not sure why but the pair that I received is a loose fitting pair that is exactly like the women's pair that I got for myself a few weeks ago. They are very nicely made with a good quality fabric that is not thin or flimsy. The pockets are a such a nice touch, too. My husband cannot stand to wear pants without pockets! These fit him ok because there is a functional drawstring in addition to the elastic waist but the pair that I received is definitely loose fitting in the legs, not slim as pictured. That is just fine with the Mr. though, because he isn't looking for skinny pants. Even though the leg are a bit baggy, I think that I chose the correct size because a size down would have been too small in the waist. For reference, he has a 34"" waist & is 5'11"" tall.  These are soft, comfortable lounge pants that are perfect for lazy Sundays around the house, or to use as pj's when it's too cold for him to sleep in his birthday suit! I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review. I would definitely recommend them, as well as the Utopia women's pants which I have & love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20M7ABMXBEK7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KFU0NA#wasThisHelpful","R20M7ABMXBEK7C","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"7 Chakra Crystal Healing Tumbled Stones Set. These arrived yesterday & I could not open the package fast enough! They were wrapped well & inside of a nice little keepsake velvet pouch with a drawstring. The first thing that I did before touching them with my bare hands was to clear them with a stick of selenite. All gemstones carry energy & it is important to me to clear anything that I bring into my home, especially something like this that I will be using to work with my own energy. (Not to say that there is anything wrong with who or where they came from, this is just what I have learned to do). The stones are close in size to what is shown in the stock photo, although a few of the ones that I received are a little less colorful. I debated on whether I should give this product five stars or four but after reading over the product description again, it states that you may receive stones 'like'  Amethyst, Fluorite, Aventurine, Jasper, Tourmaline etc. So, technically, they don't all have to be what is listed. I am not a gemologist, although I have been studying gemstones for some time & I am pretty good at identifying them, (with the help of books on this subject when needed). I am not positive on a few of the types of stones that I received & when doing chakra work, this can be extremely important. Again, since it is not specific in the description, I cannot fault the product that I did receive because they are nicely polished stones. I do intend on having them looked at, to identify for sure what stones I do have, (before doing any chakra work with them) just to be on the safe side. Dabbling with the chakras should definitely not be taken lightly, rather extreme caution & care should be taken. Overall, I am satisfied with this product, which I purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. They are nicely polished gemstones, I just want to know for certain exactly what I have. I am still learning about chakra work & I intend on being as safe as I can when working with my own energy, as I am with any other healing work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31UIJK86ODKLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JCNSD2#wasThisHelpful","R31UIJK86ODKLU","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hair Guard Headband - Clear Water color. This product was an absolute joy to test & review! From the moment that I opened up the package, I was pleasantly surprised. The seller had taken the time to wrap it in tissue paper & add a pink ribbon, (which looks to be a breast cancer awareness ribbon) with a logo sticker & an adorable keepsake magnet attached to it! the magnet reads; 'When you go through deep waters, I will be with you"" - Isaiah 43:2. There was also a very nice card included with one of my favorite quotes on it, that says, "" For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. - Audrey Hepburn.  I cannot express just how thoughtful this seller is & how great it made me feel to open this package & find these little gifts! They went out of their way to make customers feel special & I really appreciate that. The product itself is really cool, too! I got this silicone headband to wear when I sit in our spa because I have colored hair & the chlorine is not a good thing to expose it to. I must admit that although the headband looks really nice, I was scared that I might rip it. It is tougher than it looks, though. It is super stretchy, it fits snugly & does a great job of keeping the water out. I was a little confused about the shape of it/which way to wear it but I found it easy to adjust to my liking. It is much lighter in color than the stock photo, (which is just fine with me) & other than being snug it is pretty comfortable. I chose to wear it behind my ears since I am not actually swimming with mine. It's perfect for keeping the spa water from getting the hair on the back of my neck & head wet. The outside is smooth, while the inside has an almost terrycloth texture, which enables it to stay securely in place, It stretched quite a bit to fit my rather large head but went right back to it's original shape when I took it off. I think that this is a great product & I was happy to purchase it at a discount during a promotion for testing & review. I would definitely recommend this product, as well as this seller.The little extras meant so much & were such a nice surprise!  *(I will add photos soon).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OML6XTVF19U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01614MMF4#wasThisHelpful","R2OML6XTVF19U8","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TheraFlow Dual Foot Wooden Massager Roller (Large). I must say, this is a pretty amazing product! Not only does it feel great on my sore feet, it works wonders when I lay on it & slowly roll across it with it under my back! Of course, I am not making any medical claims, I'm only sharing my personal experience. I have a chronic pain condition, so it can be tricky to find things that help to relieve the pain. One thing that also helps me is adjustments from the Chiropractor but I don't get in there nearly enough as I would like to. Sometimes I find myself home alone & I get this pain between my shoulder blades, which is nearly impossible to reach for myself. This wooden massage roller from TheraFlow works great for me when I lay myself across it & gently roll. It's rollers are slightly raised, so my spine fits comfortably down the middle. Before I got this, I tried everything to relieve that back pain, including bending over the arm of the couch backwards & upside down, sometimes making it worse! This makes it feel better when I have nobody else here to massage it & did I mention that it feels pretty incredible on my feet, too? The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that one of the rollers with the large nubs hits the roller after it, so it does not roll smoothly as it should. I am hoping that my husband might be able to fi this, as I'm sure that it is a slight defect & not how all of them are made. Other than that, I am really happy with this product, which I received complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I think that this would make a very nice gift & I do recommend it. It may look a little strange but it is totally awesome!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8JLAOJFXFQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMJIYNG#wasThisHelpful","R2W8JLAOJFXFQV","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HOVEOX Tattoo Arm Sleeves - 10 pieces, random. I was super excited to test & review these complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. I have been looking for a good tattoo artist & I have wanted to do real tattoo sleeves on my arms for a long time. These are a great way for people who are considering tattoos to see what it might look like, as well as to see the reactions that they may get from other people. It's a trip but even in this day & age, there are still some people who get weird when they see tattoos! I am not gong to go as far as to say that these look completely lifelike but they are pretty cool & they certainly fool people at first glance. From a distance, many of them look pretty real. I think that they should sell these in tattoo shops because it really helps to see what it would look like to gaze down & see permanent ink on one's arm. They are also nice if you like to cover your arms but don't want to wear full sleeves due to hot weather. These are nylon sleeves, which allow the skin to breathe better than a long sleeve shirt.  As for the quality & fit, The quality of them is pretty good, especially the prints. I did have an issue with one of them having a snag already when I opened the package, (which was a little bit of a bummer) but I can turn it so that part is not on top. These sleeves fit me well but I am a small person & I did find them snug at the end of the upper arm, after a while. I suppose that this is necessary in order for them to stay on, though. I read another review from a man who was only able to fit them on his forearm, rather than all the way up to his shoulder & I agree that is pretty accurate for larger people. I am a small female, so I was able to pull them all the way up close to my shoulders but again, it felt snug after a while. These are a fun item & I appreciate them for the ability to consider & think about the real tattoos that I want to get. these would also be quite fun for people who just want to experience having tattoos temporarily. Of course, one could use them for part of a costume or kids could use them just for fun, although some of the prints may be questionable to certain parents, depending upon how strict they are with things such as skulls, weapons, etc. Overall, I am pleased with this product & I would recommend it. I am actually going to recommend these to the tattoo parlor, as I feel that they should sell them there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QL4BU59325BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI8IZP6#wasThisHelpful","R2QL4BU59325BS","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"iTinte Compatible Ink Cartridges for Canon Printer. I have a Canon Pixma printer, which is a few years old but was expensive at the time & still works quite well. The only problem that I sometimes have is finding replacement ink cartridges for it. They are often not available in-store & they are also very expensive! Naturally, I was very excited to purchase this product at a discount during a promotion in exchange for my honest review. These fit & work great, just like the expensive, brand name ink cartridges! I tend to print coupons to save money whenever I can. In addition to saving me money with the coupons that these will allow me to print, they are saving me a lot much money on replacement ink. I do not notice any difference at all so far in the quality or color of these, as opposed to the brand name cartridges.

"Kitchen Maestro Collapsible Over the Sink Silicone Colander / Strainer. This is such a wonderful product to have in the kitchen! I have wanted an over the sink colander for some time but I had never seen a collapsible, silicone one before this. Of course, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase this one at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am so thrilled with this product! It has exceeded my expectations. Even though it folds flat for easy storage, I have mine sitting across my second sink in my kitchen because I have been using it so often! It's super handy for washing fruit, which I do a lot of. It also is much easier to drain pasta with this, as opposed to a conventional strainer. Before I got this, I had a difficult time juggling hot pots & pans & straining the water without dropping anything. Now, I have an extra hand free for holding onto the hot pan, while the strainer safely rests across the sink. I don't have to worry about anything falling into the sink or burning my hands. The adjustable arms fit perfectly across my sink & are very sturdy. I had a little bit of trouble getting them all the way open the first time but that just showed me that this product is not at all flimsy. I have nothing but great things to say about this strainer & it is even safe to put in the dishwasher! The only thing I can even think of improving would be different color choices but that is just aesthetic. I highly recommend this product to everyone, whether you are someone who loves to cook, a vegan or a raw foodie who cuts up lots of fruits & veggies every day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SAXTVBV5X47C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CBMU62#wasThisHelpful","R2SAXTVBV5X47C","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Totalohan Mx7 Handheld Flashlight. It is no secret that I collect flashlights! I live in the mountains & we experience frequent power outages. I never want to be without a light, so I strategically place both motion lights & flashlights all around the house, so that they are always within reach. This flashlight is really impressive for several reasons. It is incredibly bright, especially for how compact it is. I absolutely love that because I like a bright flashlight for going outside at night with my fur kids but I don't want to lug around a bulky, heavy light. With this one, I don't have to! It is probably brighter than our largest flashlight, (which is a pain for me to carry) plus this guy has a wrist strap, several settings to choose from & is even adjustable with it's zoom. It comes with a rechargeable battery, (which I prefer) a charger & an insert which allows you to use regular batteries, if needed. This is awesome to have around the house & I will use it often. It would also make a great gift for just about anyone. It would be ideal to keep in the car in case of emergency, since it has an SOS blinking feature. I already have an emergency light in my vehicle, so this one is staying by my door, where it is easily accessible for nightly poodie walks with my dogs. I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.

"Utopia Bedding Printed Duvet Cover Set - King, Navy. I ordered this set because I had been wanting it for quite some time. Even though I am a top reviewer on amazon & it had been on a review site, it was not in the size that I needed so I paid full price for it & I'm very pleased with my purchase. The fabric is soft & is indeed wrinkle resistant. I was afraid at first when I opened the package to find that the white parts of the duvet cover had blue on them but it appears that this happened when it was ironed before packaging & it looks to have washed out. I have many items from Utopia & all of them are of excellent quality. I love duvet covers because I have large fur kids, (who of course, lay on my bed) & it is difficult to frequently wash king sized comforters without ruining them. It is much easier to frequently launder duvet covers & this one is so soft & pretty! I am impressed with the quality & I love the fact that the king size comes with king size pillow shams! I have lots of pillows on my bed but none of them are small, so I really appreciate large pillow shams. This duvet is a great value, even if it were on it's own, so the added large shams are like a bonus to me! I would highly recommend this set & the only reason that I haven't purchased the matching sheets is because I haven't seen them in California King size & that is what my bed is. I do, however have some utopia sheets in a solid color & they are terrific as well. As soon as I get this duvet set on my bed, I will update with photos. I can't wait to see this on my bed! it is so pretty & it goes nicely with my blue bedroom furniture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M63WMCTPFZRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNGYZLA#wasThisHelpful","R3M63WMCTPFZRF","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dead Sea Magnesium Oil from Magnum Solace. I have been using similar products with much success, so I was happy to receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. I gave the bottle to my father, to try out. I thought that it would help him with his muscle aches, as well as with his sleep as it does for me. Well, he called me to tell me that he put it on the bottoms of his feet before bed, (as I suggested) only to have to jump out of bed ten minutes later & wash it off, finding his feet itching, swollen & red! He is not a sickly man & other than the aches that come with getting older, I have rarely seen him have health issues. This reaction is definitely strange & not what I expected, so I got the bottle from him & tried it on myself. I am a person who suffers with multiple chemical sensitivities & allergies, so if anyone should react to something, it would be me. I am able to use it just fine, so I would say that it is a good magnesium product but as with anything use with caution, especially upon the first use. Individual results may vary. I use magnesium daily to help with a number of issues, including muscle pain, cramps, etc. I also find that it works well to aid in falling asleep when I spray it on the bottoms of my feet at bedtime.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JWUTNF8VQZJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N48BNGK#wasThisHelpful","R1JWUTNF8VQZJB","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tidy Cats Litter, Clumping 24/7 Performance 27 lb. This litter is pretty good, as far as clumping & such. I have found some that I like more than others, some that have way more dust, some that seem to clump too much or not enough, etc. This one does seem to have a fair amount of dust in it, as my male cat has sinus issues & has been sneezing & getting plugged up nostrils. The scent is strong & reminds me exactly of the scent of liquid Tide. That may be a good thing, or a bad thing depending upon one's personal preference. I ordered this because it was a great value & I thought that this was what we had been using recently, only to find out that I was wrong! (My husband had a large bucket of this, which he had re-filled with another kind of cat litter without telling me). At any rate, this is not bad except that the dust is an issue for my boy & the scent is a little more than I would like. I prefer my house to be scented by nice candles or sprays, not the cat litter or the toilet cleaner. That's just my opinion, though. I scoop daily & don't really need a strongly scented litter.

"SunLabz Solar Charger Backpack (7w) INCLUDING 10,000 mAh Power Bank and 1.8L Hydration Pack. My husband originally wanted this but since he isn't a hiker, he decided to hold out for another, more basic backpack.

(Does this sound like a personal ad for a relative)? LOL! Although I'm sure that one would need a larger pack if hiking such a distance, this is an ideal pack for a day hike, camping, fishing, mountain biking & all other sorts of off road activities. It has the hydration pack built in, (although it can be removed if needed but I don't know why one would do that) & the ability to charge up a low battery is awesome! That could be a real life saver. It is a very well made backpack, stitching is done nicely & it is comfortable to wear. The straps are nicely placed, adjustable & it's an all around awesome pack. It has reflective elements all over for safety, so that while wearing it one is easily visible to motorists, other hikers, hunters, etc. If you are looking for a lightweight pack loaded with extras, this one is pretty cool.

There are several recessed lighting fixtures around my house that take this size of bulb, so I was excited to try this one complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. I had my husband place it in the ceiling of the master bathroom, where even though there are several lights, it never seems bright enough at night. This light makes it so much brighter in there! Now, I can actually see in my dimly lit shower. The money saving feature of this low watt bulb is a nice plus & the super long life of 45,000 + hours is awesome! I need to get a few more of these little guys for my house! I am thrilled with this light bulb, as it blows away what I had in there before.

"eVogues Plus Size Lace Zipper Front Hoodie. I purchased this lace hoodie in the teal color in size 1X. I love hoodies & I also love to be girlie, so a lace hoodie is the perfect combination for me! I don't like to show my arms, so in the summertime that can be problematic. This hoodie helped me quite a bit because it allows the skin to breathe. It is very pretty & I love that they took the time to add the front pockets! It is super long, though & the zipper is difficult to zip up & down, which is the only reason that I didn't give it five stars. The color is a little less blue & more of a lighter teal than shown in the stock photo. Mine looks closer to the color of my photos without the flash but I included both, as you can see how it appears brighter when the flash is on. It does have a slimmer fit, so do go by the size chart of Junior's rather than women's as suggested. For reference, my measurements are 36-30-36 & the 1X is a pretty good size for me. It perhaps has an inch or two of room & falls way down past my hips, so I have to pull up the waistband & fold it over, or I suppose that I could tuck it in. I do like it a lot, I just wish that it were shorter. The arms are long on me as well, so I have to roll up the sleeves but I am a small person, so that is to be expected with many clothing items. I like it enough to want it in other colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PJB4M0OGZ3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGIBL78#wasThisHelpful","R29PJB4M0OGZ3H","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thunder Amazing Singing Birthday Candle. Oh my goodness, we had so much fun with this candle! I saved this candle for several weeks, (which I received complimentary for testing & review) to use for my recent birthday. I spent a quiet night at home with my husband, watching movies, eating goodies & such. I was super excited to finally get to light this birthday candle & my husband could not understand my excitement...That is, until he saw it lit! You see, I am a person who does not like the whole 'singing' before blowing out the candles thing & my birthday isn't something that we usually celebrate. This time, though it was a milestone birthday & this candle made it so much fun! My husband made me a gluten-free birthday cake, (because I am gluten intolerant) & I don't like frosting so when I add photos, please excuse the strange looking cake. When he lit the candle, he finally saw what all of my excitement was about! It went off like a screaming firework for about 20 seconds, shooting sparks over a foot high, (so please be very careful when first lighting this little guy) before it begun to open up, spin & play a lovely. ""Happy Birthday"" melody. It was just a tune, no singing, so for me, it was perfect. The show of the sparklers, spinning & such entertained us so much that we both could not stop laughing! It was great! I had to gather myself to blow out the candles because they were melting down to the bottom. Once I blew out all of the candles, (in one breath, thank you very much)! my hubby cut the wire as instructed but the tune continued to play! This just made us laugh even harder & he actually had to take it apart to get the tune to quit playing! Apparently, it had melted something inside, which prevented the wire from losing power when cut. I had originally thought that these were re-usable, (that you just had to add new little birthday candles to the petals) but I was wrong. It is a one-time use only candle. However, we were talking & laughing about it for the rest of the evening & it was totally worth it! We have decided that we will get these for each & every birthday of our own, or anyone else's that we attend from now on. They are THAT much fun! I highly recommend this candle, just be cautious not to get it too close to anyone or anything flammable when first lit. I will add photos of it lit when I load them from my camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZJ592A99CF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130B0QSG#wasThisHelpful","R1DZJ592A99CF4","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Woodstock Chakra Wind chime with 7 Stones, 24.5-Inch. So, last month my husband took a trip back east for work & he brought back a gift for me from the Woodstock Chakra Wind chime store. We hung it on our front porch & it sounds absolutely heavenly whenever the wind blows. So much so, that I wanted another to hang outside of my bedroom! I decided on this one because I was able to play a sample of the sound on here, in addition to the fact that it symbolizes all of the chakras, which I am studying right now. The wind chime itself is very well made & it sounds good, although it is a little smaller than I expected & the Om symbol that is shown in the stock photos on the wind catcher is not really on there. That was kind of a bummer, as it looked perfect & finished off the product so well but I will either find some Om symbol stickers to put on there, or engrave the wooden wind catcher piece with Om symbols, myself. I am very impressed with this particular brand & although I wish it were larger, (I may attempt to lengthen the wind catcher string) I am pretty happy with this purchase. I believe that I am hooked & I am sure that I will be a repeat customer of Woodstock wind chimes, both for myself as well as for special gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJFH0OJS60YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CB5S0E#wasThisHelpful","R1SJFH0OJS60YH","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Airtight Food Storage Containers With Lids. I have purchased numerous plastic storage containers over the years, of all different shapes, styles & brands. Some were better than others & some lasted longer, held up better in the dishwasher, etc. One thing that seemed to be a common theme around my house was that when I would go looking for a lid to a container, it would be missing, or vice versa! I often found the missing containers in my husband's car or garage, so I have identified the likely culprit. At any rate, after 19 years of marriage, I was desperately in need of some good storage containers with lids that fit! These containers are really nice, generously sized & I like them a lot. The lids aren't difficult for me to take off, which is important to someone like myself & they seal well. The size is just perfect for many things, such as a dozen cookies or leftovers from dinner. I don't cook every day, due to health issues so when I do, I tend to make double amounts. That is to say, I make enough for at least two meals. These containers are perfect for that because I can fit the second day's meal for two in them. They are safe to use in the microwave & top rack of the dishwasher, so they help me out quite a bit. I also like that they are BPA free. Time will tell just how well they hold up to frequent use but so far, I am pleased with this product. I purchased this set at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG3QDMQSU08NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CPKAFO#wasThisHelpful","RG3QDMQSU08NM","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deluxe Lingerie Laundry Bags. I use mesh laundry bags constantly, as I have a lot of delicate clothing. This type of bag has become a staple in my house & I am really happy with the improved design of these new bags, as opposed to the bags that I used just a few years ago. They now have elastic zipper covers, which hold the zippers securely in place while going through the washer or dryer. That is so nice to not have to worry about them coming open in the middle of a cycle! These bags from Simple Classix are different than any others that I have tried because they are stretchy. I'm not sure if that is a bad thing, it's just different than any I have used before. I suppose if one wanted to fit a lot of items inside, it would be a plus but I don't over-stuff the bags because I don't feel that things would get as clean if there are too many items in one bag. They can be used to hold wet bathing suits, shorts, towels, etc. after a day at the beach or pool. This is a great way to transport your wet items in the car without getting a musty smell, as long as you remember to take them out of the car & put them in the wash when you get home! These are also great for travel. One thing that I found odd about this particular set was that the two smaller bags have loops to hang them with but the large bag does not. Other than that, so far I am finding them to be a welcome addition to my laundry room. I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283STGB76ONVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QOARRNS#wasThisHelpful","R283STGB76ONVB","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PurpleRain Baby Washcloths. This looked like a really cute set to give as a gift to a family member who has a new baby, so I was happy to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. The set arrived inside of a plastic bag & tied with a ribbon, which had come loose. The ribbon was not at all as pictured either. Rather than a large tied polka dot bow, it is a small bright pink bow, which wouldn't do for a baby boy gift. The photo made it look more unisex than it actually is. So, I removed the two pink colored washcloths & re-tied the rest the way that they were supposed to be, going by the photo. I also added a yellow ribbon to match the color scheme. They cloths themselves are pretty thin material & feel like a fine terrycloth. They are not quite as soft as I had expected but perhaps they will soften up after washing. I think that this would make a cute addition to a gift basket, (which is what I intend to do) but I wouldn't give it as a stand-alone gift. Also, be prepared for getting a different color of ribbon than shown in the stock photos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2T757YBIAQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01444GKGK#wasThisHelpful","RW2T757YBIAQJ","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Only time will tell how long they last, so I will update my review if I have any problems such as running out of ink very quickly. I think overall, this is a great value. This set has two of each color, as well as four of the large black ink cartridges at a fraction of the price of the kind that we usually buy in-store & that is IF we can find them in stock!

"Reese's Cup Men's Licensed T-shirt. I ordered this T-shirt for my husband because Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are probably his favorite candy in the world. Originally, I was going to give the shirt to him to wear but then I thought about it. Wait a minute! If I wear this shirt around him, it will subconsciously tell him that I am his favorite candy in the whole world! LOL! So, my master plan has begun & I must say, it works great! Now, for the technical aspects of my review; The shirt appears to be well made & is appropriate in size according to the given size chart. It measures 24"" pit to pit, laying flat, for a total of 48"". The label states that it is 52% cotton & 48% polyester. It says to wash in warm water with like colors. I always wash new garments in cold water the first time, to prevent shrinkage & that is what I recommend for all clothing, unless you want something to shrink a bit. I like the heathered orange color of this shirt & they fun effect that it has on my husband.

"Aria Starr Argan Oil Restorative Mask Repair Hair Treatment. Ok, upon first inspection this hair mask reminded me a lot of the last hair mask that I tested. It is very similar in scent, consistency & such. I wondered if it was the same mask packaged under a different brand name. (That other mask was pretty darn good, by the way). Well, I used this mask on my hair tonight & the results were amazing! I usually use a leave-in detangler spray but when I test a new product, (such as this mask) I refrain from adding any other products so that I can gauge how this product worked. It has a nice, light scent & it detangled my hair pretty well in the shower. I left it on for about 20 minutes before rinsing. It left my hair soft & detangled but what really impressed me was how my hair acted after it started to dry. I have naturally curly hair but the more that I color it, the more it has relaxed & the less natural curl it has. This mask seemed to bring the life back to my hair. When I looked in the mirror about 30 minutes after my shower, I had amazing waves in my hair! The kind that you get from lots of work with a beach waves spray & often times, the addition of a curling iron! Oh, my goodness! This stuff is awesome! I always love a good hair mask but this one is supernatural. It gave me awesome, beachy waves without any other styling or products. This one is a keeper for sure!

"Easyology Premium Cat litter Mat -XL. I got this the other day & I was surprised not only by the size but also the weight of this mat. It is very well made. It's much larger than I expected, which is a good thing! It's so nice, in fact that I am using it as a welcome mat in the front entry way of my house. I tested it out & it does well to trap cat litter, as well as crumbs & such, in addition to dirt & debris. If you choose to use this in front of your litter box, it should work quite well. If you place it under your kitchen sink, it will trap all of the crumbs. (I have a similar one in front of my kitchen sink). This one is just so nice & large that it is going to be perfect for wiping off dirty, snowy wet boots at the front door. We live in the mountains where snow is a virtual certainty in the winter. Along with that comes mud & muck. Thank goodness that I was given the opportunity to test & review this product at a discount. It came just in time for the rainy, snowy season!

"eBoot Marshmallow Roasting Sticks. I received this marshmallow roasting sticks pack of four complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. I was excited to try these because even though I hate camping, I love roasted marshmallows! I opened up the individually wrapped packages to find that one of the four was broken off at the end, so I was only able to use three of them. (Thus, the four stars rather than five). I informed the seller of this but they didn't offer a replacement. No big deal, we were still able to use three of the sticks, which allowed us to roast six marshmallows at once. We used the leftover coals from our BBQ & the low heat as the coals were winding down was perfect to roast some tasty marshmallows. We will continue to use this method until we are able to afford a fire pit for our back patio. The telescoping design of these sticks extends to a little over 2.5 feet long, keeping your hands a safe distance from the flames while allowing you to perfectly roast your treat of choice. I prefer marshmallows but you can also do hot dogs, or whatever else you desire. We made S'Mores with our roasted marshmallows & they were delish! I will add photos showing the sticks in use, as well as the final treats. One thing that I want to note is that you are supposed to remove the protective end caps before use. They are not meant to be left on when roasting food.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFCHGA89F5OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146GH7KO#wasThisHelpful","R3FFCHGA89F5OK","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Petmate Chuckit! Indoor Fumbler. I just ordered these for the first time, so I wasn't sure how they would hold up to my extra large fur kids aggressive play. Usually, if a toy makes it past the first hour, (the golden hour) then it's pretty durable & worth the money spent. These held up ok & two days later, they are each still in one piece. However, they are showing major signs of wear. The dogs love them but they are pretty easy to rip up. They are a nice toy to have indoors because they are soft & don't dent or chip the furniture & they are also much more lightweight than most other large dog toys. The fuzzy, mop like cover has a foam, Nerf-type ball inside. It's nice & squishy, which makes my boy who loves to chew want to chew on it endlessly. My girl has decided to try & rip off the outer cover, when she isn't chasing it. My dogs are pretty careful with their toys, given their sheer size & strong bite but these aren't the most chew-proof toys & they probably won't last more than a month. That is only because we put them up when not playing fetch with them. Otherwise, they would likely be shredded in a day or two. For the price, they were totally worth it for us. Since we have introduced kittens into the household, it's nice to have some soft dog toys that won't knock out the cats if they roll into them! My dogs love to get new toys & after a few days when the newness wears off, they settle down & are easier on them. If you have a dog that is careful with their toys & isn't a chewer, I would recommend these. If your dog likes to chew, be warned that these are not going to take aggressive chewing & probably need to be put up after fetch time is over. I added photos to show the size of these, (which is pretty big considering the price). I hope this helps some pet parents decide on some great toys. If your dogs are aggressive chewers or rough on their toys, I highly suggest the ChuckIt! Large ball on a tug strap or West Paw Design Zogoflex toys.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19OLRIWMED13D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JRPQKJE#wasThisHelpful","R19OLRIWMED13D","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amariver Leopard Print Floor Mat. This is a nice little floor mat which can be used in several different locations. It could be used at the front door as a welcome mat for wiping shoes, in the kitchen in front of the sink, under a doggie dish or in front of a litter box, to name a few. I was originally going to place it under our kitten's food & water dishes but my husband finally assembled the cat condo that I ordered a while back & I placed it underneath the bottom ladder, so that the cats have a soft place to land when they come down from their kitty tower. It is nice & soft on the top & it has an anti-slip backing. The only thing that surprised me was that the print is a bit different than the one pictured in the stock photo.

"Handmade Glass Jar Wax Candle 7oz. Lavender. This candle is ok, I guess. Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from it. It was originally listed as a scented candle but after my order was on the way, the seller emailed me, stating that they had changed it to the category of decorative candles, due to the lack of scent. I wish that I had known that BEFORE I ordered it! They were correct, as there is absolutely no scent on cold sniff. It comes boxed & the little jar is pretty. There is a matching ribbon tied to the top of the lid with a label, which makes it look a bit more generic to me. My husband asked me if I got it from the dollar store! I was going to give it as a gift but not after seeing it in person, due to it's lack of scent & the fact that another person thought that it was a dollar store item. Other than the lack of scent, my main complaint is that it is only about halfway filled with wax. They could have made it a much longer lasting candle by adding more wax & since it is a 3-wick, it is likely to burn down very quickly. I burn a lot of candles, (at least two every day) so I am a bit picky & I know what I like in a candle. For what it is, it's ok. It's a decorative candle with no scent. That's fine but I prefer scented candles & that is what I was expecting to receive. I would probably have given it another star if it had been originally marketed as such when I placed my order but I was expecting a scented candle. The glass vessel is nice & will make a nice votive holder when the original candle is spent. Some people may choose to use it as a candy dish or for something such as a soap or potpourri holder in a guest bathroom.

"IRIS CLH Hooded Litter Box w Scoop and Cleaning Grate 15"" W x 18 7/8"" L x 15 7/16"" H  - Navy. Well, I purchased this as a backup litter box for when we are washing out the main one. This one is not as large as I expected it to be & unfortunately, it's not very well made. For all of the shopping around that I did, I expected this to be better. It has a flimsy top piece, which doesn't stay properly attached. The grate part that is supposed to reduce the amount of litter doesn't seem to help at all in that regard & it further shortens the space of the litter box. The included scoop is ok, it's slats are too large just as others that I have purchased & I have trouble with large pieces slipping through. However, it is convenient to have the scoop right there, where it rests on the side of the grate. I was sure that it wouldn't work to keep it there, (that the cats would dislodge it) but it goes in there firmly & does indeed stay in place. Overall, this is ok as a backup box but we much prefer our larger, sturdier litter box from another brand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15L24KCMEYS18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BDU8K6#wasThisHelpful","R15L24KCMEYS18","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deluxury Fine Accessories Premium Mesh Washing Bag Set. These mesh wash bags are a staple in my household. I have a lot of delicate clothing & I like my things to last, so I use these wash bags & line dry my clothing to prolong the life of my garments.

"Beckham Luxury Linens 4 piece Sheet Set. I ordered this sheet set in the navy color in California King size. I recently switched from a waterbed to a memory foam mattress & it is 14"" deep, (not including the mattress topper) & I needed some sheets that would fit. These sheets claimed to fit a mattress up to 17"" deep, so I was sold on that feature alone. What I received was a sheet set that is so soft & scrumptious, I can hardly find the words! I definitely like microfiber sheets but I usually reserve them for the warmer months. However, these are so soft & cozy that I can see myself using them well into fall & in the spring, too! This is a quality set. The color is vibrant & the stitching is nicely done. I love the fact that the pillow cases are king size, too. I have large pillows & I need the extra long pillowcases to fit them, so it's great when the pillowcases included with a sheet set actually fit & I don't have to purchase them separately. Also worth mentioning is that I have two extra large dogs who sleep on my bed & this fabric doesn't seem to attract the dog hair like some other microfibers do.

"Oatmeal and Neem Oil Shampoo Plus Conditioner 17oz. I am picky when it comes to products that I purchase for my fur kids & I am very impressed with this shampoo! I love the fact that it contains all natural, organic ingredients. I was a little afraid that this would smell funky, due to the neem oil but the scent is pleasant & mild. It reminds me a bit of an orange & peach smoothie. The neem oil is said to help to prevent fleas & ticks, which is a huge plus! Both of my extra large fur kids had a bath with this shampoo & at first, I wasn't sure what to think. They both have short, rather sleek coats, (although my boy has much thicker hair). When they first dried, my boy was super fluffy & frizzy. Oh, no! What had I done? However, within an hour or so, his coat settled down & looked sleek & shiny once again. This shampoo left both of them clean & soft. They don't seem to be itchy at all, so I am giving this shampoo a thumbs up. It is quite a generous sized bottle for the price, too. I purchased this product at a discount for testing & review. I will happily purchase it again, at full price when I run out of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MK6BC2UM7OBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141PQHE2#wasThisHelpful","R2MK6BC2UM7OBH","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thunder Chalkboard Stick-on Labels and White Color Liquid Chalk Pen. These labels are great for crafters & neat freaks alike! I am someone who fits into both of those categories, so when I was given the opportunity to test this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion, it was a match made in heaven! I like these particular labels a lot because they are pre-cut into attractive shapes that are perfect for any style of dcor. They are great to use in the kitchen, office, laundry room, etc. for labeling jars, containers, miscellaneous boxes, folders, & so on. They are also really pretty & you can dress them up even further in creative writing & designs with the included liquid chalk pen. I have a bunch of different colored liquid chalk pens, which work really well on these labels. You can even make custom gift tags, or greeting cards with these fun little labels! I like to save my candle jars after the candles are spent & after removing the labels & washing them, I use these labels to re-purpose them. Whatever you choose to do, I'm sure that you will find a creative way to use these chalkboard labels. They are just wonderful to have around the house & I would highly recommend them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV3KMLFFK4T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015J5ISGS#wasThisHelpful","R2OV3KMLFFK4T4","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aprince Solid Brass Shut Off /Bidet Control Valve with Short Switch. This shut off valve is exactly what we needed! We were looking for something like this, which allows us to shut off the flow of water while shampooing our dogs, without having to turn the water off & on. This does the job with a quick flip of a switch. It has a left to right switch that you just press with your thumb. Attached in between the shower head & hose, this allows one to control the flow of water. It would be great for those who like to turn off the water while shaving their legs, applying a hair mask, etc. It also helps to conserve water, so you can fee good about using this. I like the fact that it allows you to maintain the correct water temperature, too.

"Door Stopper - 5 Pack. These door stoppers are of average size & length. They work well on most doors, to keep them open, (or closed) as needed when you wedge them underneath. I got these because I have two large dogs who often open & close doors that I wish to be left open, (or closed) & these seem to solve the problem for the most part. However, my laundry room door, (which is the main one that tends to slam shut) goes right over the top of these, completely clearing them. So, if you have a higher set door, these may not be effective. I was shocked when I put one down & the door went right over the top! Darn it! I guess that door is hung higher than the rest. Oh, well. This handy pack of door stoppers has solved other problems for me. My master bedroom has double doors leading into it & even though one of the doors has a lock in the top of the frame which enables it to stay closed while the other is functioning, in my opinion it is on the wrong side & it cannot be switched. If that door is shut & the other is open, people can see straight into my bedroom from the front door. Not good! So, I always have that door cracked open & the other shut, which in the past I was having to find creative ways to prop the doors shut & open to the desired place. Now, I can keep the door shut that I want & prop the other door open to my liking. With these door stoppers wedged under there, even my big dogs aren't accidentally pushing the doors where I don't want them to be. Excellent! They are also great for propping open doors on breezy days, allowing fresh air to come in without having doors slamming shut. I was happy to purchase this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15802TA338416/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHQQD2S#wasThisHelpful","R15802TA338416","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set of 2 Trimmers - Nose Hair Trimmer & Beard Trimmer Kit. I have mixed feelings about this set, so I averaged the stars out based on my experience with the two trimmers. First, the nose hair trimmer is excellent & I would give it five stars for sure. It not only trimmed my nose hair, it shaved it clean & works better than any other nose hair trimmer that I have ever tried. It got to the hard to reach places easily & didn't leave any stray hairs behind. With my previous trimmers, I would have to use scissors to get the hairs that were left, which is kind of scary & I am glad to not have to stick scissors in my nose anymore! This is a fantastic nose hair trimmer & I would highly recommend it. However, the beard trimmer set is less than wonderful. The included comb is an average comb but the scissors are so flimsy that they bend when opening & closing them, making it impossible to cut any hair with them. They are probably not effective to use on anything but perhaps paper, in my opinion. The beard trimmer has even more issues. While I kept the nose hair trimmer for myself, I gave the beard trimmer to my husband. He is less than thrilled, to say the least. After we inserted the required batteries, (which were not included) the back of the battery case fell off & does not properly fit back on. It tries to come open every time it is touched, making it difficult to use the trimmer. The trimmer itself is not effective. My husband has a moustache & chin hair but not a full beard by any means. He tried to use it to trim his face, (on the shortest setting) but it would not cut a single hair! It even got stuck repeatedly as he attempted to get the trimmer to cut any whiskers. He was not happy about this, especially since I was standing there taking pictures as this occurred.  If this won't work on his small amount of facial hair, I don't see how it would work on someone with a full beard. Of course, we didn't expect it to shave his face, since it is only meant to trim but since it didn't cut a single hair & it got stuck, I would call this one a fail. We put brand new batteries in it, so I know that was not the problem. So, overall I had to average this set to three stars. I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU76O7Y3ECDDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131LZ5C2#wasThisHelpful","RU76O7Y3ECDDO","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cenoire Eluo Sonic Toothbrush. I ordered this toothbrush in the pink camo color. I'm not sure why I chose this color, as it doesn't match any of my handbags but I just thought that it was super cute! It comes packaged, along with instructions, two extra brush heads, (which are a great bonus) & the required battery. I always appreciate it when a product includes the necessary batteries. The case is long & slim, making it super portable & easy to fit into a purse or gym bag. I like the fact that it has an enclosed case, (which keeps the toothbrush sanitary & protected). I think that it looks like a fancy tampon holder or perhaps a personal massager. I asked my husband what he thought that it looked like & he said, ""a lipstick case"". LOL! That would be one long lipstick case! Anyway, besides being totally adorable, this toothbrush is very handy to have in my purse. I have had braces twice in my life, as well as a retainer & I then I had to wear an oral splint for several years to correct a jaw problem. With all of that going on, I was constantly brushing my teeth & it got me into the habit of brushing each time that I eat, which I still do to this day. This product would have been a great thing to have back then & I would recommend it to anyone who has dental work. It would also make an excellent, practical gift to someone such as a teen who has braces. It comes in many different colors & patterns, so there is sure to be something for everyone. The toothbrush itself seems to work pretty well. Although the head doesn't spin like my other electric toothbrush, it is quite powerful & leaves my mouth feeling nice & clean. I love the fact that the head has a tongue cleaner on the back of it. The fact that it comes with two additional refill brush heads is just awesome! I would highly recommend this whether it is for yourself or as a gift. I am happy to keep this in my purse so that I can brush my teeth when I eat away from home. I purchased this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review. I added photos to show the pretty color, pattern & size of it, as well as different angles so that you can see all of the parts & the tongue cleaner on the back of the brush heads. I hope that this review is helpful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3755SKN9GKFSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZMS82G#wasThisHelpful","R3755SKN9GKFSR","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zebest TM House Wall Adapter Charger Cord for DVD Players. This little guy totally made my day, yesterday! Heck, it made my year! It's really the little things in life, that make a big difference. I have a medical condition which causes wicked dizziness, (especially when I'm in the shower) & I found that having a DVD player in the bathroom makes a big difference for me. Having the tv screen to look at seems to help me greatly. So, I have a portable DVD player on the other side of the glass wall of my shower. (Hey, whatever works)! Well, the other day the DVD player quit working. I mean, it just DIED! I was not a happy camper, to say the least. I had my husband test the power supply & sure enough, it was the plug that had gone bad. (Probably my bad for having it near steam but I need it in there). I can't afford to purchase another DVD player, so I was super bummed. I have been through several months at a time where I had to sit in the shower & it was not fun, especially when trying to wash my long hair. So, I found a wall adapter & ordered it, thinking that I had solved the problem but it was the wrong size. (Long sigh)... Then, this baby popped up & I knew as soon as I saw the plug end that it was the correct size that I needed for this off-brand DVD player that I love so much but cannot easily find parts for. It shipped quickly & I opened that box like a little kid on their birthday! It fits my DVD player & I did a happy dance when it turned on once again. Now, I can wash my hair! Woot!

"Wastar Creative Square 2pcs LED Wall Lamp Bedroom Night Light for Kids with Sensor - Blue. I love these little night lights! They put off just the right amount of blue ambient light. They have a nifty built-in sensor, which allows them to know when when it is light in the room & they turn off on their own. This saves energy, money & prolongs the life of the lights. These are smaller than I expected but that is only because I first tried the clover light from the same company & I was expecting these to be similar. They also came in a two-pack, which I was grateful to have. These are really neat because they plug directly into the wall & don't require any batteries. I have one plugged in where I walk into my master bathroom, (which has all blue tile) & the other plugged in outside of the bathroom door in my bedroom. I love the blue glow that they put off at night. It isn't too bright to distract my sleep, (although I am a person who does like night lights) & they give off enough light to enable me to walk to the bathroom & back without having to turn on a lamp in the middle of the night. I am very pleased with this product, which I received complimentary for testing & review. I took several photos of the light in daylight, as well as with the flash on in the dark & then with the lights off so that you could see how it looks at all times of night & day.

"HAMIST Finger Clips Slim-Line Gray(Pack of 20). These are wonderful, multi-purpose clips. They are strong & sturdy, especially compared to other clips that I have tried. They are such a nice thing to have around the house because they are so functional. I used them last night as a chip clip, to close a package of expensive cookies that have bad packaging but taste oh so yummy, to hang wet delicates to dry in the laundry room, to hang leggings up for photos & to hang my pants with a top to have an outfit ready in my closet. I'm sure that they will come in handy for all kinds of other things, too! I love how they pop onto hangers, giving me the ability to double the space in my closet & put an outfit together without wrinkling anything. I have the flocked hangers from a shopping channel in my closet but these clips are also big enough to attach to the cheap, plastic hangers that you get at the big box stores. I clipped them on last night to a plastic hanger in the laundry room & it worked just fine. I am quite happy with this product, (which I purchased at a discount during a promotion for testing & review) & I would recommend them as a great, multi-purpose accessory to have around the house.

"J.TOMSON Women's Active Workout Athletic Running Yoga Leggings. I ordered these leggings in the navy color in size Large. According to the size chart, they should have fit me but they seem a bit large in the waist, so they pucker out in the back like some jeans do. Other than that, I really like them a lot. They are well made & thicker than most leggings. They are not at all too sheer or flimsy to wear in public. Although a tad bit stiffer & less stretchy than your average leggings & they are a better quality, in my opinion. For reference, my measurements are 36 - 30 - 36 but since these seem to be low-waisted, (which I love & is a difficult feature for me to find in leggings) they are just too wide in the waist for me.(I measured the waist & laying flat, they are 31.5"").  I would have given them five stars for sure, if they fit me in the waist.. I am really glad that I didn't order an Extra Large, (which I am always tempted to do when it comes to shopping for clothing on amazon) as most items seem to run small but these definitely don't appear to be junior's in size. I would say that they are of average length, (I had to scrunch them a few inches at the ankles as I usually do because I am under five feet tall). I didn't measure the inseam but I would guess it to be around 30-31"". I hope that this helps other shoppers to choose their correct size, as I often rely on other reviews with sizing information to find my proper size.  They are very flattering to my curvy figure & I will be totally comfortable wearing them in public, as opposed to most leggings which I only reserve for lounging around the house. I would love to have a pair in every color, I'm just not sure which size to go for, as I am afraid that a Medium would be too tight in the rear. I have many pairs of leggings that range in price from $70 to $7 or less & I tend to be picky about them. I look for a comfortable fit & nice fabric as well as those which flatter my figure, rather than accentuating any lumpy bits. I am a little person but the wrong cut or fabric can make a huge difference.  Overall, I am very impressed with these & I would recommend them.

"Solar Outdoor String Lights. These lights charged up well after two days in the sun & so far they work just fine. The string that I received seems to be more of a yellow color, rather than a warm white, (which I also have). They are a dainty size but put out a pretty decent glow, especially for solar lights. I have a strand that just quit working for no apparent reason, which is strung along one of my deck bannisters, so we are going to take them down & replace them with this set. They last for several hours each night, on the constant setting. I was expecting a lighter/warm white color but other than that, they seem like a good set of lights.

I always wanted a large kite, so I was very excited to test this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion. It seems well made & was easy to assemble in less than five minutes. We have had zero wind since it arrived, so we finally decided to assemble it & play with it in the driveway, without the string. My husband was like a kid in a candy store, running around the driveway with this thing! I was able to get some great photos, (which I will add later). As soon as we get some decent wind, we will hop into the car & head down to the nearby lake, so that we can see how this guy flies. It has been impossible, so far due to the total lack of wind but I will update after we have had a chance for him to get some air.

"Catit Carbon Replacement Filter. Well, I had high hopes for this product when I first purchased these filters, along with the littler 'house' that they refill. However, I don't think at this point that they do much in the way of controlling odors. I scoop the litter box every day, (at least once, if not more) & it still smells. I've tried different types of litter & some are definitely much better than others but the bottom line is that it does smell & litter boxes require a lot of cleaning. If they are not scooped daily & cleaned out & filled with fresh litter weekly, they just stink! Even with the above average cleaning of the litter box that we do, it still smells. This is why I don't feel that these filters are doing very much. I sure do wish that they were & that I could report good results but I just don't notice any difference between this one & the other, plain litter box that we rotate it with when the other is being cleaned.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R253W3PVKGO526/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NOEG3E#wasThisHelpful","R253W3PVKGO526","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"VertX Polarized Sport Sunglasses. I ordered these sunglasses for my husband. He has over an hour commute to work, (each way) & he often works outside in the sun, so he needs good eye protection. However, when I opened the package to inspect them for my review, I found that they are perfect for me! I showed them to my husband & told him that I got them for him but he instantly said that I should keep them, because they are, ""So you""! (His words, but I agree)! It is not often that I find such a great pair of sunglasses that I both like & that fit me so well. These are really comfortable & they definitely have the look that matches my style. They are clear, rather than white as they appear in the stock photos. The lenses are polarized blue, yet when you look through them when wearing them, they have not a blue tint but more of an amber color. They have a crisp, clear view, comfortable frame & I like them a lot! I am super picky when it comes to sunglasses, so it was awesome that these worked out so well for me. I usually have to get very high end sunglasses, which are way out of my price range. For that reason, I was desperately in need of a new pair. These also came with a silky white carrying bag. I am thrilled that I was able to purchase this product at a discount during a promotion but I can tell you that they are worth every penny of the retail price! These may be marked as men's sunglasses but I am a woman & they fit me perfectly.

"Women's Lightweight Open Front Long Sleeve Casual Cardigan. I ordered this in the charcoal color. It is a bit darker than I expected but I think that it is very pretty. It is super soft & comfortable! I would give it five stars except for the fact that it has a hole in the left pocket, making the pockets useless. I contacted the seller & they have sent an exchange. I am still giving the garment four stars for the overall comfort & style. I will still wear it but I will just tie it in the front, since the pockets are unusable. I have purchased several items from this seller & they seem to be in Junior's sizes. I got the large & it measures approximately 40"" maximum at the bust, laying flat. It is difficult to give an exact measurement since it is an open front design. I am a 36 B & it fits me well, although I don't think that it would fit much more than one or two sizes up from that. The arms are a little snug but it is stretchy material, so it isn't uncomfortable. If you have thick upper arms & are self-conscious about them, I would size up due to the sheerness & the snug fitting arms. I am a small person, usually a size 6 or 8, depending upon the brand & the size Large fits me well. I think that these are Junior's sized but I see that they have added extended sizes now. I hope that this helps other shoppers to choose the correct size. I know that I depend greatly upon other reviews regarding sizing when I am shopping online. (If you found this review helpful, please click the 'Yes' button below). I like it a lot because the design is cute & the fabric is so soft.

"Majestic Pure Argan Oil Hair Mask. I am picky when it comes to hair products but I like this mask a lot. I grew up in a salon, so I have had the opportunity to try most of the high end products that are on the market. I have thick, coarse, curly hair that is also color-treated, so it tends to be quite dry & I have to baby it a bit. Using masks that are super hydrating is one of the best ways that I have found to keep my hair looking & feeling great. This mask really impressed me, the way that it made my hair feel after it dried. I used it in the shower & let it sit in my hair for about 20 minutes before I rinsed it out. The things that I look for in a holy grail hair treatment are; scent, (my favorite hair mask smells divine) although that should not be the deciding factor, how well it detangles my hair & how my hair feels after it dries. The smell was pleasant, yet not overwhelming. I find that refreshing because some hair products, (especially with treatments such as argan oil) can tend to be unpleasantly scented. This just reminds me of an average conditioner scent, like the kind you get when you stay at a hotel. It detangled my hair ok in the shower but not super easily, which is one thing I look for in a great hair product. However, by the time that I rinsed it out my hair was tangle-free. When I got out of the shower, my hair was not tangled at all & this really kept the frizz away. It made my hair feel soft & moisturized and this was just a few days after I had my hair colored, so it was especially stressed & dried out. I will take this end result any day! I am really impressed with this hair mask & I intend to purchase it again, when I run out. I purchased this product at a discount for testing & review & I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TSOIKMFLO1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JFT9DU#wasThisHelpful","R30TSOIKMFLO1O","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shwizadle Flexible BBQ Skewers. What an amazing idea! Seriously, whomever invented this product was brilliant! I like a lot of fruit & veggies with my BBQ'd chicken but my husband is constantly complaining about how there isn't enough room for all of it on the BBQ grill. Well, these flexible skewers solved that problem! Not only do they make the most of the space on the grill, they are better at keeping the food on the skewer & not falling into the coals. You can do all sorts of things besides fruits & veggies, too. Fish, chicken or beef kebabs work well on these guys. It just makes using the grill that much easier when you have the flexibility that these give you. No more wasted space on the grill! Now, instead of using the dwindling coals for my pineapple & peppers, (& winding up with half-cooked kebabs) I can use the leftover coals for my dessert; Roasted marshmallows! Yes, please! I purchased this product at a discount for testing & review.

"Silicone Heat Resistant Grilling BBQ Gloves. These silicone, heat resistant gloves are an awesome accessory to have on=hand in the kitchen or when lighting up the BBQ grill. I have a similar pair in my kitchen, which totally save me from burning my hands on my gas stovetop, (the same exact pots & pans that I used on my old electric stove burned the heck out of my hands on my electric stovetop). A family member recently spotted a pair of these in my kitchen & for fear of mine going missing, I ordered this pair! (What can I say? I have cool stuff & my friends & family want what I have)! These gloves get the job done & are heat resistant up to 425 degrees, although I am not pushing it. I like that they provide protection from burns while I am able to maintain the dexterity in my fingers. They are textured but I can still feel what I am touching through the silicone material. I have also found these gloves quite useful in opening stubborn jars with ease. This is quite handy when I don't want to bother my husband, or when he isn't even around! I don't enjoy the helpless female feeling, or having to ask for help.

"Funny Saying Beer Can Koozie 5 Pack Premium Polyurethane Coolers with 5 Unique Quotes. These are great! All of my life, I remember my dad having beer koozies, (I think he even used them when he was drinking soda). I mean, why not? They definitely keep drinks colder, longer. Those old school ones that he had, though were made of thick foam & all of them eventually split, broke apart or simply wore out. I was so happy to find these at a discount for testing & review because my dad will really appreciate some new ones!

"Organic Yoga Mat Cleaner with Free Towel from Asutra. This mat cleaner works as great as it smells! It has a light, refreshing lavender scent that is not overpowering. I like that it has organic ingredients, too. I can use this to clean off my other equipment, such as my large inflatable stability balls & yoga blocks, as well. It doesn't leave a sticky residue & it makes me feel better to clean things right after I use them, rather than having any leftover sweat on things , later! The free towel that was included is a nice bonus item. It is larger than I expected, which is nice. It's not a body towel, (well, in a pinch, it would do the job) but it works great to wipe down the mat & other equipment. I suppose it would make a great sweat towel, too.

"Jolly Pets Toys Jolly Bounce-N-Play Dog Toy - Blueberry, 6 inch. My dogs LOVE these balls! I have two Cane Corso, (Italian Mastiff) & they love to play with these balls. Of course, we have the big, horse Jolly Balls, too. Those can be a bit much inside the house, though. This size was a great alternative. They can have their balls, without the huge size They are quite durable, although it depends upon how your dog treats his or her toys. If you don't pay any attention to them & give them this ball, they will likely shred it, even if it takes some time. On the other hand, if you play with them on a regular basis, toss the ball & let them herd or fetch it, they will likely develop a great affinity for this ball & be less likely to sit & destroy it. We have had these balls for several months now & they are still not ripped up. They do show signs of wear, chewing, etc. My boy likes to chew his ball, so I have to be sure to interact with him when he has it. My girl really loves to herd the ball, so she could play on her own for longer periods without supervision, if I didn't have to stop her from over exerting herself! At any rate, if your dogs have tried a Jolly Ball before, or if you are wondering about the strength, texture & longevity of them, this is a great place to start. I'm not sure if my dogs care much about the scent/flavor but it's a nice added touch to smell blueberries, rather than doggie breath.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBH6Q6JC56024/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VPA97C#wasThisHelpful","RBH6Q6JC56024","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Qing Outdoor Adult's Daily Stripe Beanie. This is a nice looking, well made beanie. It has an attractive pattern of stripes, which include black, blue, olive, aqua & bright green colors. It is 100% acrylic & is a larger gauge knit which makes it ideal for a warmer, wintertime hat. It is longer than others, so it easily accommodates thick or long hair & it allows you to scrunch it up for the slouchy look, which is always in style. I also like to wear a headband underneath, (to help to keep my hair out of my face) & that isn't a problem with this at all. This beanie definitely keeps my head warm on cold morning walks with my dogs. I live in the mountains, so I am confident that it will work well for those who ski or snowboard.

"Clip on Book Light. This is a great little clip on light. It is lightweight & portable, doesn't take up much space & can be used just about anywhere. Since it is battery powered, it can even be used in the car, on a plane, train, camping or wherever else you may need a light. It is surprisingly bright for such a little light & I enjoy having these for reading, as well as using my computer at night when I don't want to disturb my sleeping husband. The only drawback that I can find so far, is that it doesn't have the option of a power cord. There is no way to re-charge it, so new batteries will be required frequently. Other than that, it seems great for occasional use. I think that I will tend to use my other, similar clip on lights that have a power supply cord because it is much more convenient than constantly buying & changing batteries.

I think that most wives would agree that their husbands could benefit from having these on their wrists! I love that they are made from silicone, rather than latex, too.

"VIRGIN ONLY Women's Denim Jeans Printed Elastic Waist Band Seamless Leggings. I chose color 157 in black. These are super cute, cotton/spandex leggings that look like jeans with the comfort of pajamas! They pattern is very pretty, the flowers look hand painted & the jean details, such as the pockets, crease lines & such look incredibly real. They fool the eye from a distance because they absolutely look like skinny jeans! I have some similar leggings that were advertised on tv, which are nowhere near as stretchy & comfortable as these are. When they first come out of the package, they look absolutely tiny but they stretch to fit. It is difficult to shop for clothing online, especially when it is a 'one size fits most' deal, such as this. I am happy to report that these leggings fit me with ease & I would expect that they can stretch to fit up to two sizes larger than me & still be very comfortable. (For reference, my measurements are; 36 - 30 - 36).  The material isn't thin or see-through in any area & they are a high quality item that I would gladly re-purchase.

"Mic Mic Men's Marled Moisture Control Assorted Crew Socks, 2 Pack - Gray & Green. These are a nicely made, high quality sock. They are cushioned at the heel & foot bed and are quite soft & comfortable. I would definitely say that these are more of a Fall/Winter sock, due to their thickness. They are a quarter length sock with some funky stripes, as pictured. I received a pack of two, one gray pair & one green. My husband & I tried them on, in order to take some fun photos. They are really great socks, stretchy, comfortable & cozy. The only thing that I can caution is that they seem to run small, as they fit my women's size 8 feet perfectly & although they fit my husband's size 10 (men's) feet, they were a bit snug. Since they are being sold as men's, I would recommend them to men with a size 10 or smaller shoe size. After having tried them on myself, I think that women with size 7 & up feet would enjoy wearing these, too!

"Vaulia Lightweight Polyester microfiber Reversible Duvet Cover Set, Print Floral Design, King Size. I am absolutely loving this duvet set! I have a California King size bed & this duvet is generously sized, so that I still have several inches left on either side. It is so gorgeous that it's difficult to capture on film. You just have to see it for yourself! It is made really well & they even took the extra step to sew in a hidden zipper, so that you can easily stuff it with a comforter. I have tried different types of duvet covers before & it is difficult to find one that has a hidden zipper. Most companies just add a few buttons or Velcro, because it's easier. I prefer the hidden zipper because not only is it easier to insert the comforter, it is faster & it looks sleeker. The overall appearance is more polished when there are no buttons or gaps in-between buttons showing. I have my bedroom decorated in mostly blue, with a blue washed bed & dark blue furniture. This duvet set look so pretty in there & it picks up the other colors in the room & livens up the place. The only thing that I would have differently is the shams. They are red & I wish that they would have been blue, or at least reversed to blue but that is just my personal preference. Did I mention that this duvet is reversible? Yes! Both sides have a print on them & you can choose which one that you want face up, depending on your style preferences. I tried to photograph it to show how it looks but honestly, the stock photo is really great. The side with the blue at the bottom, (as shown) is how I have mine, (which looks like a Moroccan style print) & then the other side is busier print with more red & less blue. It reminds me a bit of a bandana print. I will attach photos to show for a better view. I washed on cold & threw it in the dryer on low & it came out great  wrinkle free. I am super happy with this duvet, which I received complimentary for testing & review. I would recommend it, as it is an excellent value for the price. It even includes the matching shams, which are nice & large for your king size pillows, (included with king size). There are different styles to choose from & then you get two patterns, (for when you feel like mixing it up) since it is reversible.

"Food Should Taste Good Real Good Bar Macadamia Chai. Ok, these are so yummy that I would consider them one of the top five tastiest gluten-free snack bars that I have tried, (and I have tried ALOT of bars) since going totally gluten-free nearly 4 years ago. In addition to being gluten-free, they are Non-GMO, with no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives & they're made with fair trade cocoa! These low-sodium snack bars have healthy ingredients, that taste good, too! The ingredients are; almonds, sugar, honey, tapioca syrup, macadamia nuts, palm kernel oil, toasted coconut, cocoa powder, cashews, sunflower lecithin, allspice, vanilla extract, ginger, cinnamon sea salt & cardamom. (The box states that they may also contain traces of soy & pecan). They are dipped in chocolate & then drizzled with more over the top. The taste is out of this world! If you love nuts, chocolate & chai spice, you should give these a try! They aren't overly spicy but there is a nice balance between the nuttiness, slightly sweet flavor & the mellow spice is nicely balanced out by the chocolate flavor. Seriously yummy! They do contain a whopping 16 grams of fat per bar, but that's to be expected when eating several grams of nuts. It's certainly a better choice than a handful of fried potato chips!  I would compare them to Kind bars, although none of the Kind bars have this particular flavor mix. This is definitely a snack that I want in my cupboard! I dig them & I hope that they will continue to roll out more interesting flavor combinations. Products like this make it so much easier to stay gluten free without feeling  deprived.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KU4PJHUXYGCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8Y0GCI#wasThisHelpful","R1KU4PJHUXYGCV","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"InsideSmarts Waterproof Car Garbage Can & Storage Organizer. These things are so useful! We have a similar one that we strapped with velcro to the end table, in between our couches. We use it as a garbage there, since we have two large dogs who constantly need their faces wiped & are always chewing up toys & leaving chunks all over the floor. It's also handy to toss used tissues into, (since I have major allergies) until we can empty it into the large garbage can. It's perfect for keeping the living room tidy & clutter-free. When watching a movie, we can throw our snack wrappers & empty cans/bottles into it & later sort them into the recycle bin. Another really great function of these, (and what we plan on using this one for) is a portable snack & drink cooler! It makes the most convenient & handy little tote to take along drinks, snacks, dog treats & such when we load up the car. We always take our dogs with us, (no matter where we go) so it is essential that we have with us at all times things like extra water, treats, wipes, toys & snacks for ourselves. This organizer from InsideSmarts has great pockets all over it, which is perfect for stuffing in our necessities. There's plenty of room for extra things that we need with us like poop bags, anti-bacterial hand gel & such. The lining is awesome because it actually helps to insulate drinks & keep them cold. This is truly a multi-purpose organizer & it's awesome to take along every time we head out the door. It would be a good thing to keep in the car, take on picnics or wherever your adventures may take you. I am really glad to have received this complimentary for testing & review.

"Utopia Wear Women's Jersey Lounge Pants. I ordered these in size Large, after reading other reviews stating that they run big. I like my pajama pants to be baggy, so I usually order XL but the Large is perfect. To help others order their correct fit, the measurements of my size Large pants are; 32"" waist, (unstretched, with the ability to cinch them up as needed with the drawstring) 11"" rise & 28"" inseam. The first thing that I noticed was how well made these pants are. I am impressed with the quality & the material is thicker than I expected it to be. The waistband has elastic, as well as a functioning drawstring & they even have deep pockets! I guess for such a low price, I wasn't expecting them to be as nice as they are but I should have known better, as every product from Utopia that I have purchased has been excellent. I thought that these would just be an average  pair of pj pants but I would feel comfortable wearing them in public to a casual event, such as a football game, grocery shopping & such.

"The Barn Decorative Wall Dcor Art, Inspirational and Motivational Message of Hope and New Beginnings, 12 by 16-Inch. I was so excited to receive this sign in the mail & I quickly opened up the box. IT was packed with some bubble packing but only on the back of it & the sign was face down! (I wish that the folks at the amazon warehouses would pay better attention). My heart skipped a beat as I inspected it, as I expected to find it scratched. It was fine, though. It was shrink wrapped with plastic, so I think that saved it. The sign has several inspirational quotes & is really quite lovely. I had expected to need to find a frame for it but once I got it in person, I realized that it would be a shame to put it behind glass. It is so nicely textured that it looks great just the way that it is. It even has the print wrapped around the edges on all four sides. The only thing that I found a bit weird was the back of it. I expected to find a metal hook or something with which to hang it but there is just a cutout. Not a big deal, according to my husband. It can be hung just fine, so I am happy as can be with this decorative sign. I can look at it each morning & when I'm feeling down for an instant pick me up!

I would recommend it as a quality product to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J6LS26YFEWRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VADTESA#wasThisHelpful","R3J6LS26YFEWRL","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excell Women's Fuzzy Socks Crew Socks, Warm Butter Soft, 12 Pair Pack. I am a sock fanatic & I am so happy when the Fall comes, so that I can wear thick, fuzzy socks like these! I chose the striped pattern of these socks & they are so pretty! Yes, I do get really excited about socks! I am a home body & I live in them 24/7. I have hardwood floors as well as tile, so thick, fuzzy socks are a staple in my wardrobe. When they happen to be as beautiful as these socks are, it's a double bonus! These are like sock eye candy! LOL! The pink & blue ones remind me of the bubble gum ice cream that I used to get at a local ice cream shop after school, when I was a kid. These socks are indeed buttery soft & feel soothing on my feet. For reference, I wear a women's shoe size 6 & I think that these socks would easily fit up to a size 11, due to their stretch. I am super happy with these socks & even though I had a little problem with my order, the customer service was fantastic & the issue was resolved promptly.

"Intex Ultra Daybed Inflatable Lounge. This thing is awesome! We bought it to lay on & watch a meteor shower that happened a while back. (We just laid out a blanket underneath, to protect it from being punctured on the asphalt).  In the past, we had always used lounge chairs but it is quite nice to have a giant, couch-like lounge that we can snuggle on. It is well made, has a soft, fuzzy texture on the top & the color is as vibrant & gorgeous as pictured.  The attached pillow is great to lay your head on, or you can sit up & have it support your back. I would imagine that this thing would be great for use at the lake, as well. It is large enough that it could be used as an extra bed if unexpected company arrives, or if you want to have a fun, sleepover in the middle of the family room! It's great that we can bring this out when we want to use it & then pack it away in a box, where it isn't taking up much space. We have purchased several air mattresses over the years & this is honestly just as comfortable, so I am really happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHLTNSVOVEDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7H7AUS#wasThisHelpful","R3CHLTNSVOVEDP","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oxgord Jumbo Pooper Scooper Dog Waste Scoop Sanitary Pickup Remover. I tested out my new pooper scooper this morning & it is quite a help to someone such as myself, who has health issues & suffers from chronic pain. This is much easier to maneuver than a big, heavy shovel. I have two, extra large dogs who eat & therefore, poop three times per day. This scooper does a good job of picking up the poop, so that I don't have to carry the shovel all around the yard. However, I found that if I tried to pick up 'freshies' they stuck to it & were difficult to remove. This caused the teeth to become clogged & prevented the scoop from closing properly. It did a much better job of picking up piles that had time to harden, although separate pieces were difficult to get into the scoop without multiple attempts. We try to pick up the poop every day, so even though this will be a big help, I still think that a shovel will be necessary for follow up work. If you leave enough time in between pooping & scooping, then you may not have this issue. However, my dogs tend to get excited & run through poop piles during play, (if not picked up quickly) so I don't intend to leave them laying around, waiting for them to harden. If you have ever had to clean poop out of a dog paw, then you know what I mean! Also, I read some other reviews & it sounds like it works better on grass than on bare ground. At any rate, I am super happy to have received this product at a discount for testing & review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2960DRWZAGVGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015P3T2PA#wasThisHelpful","R2960DRWZAGVGK","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love by Matt White. I found this song after hearing a different song by this artist that I liked & decided to sample the rest of the songs on the album. I really liked this one as well & downloaded it. That same evening, I was watching a movie, (which must be at least 7 or 8 years old) & this song came on in the movie! I thought that was so weird but super cool! What are the chances that on the same day I downloaded a song, it just happened to come on during a DVD that I was watching? I don't know, I believe that things happen for a reason & it is up to us to pay attention & figure out what that reason is. So, I started out by finding a Matt White song that I liked at the end of a movie, went to download it & found a few other songs of his that I liked. Downloaded them & then heard one of them on a movie that same night! Cool? I think so! I have heard that when we encounter things in life that seem to be a coincidence, it means that we are on the right path. I like that a lot. The song is called, 'Love' & what are we here on earth for but to love & be loved?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTVCNLIXH0N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XLUAIS#wasThisHelpful","RFTVCNLIXH0N4","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"eBoot Stainless Steel Straws Set with Cleaning Brush. These are such cool straws to have in the kitchen! It's like having the experience of an ice cream parlor in my own home. The stainless steel straws seem to keep the drinks colder when sipping & are much easier to stir with, especially if I'm drinking a smoothie or milkshake. This is an eco-friendly alternative to plastic straws, which would otherwise wind up in a landfill & they are dishwasher safe! I love that there is an included cleaning brush because sometimes it's necessary to get down in there, especially if a stray chunk of banana or something gets stuck! I think that this is a quality set & for the price, it's a great value. You get a pack of stainless steel straws plus a cleaning brush! They are a lot of fun to use. I love to indulge in a root beer float once in a while & these straws make it that much more enjoyable. The only thing that I would point out to perspective buyers is the length of them. They are a little short for some of my larger glasses but I have some short root beer float mugs which work perfectly with these! Also, it is supposed to be a pack of 8 straws but I only received 4. Maybe that is because I received a sample, I'm not sure? Or, maybe they had a pack of 4 but they sold out & now have a pack of 8? At any rate, I am pleased with the quality of this set & I am happy to have received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUHSZL1O1UZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015C56P38#wasThisHelpful","RAUHSZL1O1UZC","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"6 Piece Of excell Fleece Hooded Winter Ski Hat, Unisex. I am so impressed with this set of balaclava/winter ski hoods. I purchased a some a few years back that were quite pricey & they were so tight that I never wear them. I felt absolutely claustrophobic in them but the design on these is genius! First of all, they are a very soft, lightweight fleece that is warm, yet breathable. They aren't sewn too tight but they will easily accommodate a range of different sized heads, thanks to the elastic bungee cord that is built in. It is adjustable on both sides for a customized fit. Another thing that is really cool about these is the various ways that they can be worn. You can have your face covered with just your eyes showing, you can pull down the inner piece so that your nose is exposed or you can pull it down under your chin so that your mouth is exposed as well. In addition, (as shown in the photos) it can be worn as a neck warmer, scarf, hood & so on. The front comes down in a v shape to cover more of the neck, which is just a nice added touch. I really can't say enough about how well made thee are! I am so happy that I had the opportunity to purchase these at a discount for testing & review. When I ordered them, I asked my husband if he wanted one & he told me, ""No"". He said that he would never wear them. (I really think that he based that opinion on the others that I had previously purchased that are so tight & uncomfortable). Well, as soon as we opened up this package, he exclaimed that he wanted at least one! I knew that he would & after trying them on & feeling just how soft & comfortable they are, I am really happy that I went ahead & ordered them. I had planned on keeping one for myself & giving the others as Christmas presents. Since they come in a pack of six, there are enough to share, if you can bear to part with them! The value on these is quite impressive, too. For the retail price of one balaclava, you get six! This pack comes with four in black, one in gray & one in dark blue. I would highly recommend these to anyone who lives where it is cold in the winter, works outside or enjoys winter sports. I know that my chilly mornings out with my fur kids just got a lot more comfortable!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJSI0RH1Q0O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNI57V6#wasThisHelpful","R1YJSI0RH1Q0O5","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set of 20: HBY Solid Stretch Knot Pony Elastics Ponytail Holders. I absolutely love these pony tail elastics! They are the same, wavy material as my very favorite headbands that I cannot ever find in stores! I have been looking everywhere for more of those headbands & when I had the chance to review these complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion, I was super excited! They hold my long, thick hair up in a pony tail & keep it in place without pulling my hair. They keep it exactly where it is supposed to be with zero slipping. These are also great for making waves in your hair if you take sections of wet hair after a shower & twist, (or braid them) & then secure with these over night. The wavy pattern makes awesome waves in the hair, (which is why I love the headbands made from the same elastic so much)! There is no metal piece on these, which can cause damage & breakage to the hair, just a little plastic bead at the seam. I am so happy to have these elastics & I will get great use out of them. I would recommend them to anyone with long hair, especially those who have thick hair like I do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFZYD5H8QKYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PIM56W#wasThisHelpful","R3VFZYD5H8QKYR","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everbellus Full Length Solid Black Leggings Yoga Pants for Women (Large). This is an extremely comfortable pair of leggings, although I think that most people would consider them capri length. I measured the pair that I received, (complimentary for testing & review) laid out flat, so that people can have an accurate measurement, to assist in ordering the proper size. I ordered size Large & they measure at the waist; 27"", have a  24"" inseam & an 8"" rise. Although the measurements may sound a bit small, the polyester/spandex blend is not a tight fabric & has plenty of room for stretch. Although they don't appear as matte as they may look in the stock photos, they don't seem too thin or sheer to me, which can be a problem with some leggings. They fit me comfortably & for reference, my measurements are 36 - 30 - 36. The 3"" difference in the waist size would usually be too uncomfortable for me, as I am a person with Fibromyalgia & cannot handle tight clothing but these stretch nicely & don't feel constricting. They also hold their shape well. When I took them off, they did not look stretched out at all, even in the knees as some will. I am very short, about 4' 11"" & the legs on these stretched the 3"" difference to fit me as a full pair of leggings, even though my leg inseam is about 27"" so I just want to convey that this fabric has quite a bit more stretch than one might think. They hit just below my belly button, which is awesome for me because I am so short-waisted that almost everything comes up way too high on me. I really like the separate, sewn on elastic waistband, too. Sometimes those can be tight, scratchy or just plain uncomfortable but this one is sewn well, is soft & seems to help to smooth the tummy out flat. They don't feel tight like many leggings do & are comfortable enough for me to sleep in. I would recommend them for someone looking for a comfortable pair of leggings to wear under a dress, with a long tunic or as a comfy loungewear piece. They may be more of a capri legging on anyone that is over 5'2"" so keep that in mind if you are a tall person. I am really happy with them because I prefer a more relaxed fit. If you are looking for a compression style pair of leggings, these aren't it. However, if you are looking for something super comfortable, look no further!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGB0JUOZPPB9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NBU386#wasThisHelpful","RGB0JUOZPPB9L","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bamoer Snowflake Series 18k White Gold Plated AAA Clear Cubic Zirconia Pendant Necklace. This is a beautiful pendant with included chain. I received this necklace along with a matching ring complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion. The stones are cut incredibly well & they sparkle like crazy! I have a lot of diamond jewelry & very few simulants have ever impressed me. This set definitely does!

"Multi-function Headbands in butterfly print. I like to wear these headbands when I'm cleaning the house, to protect my hair from dirt & dust. They are a fashionable way to keep my hair covered in case someone shows up at the front door! I The material is a soft, lightweight cotton mix with just a hint of stretch. The print on the fabric is a cute, butterfly design that looks very much like a paisley print from a distance. There is also a heat-set butterfly design across the front for additional flair. I would highly recommend washing in cold water, either in a mesh delicates bag or on delicate cycle & then hang to dry. These are cool because they can be worn scrunched up, or they can be fanned out wide to cover more hair. Underneath, there is a sewn-in elastic piece, which helps to keep the headband securely in place. I find that they fit well & stay where they are supposed to be, without being too tight. It's a great value for a set of six & the assortment of colors gives ample choice to assure that there is one to go with every outfit. These look very much like a bandana, with the bonus feature of elastic already built-in. I don't ride a motorcycle but I think that these would be perfect for those who do, to keep hair out of the face when the wind is blowing. Anyone who likes the look of a bandana should try these, as there is no need to fold & tie them. Just slide over the head & you're ready to go!

"Catit Jumbo Hooded Cat Litter Pan - Warm Gray. I have some mixed feelings about this litter box, although it is my very first one so I have nothing to compare it to, other than the disposable ones. For the first month or so, it worked really well & by that I mean that it did seem to help to control odors. The four kittens had bad aim, especially at first & I was so glad that I purchased this enclosed litter box because it saved my walls! I did opt to remove the door before use, as I am claustrophobic & I didn't feel that it would be very comfortable for them to go with a door on there. Plus, with four kittens, the door very likely would have been broken off. It seems well made, although I am a bit concerned that over time the plastic pieces which lock the top onto the bottom pan will break. The odor absorbing filter seemed to work fairly well at first but isn't doing so great now, (two months later). Perhaps it is time to replace the filter? I did purchase additional filters but I thought that they would last longer than that. Even though it is cleaned out every single day, it does smell. Overall, I am pretty happy with this purchase because I shopped around & read a lot of reviews. For the size, this was an excellent value & it has served it's purpose so far. *Update; a few months in & we recently purchased another litter box as a backup while this one is being cleaned & drying. We have been rotating them & I can say that this one is really superior in it's size, as well as it's design. The other one has a grate which is supposed to reduce the amount of litter tracked out of the box but that doesn't seem to work one bit. I would choose this one again over others with a grate simply for the sturdiness & the size. I'm still unsure just how well the filter at the top works but I am going to add a new replacement filter tonight, so we shall see if it smells any less funky. With the amount of times per day we scoop & the fact that we wash it out once per week, I am quite surprised at how much it still stinks! It is in another room with the door closed, windows open & an air purifier going, yet I am still acutely aware of the smell. This is the reason that I do not give it five stars. I guess litter boxes just stink! I am adding photos to try & show the size, although it still looks larger in person.

"De-shedding Tool by Pet Lover Co. This is an effective grooming tool that is suited for dogs, cats rabbits & other pets. I have tried a few different de-shedding brushes of a similar design & I have to recommend this type to anyone who has a pet with fur. They are just so efficient at removing hair. Even when the pet has recently been groomed with a standard brush, additional hair will come out with this tool! That is hair that would otherwise be all over the floor, furniture, car, etc. This helps to keep the house cleaner, the pets happier & is just a great tool to have in the house. I even keep one in my car for road trips! The ergonomic design of the handle is comfortable to use & the grip where your thumb rests helps to keep the brush from slipping. Please take my advice & do these two things; 1).do not press down while brushing your pet. There is no need to & it could be painful. Try it on your own arm & see how it feels, so you will see what I mean. Pressing down won't make it any more effective, just glide it along your pet's coat & clean out often. It is so easy to use! 2). Keep a garbage can or bag handy, as you will be amazed at just how much fur comes out with this brush! I was happy to purchase this product at a discount during a promotion for testing & review. I would definitely recommend this type of de-shedding brush to pet parents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YY8W2G5CHOW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBJTYVM#wasThisHelpful","R1YY8W2G5CHOW9","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Professional Curling Iron - Spiral Hair Curler - Curlz (Pink). I love all of the products that I have from Xtava, so after reading a lot of great reviews on this particular curling iron I decided to go ahead & order it. I gifted this spiral hair curler to a friend who has some of the most gorgeous hair on the planet & I cannot wait to see her hair after it is styled with this cute, pink spiral curling iron. They come so well packaged that they make excellent gifts, even though it is difficult not to keep them for myself! I really like the fact that this one has an LED 'ON' button, as well as a 360 degree spinning cord. As someone who grew up in a hair salon, I have had access to just about every styling product & tool & I can tell you that one of the main pet peeves of professional stylists, (as well as clients who purchase styling tools from the salon) is a cord that doesn't spin because they get tangled up rather quickly & can become a hazard. Nobody wants to trip over the cord or have it fall off of the counter while the iron is hot, due to the fact that the cord was all tangled up. This curling iron is really cool because it allows people with long hair to easily obtain spiral curls. I am really looking forward to my friend's reaction to this gift & I will try to get her to send some photos of her hair curled, if she doesn't mind. Her hair is seriously to be envied & I cannot wait to see it after she has spiral curled it! I was happy to receive this product complimentary for testing & review. I am thrilled with my other Xtava curling iron & I think that my friend will be equally charmed with this one. I will update with photos if she agrees to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VW8JJ2JYDMQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2WYAVE#wasThisHelpful","R1VW8JJ2JYDMQF","AWVG62F959NOW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWVG62F959NOW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It does have In-app-purchasing, Analytic addons and Social network integrations that just detract from the quality of the app (in my opinion).  Paid apps should be void of this junk and why do Developers think we all need to share scores, comments, etc. with the world every time we play a game?  Just another way for people to SPY on us and target us for  more ADVERTISING.  I have to deduct a Star for this and because the app freezes ocassionally on my Tablet.

Better to be SAFE than sorry with sketchy Apps like this one that start off with adding negative, intrusive junk to your device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDU2OQ6ZF7CRH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LOMNHXU#wasThisHelpful","RDU2OQ6ZF7CRH","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tesla's Mist is well designed with good Graphics and neat Puzzles that can get tricky at times.  Fortunately, it does have a Map and a HINT GUIDE to help you... go to the NOTEPAD in inventory to get a screen that has Icons for Map or Hints.  There is also a walkthrough available in YouTube if you want to go that route.  This is an Enjoyable game that is NOT Hidden Object style but true Point and Click Adventure.  Lots of moving around looking for clues but that neat Puzzles make it more Entertaining and Satisfying.  No Malware or Intrusive junk to spoil the fun either.  There are good options to adjust volumes and no annoying advertising or Pushy (rate me) tactics.  A decent game that is not terribly long but a bargain for the low price and good quality.  A little more like an Escape game style but nice and casual Fun.  I recoomend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTI7NAQKDACP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADIT8U2#wasThisHelpful","R1KTI7NAQKDACP","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rather Neat game where you ram your Vehicle into Zombies and all kinds of obstacles on your route to the next Garage.  You earn game cash with every level you play.  Then you can buy numerous Auto Upgrades like Fuel, bigger Engine or Tires, Turbo Boosters, etc.  Each upgrade enhances your ability to make more Zombie kills and longer distances on the level.  It is nicely designed, easy to play and poses Fun Challenges and has good Graphics and Sound effects.  Controls work well and you can even upgrade to newer and larger vehicles.  Lots of Variety in choosing options and actual game play decisions.  I find it very Enjoyable and Satisfying.  It is SAFE with no Malware or nasty Addons.  Plays well with WiFi off also.  DISLIKES: FRANTIC sounding Music but it can be Muted.  Will EXIT with Back key but game still stays in memory so requires Task killing to shut down completely.

"A new twist on H.O. style games; This one has a Storyline, Earning Money to purchase items, Mini-Games and variable search styles.  It has a Hint button, Mute option and lots of items to purchase after you get enough money to go shopping.  The Match 3 type game is different with items that need to be dropped to bottom (by correct matching below them) so you to aquire them.  Surprisingly Fun activity for an H.O. game.  Many people get bored with H.O.Games but this one keeps you engaged pretty well and requires more fun decision making to progress nicely.  It also has an optional Casual mode that eliminates Timer and makes playing easier.  Music is OK but can be Muted.  Graphics are good and there is a Pinch into ZOOM feature that helps for finding elusive items.  It has a little Advertising for other games but can be played with WiFi off so children will not be able to buy any.  Has Flurry Analytics and Game Circle but seems SAFE enough.  It also EXITS Cleanly if you use the Exit icon on bottom right of Main Screen.  Sadly, you have to be in the Decorating room screen before you can get to the Settings icon to get back to Main Menu so you can Exit properly.  This is a little TEDIOUS so I subtract 1 Star.  I still like it and it's worth the cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBPUYJ3JROAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F52YOPA#wasThisHelpful","RCBPUYJ3JROAQ","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Engaging game play with wonderful Graphics, realistic physics challenges and neat Music and Sound effects.  Very relaxing, casual play with no Timers and pleasant, soothing music.  It has 120 Beautifully designed levels that pose some pretty difficult challenges.  You have to aim and shoot varying types of Bombs to destroy as much of each level objects as possible.  It requires at least 90% destruction to pass each level.  Controls work very well and I discovered that you can BANK YOUR SHOTS off the screen walls to get better placement of bombs.  Very Enjoyable though it gets very tough early on.  It takes some trial and error with differring strategies to get the hang of best ways to play.  App is SAFE with No Malware  or intrusive Addons.  It also plays fine with WiFi off and Exits cleanly with an EXIT prompt from a pop-up screen.Overall, one of the BEST apps I have seen in awhile from Amazon.  Addictive, challenging Fun that is Satisfying and pleasant (once you get used to changing strategies constantly).  Definitely a 5 STAR app that is SAFE, User Friendly (with casual play) and priced perfectly.

"This is one of the best and longest Mystery/Adventure games I have purchased.  The Puzzles are wonderfully Unique and challenging.  Gameplay works well on my 10&#34; Tablet and it is Engaging, Enjoyable and Satisfying to play.However, it continually DELETED my Saved games.  I exited properly within the game and answered the prompt to Quite game but the Saved game was lost when I would come back to it.  Originally did this glitch off and on but now doing it every time so I can not continue game.  Big Fish (Developer) has known about this problem for at least 14 Months now according to REVIEW HISTORY.  A great number of users have reported the problem but they have not fixed it and still sell it new users (like me) who end up losing our money and getting FRUSTRATED!I though BIG FISH was a good developer with great App Quality but now know better.

"Nice Physics Puzzles to solve while moving your ROBOT through 100 levels in a Platform style design.  NO Instructions make it a little difficult to get started but it is totally INTUITIVE so you have to figure out how to interact with all objects.  By trial and error you find that Blocks can be moved by touching amd dragging them.  They are Magnetic and will stick together too.  Use Electric doors, ramps elevator platform vehicles, caterpillar-like critter, etc. to move your Robot Up-Down-Around towards the level exit goal.  Graphics are simple, physics are good, sounds are realistic and movements are smooth.  It has a REDO button on top right and Level select (X) on top left of screen.  Plays well with WiFi off and EXITS Cleanly with use of Back Key.  I like the challenges very much but had to deduct 1 STAR due to NO INSTRUCTIONS or MENUS, Settings, etc.  It also has an Analytic ADDON.  SAFE, Challenging Fun so I would recommend it.

"This app is well done with plenty of diversity and neat challenges.  Graphics are excellent and Puzzles are great.  Menus, Inventory and Options are all USER FRIENDLY and add greatly to a Fun and Engaging experience.  Controls work well, has a Zoom feature for Hidden Object scenes and a decent Map that can take you quickly to locations if you DOUBLE TAP on the desired spot of map.  It also play with WiFi off and EXITS Cleanly.The BAD NEWS:  It imposes (5) ANALYTIC ADDONS to keep track of what you do while playing the game.  It also has unnecessary Permissions to divulge your device ACCOUNTS, Retrieve Running apps and other private info to unknown parties.  TOO INTRUSIVE so I SUBTRACT 3 STARS!Without all the SPYING, this would be a 5 Star app that is reasonably priced for a well designed and lengthy game.

Grids can be turned on or off,  music can be Muted and game EXITS CLEANLY.  The 220 challenging levels are cleverly designed to keep you engaged and satisfied with smooth, casual play and increasing difficulty as you progress.  Everything in the game works well and it has NO permissions, Adware, IAP's or Analytics to annoy us.  Totally FUN with addictive puzzles and completely safe.

"Nice Massager with 3 Globe lights that alternately change colors while vibration is turned on.  Comfortable in your hand and lightweight.  Massage effects are decent but certainly not as good as professional massagers.  Great for light Massaging of Muscles BT also a neat device to play with.  I use mine to entertain the Grandkids and calm them after wild their active play.  They Love it, Giggle and Laugh a lot while getting their Backs, Arms, Lags and even their Heads massaged.  A Cheap device that produces lots of Fun and Comfort.Overall, a handy Massage device that produces Enjoyment and Fun for the family.  Batteries last a reasonable amount if time.  Looks nice but is made of CHEAP MATERIALS (like many CHINA products) so not sure how long it will last.

Levels are completed after you hit and remove all the strings of yellow (star-like) objects from the screen.

"The GRAPHICS are good and the PUP is adorable.  No Instructions except Visual, 1 page depictions (when you tap the ?). They are simple and Vague for young Kids.  Boring for Adults but may be OK for younger Kids if you help them learn what tasks need to be completed and how to accomplish them properly.  Takes a little while to figure it all out.  There are several ROOMS with different activities for the Pup.  There is also a YARD setting where the Pup searches for spots to Dig for items or do HIS BUSINESS and you can pick it up with scooper.  Picture bubbles float above the Pup to let you know what the Pup needs next.  You move to others scenes by touching the Doghouse on upper right corner of the screen.  Activities are OK but the controls are Sloppy and SLUGGISH when trying to move the Dog around.  Sound effects are Minimal and No Music.  Safe download but contains Flurry Analytics.

"The Graphics are great, Sound Effects are good and Puzzles are fun to solve.  You have to remember to use the Arrow buttons on bottom left and right to pan around in many if the rooms.  The Found Items are often tiny and you can not tell what they are.  There are no Labels or popup text to tell you what the item is either.  This can be frustrating at times when you struggle to determine how to use an UNKNOWN ITEM.  Some of the items have to be combined with others before you can use them also.  Challenging levels are fun but unnecessary frustration ruins the joy and degrades the REPLAY VALUE of this game.  I do like that it has a LINK to YouTube Walkthrough if you get stuck.Many of the needed actions do not make much sense so it is not terribly USER FRIENDLY.  Somewhat SAFE but does include ADMOB that CAN SHARE YOUR Device ID and Location with unknown  3rd parties.  I prefer PRIVACY!  App is Just OK, not great like many others Escape games.

"Nice Theme, decent Graphics and Sound effects.  However, you have to complete required takes in a precise order (most of the time) so that forces you to do a much more CLICKING than necessary.  The constant panning around to look for items is annoying too because the view changes don't always make sense and create a need for more extra clicking to find your way around.  It does have a List of required tasks that can help you comply with needed steps.  There is a decent HINT system that is helpful by simply tapping on the task description in the Task list to bring up HINT options.  Constant requirement reminders to TAKE PICTURES is annoying because you have to do it to continue progress.  Game is just OK to me and has Hidden Ads for more apps.  They come up when you are clicking in search of needed items.Overall an OK app but not great.  Too many irrtitants degrade Replay Value.

"Another GREAT Game from (10 Tons) who has earned my Respect and Admiration with previous good Quality apps.  This one has varying Octagonal shaped boards where you Match 3 or more like items until you clear the board of all pieces.  It starts off with good Instructions and each level is selected by tapping on a picture puzzle piece. NOTE: The ones with a STAR are tougher.  There are Compass pieces that act like a Wild Card and will match ANY other items.  Frozen pieces are more challenging and require adjacent matches to Thaw them out.  It has 12 selectable Packs with 12 or 24 Levels in each Pack.  There are 4 Difficulty levels from Easy to Extreme.  Music is soothing.  Volume for Music or Sound efffects can be adjusted.  Challenges are Fun and Satisfying.  Part of each Picture Puzzle is revealed when you complete each level.  Play is CASUAL with NO TIMER or pressure.  There is a useful REDO button too.  Plays with WiFi off.I find it Enjoyable and Satisfying as well as completely SAFE from Malware, Advertising or Intrusive Addons or questionable Permissions.  I TRUST this Developer and have enjoyed most of their apps.  It also EXITS Cleanly and completely.  I gladly recommend it for Fun, Casual play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCF5TSOM2XW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KHDN1I#wasThisHelpful","R1JCF5TSOM2XW8","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Escape game starts off rather Simple and Easy and has very good graphics.  Most of the levels are Short and pretty simplistic.  However, some levels have Number combinations that get quite complicated... difficult to figure out but not impossible.  Luckily, they have a YouTube Link that will show you a Walkthrough video to help you.  Most required steps are logical but some are strange and require some ODD OUTSIDE THE BOX thinking to solve.  This can get somewhat aggregating to many users that are used to better quality apps.  This is a Fun game but lacks the Atmosphere and Polished Puzzle style of many other better designed, Highly polished Escape apps that give better Satisfaction and are longer.Overall, it is an OK app that is Safe with no Malware or intrusive Addons and offers a good Help option to users.  However, it lacks the Polish and sophistication of so many Better apps.  It is also way too short for a Paid app.  It does Exit properly with back key but stays in device memory unless you stop it with a Task Killer.  I find it somewhat dissatisfying and not enjoyable enough to have any REPLAY VALUE.  I wish the developer would improve this but realistically doubt it.  They have great potential. Too bad it let's you down!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFQC5J604RFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LC93GCC#wasThisHelpful","R1EFQC5J604RFU","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another ENJOYABLE puzzle game with Vibrant colors and nifty Sound Effects that can be muted with a single Tap on speaker Icon. Clean and simple to play. 100 levels for you to master. Very engaging and satisfying. Kudos to THE OAK TEAM for making another highly polished app with NO Permissions, intrusive adware or malware. It is rare to find such a totally SAFE app and it is bargain priced at $0.99 to boot. This app is suitable for all ages and parents don't need to worry about it trying trick your kids into spending your money through enticing Links.Overall, an Excellent app that keeps you entertained and challenged in a very CASUAL Manner with soothing Music and NEAT graphics. The only complaint most people have is the persistent nagging for an app Rating. However, this can easily be stopped by a one time tap on the RATE button and you can just go back to the app and the rating requests are STOPPED forever. I choose not to deduct any stars for the nagging because it is so easily resolved permanently.

"Nice game for Kids to learn and exercise many duties required to care for animals improperly.  Each Animal has a Clipboard that tells you what type of care is needed to keep it happy and healthy.  Even tells you what Ailments they have so you can decide what to use (from your care inventory) to treat them, like Injection, Pills, Bandage, etc.  You also have told keep their Pens clean, filled with straw and supplied with Food and Water.  All this is Fun and Challenging but gets very REPETITIVE after a short while since it is the same thing over and over.  The only break from the repetitious chores is when one of the animals gets Adopted.  Then, you clean his pen and start the same cycle over again.Overall, well designed to accomplish the tasks and has nice graphics and sound effects.  The controls are sometimes quirky and I had to repeatedly touch items before I could pick them up properly.  It also has a LINK to purchase more apps at Amazon app store and a Facebook link.  This is not appropriate for an app designed primarily for Kids.  At least it will play with WiFi OFF.  Also Exits cleanly.  It is Safe with no Malware or Intrusive Pertmissions but has Flurry Analytics.  It gets Boring and monotonous after a bit and makes you hurry to take Care of many animals as new ones keep arriving.  Even small Kids get tired of too much repetitioin so I expect little REPLAY VALUE.  Disappointing!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1EILAKV019D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8LU122#wasThisHelpful","RK1EILAKV019D","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not a standard JIGSAW puzzle... Pieces are all rectangular and a box is highlighted to show where the next piece should go.  Your task is to figure out which of the displayed pieces is the correct one to place next.  It will TIME OUT if you take too long.  The play is harder than it appears at first and your game ends if you pick too many wrong pieces also.  Quite challenging but fun to master after you get used to it.  It has good Sound effects and Music that can be adjusted.  Graphics are good and controls work well.  SAFE with No Malware or nasty Addons.Overall, a fun and engaging puzzle style that is different than most.  Enjoyable  and a little frustrating at same time.  Well worth a try.

"Lots of challenging puzzles that are moderately challenging with Casual play make this app very Enjoyable.  The Graphics are neat and the Music and Sound effects are pleasant and appropriate for the atmosphere.  Sounds and/or Music can be turned off by the user.  It contains 18 levels and each has many clever puzzles to keep you engaged.  Some are quite tough to figure out.  However, there is a quick Link to a helpful YouTube Walkthrough if you get stuck.  I enjoy this game very much and it will play with WiFi off also.  It has NO Malware or Intrusive Addons.  Permissions are appropriate and no Advertising except a link for the Developer's other apps.  A pleasant playing atmosphere.Overall, a Fun app that keeps your Puzzle solving skills well exercised in a casual way.  No pressure by Timers but it does get harder as you play.  It does Exit with back key but only saves from the beginning of your level (not where you left off).  It also remains in memory after you exit so I had to deduct 1 Star for these two minor irritants.  A little shorter than I would like but still worth the price for good, clean fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BUI5OVF7I4CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCC6UR6#wasThisHelpful","R2BUI5OVF7I4CU","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent Graphics, Charming Characters and interesting storyline make this very enjoyable.  Has many cute INTERACTIVE  creatures that make Sounds or perform Funny movements and tasks when you touch them.  This is quite entertaining for most children.  Yes, the theme is a little spooky because the WHINE villain steals that Turtle's Soul but it is done in a very simple and Gentle way that does not scare the kids.  Then, the whole story is about Friendship and bringing the Turtle back to life with a Happy and satisfying ending.  You have to Tap on almost everything to search for STARS that are hidden on all Interactive pages (that come up on every other page).  The Narration is good but necessarily a little slow so Kids can fully understand what is going on.  The Sound Effects are Entertaining with many Funny sounds that Kids love to hear.  Music is OK but a little too loud and could benefit by a Volume control.Overall, a mildly Challenging Adventure Storybook that has keeps Kids Engaged with neat tasks and interesting story.  Suitable for most Kids but some Parental guidance would help to keep some Sensitive children from getting Scared by the WHINE and Spooky theme.  Not a problem for most Kids though.  SAFE app with No Spyware or Malware.  My only complaint is that it does nit EXIT cleanly... Back button does not work to exit and no Exit options or Menu anywhere in the app.  Sadly, Requires using HOME key to Exit and it Stays in memory afterwords.  Enjoyable and Satisfying app that I recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3777TBPMWR773/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIK3FAI#wasThisHelpful","R3777TBPMWR773","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basic concept is great but it has Control FLAWS.  Moving the Dog around to block the Main Character is often too slow and placement of items is very Inaccurate at times.  Very hard to adjust to the control Flaws.  The 3D Graphics are great and the challenges are well designed for what should be a neat, Casual playing experience.  However, it is nowhere near the FUN it could be.  It is too FRUSTRATING.  Seemed like a good PAID APP (similar to Monument Valley) but too Flawed.

"This game has great Graphics, good Music and neat Sound Effects.  The Mini-game puzzles are challenging and fun to master.  Sometimes you can get lost it stuck for what to do next but the HINT system is a good aid to get you going again.  Controls work well and sound levels can be adjusted.  The STORYLINE is pretty good but the End is rather abrupt and leaves you hanging.  Game seems too short for the price.Overall, I liked it until the Ending disappointed me.  I Aldo did not like all the Permissions (especially the READING MY ACCOUNTS one).  That seems unnecessary for game operation and suspicious to me.  I was able to play it with WiFi off though after initial startup.

"Awesome Mystery/Adventure/Hidden Object style game that keeps you Challenged, Engaged and Entertained.  Excellent Graphics, great Sound Effects and good Narration.  The MOST POLISHED game of this style I have seen after playing many of them.  All Sound levels can be adjusted.  HINTS are available and the MAP helps you get around quickly.  You are also asked in beginning if you want INTERACTIVE HELP.  Hidden objects are not too tough to find (especially in CASUAL mode).  I also like the SPARKLES that help you find items that need to be interacted with. The MINI-GAMES are wonderful and satisfying.  It is more USER FRIENDLY than other Developer's games (of this style) that I have played.  It is very SAFE with NO Malware, Intrusive Addons or annoyances (other than asking for app Rating).  The BONUS Game is Awesome too.  Sadly, they both crashed on me periodically.Exceptionally Enjoyable and Satisfying game.  Storyline is AWESOME and keeps you very Engaged.

"A great tool to keep track of Humidity so you can control it before damage occurs.  Very Accurate and easy to read.  I like that it records the HIGH and LOW levels of both Temperature  and Humidity for each day.  It tells you what is happening when you are not doing instantaneous checks.  It has helped me to keep better control of basement Humidity since the Dehumidifier displays are not very accurate.  Now I an set Humidity level to a SAFER level but not so low that it WASTES ELECTRICITY needlessly.  Well worth the cost with neat look.

"Nicely designed Physics based game with lots of obstacles and strategy challenges to engage your puzzle skills.  The controls are simply to stretch the rope perches with the Bird on it at different angles to aim at the next perch.  You pull back to adjust the power and distance to catapolt the bird and then let go.  The object is to navigate through the different mazes of perches without hitting the obstacles and ultimately find and join with his Girlfriend Bird on final perch.  Graphics are good, Music and Sound effects are OK but can be turned off.  Controls work well and the challenges are decent and lots of fun to beat.  Simple, Safe fun with No permissions, Addons, Malware, etc.  They do show large Links for More of the developers games and their is also a link for Facebook with NO PARENTAL CINTROL over kids using these links.  Not a huge problem ( since you can play with WiFi off) but not an acceptable scenario for a KID's App.  I have to deduct 1 Star for this mistake.

"Any kind of CHECKLIST can be created for any purpose with this app.  Just modify or customize existing lists and Add or Subtract items.  Any list Name can be easily changed at any time also.  You can duplicate existing lists to work on modifications safely.  Navigation is easy to get used go and it allows for group item deletions after you have checked the ones to delete with single command.  A nicely designed app that is Useful and User Friendly.  Could have been called CHECKLIST CREATOR instead of Camping theme but the Developer has made other themed checklist apps that have pre-populated Titles and checklist Items. That explains the specific name.  Not limited to Camping though and uses are limitless.Overall, very useful and easy enough to use.  Also completely SAFE with No malware, adds, annoyances or intrusive Addons to worry about.  Your Lists can also be saved to backup files at locations you designate and can be shared also.  The only thing I found missing though is the option to DATE YOUR LISTS.  Sadly, it also restricts name entries by not allowing special characters (like slashes or dashes for dates).

"The Lost Ship is nicely polished with plenty of good Puzzle and Strategy challenges. It is a worthy app for puzzle lovers. Graphics are excellent and Music is soothing and pleasant. INVENTORY system works well and so does the CAMERA that takes pictures of found puzzle guides to help you later. Lots of secret passages and interactive items usage makes it more enjoyable. It can get quite difficult to figure out sometimes but the Internet WALKTHROUGH Video is a great help if you need it. No actual instructions but you do get occasional Subtle Hints on needed actions. No Malware, Ads or other annoyances so is SAFE and USER FRIENDLY. You can play it with internet off also. It has a Guide MAP but so small on a 10 inch Tablet screen that it is pretty useless.Overall, a Quality app that is Enjoyable, Challenging and Satisfying to play. A bit short but worth the low price. Developer has done a good job at keeping it SAFE and Non-Intrusive for the user. Permissions are minimal and necessary. KUDOS to Developer for making it so USER FRIENDLY for.

"I am new to Gamebook RPG style of play but find this app well designed and Enjoyable even though it requires extensive Reading throughout the adventure.  You make decisions based on options presented to you in writing that will influence and adjust your individual strategy.  Nice to have options on getting food and supplies and how you interact with all the characters.  Basicly, you try to make the BEST CHOICES along the way like where to go, how to use items, which stratrgy to use for Fighting enemies,  etc.  Engaging and satisfying Fun that gives your brain a good workout.  It is rather large and seems to Drain Battery more than most apps though.Sorcery has good neat graphics and sounds.  It also has a good Map that let's you decide where to go and you can go back to places you have been before if you want to.  Success is mostly determined by a combination of player strategy and luck of the draw.  The monitors for Stamina, Money and Rations are also very helpful.  Mystical Spells are interesting and useful aids for you but do get a bit complicated to learn.Overall, a decent game for people like me that are new to this genre and enjoy a new style of challenge.  Well designed and Permissions seem Safe.  No Malware or Annoyances that I have detected.  Sadly, not much animation and tons of reading is required.  I find it Fun and nicely challenging in a relaxed style that let's you stop and start again later with no problems.  It also EXITS Cleanly.  Good game but a little Pricey!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8EME8DIBKJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX035QA#wasThisHelpful","R3T8EME8DIBKJE","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cute Dolphin game is actually a neat way to kill time with no pressure.  Graphics are great, the Music is soothing and Dolphin training is fun at first.  Then, it gets to be a tedious, laborious and repetitious.  Sadly, it requires endless trips back and forth to get more Fish. You constantly repeat the painfully slow process of Feeding and exercising the two Dolphins individually (taking turns) to fill up their bar graph guages that monitor Food, Health and Happiness levels for each of the 2 Dolphins.  If you don't perform these tedious chores adequately,  the people you speak with will just leave you hanging with little or no hints as to what is to be done next.  You also have to constantly get fuel for the Boat or you are left hanging again.  There are many complaints about difficulty in steering the Boat but it works OK for me if I TILT MY TABLET with SHORT, Quick movements.  Still a decent game if you can tolerate the Slow and Repetitious style.  If you read all the information given in conversations, it does give some direction on where to go and what to do but not as helpful as real instructions would be.A decent storyline and many tasks to complete help keep you engaged for a while.  Unfortunately, many players will get frustrated with the overly repetitious and slow nature of many required tasks.  If this was adjusted properly to make it more USER FRUENDLY, it would be a great game without the Boredom and Frustration that it creates in it's present state.  It is SAFE as far as  No Malware or Intrusive features but it has No Instructions, Does not EXIT with back key and has a few rough edges or glitches that need fixing too.  I will keep it since it really has much promise and may get fixed with future updates.  Just OK for now but HOPEFULLY THE DEVELOPER WILL FIX to satisfy users better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3YHGRW9LPOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4VGUIG#wasThisHelpful","RA3YHGRW9LPOJ","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comfortable, lightweight and BREATHABLE material makes it more user friendly than many other types.  Works well to give light support to Thumb and Wrist without stiff metal braces.  However, not great for heavier stress loads that should be protected with stiff braces.  This works best to sooth and support your Thumb and/or Wrist while at rest or doing LIGHT WORK.  The Velcro fastening works well to adjust the level of pressure and support for painful areas also. One of the best supports out of many that I have used through the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGR12UR1PMPG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GEXJQ6#wasThisHelpful","RGR12UR1PMPG9","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yet another Flagrant violator of our PRIVACY in disguise as a Soccer game that is a PAID APP no less!  Cartoon Network has produced a Slick Deal for you with this one:  You PAY for a game and they get Permission to force PUSH Notification ADS on you device, Spy on your device and Location and give your Kids access to Social Networking.  They also get access to your ACCOUNTS list while doing Analytics snooping as well.  Remember, this is supposed to be a CHILDRENs app by a developer called (CARTOON NETWORK) but is an undisclosed SPY TOOL!The game is mediocre but the Shameless, GREEDY, in your face Advertising and Privacy invasions are WORLD CLASS obnoxious INTRUSIONS.  This should not be tolerated by anyone who values their Privacy and Kids well being.  Cute games taking advantage of naive children is very Unethical and is not only objectionable but irresponsible marketing from a Children's app developer.  DON'T accept MALWARE like this!

"An excellent Pipe Connection Puzzle game with great Graphics, good Music and Sound effects.  The music can also be Muted.  The Hint system is a good help if you get stuck.  It has a large variety of worthy piping challenges that get harder as you progress.  App is SAFE with No Malware, Addons or any Permissions at all.  However, there is a constant Popup message asking you to Rate the app after every few levels of play.  Many people are rightfully complaining because the constant interruptions are annoying.  There is a simple solution... NOTE: POPUP MESSAGE CAN BE EASILY STOPPED by pressing that RATE US button once. You can then rate it or just hit your return button after it connects.  I just pressed return button as soon as it connected with appstore and I now have NO MORE POPUPs after playing 20 levels so far.Overall, Excellent game that keeps you engaged, challenged and satisfied.  Well designed and works flawlessly for a fun user experience.  NO safety issues or annoyances (except popup that is easily stopped) so I have to give it a full 5 STARS that are well earned.  It also EXITS cleanly with Return button and completely clears from memory (unlike many ither apps).  Very USER FRIENDLY so I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA6U90USO5MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3AW23G#wasThisHelpful","RQA6U90USO5MU","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very sweet point and click Adventure Puzzle experience with excellent Graphics and soothing background Music.  The Sound effects are great also and both Music or Sound effects can be Muted if you like.  This is a nicely designed and well polished game.  The endless searching is not painful but rather enjoyable with a few puzzles to figure out.  Mostly you just have to figure out how found items need to be used to open, access or operate something else.  There is a good HINT system of PICTURES only and can be accessed by tapping the (?) Symbol on options screen.  It shows sequencial pictures of where to find items to use on the level you are at.  Playing is refreshingly smooth, leisurely and enjoyable.  I finished the whole game in 2 hours and was challenged enough to make it Fun without frustration.  It has a nice, pleasant Story line too.Overall, a wonderful experience for adventure puzzle enthusiasts.  Making the machanical objects work is especially rewarding.  It is long enough but so cool that you want more.  Safe app with No Malware, Permissions or annoyances.  I did find that it includes FLURRY Analytics and it does not clear completely from memory afrer you Exit.  These may be there for a free version or for use with future Updates so I would stay away from any future Updates or scrutinize them closely if offered later.  I had to deduct 1 Star for this questionable stuff though I love the game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OE4B3C80PLMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GI8AMI8#wasThisHelpful","R2OE4B3C80PLMB","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Storybook has awesome Graphics and good narration.  It will read to you and highlight words or read it by yourself.  Story is nice but the next page transition is painfully slow... the slowest I have ever seen in any app.  It has a neat Coloring book section with 6 pages and lots of tools and, coloring styles and stickers.  It has Save or Erase features too.  The Dragon Hunter game section requires quick reflexes to shoot Hunters as they pop up but you have to avoid shooting the Sheep.  Scores are calculated and saved.  High scores can be seen by tapping the Trophy button.  Lastly, there is a neat Dragon Racing game where you select your Dragon and race other dragons by flying past obstacles and picking up bonuses in the way.  It has whirlwinds to help speed you up you control movements by finger touch and tapping.  Lots of fun activities with plenty of variety to keep you engaged and prevent boredom.Overall, a nifty app that is actually equivalent to 4 apps.  The 4 in 1 variety makes it more appealing and entertaining.  Mostly well designed and works well except the Lagging page transitions in the storybook.  Safe app but Permissions are a little questionable so I deduct 1 Star for this and the silly Parental button that asked for your birth year to gain access.  Many kids can get past that easily.  I don't worry about the PUSH NOTIFICATIONS because I set my tablet to block them.  I have not seen any ads yet and it has No malware or Intrusive Addons. The app will play with WiFi off also.  It is Enjoyable and diversified enough to satisfy most users.  Worth the price for all that you get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWN4HUZ1P8C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMBSQS0#wasThisHelpful","ROWN4HUZ1P8C6","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pettson's Inventions opens up a Fun way of piecing together Inventions and watching them work. It first shows a picture of what they want to accomplish. You figure out how to use the various available items to achieve some Mechanical Movement to complete the goal. You then flip a Lever to start the movement (if it is put together correctly) and you are awarded a GEAR for every successful level. Graphics and animated Characters are very Cute and inviting. The Narration and Sound Effects are very nice also. The Music is soothing but can be muted if you wish. Some brief Instructions can be found by selecting the ( i ) on the settings page. It seems moderately challenging for children and can be very Delightful for them to get the Rube Goldberg type machines working properly and achieving the required goals.  Cute, Funny and nice Replay value.  Also Fun for Adults who enjoy Physics and Mechanical challenges.Overall, a Charming and Stimulating way to encourage Creative/Inventive thinking in a leisurely atmosphere. Very polished app works smoothly with no glitches, annoyances or safety issues of any kind. It has no Intrusive Addons or Malware either, thank goodness. It can be played with WiFi off too. There are 66 awesome levels.  It does what they advertise well and is a SAFE and Enjoyable experience for Kids or Adults.

"A cute and vibrantly colorful Hidden Object game.  This takes Kids around the world to 12 countries in search of required items.  Each country has 3 Levels and child gets to select a souvenir from that country when completed.  There are 3 Difficulty categories to choose from so all totaled, you can play 108 levels.  The style of Clue and degree of hiding objects is different in each dificulty category to increase challenges.The player can play any level again by just selecting it.  When you replay a level, it changes the positions or locations of hidden objects so it is not too boring.  The Music is nice and the Narrator does  a great job.  Graphics are great and help keep Kids engaged and entertained.  NOTE: You need to Swipe screen left and right to see all objects.Overall, a SAFE and Entertaining Kids app that helps them with hand-eye coordination and analytical skills.  Good positive reinforcement and letting them choose Souvenir's is a great feature.  Suitable and appropriate for Kids ages 3-8.  It requires Network Permissions and installs Google Analytics (to track play).  It also has persistent Pop-Up Ads for other apps.  I have to deduct 1 Star for this annoyance in a PAID app for Kids.  Fortunately, they added a Parental block with a required number calculation.  But some Kids can easily get past that.  I found that it will play with WiFi off also.  Note: No sound control options either so you will have to adjust your device sound levels to adjust this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZ88NZ786K4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQIZRLS#wasThisHelpful","RYZ88NZ786K4J","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had one of these for about 15 years and absolutely Love it.  Mine got damaged a couple of times so that is the only reason I am replacing it.  They are made of Durable plastic and a perfect size for small boxes and packages.  Many of the AMAZON boxes I receive fit in this box well (ha-ha).  Easier than having to pick up packages at the post office because the mailman could not fit it into your mailbox.  It also has a neat YELLOW FLAG that indicates your Mailman has left mail in your box.  Saves lots of wasted trips to check box and finding it empty.  I also like that the Plastic material resists Snow and Ice much better than Metal mailboxes.  The access door never freezes up and holds tight enough to keep weather out.  Better than MORE EXPENSIVE Metal boxes!HINT: If you get lots of ICE in your area, you can spray Silicone or WD-40 lubricant on the 2 Flag bases to keep then from freezing.  Also, you can use Armor-All polish on the entire box if you want to make it pretty much FREEZE PROOF in winter.If you attach it to a good wooden 3/4"" base board of about 7"" W x 17"" L and attach through provided holes, it will stand strong and last many years (like mine).  Or you can attach it directly to 4""x4"" post arms... see INSTRUCTIONS on bottom of shipping box..","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUGUQ6HRROTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LNIB4I#wasThisHelpful","R1KUGUQ6HRROTP","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A pleasant puzzle adventure with a nice storyline. Mostly a Search game finding objects to unlock or open other parts of game with Inventory items. Mini puzzles can get hard to figure out at times but the OWL Hints feature can help or Solve the puzzle for you. Good Graphics with neat artwork adds to the Fun. Adjustable Music and Sound Effects are decent. There is a MAP but it's not as helpful as we might like. Dialogue is mostly just reading simple declarations from a Lonely GUARD that adds little to game play. Some puzzles are too difficult with inadequate guidance to get you started in the right direction and some have GLITCHES.I like this Neat Adventure game that keeps you engaged. Enjoyable, Safe game with no Malware, Addons or Intrusive Permissions. However, I have some issues with it.  It needs initial directions on what to do on some of the more difficult tasks. I deducted 2 Stars because a broken Picture puzzle forced me to get help though it was clearly completed properly. Controls are horrible when putting broken picture pieces together (your finger is far from the object you select and placement is choppy) making it very hard to get decent accuracy. I also noticed that BATTERY drains quickly on my Xoom Tablat with this app. Lastly, NO EXIT BUTTON but it Exits with BACK KEY and stays in memory so I have to use a Task Killer to stop it completely.

"Fruit Drops II is much better than it appears at first.  It has more Variety with different Goals for each level.  Lots of neat Power-ups  are achieved by varying combinations of matches.  Instructions are excellent and the Music and Sound options are good and appreciated for comfortable play.  3 levels of GRAYED areas require more matches to clear the Darkened grid squares.  Also has Frozen and (netted) squares that require clearing adjacent squares to free the trapped Fruit or Pies.  Delightful Child Sounds and narration make it very entertaining as well.  I find this impressive version of March 3 style game to be more Engaging than most others.  It goes far beyond the normal repetitious match 3 gameplay.A TOP NOTCH version of this game style that is Delightfully Enjoyable.  It is SAFE with no Intrusive Malware, Addons, IAPs or Permissions to worry about.  It also EXITS cleanly and completely.

"Cute and Colorful puzzles with 7 interesting themes that keep Small Kids engaged.  Simple puzzle piece placement in Shadowed areas is a great way to introduce puzzle skills and Entertain little kids.  Narrators voice is great and provides positive reinforcement when puzzles are completed correctly.  Music and Siund Effects are good and Lively.  They also have a bunch of BALLOONS flow up the screen (when puzzle is completed) and the child can POP them for fun.  It includes several Mini Games that are simple but sadly, have no instructions.  It is definitely geared towards Toddlers and Younger Kids.  It is Fun but does have a few negatives (see below).The Doctor game requires use of various items on a sick child.  Areas to be examined flash a bullseye on and off after you select an item or tool.  However, it does not seem to have an end after you do all the necessary tasks.  It also has a chart on wall with 2 pictures of a child.  One shows an X and other shows a Check mark next to pictures but NO INSTRUCTIONS or guidance of any kind.  It just stays the same with no narration, fanfare or closure.  Not good to leave users guessing like this!  It also installs the FLURRY Analytics addon onto your device so they can track your usage.  It does Exit with back button but Stays in memory so a Task Killer app will have to be used if you want to Clear it out of memory entirely.

"A neat Word Search game where you first find the words in a grid of tiles and then rearrange the words to match a President's Quote correctly.

It has 3 difficulty levels to suite your preference and skill.  Great Sound Effects add to the Fun atmosphere.  GabySoft has created another great app like their Pix Art apps that are very popular, easy to play and are Satisfying to play.  It gets harder as you progress but is not tremendously difficult to master.  This is great for average people (like me) to enjoy without getting frustrated by difficulty.Overall, a great Word game style that keeps you Engaged, Challenged and Satisfied.

"Triple A unleashes your creative side with variable Visual Effects that can get quite stunning after you practice for awhile.  Pleasing to the eye with endless Art shapes that are constantly in motion.  Colors randomly change and the Particle Number, Size and Length can be set by the user.  You can also change to 1 of 3 modes: Wave, Particle or Gravity for customizable effects.  Music is Soothing most of the time but there are some tracks that are actually Annoying and can not be changed.  There is an option to turn off music but it could be much better if you had control over which tracks play over and over to eliminate the Annoying ones.  It would also be better if we could select which Colors are used or not.  This would make the app more User Friendly and Customizable to suite every user by tailoring their unique experiences.Overall, a mostly Relaxing app that can be improved by giving the user control over Music tracks and Colors relatively easily.  I hope they Update to improve it.  It is SAFE with no Malware, Intrusive Addons or unreasonable Permissions.  Menu options are helpful to enhance user experience.  Potentially a 5 Star app but not without needed improvements.  Bye the way, Options menu is accessed by touching the tiny (i) symbol on lower right corner of screen that is also too close to the setting icons on my 10&#34; Tablet.

"Nicely designed platform Runner style game with good controls and Awesome Graphics.  The Storyline is nice with a Global Water Conservation theme.  Finger swiping to make Maya climb or jump higher is a neat change from all the button pushing that most runner apps require.  Plenty of Collectable items and Power ups to keep you engaged, Entertained and Satisfied. An Enjoyable game if your Device handles the huge size without issues.Sadly, it causes problems on some devices like my 32gb Motorola Xoom Tablet that normally handles apps much larger than this with no issues.  Starts out a little Laggy and then shows floating Black Boxes on one  screen.  It also makes the Notification bar on bottom of screen FLICKER on and off constantly.  Then, it changes my devices background screen to Green pattern when I EXIT the game.  Problems reoccur even after I restart the Tablet and restart the game again.  I have to use another app to change my desktop screen back to original solid color every time.It seems likely that new AMAZON INSIGHTS Analytics addon and flaws in app code may be causing the problems for me and those encountered by other users also.

"This Hitch is well designed to keep most of the frame hidden.  It looks very good on my 2014 Honda Accord.  With the Ball Mount off and a Receiver Cap covering the hole,  you can hardly notice the car has a trailer hitch.  It is a strong and sturdy design also.  I had the same one on my previous 09 Accord and absolutely loved it for hauling my light utility trailer.  It has more of a Sporty look than most other styles.  The price was very reasonable too.I would have rated it 5 Stars but the one I received has some annoying Flaws :Not protected well enough in the packing so arrived with Scrapes and Gouges in Paint and Metal.Many raised dots all over from Welding Splatter that they did not scrape off before painting it.METAL SHIELD 3 step Paint process is not good since paint is very THIN and scapes off easily.  I discovered that when I had to sand off scrapes and gouges before REPAINTING IT MYSELF.I had to remove 11 Labels to make it look better and to allow for proper Re-Painting.  3 large inventory labels covering other inventory (barcode) labels.  Also, Name labels covering other Name labels since it was supposed to be a REESE hitch but had DRAWTITE label underneath and several other labels.The Instructions are not good and were not updated for 2014 cars.  I found that I not only had to trim the Heat Shield (that was OK) but I needed to Cut a Plastic UnderBody Panel with no guidance whatsoever.  It became a nightmare to figure out how to cut it correctly.  I finally removed the panel, installed the hitch and overlayed the plastic panel over the hitch to mark off 2 areas to cut off that would allow a good fit.  I used a chalk to mark cutout areas, a Multi cutting tool to cut plastic and had to do it twice.I chose not to exchange it because it is obvious that most of the damage came from the Factory, not shipping.  I would probably have gotten more Welding Splatter, Paint Scrapes, etc. and had my installation delayed longer.Thankfully, I got the hitch Painted properly for good corrosion protection and was able to get an adjustment on the purchase price to compensate for some of the added costs, wasted time and additional work.  I appreciate that but would have been happier if everything was right from the start.  BUYER BEWARE - it may happen to you.By the way, this is sold as and labeled REESE but is actually a DRAWTITE Hitch which is fine with me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVWG2K04972/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6ZWF02#wasThisHelpful","RUVWG2K04972","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Fun and Challenging app that keeps your Brain busy. You have to master the methodical steps needed to create a fancy Gelato (Ice Cream) that matches the sample while you are being Timed. The process can be quite challenging at times with 144 puzzles that get harder as you progress. A tutorial does a good job of getting you started. The Graphics are good with a cartoonish look. You simply select the necessary items from the provided Inventory and decide what sequence to use them in to create the needed design. If you make a wrong step, you can use the User Friendly tools to recover and continue. You can choose to use the REDO button, Start over with a new cone or just keep changing the Colors and Steps on top of what you have done. There us also a HINT button. If you go too slow you won't get the STAR at completion. Music is Cool and upbeat. There is positive reinforcement with CHEERING after you match the cone correctly. I like using the Bands and Sunglasses for special effects.A neat, Fun filled Puzzle app that is clean and well designed. Seems appropriate for most ages but can get difficult so youngsters may need adult help. I think it is great for Family Fun to play together. It is Safe with No Intrusive Malware or Ads but does have FLURRY Analytics that will track usage on your device. I deduct 1 Star because I don't like that.

The Quizzes are pretty good and would be a great tool for Students to brush up on Muscle terms and functions.  It is more of a REFRESHER than an actual TEACHING Tool for students.  So if you are not in the Medical field or a student, it is not a great way to start learning Muscles.  However, it does have a lot of good information if you can deal with the technical terms.Unfortunately, the VIDEOS do not play on my Motorola Xoom Tablet.  It gives a message (VIDEO CAN'T PLAY) every time I try a video.  I reported this in hopes that they can resolve this with a future Update.Overall, an Adequate Student Aid but not terrible great for Laypersons wanting to get easily understandable info on Muscles and Functions.  I had to deduct 2 Stars due to less User Friendly than others and the Video playback issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JH41CU2WYHER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006LT51US#wasThisHelpful","R1JH41CU2WYHER","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anka is an Enjoyable and moderately challenging Adventure game with Point and Click style and a decent variety of Mini game Puzzles.  It is obviously more geared to children (though not stated).  Soft, soothing Music plays while you hear the Narration (that is good) but you have to tap screen to keep the dialogue going and message bubbles show the words on screen.  Remember, it is geared mostly for kids so adults must be patient with the slow moving, simpleness of the process that still produces an Enjoyable experience for most of us.  There are a large number of decent tasks and puzzles that keep you busy and Entertained.  The Storyline is Cute for Kids and naturally a little tedious for most adults.  I find it Enticing and Challenging enough to satisfy both Kids and Adults with Enjoyable activities that are great for casual play.Overall, a Good and Fun game that saves your progress and has decent Replay Value.  Not overly sophisticated but pretty well designed except it does not EXIT properly.  You have to use Home key to Exit game and it stays in memory.  It also has some Advertising (for their other games) but only at beginning of game.  Thankfully, it has NO Permissions at all, No Malware or Intrusive Addons and plays with WiFi off.  A Clean and SAFE game that deserves 4 Stars since it is Great for a variety of ages, SAFE and Non-intrusive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38K7A4SPZVEXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ5T09Y#wasThisHelpful","R38K7A4SPZVEXD","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ABC 123 is Fun for Kids while they learn to use and Write Letters and Numbers . Graphics are colorful and engaging. User learns Letters, Numbers and Objects. Graphics are colorful and engaging. Example: Pick a Letter and screen comes up with a picture of Animal or Object whose name starts with the selected letter. Touch Animal pictures to hear animal sounds. Touch a Letter to hear proper pronunciation.  Sounds and Narration are excellent. There is also a Writing feature that let's child trace the correct shapes of Letters and Numbers. Letters are done in both UPPER and lower case. Also has a fun Matching Game section with your choice of Letters, Numbers or Objects. There is also a nice SING-ALONG section that is very enjoyable and well done.Overall, a polished Educational, Entertaining Kids app that keeps kids engaged and satisfied while they learn in a Fun way. It has reasonable Permission and No Malware, Addons or Intrusive annoyances. I like it very much but have to Deduct 1Star because it has an animal icon on the main page that kids can touch to link to YouTube with no parental intervention. It also Exits well but does not shut down completely. Still a great app that is well worth the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NA59QYQDAUVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073WGI1S#wasThisHelpful","R2NA59QYQDAUVW","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FlipPix-Art with SPORTS Theme is a neat addition to this series of apps.Nicely designed to keep you engaged with challenging Nanogram puzzles. Pleasant HD Graphics and Excellent Sounds add to the soothing atmosphere. Easy to learn by following the well delivered Instructions and Tutorial. Lots of Fun even for beginners like me. Glad I decided to try it. A Nifty Flip-Art/Nanogram app that keeps your interest. Controls work smoothly and everything functions nicely. The Breakout feature lets you eliminate tiles that are obviously not needed, making it easier to continue your strategy. Also has good options to adjust Volume, get HINTS, Reset puzzle, DeSelect tiles, etc.Overall, a great Flip-Art app that is Engaging and Fun. Puzzles are addictive and seeing the Picture pop up after you solve them is a satisfying touch. You chose Puzzle sizes from 5x5, 10x10 or 15x15 according to your skill and comfort level. A SAFE app with No Data-Mining, Ads, IAP or other Intrusions and only 1 reasonable Permission. Plays well with WiFi off and has a Clean Exit function. Highly polished app that is quite Enjoyable with great Replay Value in a casual (no pressure) style.

"These Ventshades are made by a division of LUND that had the best quality years ago so I purchased them.  Sadly, they are FLIMSY, came with Scuff marks on the plastic and were not cut accurately at the factory (apparent visual Flaws).  When I held them against the car, the fit was not exact from one end to the other.  To check accuracy, I held Left and Right side visors back to back and they DID NOT MATCH.  In other words, the Arch shape is slightly different between left and right side Visors (both Front and Rear pairs).  This would cause a sloppy looking fit.  Also, the Chrome part has cut off (unfinished) ends that makes them look very cheap and unsightly.  They do not live up to the advertised HYPE of good quality!  Not worth the price.Stay away if you value Good Quality, Solid construction and Proper Fit.  I returned for Refund and bought a different set (through Ebay for $85) with Sturdy construction, properly Finished ends and impressive OEM style, shape and fit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DKVJIOGWLVPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CEXKFLU#wasThisHelpful","R2DKVJIOGWLVPP","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pet Doctor is another in a seres of cute and colorful apps for small children.  This one seems more appropriate for the 2-3 yr old kids though.  It has 15 Pets that need some CARE in the form of minor Interactive adjustments to be made by the player.  All of the critters are colorful, pleasant and make cute sounds.  After you make the necessary adjustments to cure their ailments, you feed them and they happily fall asleep.  The Graphics are vibrantly colorful (like all Toca Boca apps), the Music is pleasant and the Sound effects are very Enjoyable.Sadly, this is a very Basic app compared to the other Toca Boca apps.  No Interactive features with the surrounding areas or objects, just with the animal patients and the food.  Kids enjoy it more when they can touch other items on screen to get some kind of reaction.  There is also minimal movement of the Animals, nothing else interesting happens and no fanfare or positive reinforcement when the child completes a task properly.Overall, pleasant app with calming atmosphere and minor interactive tasks for smaller children.  However, it seems to be missing some of the Fun, Interactive features that made other Toca Boca apps outstanding.  Many kids will get bored quickly with this one.  I still gave 4 stars because it is ok for toddlers has NO Intrusive Malware or Addons, it plays with WiFi off and it Exits cleanly and completely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHQG3GYWEZ3WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4HO3OO#wasThisHelpful","RHQG3GYWEZ3WL","A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GZZEI9LGAIRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PDF Max is a great tool for Viewing and Editing PDF Documents on Android devices.  Much faster loading of your files than other apps.  The Display is sharp and clear for most documents but some do come out a little fuzzy (similar to other apps).  It has many useful features that are helpful like the magnifier, highlighting, annotation tools, file saving/sharing, editing tools, etc.  It works well and fast (once you get more familiar with features).  Not full featured like commercial apps but great for averagee users.  Unfortunately, I could not find an easy REDO feature so I can erase changes I made and then want to start the edit over again.  I don't like being stuck with an edit that doesn't let me experiment more.  I have to deduct 1 Star because of this and the lack of more desired functions.  It is pretty impressive compared to most others though.Overall, much faster load speed makes it better than others.  It has enough common features to satisfy average users and works well with all the Editing tools and Saving functions.  It also has No Malware, Adware, etc. And works fine with WiFi off.

"Well I decided to go for this necklace to give my 9 year old daughter but was not real happy when I almost needed to use a magnifying glass just to see what is says on it. Would have been really nice if it were shown modeled on a person's neck to give refrence to it's actual size of very small. Non the less my daughter does love it because it is real gold and real jewelry. The length of the chain is about just right and maybe a bit too short to hang outside and be seen. I really did think my daughter would be upset because it is so small but she likes it. I did look it over and yes I had to use a magnifying glass but does look like it is made fairly well but not sure it is really worth the asking price. Just keep in mind that it is really small and if you keep that in mind then you probably would be pleased with it otherwise may want to look at some of Amazon's other jewelry since I have always been pleased in the past just not blown away this time.

"My kids love blankets and carry them around from room to room.  While I personally am not a big fan of animal prints, my daughters LOVE them.  This blanket is 100% polyester and is soooo soft.  Very comfy to snuggle on the sofa for family movie night.  The size is 50x60, so it would be more usable for adults if it were a little larger, but it is a nice throw blanket.  The kids and dogs fight over the softest blanket in the house and this one is the preferred pick of all that are left laying around.  The weight and density of this blanket is much more than your typical fleece or plush blankets, so be careful when laundering.  It is recommended that it be laundered in cold water and dried with low heat.  Fortunately, we have not had a need to wash it yet, but just a precautionary for when the time does arise.  Overall, my top recommendation would be different prints, or even just solids.  The function and feel is fantastic and we will definitely have this one around to fight over for a while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36X5IW1APRM8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6RK9CC#wasThisHelpful","R36X5IW1APRM8F","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this Nuface trainer kit and figured what the heck yes I am a man but I want to look as good for as long as I can! Makes my wife happy too! Now I am new to this and have never used and Microcurrent therapy before so did not know exactly what to expect.  When unpacking the unit I immediately noticed a very solid and comfortable feel to it and super nice build quality. I guess given the price this would be expected. Also I should mention the one bad reviewer that blasted it for the battery not staying fully charged and ready to go when it sat off the charge base for several days is silly. This device is no different than your electric shaver or battery operated toothbrush. They too need to stay on the charger when not in use to keep battery full and ready to use. Nothing new here.  I followed the directions and let charge on the dock overnight and next morning before I took a shower I decided to give it a try. I have wrinkles beginning under my eyes and above my cheek bones so that s where I focused but can also do forehead and chin or basically whole face. The conductive gel provided is cool and somewhat slimy feeling. I decided to to start with under my eyes first and immediately I could feel a tingle from the electrical current. I would rate it as feeling good and relaxing for me. Each area lasted for about 3 minutes before it beeped to let me know I need to move on to next area.  I did not have to use a lot of the gel so hopefully it will be enough for a month or so but is only about 12 for 2 oz here anyways. So I have been using it everyday now for about two weeks and no I don't see miracules overnight transformation but I can tell my face feels a little bit tighter and ever so slightly smoother so yes I do see improvement. Now lets talk about the cost factor. You can go to a clinic for about 90-120 a pop for 12 sessions for 1440.00 and have to take time to drive to clinic and wait. Or you could spend 400.00 and do it in the comfort of your own home at your leisure and have same professional results. So for me it is a no brainer. I choose to do in my free time and at home whenever I want to.  All in all I believe that within the 60 days mark I will see much more improvement and will continue to use and will update my review to reflect my findings. Thanks and hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DLKP1ZH8XDAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ5XCBE#wasThisHelpful","R1DLKP1ZH8XDAJ","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these Bose headphones about a week ago and have been using them like crazy. The first thing I noticed was that the boxing was very plain and minimal unlike other Brand names with super fancy packaging but really who cares. I placed the headphones in my ears just as the came out of the box and wow they are supper comfortable compared to any of my other high dollar ones I have had in the past. It did come with extra ear pieces.The ear buds fit very snug in my canal and surprising they do not sweat in my ear after an extended run. This is a plus because sweat is usually what ruins all my past headphones as it enters the voice coil and rust out.  Now for the sound. The highs are superb. The kids are superb. The lows are very good and natural but not super defined like some of my other high end headphones. I have used them long enough to break them in and all in all the sound is very good.  My only concern might be the cord. It is very slim round and not the flat tape type that seem to hold up better under abuse. Lets face it when you are running they are going to get abused. The controls work just fine with no issues at all and work with both my Samsung S4 and Blu Studio Energy phones. For the money these are very good headphones. They are not the best but they are Bose and just the name raises the price. I hope this helps.

"Absolutely this Hayward filter was worth it to me. I have had a large oval above ground pool for about 3 years now and have struggled with cloudy water and algae the entire time. I have been using all the needed chemicals and back flushed my existing sand filter regularly and have also changed the sand and water each year. Still cannot get clear water even with the pump running 24-7. I finally decided that maybe it was the cheap sand filter that came with the pool and wow. Why did I wait 3 years to think of this is beyond me. I installed this new Hayward filter and within just 8hrs I notice the pool was getting much clearer. Then after 2 days it was sparkling clean and I am so happy now. I have back flushed it twice now and has been running for a month and also put the pool back on a timer so it only runs now for about 8hrs and the pool is still sparkling clear. I was so close to tearing the pool down but very happy that this Hayward sand filter saved the pool and now wife and kids are happy too!

"First, my wife was thrilled when I told her I got these labels for her to try.  She is always hosting baby showers and making treat bags for my kid's birthday parties, so I knew she would like to implement these into one of her projects.  First, the positives...typical great quality Avery product.  Adheres well to the foil on the kisses (as pictured on the cover), as well as plastic bags and paper products.  Printing to the edge was a nice feature to make use of the entire label. Now for the negatives, 1) the sheet size is not a standard 8.5x11.  Be prepared to feed this into the envelope settings on your printer for this to print properly.  2) The template for this product is not a standard template available from Microsoft, so you must download from Avery in order to use.  This process took about fifteen minutes to download, install, and locate the template to begin customizing, 3) The price for 120 labels (6 sheets) is excessive.  Spending $12.95 to make two or three bags of chocolates for a birthday party is a little over the top.Overall, the product itself is a neat addition to the Avery line of products.  Would I purchase again?  Probably not at the current asking price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBZO0YT2FEMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W7VED76#wasThisHelpful","RQBZO0YT2FEMM","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to get this Pet air purifier for my house and BIG St.Bernard that loves to shed his fur and dander all over our living room. It has been a problem for some time and decided time to fight back. I decided to place this near his bed and was blown away that within less than one week the filter was already covered with dog fur and dander. I also did notice that the dog smell was slightly reduced. The air purifier is very nice to look at in terms of an appliance sitting on my floor in the living room. Now I had to run this on low setting because anything else is just too loud. Medium and Fast sounds like a hurricane is coming and cannot hear the TV over it's noise. The low setting seems to wrk just fine though so no big deal. I really don't know what they were thinking when they designed the blower portion of this system because of the noise from Medium and High speeds. I don't think anyone could realistically stand the noise. Next is the filter replacement cost and seems a little high but I noticed that all air purifier filters are kind of pricey. I think that if i clean the preflight regularly that I will not need to replace the main filter very often anyways. All in all I like the air purifier but only on low speed.

"My wife LOVES this grill.  She had one many years ago when they first came out, but the cleanup was horrible.  She used it anyway though since it was a quick and lower fat alternative to frying.  Note: we only fry things MAYBE twice a year so healthy eating is a big plus!First, straight out of the box, the unit is ready to use.  Remove the protective sealing and setup is complete.  The instruction booklet says to grease the plates before the first use.  I did not do this, although I probably should have.  I did remove the plates and wash them before cooking on them.  Secondly, the drip tray still seems a little awkward.  If you hit or bump it, then you're going to have a mess.  Would be nice if there was a way to hook it onto the unit to hold it in place.  Next, the temperature slide seems a little cheap.  Hopefully it will not break or fall off, but nonetheless, it does the job intended.  Now, as for the first time it was used, be prepared for the dust on the heating elements to smell HORRIBLE.  We left the unit on for about 20 minutes to burn off all of this residue before we started cooking.Now for the meal, we made grilled fish.  Tilapia and flounder to be exact.  The flounder took about 6 minutes to cook through.  The tilapia about 8 minutes.  We were able to get 6 pieces of meat on the grilling surface at one time.  With a family of 5, I made two rounds of meat, which still only took 15 minutes.  Literally, place the meat on the grill, sprinkled on some seasonings, and done.  The cleanup was a breeze.  The unit was unplugged after cooking.  We ate dinner.  Twenty minutes later it was still a little warm, so using potholders, the plates were removed and placed in the dishwasher along with the remaining supper dishes.  Came out perfect.  Granted, we only cooked fish so nothing to stick on or make a mess, but my opinion is that if the plates are washed immediately after use, the cleanup should be pretty painless.Summary - great product for quick and easy healthy meals!  Could use minor improvements, but nothing to keep me from purchasing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQV1B2F7ZM73I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","RQV1B2F7ZM73I","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this jack In The Box system for my boat that is a little old and never equipped with a jack or lug wrench. The Extreme Max system is a very good idea because no worries about did you remember to bring the jack or lug wrench in the truck? It is very heavy duty and mount's on most trailer frames as there is two size U-clamps and nuts supplied to mount it. I mounted mine on the right front and I was afraid it would look weird and stand out like a sore thumb but it actually look's nice. When mounted it is very secure and comes with a sliding bar that goes in front of the cover and can also use a lock to keep from being stolen. The jack and lug tools fit nice and snug in it's enclosure. I have it mounted far enough forward so that I do not think water will get into it while loading or unloading the boat in the lake.  For me this is a great tool and possible life saver because before this I did not have any tools incase of a flat tire so Im good now. I would for sure recommend this to anyone that does not have a jack solely with the boat.

"The look of rustic, handmade pottery without the expensive price tag!  This is a beautiful serving plate that is perfect for every day use.  A bit on the small side for large family gatherings, but just right for a weekday night at home.  The color is an antique creamy color, a slight tinge of yellow, with a darker edge to look more unique.  The color coordinates well with other colors of the Cucina line by Rachael Ray.  As a microwave and dishwasher safe product, I hope to have years of use from the product without the glaze wearing off.  A slightly weighted dish, which is nice, but not too heavy for every day use.  Overall, this is a quality serving dish (I wouldn't call it a platter since the size is far from what I would consider appropriate for a large serving) that compliments a rustic or French modern casual atmosphere.  The look of classic elegance appropriate for every night of the week.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZCOP56BFU97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UD7GKRC#wasThisHelpful","R35ZCOP56BFU97","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect!! This battery solved my problem with my Neato saying the battery needs charging and please remove dust bin and switch power off and on again. I had also noticed I was only getting about 45 minutes run time when it was charged fully. I thought my Neato was done for but this battery not only last for over two hours run time but solved my first problem I was having the the message to remove the dust bin and switch off and on again. I had tried several times to remove the old battery and let sit for about 20 minutes then plug in and hoped it would reset and fix but did't and that is why I decided to go ahead and give this battery a shot and so glad I did. It actually seems to run longer than it did with the original battery even when it was new. The original battery was 3600mAh and this new one is 3800mAh so maybe it really is as it states. At any rate this seems to be a very good battery for the price.

"My back round is a I would guess Hobby electronics repair. I repair just about anything electronic and many times very very small. Such as an iPod or iPhone. The component are so small that almost can't tell what they are without magnification. And magnification is a must when replacing any of these components. In the past I have been using don't laugh but visor type magnifier and hold flash light in my mouth type equipment. Not very fun or practical. So without question when I was offered this I jumped on it. I am so glad I did too because I can see what I am doing very well and most important without a headache from straining my eyes. I was really surprised when I pulled this out of the box and it was so much larger than picture makes it look. It is very good size for professional use. My wife mentioned that it is the same size they use at here work Prettl Electronics.  I quickly mounted it to my work bench with no assembly or tools, plugged it in and flipped the switch on and wow it is so clear and bright! I am so happy now because I can clearly see what I am working on and can manuver the light in almost any needed position. Another thing I noticed is that I can be only maybe an inch away from the glass and the glass does not fog up at all in anyway. The viewing lens is huge at 5 inches and the magnification is just enough for most uses. There have been times that I had to use my electronic microscope for locating some very small poor solder joints. The build quality seems to be very good. It stays in place and does not budge. I would for sure recommend this for anyone that needs to view a clean and large image.Pros: Much larger than expected that of professional's  No assembly required.  Very nice clear image when magnified  Can manuvuer in almost any position desired  Made of very nice stainless steel  Light is very bright and clean- not so bright that it blinds you from the reflection  Lens does not fog up at all no matter how close I would get to itCons: I have not found any as of yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUM35M34I26C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007YK2RUK#wasThisHelpful","R1JUM35M34I26C","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:51 Mins I have both a Neato Botvac 80 and now the Brand New D80. Just a little background I have been using robotic vacuums to clean my home since the old red Irobot Romba came out and have had Irobot vacs form the 4110, 530, 535, 650, and the 780. All were great at first but after six months they seemed to get loud and not clean as well. I still love them though. I have also had several of the Samsung, LG, Dirt Devil  and while they cleaned ok they would also get stuck a lot and not hold much debris. I currently also have 5 Bobsweep pet series and that is only because I buy them really cheap because they are always broken but when they are working they clean great.  Now back to the Neato. I was one of the first to wait in line online for the first XV11 to come out and have loved Neato Vacs ever since. The Neato vacs sound like a jet plane but the newer models such as the Botvac series are much quieter and clean even better.  Now for the difference between the Botvac 80 and D80 are few but I have noticed that the D80 is very slightly louder than the 80 but the D80 also seems to have more suction power too. It looks like the major change has been to the main brush. The Botvac 80 has a non sealed bearing on the end of the brush that sometimes has issues with hair getting entangled in the bearing. The Botvac D80 Has gone back to the brass bearing assy that is larger in diameter but is still super easy to clean when needed which is not very often. I am glad to see they have gone back to the good old brass type bearing. Other than the obviouscool black color it operates the same, has same side brush, same size debris bin. I am sure there are other minor improvements but I have noticed that none of the Botvac series have ever had a firmware upgrade so sounds like that have got it down now unlike the XV series that seemed to have a firmware upgrade about every month or two.  When comparing the size of the debris bin to other brands it is a no brainer. The Neato has by far a way larger bin and the Neato crams it in too. I have used many many robotic vacuums and for the long term I still prefer the Neato to any others at the moment. It is interesting to note that the Irobot Rombas that used to be cheaper than Neato are now more expensive. All in all I for sure recommend the Neato Botvac D80 for great all around cleaning especially if you have pets and dust bunnies. If you have found this review helpful please mark helpful at bottom.

"Ok well I have a dog that like's to get into our garbage can when we are not looking. He will use his nose to open the lid and dive in. The garbage can had no lid lock and was really easy for him to open. Needless to say I needed to do something and this garbage can came just in perfect time. If you look at the picture you will see the the lid is flush with the outer ring and now he has no way of nudging it open anymore. Now if he were to knock it over then yeah he would be into it but fortunately that has never happened. Ok now onto the actual can itself. I like the size and wide opening but really wish the lid would open more than just 3/4 without having to force it up. Just using the foot pedal it opens 3/4 only. I have noticed that the can is very stable even when it is empty unlike my other one that when empty and you press the foot pedal the whole can would flip forward onto you. So it is refreshing to see this one is built and functions great.  I also like the fact that when changing the bag you simply lift the upper lid section off and pull the bag up and out. Next a really nice feature is the spare bag holder nicely out of view in a pocket behind the can. I did find that the K liners do work very well and are also very strong but at a price. The custom fit liners are a bit more money and I will probably just use regular ones when the sample pack that came with the can runs out.  All in all it seems to be well made and thought out with the exception of the lid only opening 3/4 with the foot pedal.Pros: Lid is flush and my dog cannot nudge it open to go dumpster diving.  Very easy to lift the upper ring up to remove full garbage bag.  Has built in pocket in rear of can and is out of site to hold spare bags.  Came with a sample pack of K-liner bags.  Very stable either empty or full.  Very well built.Cons: The lid only opens 3/4 way using the foot pedal but otherwise very nice wide opening.  K-liners are a bit expensive but can use standard bags.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38MMGLQ0EUUZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUB7FGU#wasThisHelpful","R38MMGLQ0EUUZQ","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't real sure how this would look in my bathroom but so glad I did! I decided to go for this style solinder faucet even though was unsure of how well it would look in my bathroom along with less than contemporary componets surrounding it. My counter top is an off white marble and a Kohler sink. I removed my chrome faucet and installed this one in place and wow! I really do like this look better. It is higher up and stands out nicely but not obnoxious. Unlike some other reviews I feel the white handle is very nice. Not a bright white but more of an off white and compliments my marble counter top perfectly.  The installation was very painless compared to my kitchen sink and faucet I replaced last weekend. Has an awesome system to secure it to the counter top with having figure how to tighten that jam nut or purchase a special basin wrench. Just spin the nut flush and the tighten two screws to secure it firmly.  This faucet is heavy and very substantial. Looks like the inners are mostly brass and comes with two braided stainless steel flex hoses to connect the hot and cold water conections. Nothing about this feels or looks cheap in my opinion. The faucet works very well and with no drips after shutting off.  All in all I am very glad I gave this style a chance.

"One word....""Amazing!""  I love this device. At first thoughts when I opened the box it had a great non-slip rubber that surrounds the entire battery pack that seems to be nice and thick and should last for a while to come.  Another thing I noticed pretty fast was how heavy the thing is!  It probably weighs a good pound or so!  The features on the pack are a 1a output, and also a 2.4a output to plug a usb charger into. The one thing that I love the most is how long this battery pack last!  I was able to charge my iPhone 5, a decent 5-6 times before it completely died.  The charging time takes around 5-6 hours from what iv been able to tell. As far as drop proof, and waterproof goes I'm not going to out right test it, but as far as the build quality goes, it should hold up very well. Even though the product is a bit more pricy I still highly recommend the product to anyone looking for a good rugged portable  powerbank!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEQUS4IN7I0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5H57Q8#wasThisHelpful","RJEQUS4IN7I0J","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use mainly robotic vacuums to clean my 90% hardwood floors in my house but even then sometime's I need a standalone vacuum specially when my St.Bernard is shedding which is almost year round. The robotic vacuums do a great job of picking up the dog hair but cannot get in all the nooks and such nor do they clean the throw rugs real well. This is where the Dyson V6 comes in to play. I love the fact that it is powered by a rechargeable battery so no cords to mess with. I absolutely despise corded products and hoses too!!  I am very impressed with the build quality of the vacuum and is by far better than most. The vacuum is not quite though. It sounds like a jet plane. Loud but not unbearable. The brush head uses carbon fibers for the brush and is motorized. It should be noted that the brush head will shut off on it's own if the carpet adds too much resistance and will restart upon releasing the power button and turing back on again. The vacuum is extremely powerful in the turbo mode but the battery life is pretty short and the handle gets warm near the battery but only when using it in the turbo mode.  When using it in the normal mode the vacuum suction is still very good and battery life is much better probably about 30 minutes and no warm handle either. The way that the Dyson pivots and turns around the corners is awesome and very natural. I do find that the dust bin fills very quickly but that is mostly because of the dog fur. Fortunately it only takes a second to empty. For hardwood floors this vacuum is just awesome. For throw rugs it just depends because if it has textures to it and does not do real well and if it is a very low profile it tends to pick it up and get stuck.  I tried to use it in my car and just decided that was not going to work unless you plan on only vacuuming the flat open areas of the floor. The crevice tool provided is good but really does not work in a car with a rigid tube that it attaches to. If you buy the optional tool pack that comes with the flexible suction hose I think it would work awesome in cars. That is about 60 extra though and really would expect that it would come with at least the flexible hose.  All in all it is a very solid and well built cordless vacuum that is very well engineered. Very high performance indeed. I really like it and plan to keep using it for a long time. Thanks, hope this helps.Pros: Very lightweight  Works fantastic on hardwood or tiled floors  Flexible to get into very tight places  No cords!!!  Battery last a good bit it normal mode  No bags to buy. Just dump and start again  Very high quality powered brush head with carbon fiber bristlesCons: Does not work well on very low profile throw rugs or textured ones.  Does not work well in cars without the optional flexible suction hose","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TPSORNIQ0R63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMLJPIC#wasThisHelpful","R2TPSORNIQ0R63","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok I know it say's for women but I am a Man and I purchased this for my concealed carry. I have been looking all over for a plastic holster like this one because I work with my concealed on as a inside waist carry and sweat badly thus causing my LCP to rust and drives me crazy! I have been using a leather holster for over a year and while very comfortable it just  my sweat. So after much research I cam across this and tried to figure out why it is just for women but after looking at it I decided it looks perfect for a man to use as well and I must say yes it does!! I am very glad I purchased this for my inside waist carry because it is very comfortable even after only first day of use and no sweat issues on my LCP either. I just clip it on my inside pants no belt needed. I adjusted the tension screw until I was happy with the amount of resistance needed to pull the gun from the holster.

"The SOG knife is a excellent tool for any outdoors man, hunter, or fisher. Price is a little on the high end, but worth it for a great tool. The nice sharp and durable fixed blade is resilient to dulling and chipping. The knife comes a  sharp *serated*(not sure of spelled correct ) edge which is perfect for minor cutting. Light weight and balanced is one of the many nice features that is included with this knife. The sheath is full of awesome extras. Has a knife sharpening tool which is not only very convenient but works great. Also, has a flint which produces enough spark to start fire; tested it on a napkin which worked great.

"I receive this phone about a week ago and have also purchased the Blu Studio Energy and love both of them. My background is coming from the Samsun# Galax# S4 and S5. I like the Galax# but always had a hard time using the keyboard for texting no mater if I used the one that came with it or downloaded one. I just could not get past that oh and the cost of one to buy outright. So I figured I would do some research and came up with this Blu brand cell phones. They are fairly new in the cell phone market kind of like HTC and others were but are now considered big brand name phones. The sound and screen quality are every bit as good as the big names out there. Oh and I bought a tempered glass screen protector and you cannot even tell it has a protector on it and does not smudge up anywhere as much with it on. I will never go back to using the peel and stick plastic screen protectors. The build quality is just as good as the Samsun# and function every bit as well and even better with the keyboard. It seems that the Blu is much more accurate so I do not get anywhere as much typos anymore. This phone has a very high quality feel to it but does not slip out of my hand as easy compared with my past Samsun# phones. The rear camera quality is excellent and even better than my Studio Energy that I also have. Now the battery life is right on par with most other smart phones with about 2 days of average use before needing to recharge. My Studio Energy I almost  always go 9-10 days on one battery charge which is insane and makes my wife with her iPhon# so mad because her's is always plugged into the wall or car outlet.  For the price point I have yet to come even close to finding a better phone that I really cannot find any flaws with. I don't think you will be disappointed with this phone or the Blu studio Energy which is very similar to this one but has a super long battery life. Either way you can't go wrong and I am had dot please when it comes to cell phones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CBI76QWFVE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZEFDRI#wasThisHelpful","R30CBI76QWFVE1","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this Workshop portable vacuum and was pretty excited to receive it but unfortunatly not as impressed as some of the other reviewers have praised it. I unboxed it and every part of it feels kind of like very cheap plastic. I have had many portable vacuum's in the past to compare with some from Homedep# and Craftsman# and were in same price range but they were of much better build quality and feel. I really don't like writing a not so great review but weather I paid for it or not I try to be honest in my reviews. During my first use the wide nozzle fell apart while vacuuming my car with it. I had come to find out that it is held together with what looks like superglue. I pressed it back in but fell right back out while vacuuming. I decided to try another nozzle the crevice one and I found that I really liked that one the best anyways and it did not break.  I found that the hose was just barely long enough but it is a small diameter and cheap hose that will probably crack in a year of two use. I have had ones like this in the past. Also the suction is just ok and enough for home light home use but for sure not very strong. I really want dot like this vacuum but just too many weakness for me to recommend it. There are better options. Please remember this is just my thoughts based on my personal experience with this and past portable vacuums I have had.Pros: Very light weight  Pretty easy to maintain and use  Has vacuum and blow featureCons: Wide suction nozzle broke during first use  The main hose is small diameter and seems of low quality  For the price there are better options.

"I placed an order for this to help my Dad with his chronic bald area near his huge oak tree this year. He has tried to get grass to grow in this area for at least 10 years now but never takes off. The area is fairly well shaded most of the day and moss sometimes is a problem growing in the soil.We went ahead and tilled the area and has been raining just about everyday for the last month it seems so nice and moist already. He went ahead and broadcasted the seed and to my surprise after about 6 days small grass shoots are appearing everywhere!!! So far so good and hope that it will continue to grow this summer. I did notice on the contents disclosure that their are probably 6 different types of grass seed in this mix so I guess if one type of seed does not do well in your area maybe another seed will?

"Well I had high hopes for this Zoysia grass seed to help get a nice yard this year but no go. I had an area that was about 30 x 40 cleared and ready for grass seed so I even used my Scotts broadcaster and used their setting to spread the seed on the prepared soil. It had rained almost everyday so the ground was still very moist and I also raked over the seed slightly and it rained the next day and next day and almost everyday for about 1.5 weeks. It has now been about 2.5 weeks and nothing so I am guessing either I did something wrong or my soil is not good for this type of seed. I should also note that many other reviewers had mentioned that they had mulch like substance mixed with their seed but my mix had crushed like little stones mixed in it. Sadly this seed did not work for me. I wish it had though. I did also buy a small pallet of Zoysia plugs from Amazon and so far they are still alive after being in the ground for 1.5 weeks but not growing yet. Oh I live in the upstate of SC.

I was quite surprised when it arrived though as it was in only a zip lock bag and not a nice case like everyone else has said and shown.

"I received a bag of this Scoots Turf Builder seed just in time for one of my yard projects. I had to do some excavating around the perimeter of my house and back filled it and now ready for grass. I was going to go out and buy some Rebel Fescue but I saw this and figured I would give it a try.  I had the soil already loosened so I just broadcasted the seed and lightly raked it to cover with a very thin layer of soil and it rained next day so I did not have to water it. The ground stayed damp for several days and the I totally forgot to water it but fortunately it has rained every few days here.They temperature has been is the mid 70s during the day and 50s at night so just about right. Well after about 2 weeks I am seeing green popping up everywhere so I am happy and just hope it will be established enough by summer time so it does not burn up.  I did notice that I had to slow the broadcast rate down a bit compared with any other grass seed I have ever used. I would always have mine metered for max but with this I have to back it down to about half. I have no idea unless that blue coating on the seed makes it pass through the spreader easier?

"I received these GWON orange gloves and did not really expect to be wowed because I have always been let down with the quality of any Latex or Nitrile gloves be it expensive or cheap, fancy box or not. Ok so I have my own BMW repair shop and probably more than half my repairs involve repairing oil leaks so I tend to go through a lot of gloves in a short time because they either fall apart from the oil and cleaners or the get ripped when performing the repair or even worse rip when trying to put them on. Over the last 15 years I have used almost every brand latex or nitrile gloves out there it seems. I have used top dollar ones from Snap On truck like Microflex all the way down to the HB freight brand and was really recently disappointed with the Venom brand as they probably are the worst I have ever used. Well I am very pleased to say that these are by far the best gloves I have ever used in every way. This box is pretty big due to how many and how thick these gloves are. I was really surprised by the very deep textured diamond like grid built into the gloves that provide excellent grip especially when oil is present. I am able to perform most repairs with just one set of gloves and sometimes can even reuse them. These gloves are very thick and strong. I think they are actually as thick as they are advertised to be unlike just about all other brands. So far I have torn very few of these an no brake or carb cleaner seems to affect them either. Oh and the bright orange gets everyone attention.  Now I have noticed that the medium is a little smaller than I am used to and are snug. If they were any tighter I would need to move up to the large size. All in all when you compare the quality and the price this is a winner and I will buy these after I run out.

"many times I have my BMW customers ask me if there is anything I can do for their yellowed looking headlights short of replacing them at 1500.00 each side and I tell them about my headlight service. I have been using a wool buffing wheel for many years but you have to be very careful not to burn the plastic with the heat from the wool pad. I decided to give this foam pad a try and so glad I did. Not only do I not have any problems burning the plastic but with the mild polishing compound I do not have to work it as hard to get great results. Only thing is you have to be careful to stay away from any sharp edges as it will tend to nick the pad. All in all a great investment.

"I have my own BMW repair shop and have been using gloves for many many years and have seen good ones and bad ones. These have to be near the worst I have ever used right behind HB freights cheapest ones. A good deal of them rip as they are being put on. Then they are also really bad for ripping if just barely touching touching something slightly rough. They are extremely thin especially the palm area. Unfortunately I bought a case of these but at the rate I am going through them I will be needing another brand very soon. I have found the HB freight brand the expensive nitrile 6 or 9mil thick black ones to hold up the best so far. So needless to say I have been less than impressed with these. Only good thing is that they do seem to resist carb and brake cleaner fairly well.

"I have always been pleased with OTC brand tools in the past but this one is way off the mark and is the same tool you would buy at the flea market for 5.00. This tool came in a package that says OTC on it and that is it. The tool itself has no markings on it other than MADE In China on it. Does not even say OTC on the tool anywhere! I don't know what has happened here but not impressed with the direction OTC tools seem to be going.  The tool itself has hard plastic grips that feel vey cheap. The tool worked great the first time I used it and then I went to use it the other day and will not strip wire at all. The wire just slides out of the grips and does not strip it. I could not find any type of tension adjustment so I guess this tool is just a waste of money. I will be more careful in the future when considering to buy OTC branded tools.

"Ok I have my Own BMW only repair shop and as with BMW's come many challenging electrical issues so I am always using my volt meter. I do have several that I currently own and use. I have a couple of Fluke meters that are older but still work fine and then I also have a Centec and Radio Shack meter. Out of all them of course the Fluke is the best but also cost over 400.00 new and then the worst I have had would be the Radio Shack it is just poor build quality.  This Extech is below the Fluke in build quality but for sure better than all my other meters. The buttons are nice rubber feel and not cheap hard plastic. The meter is packed with all the functions I would need in a basic meter. I mainly use my meters for voltage test, voltage drop, current draw, resistance and diode checks are the most common. I rarely need an oscilloscope and my Fluke meter does not have that function either. The meter responds to measurements quickly but not instant like my Fluke but it is very accurate compared to my Fluke meters.  I really like the little yellow button that you have to press and hold for the backlight to come on. It is nice and bright and none of my other meters have this so is really nice when working under the dash with poor lighting. The hold and min max functions are surprising to have for the price point of this meter. Also included is audible sound for diode test and other functions. This meter also has a nice flip out stand to keep the meter upright and also has retainers built in for the cables to keep put while not in use. If I had to pick something that I did not care for is the cable leads are somewhat shorter than I like. A nice addition would be a rubberized case for it because I tend to have butter fingers and seem to drop everything. And yes I have already dropped this once but no damage was noticed. All in all for the price and build quality I would say for sure is a good deal. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECQGJBJQBWE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDQ2BOC#wasThisHelpful","R1ECQGJBJQBWE8","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this Blu Studio Energy phone about two weeks ago to replace my Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro that was good but was just too buggy. The battery on my old Samsung would last me an average of 2-3 days with moderate usage including calls, text, emails, internet use, and GPS. This also my Business phone for my repair shop so I get a lot of calls.  I bought this phone mainly because of it's advertised battery life and I figured if I could get more than 2-3 days I would be very happy. Wow I was really blown away when I was able to get almost 9 days on a single charge with all the above mentioned usage. I kept telling my wife everyday that went by and I was still on the same charge. By day 4 or 5 she was really getting mad at me for bringing it up everyday because she has an iPhone 5 and has to charge her battery up half way through a day to get by.  As for the rest of the phone I am really happy with the size and weight of the phone. I thought that it would be really heavy and bulky with that hugh 5000ma battery but not at all. Now no it is not as thin as a Samsung Galaxy S5 but it is welcome for me since I can hold onto it much better with the slight thickness increase.  The phone is very fast with all apps and usage and specially the internet. The only feature that is not real fast  to me is texting and it seems to lag slightly but not bad. That maybe part of my service with Cricket or the phone but not sure either way. Oh and the phone comes with a nice protective cover that I am using and a screen protector that I used then 1 day later stared seeing bubbles so I pulled it off and threw it away. After some research I found VSTN  Blu Studio Energy Glass Screen protector that is really a very thin piece of tempered glass that goes on exactly the same as the standard plastic one does. I was so blown away when I removed it and it really was a piece of glass and it applies just the same as normal and with Zero bubbles and you cannot even tell it is on because it fits so well. Another thing and maybe my imagination is the screen seems to be much more sensitive to my touch and that is a good thing.  All in all I am very very happy with this phone in everyday compared to my old Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro. Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RESWHTDDPF03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZEFJ68#wasThisHelpful","RESWHTDDPF03","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I placed an order for this to give to my 9 year old daughter to wear this Easter Sunday and wow very very nice. The bracelet came in a nice gift box that is hinged. Being a man though and my daughter anxiously waiting I was not able to open the bracelet to put on her wrist. It has a very small clasp on the side that you flip over to unlock it and I thought it would just open after that but no it does not. Took me a bit to figure out that you also had to push down on the little tab that is near the clasp and pull outward at same time to open it.. Wow I felt dumb but is double security that it won't fall off.  Now yes I did give this to my daughter but my wife loves it too so I may have to buy one for her. The feel is very good quality and is well made. Not just cheap stamped piece of metal. It looks like it should hold up very well indeed. This picture just does not do it justice. Really needs a picture of it on a ladies wrist.

"I decided to give these Dickies steel toes shoes a try because I have been having problems with my steel toe boots sweeting too much and feeling like a swamp in my boots and smelling like it too. I noticed before buying these that they have breathable mesh all over them so that is what I was drawn to.  Upon opening the box and pulling the shoes out I was blown away with how light they are. I had to pinch the toe to make sure it was really a steel toe shoe and it is indeed. I put them on and laced them up and the rest is history. I have been wearing them for a little over a week now and am very glad to say that my feet are not all sweaty at the end of the day and no swamp feet either. The shoes overall are very comfortable and light weight. These will not weigh you down at all.  So if you have a problem with sweaty feet or can't stand the weight of a heavy work and need steel toes then this might just be the answer for you too.

"Wow I knew this was portable but unreal. Unfortunately most of the people reviewing this Decoy are not hunters and were expecting a yard orniment that was 3 dimensional  and would look pretty. This is not that. This is solely for the hunter and to attract the Tom's eye's and not the humans.  This Decoy is an awesome design for portability and most hunters know you already have enough stuff to drag around and weigh you down so this is a warm welcome for me. One less thing to weigh me down or make loud sounds the better.  Now this is made of a screen printed photo on material and stretched over a collapsible frame. If you watch the attached video it will show how you simply twist and fold it then just place it in your pocket and that is it. When you are ready to set it up simply pull it out of your pocket and it folds out on it's own. Next just place in your favorite spot with the attached pole.  Now for the fun. Sit and wait. This is a very realistic Decoy and is accurate to attract a Tom. All In all for the price and portability factor this is a very well engineered product. Please only hunters review this item for hunting purposes and not a lawn decoration. Hope this helps the real hunters out there like me.

"I purchased this screen protector because it says it is tempered glass. My thoughts were no way this could really be a piece of glass as a protector but to my amazement it is an extremely thin piece of tempered glass. This kit came with a cleaning wipe, a drying wipe, and a lint cloth. I followed the directions and placed the screen on and wow fits perfect and zero bubbles!!! I looked it over real good and can't even tell it has a screen protector on it.  What is even more amazing is that with the screen protector on it is more sensitive to the touch and the touch screen actually works even better with this on. I am so glad I tried this protector because I have never until now been happy with a screen protector because it either had bubbles from day one no matter how carefully I was or within days the screen protector would start lifting in the corners. Well worth the couple of extra dollars to get this one that I feel will last the life of the phone.

"I received this Bosch impact drill a few days ago not really knowing it's capacity but all I can say is Wow!! When I pulled this out of the box and saw how small it is my first thought was this thing cannot have any real power but I was so wrong. This Bosch impact drill is way smaller than my Porter Cable drill I have been using and way lighter too.  My first test was to try to break lug bolts loose on my BMW. I figured it would be a joke but much to my surprise it broke them loose with ease. This impact drill has 3 electronic torque settings and while it works just fine I still would prefer the old fashion twist torque settings. For me just 3 torque settings is not enough but I will probably will get used to it. Just a learning curve.  This also has a hole within the center of the 1/2 drive that accepts hex type screw driver bits and drill bits. It also comes with an adapter so you can use 1/4 drive sockets too. This is a very versatile tool that is a drill and impact wrench. Now this is 139 ft lbs torque and is almost as powerful as some light duty air powered impact wrenches so really is very impressive indeed.  The way that this unit charges is amazing to me. It is an inductive charger and all you need to do is set in on the base and charges all on its own. No battery to take off every time to charge. It will always be fully charged and ready to use this way. Charging time seems to be quick at just about an hour for the first charge.  This will for sure replace both my old drill and impact driver for most purposes. Now yes it will probably not break loose stubborn lug bolts but for every day use this will do for me at my BMW repair shop. The included carry bag is a nice bonus. All in all I am very very impressed with the only exception of the electronic torque settings. ThanksUpdate: Just discovered that using this as a drill to drive screws in a deck is awesome. The impact function ratchets the screws down with no effort and I am talking about 3 inch long screws that sometimes tend to break before seating all the way down. Works very well driving screws for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRDCH1WRV7WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ND4H4K4#wasThisHelpful","R3IRDCH1WRV7WE","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had a water pipe burst upstairs and ruined my hardwood floors in the kitchen so i have been pulling the flooring up and needed to find a way to remove all the adhesive on the concrete that was holding the flooring down. From ready all the reviews on this tool I thought it would be perfect for this job but just did not work well at all. The blade just slides over the top of the glue no matter the angle used. I ended up using my flat blade shovel and grinded a sharp edge on it and it actually did a decent job removing the glue. The Bully floor tool may work well in other areas but not good for removing floor glue in this case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQEUALH8FCWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000224PU#wasThisHelpful","R2VQEUALH8FCWD","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this for one of my Mini Cooper Customers since the price was good and was stainless steel so thought should be very good. So ok the day came to install it and looked very nice and well made but when went to fit it that was not happening. This is only for 2003 and under Mini S but yet listing stated it fits 2006 also. I contacted the seller and stated that it will fit but requires mods. So anyways I proceeded to spend an extra 2 hrs to modify and make it fit but boy what a pain and did not quote for extra labor so my loss but. Next came starting the car up and wow does it sound cheesy. It has a metal can sound to it and not at all impressive. If you like the sound of riceburner cars like the Hondas then you will probably like it. Needless to say when my customer picked up the car he was not happy at all. He said it was cheap sounding and I agreed. I purchased an additional muffler to install in the center section before the main mufflers and that helped the sound quality considerably to the point were the customer is happy. Point learned ""Stay with factory parts"".

"Wow I was really surprised when I received these and they look and feel very nice and well made but that is where my excitement ended. I installed them on my wife's 2001 BMW X5 and fit nice and secure but when you use them it is just a plain mess. Both sides streak about 3 inches wide under the arm mounting point. I tried to mess with it but did not matter still huge streaks!! I removed them and put my 4 month old Duralast ones back on and they work perfect with no streaks.  Next I figured well maybe it was just the car and thought I would try them on my 2001 Ford F350. Nope!! Same exact problem with 3 inch wide streaks under the mounting point areas on my Ford too. So off they went and my old Duralast wipers went back on my truck too!  Well to wrap it up the SilBlade wipers are nice and fancy but just plain fail in the most important dept and that is they just don't clean the windshield.I cannot recommend these wipers as they seem to be poorly designed and cannot withstand any pressure that any wiper arm will put on the blade.

I installed them and right side works great. Left side flashes on and back off. Have to cycle light switch on and off at least 6 times before it will stay on. Hmmm not too good but I figured for the price I would go ahead and buy another set. So I installed another one in left side and is working perfectly fine now. Oh I did test the other new bulb and works great to so I have 3 good bulbs out of 4.

"I received this Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress to replace my aging but still good Sterns And Foster pillow top mattress and so far I have noticed that this gel mattress is a bit more firm than my old pillow top and while it is taking some getting used to it is very comfortable. All my kids have nice memory foam mattresses and finally we do now too!! I was not surprised by the weight of it since I have dealt with heavy memory foam mattress in the past and this one is heavy too! I quickly and very carefully cut open the huge plastic rolled up mattress and it was full size and shape within minutes. You must be very careful when cutting the plastic wrap so as not to damage the fabric cover. Don't ask me how I know :-) I was very happy to find that their was no horrible oder to the new mattress but yes there was a faint new smell for a couple of days and with all new memory foam mattresses.  My wife and I have been using this mattress now for about two weeks and is very comfortable but firm too. You do not sink into it at all really. Another very nice thing about this is you do not bounce your wife around when jumping into bed like a traditional spring mattress would. That could be good or bad but I like it. So for the price point it is a better mattress than my children have but the price was no more so very good here.  If I had to state something I do not like about it is that it is a little bit firmer than I am used to but I am sure that will change in time.

"Wow I just received this OTC wire loom set and so glad I decided to give them a try. I am a BMW technician and they have their share of wiring issues that I have to repair. BMW's have a common problem of wiring breaking in the trunk and hatch flex conduit and the broken wires must be pulled out and repaired. In the past I have always used a coat hanger and while it worked it was not easy.  Well this OTC set is a game changer. I find that the long ones work the best for me as they are flexible and they can be used for either pushing or pulling wiring through the conduit. The tool that is used for pushing wiring through a grommet is very nice. Whenever I have an aftermarket accessory to wiring in I have to make a puncture through the firewall and this tool works perfect.  All in all yes the tool set is not super cheap but will pay for itself the first job. Oh yeah the included plastic storage case is nice enough to keep and place in my tool box. I will be using this set for many years to come. Hope this helps.

"I received this Irwin Unibit set and am loving it. I have always want a set like this but has never been in my budget. I have used these for installing spoilers on cars. I used to use regular drill bits and tape the painted surface so it does not chip the paint but with these Irwin Unibits I don't even need to put tape on the painted surface because these don't chip the paint. I love that these bits can step up progressively as needed without having to change out drill bits all the time. Now for the speed of cutting is good and do not need to put heavy pressure for it to cut well into sheet metal. The holes are beautiful and clean every time. They also cut fiberglass really well and clean. Now my only gripe is that the picture of the item has a nice plastic case and easy to get each bit out as needed but the case I received says Irwin on it but is zippered and a foam pad has cutouts for each bit but is very hard to get them out.

"I received this pressure washer a couple of weeks ago and have not been able to use it until recently due to very cold weather but I am please well very pleased with it's overall performance. It looks weird with the hose reel but does work well. It has a little footrest built in at the base so that it will not fall over while rolling up the hose. Was pretty easy to put together about 10 minutes and was ready to go. First impression was hmmm not bad. Easy to move around unlike my gas powered 2500 psi that I also have.Ok so the hose is plenty long enough and is not too stiff and the pressure wand has a nice lock unlock to use and then we have the array of various tips to choose from. Each one works best for the appropriate job so you need to know which tip is for what purpose. The needle tip works very well for stubborn debris removal but does not cover much surface area. The fan spray tip is best for use for general cleaning of siding and concrete etc.The onboard chemical tank is a nice size and can regulate how much of it flows out and also have a built in pressure control that is variable from not much pressure to full blast. Needless to say I have been using nothing but full blast on my driveway and siding. It does a very good job cleaning but is not as powerful as my gas model at 2500 psi and only time you really need that extra pressure for me is when I am cleaning my siding that is high up near the peak at about 20ft. Otherwise the 2000 psi is plenty.My only gripe would be is the wand and having to change out various tips. I am spoiled to my gas model that is an all in one and you simply twist the end of the wand to change spray patterns and pull in and out to increase or decrease volume.All in all this is a very well built pressure washer that works very well indeed. Yes I would recommend this to anyone. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FAMT4FV31QCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XBM64#wasThisHelpful","R3FAMT4FV31QCZ","A2CIQEY05SPHTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CIQEY05SPHTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one of the first devices I have to allow USB otg. It is only certain devices, so check to make sure yours is compatible. Not only is this an awesome 5 port charger, but the OTG access allows file access for your phone. This allows you to transfer files like moveis, music, etc. using USB, which make it faster than wifi or easier than hooking it up to your computer. Note not all devices are OTG compliant, so check to see if yours is.Beyond that, the 5 device charger is great. It will be ""smart"" and calculate what speed to charge your device at. Do note the 7.8 amp maximum and plan accordingly.

"The human body is always fascinating. So to have a device that you can use at home to tell you your pulse ox is quite interesting. it's very small and portable. A pulse ox works by comparing two light sources against the blood and how much is absorbed. Based on that, it determines how much oxygen is bonded to hemoglobin which carries oxygen. It's really quite enlightening. I believe the normal value is around 95-100%. This allows you to see how well your body is absorbing and circulating oxygen, just like in the hospital.At the end of the day, it's nice to know that I'm alive and breathing.Item was provided for unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20T8SIU55B241/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZFQRFW#wasThisHelpful","R20T8SIU55B241","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm constantly amazed at my own needs for how many ports I need to charge all my devices, ipads, android tablets, nexus, iphones, where does it end? this 8 port device really suits my needs.

The smart ports are nice as they will adjust as to how much power you need so it won't overcharge or overpower your device charging. There's a light as well to let you know something is plugged in. As I accumulate more portable devices, every one uses micro usb, and as such, I need more charging ports. This comes in handy.

"This isn't your ordinary battery pack. For one, this one was designed with stronger aesthetics than typical battery packs. Most battery packs are brick like, with corners. This battery pack, however, has rounded corners. This makes for a battery pack that is easier to slip in and out of a pocket or a purse. The biggest pro is this is 12.000 mAh, which is typically one day of battery for me, my phone, and a portable hotspot. One downside is that it only has 1 output port, but it is rated for 2.1 amp, which is a faster charge. The included cable stores away neatly when not in use. Charging time is as advertised. I had it charging while I slept and it was charged when I woke up. To check the battery level, you shake the battery and it'll show up on the 4 indicator lights how full or empty the battery is.This battery pack would be ideal for those who have a cell phone and are going on a longer trip.

"This is one of the best surge protectors in the market today from a functional point of view. It used to be you keep your surge protectors behind desks and just plugged in when needed.

There are 2 normal plugs and 5 USB plugs. All 5 usb plugs are 2 amp, meaning you can get a fast charge for all your devices.

It's great to use and have cables connected, and not have to figure out which port goes to which amperage, like with some other manufacturers.One feature that is nice is the colored ports. orange is the qualcomm quick charge port, and the other two are smart charging, meaning the charger will determine the appropriate charge to the phone. It can charge up to 2.4 amps, so any phone and even the large tablets like ipads and samung tablets which require the 2.4 amps.Overall, this is a great, handy device to have, and should be standard for anyone these days as we continue to have multiple devices that need to be charged.Item was provided for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LA9JSOWCXF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV4HCL0#wasThisHelpful","R10LA9JSOWCXF4","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sure you've seen bluetooth headsets that have a U loop for the neck. Let me tell you, those are uncomfortable. This headset is so much more comfortable. It doesn't restrict the headset on the back of your neck. It also doesn't need to hook over your ears, which are better for someone who wears glasses. This makes this one of the most comfortable bluetooth headsets I've used. They work like earbuds in a way, since you fit them into your ear.The sound quality is good. It's easy to pair to your phone. and doesn't take up much room for storage. The earbuds are quite comfortable as well.

It has a solid, all metal construction. I feel secure using this with my DSLR. You can control X, Y, and Z direction easily. There is a leveler bubble indicator that allows you to stabilize the tripod mount and camera. It helps with leveling the camera on shoots.

It also allows you to play music from your phone, something most other bluetooth devices can't do.Also, there are two ways to charge the device. Directly charging the device, or with the adapter dock, which you can leave on a desk. So even on the go, you can charge in your car, without needing some sort of special adapter. Charging in either case (dock or device) is via micro usb. So any standard charger will do. Pairing was an easy process .Just find it on your phone and it is paired.Sound quality is pretty good.

"Have you ever had your phone slip and slide on those rubber mats? This isn't that. It uses a magnetic system that's attached to the back of your phone for a strong grip. Surprisingly, it works. It makes taking your phone off and putting it on a lot easier. It also utilizes space that you would never utilize, an air vent (besides for air of course). It's easy to install. Put the backing either on your cover or on the inside of your case (for aesthetics), then put the mount on the vent and you're ready to go. easy peasey. Easiest mount and works well.

"When you've got boys, you've got kids who love pocket knives. And of course their friends do too. So my kid was the envy of everyone When looking for a knife, you want a strong blade, a sturdy handle, lightweight, and of course sharp. This comes with those qualities. The blade is strong, stainless steel. The handle is lightweight, I think out of aluminum. It comes in a nice storage pouch you can use to keep it safely tucked away until you need it. We took it out to do some prep for an upcoming camping trip and it worked just as sharply on the last cut as it did on the first cut.I would highly recommend the product for anyone looking for a pocket knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDJOM10BEA0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCOFV2G#wasThisHelpful","R2KDJOM10BEA0Q","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One thing I can say about this is that it's a pretty decent pen. When you buy a product that says tactical pen as opposed to a pen that's also a tactical item, you expect it to excel in the tactical side, instead of the pen. However, on this, it does a decent job at both. The tactical portion of the pen is mild enough so that it will not cause a security stir. If I were walking around somewhere at night and needed something to fend off an attacker, this would be something that would be useful since I don't carry any weapons.And of course, you can't forget the pen too. it has a finer style than most other ball points. In fact, I'd probably even use the pen part as a tactical weapon too, since at that point, I'd be up close with my attacker.Fortunately, I have not yet had to use the tactical pen as a defensive weapon, so i can't comment on it in ""actual"" use, but it seems well built and able to at least give me a few more seconds that would help me escape or disable an attacker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY3R6PPXD8CZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGHLOLS#wasThisHelpful","RY3R6PPXD8CZ9","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some power banks can take forever to charge. You've noticed this I'm sure if you were trying to charge your ipad with your iphone cable, you'd notice how slow it is to charge. So imagine charging a power bank the same way, especially that of a monstrous size at 12,000 mAh. For one, the device has to support a 2 amp charge, which most power banks I have do not. So the fact that this power bank has that, already puts it a step up.Ports: any standard micro usb will charge (up to 2 amps). 2 output ports, a 2 amp and a 1 amp, which allows you to charge devices like an ipad (which do well at 2.1) and phones at 1 amp. Testing the recharge, I was able to wake up to a fully recharged battery pack (which you can tell my the indicator I'll mention later) about 7 hours later.Capacity: 12,000 mah is a good power back for a full day activity. Using this, I was able to keep my portable modem and phone charged throughout a day at a local amusement park. On most phones, this should be at least 5-6 charges, which is good for an amusement park, if you use your phone in line, or give the kids a movie to watch while waiting in line. I used mine liberally throughout the day and it worked well, and was the ""push"" i needed above the 10,000 which died with a couple hours left in the day.Other Notes: The indicator light on this is a bit different from other chargers. The ""AUKEY"" logo on the battery pack serves as the light system to warn you about charging status. A red logo means low charge, a green medium, and white high charge.It's got a flashlight. Hold the power button and you get a pretty bright LED. a micro usb cable is also included in the box. Size of the device is quite small. I've got 10,000 mah that are bigger. But the long and slim battery pack I prefer since it's easier to keep in your pocket without a giant bulge. It's very slim and would be very similar in size to a cell phone.Overall, this battery pack highlights a dual USB port output, a flashlight, and a 2A input charge, giving it far faster charging times than other batteries.I was provided the power bank for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2M6CAIBBP9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSY1AJU#wasThisHelpful","R2L2M6CAIBBP9A","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So one thing that bugs the Apple side of me is the fact that i still need micro usb cables to charge battery packs. This is where this battery pack shines. This battery pack actually uses your lightening cable instead to charge. This is a huge benefit so that the apple side of me can consolidate down cables and not have to carry extra cables to just charge the battery pack.At 3600 mah, i can get about 2-3 charges from the battery pack making it useful for keeping my phone juiced through the day. I'm always on my phone, so it's handy to have. Since I already have lightening cables in my office, home, and car, it's easy to recharge this wherever I am.The device is pretty light and slim. I prefer a long slim battery vs a smaller but wider device since it slips in and out of places easily. There are LED indicator lights to help you watch your charging time and depletion time. The battery pack does not come with a charging cable.

"Bamboo is such an interesting material. It's grown, like wood, yet tough, like steel. It's pliable and can be used for a myriad of things. This package is a great value for 3 boards, rather than individually. The way I go through cutting boards, having 3 makes things easier. Bamboo is a great material for boards because it's resilient. It doesn't nick as easily which is better for your health and sanitation. The three boards give you some versatility to either cutting or serving.

"Bamboo is such an interesting material. It's grown, like wood, yet tough, like steel. It's pliable and can be used for a myriad of things. When I just want to chop one thing, a small board is perfect. And so much easier to wash than a large board. I use this to chop up sausages for grilling, or to chop up a quick onion for a mix. The nice thing about the board is that it doesn't absorb the smells, especially when I chop onions and such, unlike my plastic boards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R186LMXRHKUDMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPW7UIG#wasThisHelpful","R186LMXRHKUDMQ","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bamboo is such an interesting material. It's grown, like wood, yet tough, like steel. It's pliable and can be used for a myriad of things. The bamboo board is strong and durable. I have no qualms about using it for anything I need. This particular size works well for me as a serving dish more so than to cut. I like large boards to cut, but for this, it works well for presentation. I put out cheeses and crackers (along with knives, and other utensils). I don't have to worry about scratching my dishes since the board is sturdy. It makes for a nice rustic presentation of cheese platter. Certainly a great way to use the board.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIUBACYQ9NS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPVXYN2#wasThisHelpful","RIIUBACYQ9NS0","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This adds Bluetooth functionality to anything really. It comes with the connectors you need to hook up devices via 3.5mm audio port. You just attach it and start syncing Bluetooth with it.

So with that, I pair the bluetooth to my phone and the music will play over the Bluetooth that way. it is easy to pair, and easy to use. My audio quality is a bit difficult to judge because I'm using a tape and that diminishes sound, but that is due to tape.

Well, for one, there are 3 ports. I remember the days of just 1 port in the car. But the highlight of this charger is that each of the ports offers 2.1/2.4A. Traditional car chargers only offer 1 Amp. So you can get your device charged twice as fast. You can also charge your ipad/tablet reasonably fast now, as opposed to slow 1 amp chargers. The footprint is small, and the device feels solid.

"Item was provided by manufacturer for review. The review represents my unbiased opinion.The size of this device is about the size of a nexus 5 and a bit thicker. I can get about 2-3 charges from the device, give or take for my nexus 5, on par with what's to be expected from this battery. So it's great to throw in your purse or your wallet since it is light. There is a hole you can clip the device to as well. You can clip it with a carabiner (not included) to a bag or your belt loop for those moments you need emergency power. The loop is actually pretty thick, so it wont break off easily. Its great to have in the glove compartment as well, when you need a boost of emergency power or on a camping trip since the device can be charged via solar.  The design of the device is very simplistic. There are 4 LED lights indicating status and a power button to check status or turn on a small flashlight on the side.Charging Time: Charging time took a few hours for a complete charge, with the status lights indicating the charge. Each light represents approximately 25% of the charge remaining or charging up to.The solar charging is a bit slow. The stated input is 200mah for the solar charger. One side is solar, so that would make sense. It does take a lot of solar panels to produce power, so 200 mah is not bad at all. It would be good for emergency power, for those instances you may get stranded in the woods, or on a camping trip without any power.Ports: There is one port for charging. The device can be charged using any standard micro usb charger.  You can use the included micro usb cable, or for apple fans a micro usb to 30 pin converter. There are 2 output ports, each at 1A. Each is covered, so the port can be protected from inclement weather. I decided it probably wasnt a good idea to test how waterproof the device is by submerging it in water (since electronics dont go in water).Highlights of this case: This is a very rugged battery pack. It has a loop so that it can be hooked anywhere with a carabiner that is included. It provides one cable with a 30-pin converter. It is great to have when you need an emergency juice up on your phone, as I seem to need one everyday around lunch. Would be great for camping and in rainy weather since the ports are protected, something I have not seen in other battery packs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDFU4TBPM200/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2D7J5G#wasThisHelpful","R3EDFU4TBPM200","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Item was provided by manufacturer for review. The review represents my unbiased opinion.This charger is easy to use. If you have an existing cable for your micro usb phone, just plug it in and put your phone on top. QI technology is awesome. Wireless touching. The con is that it may not be as energy efficient as plugging in a regular cable and you do have to find the right positioning for your device.That being said, the Nexcon device attempts to make things easier. Each manufacturer puts the QI spot in a slightly different location. For my nexus 7, it's about square center in the device. For my nexus 5, it's almost center, but offset a bit on the bottom side. So with that, it's important that the Qi charger doesn't move. The charger has a rubberized grip to ensure that. The charger itself has a light indicating if a connection is met or not. The light is red for powered on but no connection, and green solid when there is connection.The charging works well. The footprint is small so it doesnt take up much room on my nightstand. I thought the small footprint would be a problem for my tablet, but it's not. The rubberized feet hold it in place well.Overall, this is an inexpensive QI charger that works well and gets your devices charging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6I5AOY7STOI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJEGE0U#wasThisHelpful","R6I5AOY7STOI5","AAOYA0DKWED4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAOYA0DKWED4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are a fan of Cards Against Humanity and all things politically incorrect then you will love this game. Like Cards, be sure you play this with friends who are comfortable with lots of sexual and crude humor. The acting out also adds a fun element to the game.

"Like many reviewers of Concussion, I am a football fan but have for years been sickened by the attitude that athletes who take severe hits then get right back in the game are somehow showing how committed they are to their team. I cringe hearing the media call these players ""courageous"" while fans admire them for ""playing through the pain."" Like steroid use, the long term effects of these injuries was the elephant in the room that the NFL was successful at ignoring. But then Dr. Bennet Omalu was assigned to perform an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster. His results were startling and led to his studies on repetitive brain trauma and degenerative brain disease in athletes (chronic traumatic encephalopathy - known as CTE).Originally from Nigeria, Omalu was unfamiliar with America's obsession with the NFL and the billion dollar business it has become. So rather than have his findings embraced as he naively thought, he was denounced,mocked and shunned.Concussion is Omalu's story - as others have said, how David took on and ultimately beat Goliath.The story author Jeanne Marie Laskas tells is an important one but Laskas is not quite at the top of her game in telling it.Her writing does not flow as easily here - mostly in the early part of the book dealing with Omalu's background - but Concussion is a fairly quick read and I still recommend it even if you intend to see the movie.Despite the evidence, I'm skeptical that the attitude of the NFL will ever truly change but Concussion will help fans better understand CTE and what is really happening on the field the next time they watch a football game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPWFOVT5610L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812987578#wasThisHelpful","R1IPWFOVT5610L","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Lenox Holiday Jewel bar set is pretty and practical and adds a festive touch for holiday entertaining. The red faceted handles are acrylic so these feel more lightweight in hand than I expected. They are also hand wash only so despite looking pretty, these would not be my everyday go-to bottle opener and corkscrew. They work for the holidays and could make a decent hostess or secret Santa gift. I say ""could"" because many gift exchanges now use ""perceived value"" as a guideline rather than a set price range. This set does not have a perceived value anywhere near the suggested retail of $50 or even the current selling price of $25.

"When I saw another review that said the Fodor's Paris guide was over 400 pages, I had to check for myself since this is a very compact and easy to carry book. It is comprehensive, informative and full of maps and photos to help you plan your trip to Paris and to use as reference once you get there.I visit Paris fairly regularly and found the traveler's  information to be pretty accurate - social customs, currency, tipping, etc... My only observation is that the warnings of pickpockets around tourist destinations such as the Eiffel Tower or Louvre do not accurately convey just how bad the problem is, and not just around common tourist sites. The problem is rampant throughout the city so the warnings are not to be taken lightly.Paris is also one of the most expensive cities in the world so the price point suggestions in this or any guide are all relative so plan your budget accordingly.If you only take one book to Paris, this is the one to get. It is compact enough to carry in a purse or backpack but filled with everything you will need to know both before and during your trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OG8PH0MDCHB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101878290#wasThisHelpful","R2OG8PH0MDCHB0","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a rich, moisturizing creme with broad spectrum SPF 15. It is dispensed via a pump bottle and absorbs nicely into the skin.There are three active ingredients listed on the packaging: Avobenzone 3%, Octisalate 5% and Octocrylene 5%. All of these are listed as sunscreens so no chemical like hydroquinone - a common ingredient in some fade and ""brightening"" cremes - is present.Instead, the ""brightening"" comes via the exfoliating nature of the antioxidant complex of vitamins C & E, pine bark essence and lipo-hydroxyl acid.I like a lot how this feels on my skin - it reminds me of a much more expensive L'Occitane moisturizer that I have been using. It dispenses easily from the pump, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth and velvety.I have only been using this for a few weeks and do like how my skin looks but as the side of the box indicates, the ""use"" for this is as a sunscreen and daily use of many moisturizers with sunscreen will help improve skin tone to some extent.But the texture and quality of this particular Garnier moisturizer is on par with department store products at a fraction of the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIXFFTNKQ8PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168560XQ#wasThisHelpful","RWIXFFTNKQ8PG","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Whether or not someone likes this book will depend on what they are hoping to get out of it. How to Have a Good Day by Caroline Webb is a pretty intense read with - no surprise - a heavy focus on behavioral science. It is well researched and cites many psychological and sociological studies to help interpret the underlying causes of happiness and satisfaction - or lack thereof - in the workplace.Webb directly addresses productivity issues in her appendix - how to be good at meetings, how to be good at email and reinvigorating your routine - but for me, her practical suggestions got lost under the weight of the science behind her studies.While I appreciate Webb's research and expertise, I think her book would have wider appeal if she balanced the scientific studies with easy to understand (and implement) steps on achieving more satisfaction in the workplace. But if you are interested in the behavioral science behind how and why people end up unhappy in a work environment, then you will gain a lot from How to Have a Good Day.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XR24792I4QON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553419633#wasThisHelpful","R2XR24792I4QON","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto is a moving, lyrical almost poetic book by Mitch Albom. Like Tuesday's With Morrie, it takes the reader along on a journey that uses music as the ""higher power"" in life that stirs the soul.Here, Albom follows the life of musician Frankie Presto from his birth in war-torn Spain to his move to America and rise to international fame. I missed the book notes mentioning that Albom is a lifelong musician but it was apparent from the opening chapter. This book is filled with musical references that are lilting and poetic and add a sense of magical wonder to the story.In Forrest Gump fashion, Albom intersects Frankie's life with several real life characters. The story essentially begins with Frankie's funeral and led by the narrator ""Music,"" his life story and mysterious death is slowly revealed.I have only read two of Albom's other books - Tuesday's With Morrie and The Five Peole You Meet in Heaven - and like those books, The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto leaves the reader with a poignant sense of wonder and gently imparted wisdom on the gift of life, and yes, even death.This is a beautifully written, mesmerizing book. Like his fictional character Frankie, Albom uses his talent to touch the hearts of his readers.If you are a fan of Mitch Albom, you will love The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto. And if you are new to Albom as an author, this symphony of words is a wonderful place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RXFAAH4GIXLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294415#wasThisHelpful","R3RXFAAH4GIXLI","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent, high quality heating blanket. As the description says, it is made of a plush velour that is very soft and cozy even without the heating element.There are dual controls - one for each side of the bed - with 10 heat levels. An automatic shut-off kicks in after 10 hours but can be manually adjusted for up to 12 hours. A surprise to me is that each control has its own AC power cord so you will need two free outlets for this blanket.Like QuirkyGirl, I also compared this to the Serta brushed microfleece heated blanket. The brushed microfleece is surprisingly soft and thick and IMHO the better value (at approx. $30 less than the plush at the time of this review). If you prefer less bulk in your bedding - or just want to save some money - get the brushed microfleece blanket. It uses the same controls and is also excellent quality.

"I try to keep price out of the equation when leaving a product review but with the Proactiv+ Redness Relief Serum I can't help but have the cost factor into my comments. As for the product itself, when used as directed, which includes storing this in the refrigerator, it does have a cooling effect and feels good on the skin. Results were ok but nothing dramatic.I get better results with the Eucerin Redness Relief line of products and at a fraction of the cost. I was able to achieve the same cooling effect by refrigerating the Eucerin. I had not thought of that before but if you have a product you like, try refrigerating it to see if you get a cooling boost before investing in the Proactiv+.The Proactiv+ does work but not any better - and many times not as well -  as other products that are far less expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRYRG9316D28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6TSG4#wasThisHelpful","R3BRYRG9316D28","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so excited to give this planner a try and out of the box the metallic cover looks beautiful. However, as soon as I picked up the planner, I noticed the metallic layer of the front and back covers separating from the heavier stock cardboard underneath. When I went to open the planner, even more of the metallic layer separated away. The mere action of opening and closing the planner - or any bend at all of the cover - will make this even worse. I will attempt to glue down the metallic layer so that I can salvage the planner (this was sent to me as part of the Vine program and not something I can return).

"As someone who lives in our nation's capital, I spend a lot of time taking visitors to Mount Vernon - it's definitely one of the best attractions in the area. As such, I thought I knew a lot about George and Martha Washington but this book added an entirely new dimension to my knowledge of the couple.As author Flora Fraser points out, only three letters survive of the correspondence between George and Martha so she relies heavily on letters to and between others to piece together snippets of the Washington's marriage. While the information is fascinating, those letters shed little light on the feelings the two had for each other. One that stands out to me was a letter George wrote to a woman who had discovered some of his letters to Martha in a desk drawer she had purchased from Washington. She returned the letters unread, to which George replied that she would have found them ""to be fraught with expressions of friendship rather than enamoured love.""Another letter written between friends of the couple remarked that George ""was more a respectful than tender husband.""This book does provide an intimate look at the private lives of George and Martha and the challenges and heartaches they faced, albeit independently, during their years together.Fraser quotes often from various letters of that time so the result, combined with Fraser's own very formal writing style, makes this book a bit dry and academic to read.Set against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War, Fraser focuses on the everyday life of the Washington's - George's concerns about the operations of the estate and Martha's management of domestic issues.While I gained great insight into each as individuals - their feelings about slavery was particularly enlightening - it was almost as if I were reading about two parallel lives rather than getting an intimate look into their relationshipWhile I really loved this book I give it four stars - or four-and-half  if I could - rather than five because the writing style itself tends to slow down the reader's pace.Otherwise, brilliant work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3URFM9GVPXMM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307272788#wasThisHelpful","R3URFM9GVPXMM7","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite thinking of myself as a chocolate conneseiuer I had never heard of the Cailler brand before.This is not your everyday chocolate bar. It is very rich, smooth and creamy and definitely a premium chocolate. While prices do fluctuate, this seems to average about $4.50 a 3.5 oz bar - not all that much more expensive than the higher end drug store brands.It is slightly sweeter than I prefer but dark chocolate is my preferred poison.

"The Generals by Winston Groom is the story behind three of the most remarkable generals in our nation's history - Douglas MacArthur, George Patton and George Marshall. Groom is a captivating storyteller and links together what is in essence three mini-biographies and details how these lives intersected during World War II. Groom does an excellent job of bringing the unique personalities of each general to life.Unlike some other reviewers, my prior knowledge of each of these men was limited to a few WWII highlights so I was glued to this book from beginning to end. The back story of the early years of each man was particularly insightful as were the years after their exploits in WWII made them international heroes.As the book jacket says, The Generals offers ""a riveting look at the lives of America's most iconic warriors.""That describes this book perfectly.

"Overall I liked The Survivors by Robert Palmer. The plot is particularly clever - two men who are the lone survivors of a shooting 25 years ago reunite for the first time since the incident to unravel the mystery of what really happened that fateful evening.On the surface, the shooting was a murder suicide by Cal Henderson's mother. Cal, who was unhurt in the shooting, has blocked out most of what happened. Scottie, who barely survived a gunshot would to the head, shows up on Cal's doorstep unannounced and seeks to find the truth behind the grisely murders.This is a page-turner in that I was drawn in to the mystery of what really took place when Cal and Scottie were boys. And some of the plot twists were interesting as more and more people were revealed to be part of a cover up conspiracy.But as Scottie's violent outbursts and emotional instability escalated, I was troubled that Cal and others continued to placate his desire to carry a gun, worried more about what he might do should the weapon be taken away from him rather than the safety of others, including those he has threatened over the investigation.I would give this three and a half stars if I could. Clever concept and some interesting plot twists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9X6QQ4UQQ2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880826#wasThisHelpful","RM9X6QQ4UQQ2O","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Allen Eskens' The Guise of Another, Alexander Rupert is a decorated Minnesota detective under a cloud of suspicion. While relegated to a basement desk job, Rupert stumbles upon what looks to be a case of stolen identity when a man named James Putnam is killed in an automobile accident. His last words were ""find it before they find her."" As Rupert begins to follow the clues, the case becomes ever more complicated involving some of the most powerful men in the world of defense contracting and a ruthless contract killer recruited from the Balkans.Eskens is an author who is new to me and I found his writing to be taunt and compelling. The plot itself takes some unique turns and even as the final pages revealed several pieces of the mystery puzzle, there were still some surprises I never saw coming.The Guise of Another is a intriguing detective thriller with fast paced action that will keep you guessing until the very end just exactly how this will play out.Loved it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in this literary genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FV0Z60902JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633880761#wasThisHelpful","R38FV0Z60902JJ","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PUR 7 cup ultimate pitcher works well as a water purifier. Like other pitcher purifiers, you insert a filter into the top section of the device and fill with water. You do need to prep the filter by soaking for 15 minutes in cold water and thoroughly washing the pitcher itself before first use.The LED indicator is working well although it's too soon for the change indicator light to come on since this is a new unit.My one complaint is that the filling tank seems smaller than other PUR pitchers I have used. It took more than three tank fills for the pitcher to fill. With a new filter, the water does move through quickly but I am surprised that the tank don't hold a bit more in ratio to the pitcher itself.Otherwise, great tasting water for drinking straight or preparing coffee, tea or ice cubes.

"If you realize the Philips Norelco 1100 is a body groomer and not a shaver, I think you'll be happy with this.While designed for a man, it can be used by women as well. The bodygroom will not replace your shaver but give you a safer, alternative way to groom more delicate/private areas of the body. Two included heads allow you to adjust the closeness of the grooming. You won't get the same results as a razor but you also won't risk nicks and cuts in those areas either.This particular model runs on a battery and is safe to use in the shower.

"It has been years since I have used a headache powder - no reason in particular. They just are not as common in the US as they are in other parts of the world.In any case, I was already aware that powders act faster than tablets but I had forgotten what a difference that makes until trying Goody's Headache Powder in mixed fruit.I suffer from migraines but am able to keep them at bay if I take something non-prescription as soon as I feel even the slightest of headaches coming on. The Goody's worked noticeably faster for me in relieving my headaches and preventing them from turning into something more debilitating.My usual pain reliever is Extra Strength Excedrin but I was surprised to find that the Extra Strength Goody's has a stronger dose of both acetaminophen and aspirin compared to Excedrin:Extra Strength Goody'sAcetaminophen 325 mgAspirin 500 mgCaffeine 65 mgExtra Strength ExcedrinAcetaminophen 250 mgAspirin 250 mgCaffeine 65 mgThe extra strength Goody's is stronger and works faster for me.As for the taste? Not sure any headache powder will ever taste good but the mixed fruit flavor makes it a bit easier to swallow and does not leave as bitter an after taste. As with other headache powders, I tilt my head back, pour the powder onto the back of my tongue and take a quick gulp of water to swallow.My only complaint is that the packets are a bit difficult to tear open so you may want to have a small scissors close by.

"I have purchased several Ravenna covers in the past few years and have found them to be better than any others I have tried, some even at twice the price.Since I was already familiar with the quality of the Ravenna covers, I jumped at the chance to try out this double lounge cover.As with the others in this line from Classic Accessories, this cover is well constructed of a thick, waterproof material. There are click straps to keep the cover in place during storms and high winds and side handles to help with adjustments or removal.My outdoor furniture is exposed to the elements 24/7, 365 days a year so after trial and error with other covers that disintegrated after less than a year, I will only use the Ravenna covers.Yes, you can find less expensive covers but for the harshest of weather conditions, nothing beats the Ravenna line from Classic Accessories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAU5IQQW8YLZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZZHBYA#wasThisHelpful","RAU5IQQW8YLZ7","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Remington PF7300 F3 comfort series shaver is a good value compared to others on the market. While made mostly of plastic, it has a solid feel and is comfortable to hold and use.It is a bit louder than my more expensive shaver but nothing that most will notice unless you are making a side by side comparison.Included are a cover/stand and cleaning brush.I get a decent, close shave with this but not as close as with a traditional razor.But for the price and portability, this is a good choice.

It sprays on easily and has a nice scent that is not too overpowering. New to me is that you can use this on dry hair as well as wet hair.

I have long, color treated hair that has a slight natural wave to it but is not overly curly.When I want a natural, wavy look to my hair, I let it air dry after applying some sort of styling product. I have had good experiences with most Tresemme products but this was not my favorite. It left my hair too stiff and crunchy to touch.

"There is more to the Normandy region of France than the D-Day beaches and this Lonely Planet guide gives you a sampling of other attractions in that area. There are four suggested road trips included in this guide: The D-Day beaches, Monet's Normandy, a tour of the region's cheese producers and a World War I tour called In Flanders Field. Each gives a good overview of the area with color photos and maps, including a pull out map of the Normandy region. Since many international travelers will be transiting through Paris, there is a section on that city as well.As with other LP guides, there is comprehensive information about general travel in France - currency, voltage, social customs such as tipping practices, etc..I have been to Normandy and the D-Day beaches and wish I had known more about the area - the Flanders Field and Monet's Normandy tour would have made nice side trips. I do plan to return next year and will definitely have this book with me.These days, most people - myself included - do their travel planning and research online so it's no longer necessary to lug around the bulky tour guide books of the past. But having a compact book such as this Lonely Planet guide still comes in handy for quick reference and especially for the maps.If you are looking for a guide book dedicated solely to the D-Day beaches, then you should look elsewhere. While those beaches and the American Cemetery are incredibly moving and places I believe every American should visit, there is so much more to appreciate if you are making a trip to Normandy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FDI4GMAVSSH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743607075#wasThisHelpful","R2FDI4GMAVSSH7","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We all have wake up calls in life and for Stuart Stevens, one was turning 60 just weeks before Mitt Romney's losing bid for the presidency in 2012. As Romney's lead political strategist, Stevens used the loss as a chance to reflect on his own life, particularly his relationship with his father, who was now 95 years old. Recalling the days of his youth and the time spent with his father attending Ole Miss football games, Stevens decides to take his parents - blessedly both still alive and in good health - to every Ole Miss game for one final season.As Stevens takes his parents on road trip after road trip in the Ole Miss schedule, he recounts the games he remembers during his younger days - days of turbulent and violent race relations in Mississippi.Stevens blends his reflections on the lessons learned from his parents during this time with the adventures they were now experiencing during this last season of Ole Miss football.This is an easy to read book that is filled with nuggets of wisdom woven between the wins and losses of the Ole Miss schedule.Football fans will appreciate the details Stevens includes on each game he attends. But  you do not need to be a fan to appreciate this poignant and beautifully written tribute by Stevens to his father.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14U1HMK6JHY1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353022#wasThisHelpful","R14U1HMK6JHY1Q","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Author Shane Stanford uses Jesus's prayers as a guide to help readers deepen their understanding of the context of those prayers and in turn develop a more focused and powerful prayer life of their own.The book primarily uses the Common English Bible translation for reference with some King James, English Standard and Contemporary English versions as well.This is an easy to read book - less than 150 pages and not too academic.I found it very insightful and thought-provoking, both about Jesus's prayers and my own prayer habits.A simple but effective book for Christians to deepen their understanding of Jesus's prayers and developing a more powerful prayer life of their own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WGA858NOE1ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426774257#wasThisHelpful","R2WGA858NOE1ZT","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Boost Complete Compact nutrition drink really surprised me. At 4 oz. it has 240 calories, 10g of protein and 26 different vitamins and minerals.This is a rich, thick liquid with a smooth chocolate taste. It has no metallic aftertaste like many other nutrition and diet shakes I have tried. It really does taste great.While it is not intended to be a diet drink, I sometimes use it as a meal substitute, adding a bit of fat free milk if I want to increase the amount of liquid. Not only do I prefer the taste compared to the usual diet shakes on the market, I like the added nutritional benefits of Boost Complete.The compact 4 oz is also better for me - as rich as this is, the larger bottles are just too much for me to drink at one time.

"Though it would be 20 years before I even came into the world, through Jay Winik I felt as if I were there in 1944, feeling the terror as Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler daringly escaped from Auschwitz in an attempt to alert the world of its atrocities. I could feel the naive excitement as Ann Frank wrote in her diary on D-Day of the hope a successful invasion promised. And I could feel the weariness Franklin Roosevelt shouldered as he desperately tried to hide his dangerously failing health from the rest of the world.To say Winik is a master storyteller is an understatement.This is a riveting account of the events that shaped the outcome of World War II. Even at just over 500 pages, I could not put this book down.Still, you will read this with a heavy heart. The body count of WWII is estimated at 36 million - 19 million of them civilians. While hindsight is always 20-20, it is hard to understand how more was not done by Roosevelt to put an end to the grisly death machine of the Holocaust in the face of mounting evidence. Winik does a masterful job of weaving together the events in Europe against those taking place in America in an attempt to answer the questions of how and why this was allowed to happen.Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.No matter what year you were born, let Winik take you back to 1944...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PM13QUYDMHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439114080#wasThisHelpful","R32PM13QUYDMHY","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I travel to the West Coast regularly and am somewhat familiar with the Bay Area and wine country. Even so, I found the Lonely Planet guide informative and very useful. In true LP style, it is filled with maps and lots of local information - like various ways to pay the toll on the Golden Gate Bridge if you are without an electronic toll pass. Locals would already know these options but tourists, especially foreigners, would not.At 128 pages, this is a good size to keep handy in a car or backpack. If nothing else, the maps, phone numbers and website information is worth having at your fingertips. And let's face it - there are a lot of remote areas in Northern California where cell service is spotty and no Waze or Google to rely on. Physical maps still have a place in the world....I appreciate West Coast reviewers noting what they feel is missing from this guide but for first time visitors and those of us that do not live there, this is a good visual introduction to the area.

"Drones for Dummies is an excellent introduction to drones. Written in an easy to understand style, it covers everything you need to know about drones. As Mark LaFay says in his introduction, he assumes nothing other than that the reader knows how to use a computer and the Internet.From the basics of understanding how a drone works to buying, flying and various uses for drones, LaFay has authored a thorough book for anyone at all interested in drones. I'm not exactly a dummy but I'm no aviation expert either so this book was perfect for me.I found it extremely informative, especially the section on understanding the laws that govern the use of drones.And anyone who has ever taken a selfie will like the section on using drones for aerial photography.While there is a wealth of information here, LaFay is also a witty writer, making this an entertaining as well as educational read.Even if you have no intention of actually buying a drone (I'm still several months away from buying my own), Drones for Dummies is a fascinating look at one of the fastest growing segments of consumer technology today.Definitely recommended .. would make a great gift as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337PUTJJAXJM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119049784#wasThisHelpful","R337PUTJJAXJM9","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot to like about the Incipio Highland Folio case - so much so that after using the white case for several months, I recently bought the black one for a second phone.The case is very sleek looking with a textured fabric cover combined with a brushed aluminum back. It is a perfect fit for the Amazon Fire phone - it holds the phone securely while allowing access to all the ports and controls. The fabric and aluminum have a nice, tactile feel when using the phone.The inside of the case is a soft suede-like material with a slot to hold an ID or credit card.The only downside, which may be a deal breaker for some, is that there is no magnet, clasp or elastic to keep the cover snapped closed. At first I was concerned but after using this case for several months, it is not an issue for me.I'm sure there is some way to modify the closure but it's just not important enough for me to bother.This is still my favorite case for looks, durability and value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34T8LNWILXWWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZO02B6C#wasThisHelpful","R34T8LNWILXWWF","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had many fire pits over the years and this is one of my favorites.At 30"" in diameter, it is one of the largest available (and at a reasonable price). The mesh sides allow the fire to give off more light and warmth than those with enclosed fire bowls.The fire pit is easy to assemble and is sturdy without being overly heavy to move. It comes with a mesh fire screen and vinyl cover for protection from the elements when not in use. Unlike some fire pits, no poker is included.Like many fire pits, this one sits about 6"" off the ground so care needs to be taken when placing it on a deck or on grass due to the risk of scorching whatever is underneath..If you place a layer of sand in the bottom of the pit before lighting a fire, it will help keep the bottom of the fire bowl from getting too hot. It also helps to buy four 18"" cement pavers to use as a base if you are placing this in a yard or on a deck. Or just set each leg of the pit on a brick to raise it up. Those few inches in height along with some sand will make a big difference in protecting both your fire pit and whatever is underneath.But the size and open mesh sides are the features that set this fire pit apart.If you like a roaring bonfire, you will like this fire pit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V2HB1PXUP517/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GURAD4#wasThisHelpful","R3V2HB1PXUP517","A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would never have picked this book on my own as it's way out of my comfort zone but that's what book clubs do best. This was my GR Irish group read this month and, in a very odd way, I enjoyed this. It was full of peculiar characters, a macabre atmosphere and a story that is full of surprises.  Merricat lives an isolated existence with her older sister, Constance, and her Uncle Julian. There was a terrible tragedy at the house about 6 years ago and the odd family has become the village's outcasts. The simple fact of going to the grocery store and the library, terrifies 18 year old Merricat but she has to. Constance doesn't leave the house. In spite of everything they are happy and content.

"This was an enjoyable historical mystery featuring Charles Lenox, former member of Parliament and now a part owner of a private detective agency. Yes, the aristocratic Lenox is now in ""trade"" for goodness sake. Meanwhile  his wife, Lady Jane, is throwing parties that Royalty attend.  Lenox is involved in investigating not one but two mysteries. In London, a German pianist disappears in very mysterious circumstances that has the entire nation speculating on what happened. This could be a real boon for the agency if they can find the pianist. Meanwhile Charles accompanies his grieving brother to their childhood home in Markethouse.  There is quite a mystery going on there with a series of small burglaries and finally a stabbing of the mayor.  Working on the cases simultaneously keeps Charles on the go.  I learned a few things from this book. The expression, Riot Act, comes from a law enacted by George I in 1714. As a Hanoverian he was afraid the Stewart faction would try to overthrow him. He made a law making it illegal for 12 or more people to engage in ""tumultuous assembly.""  This has evolved into our usage of reading someone the riot act.  The other thing is the term, lackluster, comes from Shakespeare.  He made it up. I love a book that teaches me new things.  I highly recommend this book as entertaining and informative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCRH178519A9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250070414#wasThisHelpful","R3LCRH178519A9","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always enjoyed the Mitford series and have a little crush on Father Tim. Sorry Cynthia. I was really looking forward to the story of Dooley and Lace's wedding. I thought it would just shine. Unfortunately for me, it did not. There are several reasons for this:1. I found jumping around different people's stories without any kind of preparation quite unsettling. You would be reading about Dooley's thoughts and suddenly it would be Harley. It was unsettling for a long time reader but I despair for any new reader trying to make sense of this or even how certain characters were important to the story.2. There was just too many things going on. Dooley was graduating, opening his new business, getting married all at once. It just seemed overwhelming and things kept getting add to the pot. Yet some important situations were skipped over. I would love to have been in the selection of Lace's wedding dress especially since so much time was devoted to thinking about it.3. There was just not enough Father Tim in it for me. He is the heart and soul of the books and I needed a bigger fix.  What I did like was a surprise near the end that was so sweet and right that it took my breath away. It was special enough that I raised my rating to three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JX29RH8S12JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167455#wasThisHelpful","R2JX29RH8S12JA","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The picture on Amazon does no credit to this wonderfully delicate necklace.  The beautiful flower does not shine in the picture the way it does in real life. Can you tell there are sapphires that sparkle? The scroll work is delicate and if you wear on a darker item of clothes the whole necklace shines and pops.

"The first Kinsey Milhone book I read was [book:D is for Deadbeat|64857] back in 1987. I quickly went back and read the first three and have been reading them for almost 30 years now. I am despondent that there are only 2 let to go, ""Y"" and ""Z"" although Sue Grafton is probably relieved. I liked this one very much.  One of the things Grafton has done right, in my humble opinion, is to keep the series in the 1980's. It's only a couple of months between cases and I love that. I can't tell you how lovely it is to read a story without people on cell phones and computers being relatively new with many people keeping hand records. It's just so relaxing to read that time period. I also love the neighbor/landlord in his 90's, Henry, still active and churning out cinnamon rolls. California is in a bad drought, sound familiar? Henry is out to solve the problem.  In this one, Kinsey gets scammed and she just can't let it go. As she investigates why she was scammed, she stumbles into a case of missing art, dead girls and a psychotic killer. With scamming being the theme of the book, she gets some new neighbors who take your breath away with their audacity.  It's a great read with a very old friend. 30 years later and I am still entranced in Kinsey's adventures. It's good to catch up with her.  Other reviewers have mentioned the number of typos and errors in the book. They are absolutely right. I am not sure a copy editor worked on this and if they did, they should be fired. This is a major book on the best seller list and there is no excuse for it. The publishing house should be ashamed of themselves for doing Grafton such an injustice. I hope people keep talking about it and it puts pressure on publishers do a better job. This is not a cheap book and as a consumer I deserved better.  I think this is a first rate series and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZMPXVQDWOQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399163840#wasThisHelpful","R2VZMPXVQDWOQJ","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 stars  There are times when I read a book and then the reviews, I wonder if I read the book. This is one of those books. I found this book so saccharine, so gushing, so star struck that it was barely readable to me.  I almost made an appointment for the dentist as my teeth ached from so much sweetness. I can not tell you how much this book left me cold and it was only seventy five pages near the end that saved it as an one star for me.  Let me be clear. I have read this author before and like her. I am truly disappointed.  The story centers around Truman Capote and Babe Paley's friendship in the late 1950's/early 1960's.  It is full of stories of the famous rich and famous of that time period like C.Z. Guest, Pam Churchill, Diana Vreeland and even appearances from Betty Bacall and Jackie Kennedy. They were Truman's swans who found him so amusing. He gossiped with them, flattered them and became their pet. he participated in their parties, stayed in their houses and shared their secrets.  Frankly I did not find them interesting at all. Their lives seemed so boring to me. It consisted of lunching, shopping and keeping themselves in perfect shape.  They were bored out of their minds and looking for a diversion when Capote stumbled into their lives and they all adored him. It gives you a pictures of the privileges they seemingly enjoyed but it also lays out the high price they paid for it. Their subservience to men so they could stay married to the money was just horrifying. It is terrible to envision the beautiful and stylish Babe Pauley rub her husband's feet and keeping her make-up on all night so he could never see her face bare. Shudder.  Here are some examples of the gushing writing.  ""She (Babe) was a princess, a walking fairy tale.""  Truman says, ""You simply can't understand how glorious they were, those girls!""  Truman's supposedly last thoughts, ""The splendor of belonging, being included, prized, coveted. The beauty of a perfectly tailored shirt, crisp, blinding white, just out of a box. The beauty of taffeta, the tinkling of bells, diamonds, emeralds, a pristine paper flower. Beauty.""  If you are interested in the lives of the rich and famous who fill their days with shopping, eating, caring for their bodies and faces, partying and not much else then this book could be the one for you. I'm not so it wasn't the books for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSIN7WZE1PXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345528697#wasThisHelpful","R3FSIN7WZE1PXV","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my great pleasures in life is a new Precious Ramotswe book in the Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. I throw everything aside and settle in for a wonderful time with the calmness Mma Ramotswe brings me. The last thing I expected though was that she was going on vacation. What? Vacation? Well, sort of. It's her version of a vacation she was maneuvered into taking by her funny assistant, Mma Makutsi.  This means, of course, Grace will be in charge. Will the detective agency survive?  Precious does not do well with free time. She has a run in with a young boy who tries to get ""protection"" money from her to guard her van. This is both a funny and touching incident as many of her meetings are. How she handles things and people are just wonderful. Has any of them rubbed off on Mma Makutsi? You'll have to read the book to find out how well she does leading the agency.  You can't go wrong on this book and it make me feel much happier after I read it.

"What a great way to learn to read. I learned from a large ""Fun With Dick and Jane book"" in the first grade. This is infinitely better. My grandson just lit up as he could read it himself. He didn't need his old grandma's help. The pen is easy to use and the story is great.  He loves Paw Patrol so it was a perfect fit. Now I just have to buy him more books. Luckily the prices on these books for LeapReader are pretty reasonable. They are more affordable than the game cartridges.  I love the LeapFrog product.

"My boys ( now in their 30's) loved TMNT so I thought my 5 year old grandson might love them too. I was right. He was right on this game and enjoyed playing with it right away. He plays games on my Kindle all the time so he's got it down pat. They are so quick now. When I was five we had a huge ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" book on our desks. Sigh. I am aging myself.  These kids are just so much more clever.  There are two things that I  am not crazy about. The cartridges are now cards. Even though they come in a really great tin box that my grandson loves, it would be easy to lose them or bend them. My daughter-in-law is very good about these things but I worry about that. The other thing I don't care for is that you must complete a level to move one. This may be good for adult gamers, although I admit I get frustrated with that, but for kids it doesn't take long before they get bored and put it aside. There's just so many times he's going to try before he loses interest.  He is having a wonderful time and learning math so you can't beat that.

"I run a small business out of my home and have discovered this printer is exactly what I need. It's a big beast of a machine and has print/copy/scan/fax capabilities. It was incredibly easy to set it which is a big plus for me.  I have in the past had to have someone else install the printer for me.  I have thought for awhile it would be cheaper to buy a new printer instead of buying print cartridges. I had a $99 HP printer and would spend $35 for a black cartridge and $35 for color ones and if you did this twice the ink became more expensive than the printer. This one comes with a purported two years of ink. Instead of cartridges you refill the ink. Not only is it effective, it is also good for the environment.  That's a nice bonus.  I don't really know if I have two years of ink but I assume it depends on how much printing you do.  I think this is a terrific printer that provides you good support. It's better than running to Staples or some such place to do heavy duty printing and/or faxing. It's a winner in my book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2CBX2C7W9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","RU2CBX2C7W9E","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Serena Flanagan has returned to her job as Detective Chief Inspector with the Belfast Police Department after her fight with breast cancer.  Almost immediately she is confronted with an old case, The Schoolboy Killer. Eight years ago a 12 year old boy, Ciaran, and his fourteen year old brother, Thomas,  murdered their foster father. Ciaran is being released and his new probation officer wants to talk to her about him.  Flanagan has relied on a cancer survivor's group to help her with her struggle. When her friend, Penny, announces she has only a few months to live but wants to spend the time happily with her husband, Flanagan is saddened.  When Penny and her husband are found dead in an apparent murder-suicide, Flanagan begins to go off the tracks.  The two cases converge in one mega ending.  Although I wouldn't say it was a mystery per se, it is a very readable book that deals with cancer, sibling attachments, the foster care system and what happens to the families left behind after a violent crime. This is a perfect book for a book club because there are so many topics to discuss.  The novel is so authentic that the characters walk right off the page.

"I have been travelling lately. I have been to the Cajun country in Louisiana, the Highlands in Scotland and now Bruges. Of course, it was all done through books which is what makes them so lovely. I have been fond of Bruges since the wonderful movie, ""In Bruges"" with Colin Farrell and this book gives me such a powerful sense of place.  I love picking up on cultural differences and this book does that especially since it's translated. It was written for locals and not Americans so it gives it the added punch. One of my favorite lines was when the Inspector Van In says the name Verheye was such a common name that it was almost impossible to track down a specific one. Really? Verheye is common? Yes, my kind of book.  The book is about an influential man, Degroof, who is being targeted by someone wanting to exact revenge on him for past deeds. He is being punished through his children and grandchildren which was an unique way to go. There are plenty of twists and turns and a really surprising (to me) end.  It was quite a satisfying read and I hope to read more in the series. And the real bonus is having the city Bruges unfold before your eyes.

"This is the second book in a series set in the Highlands of Scotland. I love the sense of place and enjoy the fact that I know the little towns it talks about. I spent a week in the Highlands and enjoyed it tremendously. The book is set in the mid 1950's which is a lovely time to explore. The idea of a woman having a job outside the home is still a new concept and domestic violence against women is certainly handled differently than it is now.  This mystery concerns two separate deaths on the same estate on the same day. One is the newly married husband of the daughter of the owner of the estate. The second one is the son of the farm manager. Are they connected or just a coincident? The local newspaper is on the story and Joanne Ross, a recent reporter hire, is on the story even though she has ties to the crime. The staff at the paper is made up with interesting characters who made me laugh. I majored in journalism so I loved the story of the working newspaper.  This book captivated me from beginning to end. I love mysteries set in other places that make me feel welcome. I could really immerse myself in the local culture and the story ends on one very surprising twist.

Maggie Crozat and her family have converted their plantation into a Bed and Breakfast Inn with very interesting guests.

One week a group of people check in including an elderly obnoxious couple on their honeymoon, a group of fraternity brothers, a family vacationing from Australia and members of an organization called Cajun Cuties.  As in most mysteries, someone ends up dead or in this case two people and Maggie is determined to solve the crime. Along the way they turn down business for a Civil War re-enactment, very politically correct right now.  Someone is digging up the plantation looking for buried pirate treasure and someone is scheming to inherit an English castle.

In between the boys' stories are tales of training, race events and building of The Boat. He also talks about the times and the stories of the Great Depression were heart breaking.

That's the great part of it.  The bad part is the packaging for one thing. Whoever designed it should be sentenced to traveling around and undoing it for people. It was so frustrating and it took 15-20 minutes to get all of it out of the box. This is way to long. My horse does not speak. My granddaughter doesn't care but I think it should work as advertised. Princess Sophie does talk by pressing her amulet and my granddaughter loves this. I think it is over priced. I might have been more receptive to the price if the horse had actually talked.  The bottom line, though, is my granddaughter loves it and that's why I gave it four stars. If some of the kinks were worked out (packaging and horse talking) it would be a great toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23VPSXW5CIF8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T03U1X4#wasThisHelpful","R23VPSXW5CIF8K","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to love a Marian Keyes. They were light and funny and a vacation for my mind. This as none of those things. I didn't find it funny and it was just one stupid thing after another. Initially I liked Stella Sweeney. She was suffering from a life threatening disease and you really had to root for it. Funny? No.  After she recovers she makes some really odd decisions. A lot of things that are preposterous happen including how she ""writes"" a book. She has an ex-husband that's an idiot, a daughter who lives in the clouds and a son who hates her. She makes her life so much harder for herself. Funny yet?  In the end I grew to find her so annoying and the supporting characters made of cardboard. I was so disappointed. I had expected some cheer and got a lesson on sex with lessons I had never even thought of. That was a real eye opener. I had no idea the Irish were that randy (just kidding).  I feel like Keyes, like Janet Evanovich, have exhausted their genre. I find no reason to waste your time on this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LNI8UZMG4ES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525429255#wasThisHelpful","R11LNI8UZMG4ES","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 stars  This is a debut novel about Li Du, an exiled librarian in China in 1708.  He stops in Dayan where his cousin is the magistrate as prepares to leave China for the last time. His cousin is in the throes of preparation for the emperor is coming to view an eclipse that he supposedly causes by his power.  The Jesuits actually predict the eclipse but the emperor takes the credit. During the feverish preparations, a Jesuit priest is murdered and the magistrate hires Du to discover the cause of death and really wants it to be from natural causes.  This is a fascinating historical mystery. There is a great discussion of astronomy of that age, the influence of Jesuit priests on the emperor and a lot of great tidbits about life in China at that time. I feel the author captured the time period and took me on a great journey. I love that a lot of action took place in a library and it was wonderful to read about books in that period. I love that they catalogued books by the color of the books. It made such a pleasurable sight.  I hope this becomes a series. I am anxious to catch up with Li Du's adventures and hope that Hamza, the delightful story teller, stays with him. For those who like historical mysteries this is a good one. Let's hope it continues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394Z45K5TO2S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072328#wasThisHelpful","R394Z45K5TO2S1","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Us tells the story of a disintegration of the twenty five year marriage of Douglas and Connie. There are no major blow ups but it is a just a relationship that it is worn out. There is not enough passion to be angry but Douglas is resisting the break up. He still loves his wife.  They decide to still do their month long tour with their 17 year old son, Albie, touring Europe from one corner to another. Douglas is hoping to rekindle the romance and Connie, frankly, just seems to want to travel with their little family one more time. Albie, like all teen-agers ready for college, wants to go by himself. He very grudgingly goes along.  For an American the European tour is just breathtaking. I just can't wrap my mind around how easy it is to travel in Europe. In four hours they have been flying over many countries. In four hours I can't even get out of California in any direction. I love the train travel stories and just the ease of getting around.  Douglas is a scientist and quite smug about it. He can not imagine anyone wanting to do anything else. When Albie decides he wants to be a photographer, Douglas is appalled. He tells his son anyone can do that. It's only a select few that can be a scientist and make a real difference. I thought who would be that insensitive? Then I realized that Douglas is a real life Sheldon Cooper from ""The Big Bang Theory.""  He has the same traits as Sheldon in not knowing how he sounds to other people, his amazement that anybody would want to be anything but him and his inability to pick up cues from other people.In one episode Douglas creates a Lego sculpture then glues it so Albie can not destroy it. He is sure he will be greeted with applause and great awe. Instead Albie cries because he can no longer use his Legos. Douglas is bewildered and I could see this scene on ""Big Bang"".  Needless to say Douglas and Albie have a troubled relationship and how things unfold create new stresses. It's that exploration of how to repair things that is quite interesting. None of the characters are particularly likable. Douglas is Sheldon Cooper, Connie often mocks him and helps wedge some dislike between father and son, and Albie, like most 17 year olds feels he is quite entitled.  By the end of the book, I was glad I had met them but I was very tired of them. It was just like I had spent a month with family travelling around Europe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C65YSPTZZ69J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365592#wasThisHelpful","R1C65YSPTZZ69J","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific mini oven/slow cooker. It has the most amazing feature in that it browns the meat. Hallejuh! Thank you for making my life easier.  It is much bigger than the crock pot I have. Of course mine came from the stone age. I only wish I had this when I was raising my four kids. It would have been great. It also has temperature controls which is great.  The problem with it is that the handles get very hot. You have to be careful. There is no automatic shut-off which would have been nice and there is no timer. For the price of it, I would think those last two features would be included. Still those are manageable and my current crock pot doesn't have them so I'm used to it.  I have tried several of the recipes and they are delicious. The clean-up time is standard. I really love the size and the features it does have.

"This book has an interesting premise. Two people are locked into a space with no way to get out. They have no food or water. They have a gun with one bullet and a message that says the survivor would be let go. What will they do? How long does it take to succumb? How long can a person go without food or water before the sense of self preservation kick in? And if you do survive, how do you live with the survivor guilt?  That being said, I found the writing very uneven. The book switched between people's stories rapidly and with abrupt transitions. It was hard to follow whose story you were reading. Sometimes in one chapter there would be 3 or 4 transitions. The protagonist, Helen Grace, is not likable. Even when you do discover her back story, it's hard to feel any empathy for her.

"This book was put out as upgrade of two of the stories by the wonderful writer John Banville. It is described as a cloth cover which mine does not have or I do not know the definition of cloth. Mine seems to be a regular paper cover but maybe I missed something. It does have a wonderful book mark made of a ribbon built in. The print in it is small. At 62, it was too small for my eyes to read comfortably. I really strained to read it. I guess I am spoiled by my Kindle.  The first story, The Book of Evidence, is the story of a man explaining himself to a magistrate. Everything is told from the protagonist's point of view and he is a piece of work. Although the story is beautifully written, I couldn't spend more that 62 pages with him. He was just creepy beyond words.  The second story, The Sea, is about a man who returns to the place of fond childhood memories and a memorable family, the Graces. It is quite lovely.

"As I closed this lengthy (573 pages) new book in the Lynley/Havers series  I breathed a sigh of relief. Oh my goodness,  I think Elizabeth George is back on track. This was actually a good installment in the series. After George killed off Lynley's wife and unborn child on their own doorstep, the series went amok. She followed that incident with a book that was truly, in my opinion, horrible ""What Came Before Her"" and then issued four very mediocre novels with Lynley and Havers behaving very uncharacteristically.  I had really about given up but thought that I'll give it one more try. I am glad I did.  This book goes back to the tried and true formula of being about an actual crime.  Clare Abbott, a renowned feminist writer, is found dead in her hotel suite while on a speaking tour. At first it is thought to be a heart attack but after further investigation it turns out she was poisoned.  Attention turns to her assistant ,Caroline Goldacre, and she is quite a piece of work.  Caroline has one of the most dysfunctional families around. One son commits suicide and her employer builds a monument for him. What is the relationship between these two women?  Havers is still walking a thin line with her boss, Isabelle Ardery, who desperately wants her gone. With the real threat of transfer hanging over her head, Havers must walk a very disciplined line and that is so hard for her.  Dorthea Harriman, the department secretary, tries to befriend her and this is hysterical. Harriman is such a fashion plate and Havers is, well, not. Harriman tries to take her shopping and then they try speed dating which is funny. It's Havers taste in clothes that brings her in touch with Claire Abbott, the murder victim.  Lynley meanwhile is continuing his relationship with Daidre, the zoo veterinarian.  I think this thread is still a troubling part of the book. It just doesn't fit and I find the relationship awkward. It is just so unlikely. I don't know why George keeps trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. No matter how many times you pound that peg, you just can't make it work. It doesn't work. Stop it.  I have a lot of time invested in this series. I have read all the books as they come out. They require an investment of time as they are all over 550 pages. I have stuck to it through the very rough times when it appeared George had lost control of the series. I am glad it's back on track with a very readable book. The plot was interesting. The characters were interesting. Havers was back in form. Now if she could only stop trying to force the Lynley relationship, things would be great.  Even so, I can recommend this book to all those readers who have stuck with George. It is possible to read this as a stand alone and enjoy it but for long standing fans, it is a breath of fresh air.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VW3KPCGWGV7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954333#wasThisHelpful","R1VW3KPCGWGV7E","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's summer time, hot, and you want to lay out on a hammock, sip a lemonade and read a good book. This is a great one to do that.  Written  by the co-author of [book:The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society|2728527] it takes place in the small town of Macedonia, West Virginia, during the Great Depression.  Layla Beck is the spoiled daughter of an U.S. Senator who one rebels by refusing to marry the man selected for her to marry. Sen. Beck is so enraged that he cuts her off without a dime and signs her up in the WPA/Federal Writers' Project run conveniently by his brother. Layla is assigned to write a history of Macedonia to honor its sesquicentennial (150 years).  We hear much of Layla's stories in letter she writes to family and friends. Grumbling all the way, she moves into the home of Jottie Romeyn and what a house it is. Living with Jottie is her brother, Felix (a travelling salesman), and his 2 daughters, 12 year old Willa and 6 year old Bird. Jottie raises the girls as Felix is gone quite a bit. Also residing in the house are Jottie's twin sisters Minerva and Mae. They go live with their husbands on the week-ends but can't be separated any longer than that. It's a brand new world for Layla.  The Romeyn's father used to run the mill, and main employer, in town. There was a fire and a close friend of Jottie and Felix's was killed supposedly while robbing the mill. As Layla writes the town history she starts to uncover the mystery of the fire and also very funny anecdotes about the town. The story of a Confederate General hiding in a house of ill repute is a hoot.  Ultimately the story is a coming of age novel for Willa Romeyn and the power of forgiveness. It's a wonderful book that will keep you turning pages. It's a great story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V8TXNRA538C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385342942#wasThisHelpful","R3V8TXNRA538C0","AUCXT9K30SHYF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUCXT9K30SHYF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this Nerf slingshot. It is different from a gun. The grandson had to take a minute and reload it which was nice. He got it about 15-20 ft. After that he wasn't terribly accurate.

"I found this book so absolutely riveting that I spent two nights up late reading it. At first I thought it was just a mesmerizing story about the Plague in 1348 but it was so much more. Nine strangers come together, all with secrets, and as they travel to avoid the Black Death, their stories slowly are told.

"Our two mutts really enjoy this Eukanuba dog food.  We use it for their main meal and so far they take to it like a bee does to pollen.  The best part about the food is there have been no digestion problems.  There is nothing like the good smell of hard removals in the morning.The Eukanuba combination of ingredients makes for a well balanced product that they fully enjoy.  I added that mainly because these two critters are nothing but picky when it comes to what they eat.  I fully expect to see a plate full of this food because they decided time was up and it is time for another food.

"I am delighted with Head & Shoulders Refresh (HSR),  It does more than clean my hair and scalp by removing the buildups that take place from ordinary shampoos.It took a few shampoos to find that 'just right' amount of product to do the job I sought.  I started with a half-dollar dollop and worked my way down to a nickel plop.  I tried a dime size; however, it was too small for my big head.  The nickel won and that's fine.  HSR is a thick, creamy white shampoo that leaves a pleasing but unnoticable odor on the head.  I'm not much on shopping in the grocery store, say, and asking folks if they like my shampoo's odor.  Thank goodness most others are not either.  Even though I believe I found that so called perfect dosage, it still leaves comb marks when it dries.  I usually wash my hair twice while rinsing in between each wash.  At the end, old lazy here, I simply comb my hair to the way I expect it to look when it is dry without comb marks.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have used a dryer on that mop and only in an emergency.The bottle design creates a problem for me from the standpoint of not providing a suitable holding pattern.  It needs to be more hand and holding friendly so that it does not slip out of the hand easily.  A cap on the top that requires as much pressure as this one it unsatisfactory.  Normally, shampooing is first and the rest follows.  My hands are wet and slippery when I go to open the bottle and the snap lock cap is unsatisfactory.  I leave it down but not closed and all is well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIZT8OVV2CUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMCZ834#wasThisHelpful","RWIZT8OVV2CUW","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For my humble needs this is an almost perfect box to hold specific folders.  Right now, I have loaded several with Judy's medical data from billing to EOBs and on and on.  Two boxes of medical 'stuff' are too many; however, from my heart valve replacement papers, this was a paper thin collection of 'stuff.'The Boxa will hold several folders depending on the number of pages in each folder.  I do not know if it is me or just the way the box was engineered, but in order to keep it from falling apart from repeated usage, I had to tape its bottom shut.  (I can think of several bloviating folks who would benefit from such a remedy.)  Its corrugated walls a thick enough to work quite well and not so thick to make the weight unbearable.  Thank goodness for colored folders and binders.  I would hate to think of attempting to store about 2 reams of paper without the binders.  The Boxa's picture shows what is handwritten labels and that space is welcome for repeated use and with a small circle or square they can be covered for the next project.  I have been an old time friend of what I call 'shucks' or some other word used in many law offices for holding those mysterious legal papers.  Shucks are fine for their purpose; however, they are flexible where Boxa is not.  Often the Shucks would fall to the floor and an awful mess insued.I just completed our 2014 tax organizing routine and this year I am so thankful for having a specific place for the multiple papers brought about mostly by ACA.

"The mirror's picture was misleading to me and I am delighted that it was.  That 7"" is a well portioned looking glass from either the normal side or the 1-X magnified side.  To say that I am delighted is an understatement and I have assigned a new 'waiting space' close to my center of 'beauty' organization and application.  There has been only one problem with the mirror.  Every time I went to use it, it was gone.  Sure enough, John had it and he reluctantly returned it.  Mirrorvana makes a classical product with high quality values coupled with a competitive price point.  No burrs or rough places that could leave scratches or cuts.  All well made and well balanced with sufficient base weight to hold it upright.Not only is the mirror top quality, the folks (Joy and Karma) selling it are the same way.  They followed up at every turn to be sure that I had what I needed and was at the helm to assist should either one of us need it.  They displayed service in a manner that many of us miss from olden times and wish we had today.  I believe had we had a problem with the mirror, a simple email or even a call and we would have had a replacement in a modest time.

"Clorox in fact rocks.  This new Bleach Pack rocks too with one exception:  it is so much easier to use than pouring bleach from a gallon bottle.  I set up a schedule to test the packs and began with toilet bowls.  At bedtime I dropped one pack in each toilet and did not flush until morning.  The protective covering dissolved and the smell of Clorox left a hint in the air.  The tanks were fairly clean with a stain here and there.  After flushing the next day, the stains were gone.I cherish the cleanliness of t-shirts, handkerchiefs and white undies.  The packs did not let me down and provided me with the same quality of clean undies as the regular Clorox bleach does except now, I do not have to take care not to make my usual mess.

With that I do not expect my hair to stay put or think it is a free style drone.  Luseta helps with that.  The shampoo does a great job at cleaning my hair and scalp while the conditioner aids with the control.The main problem with Luseta is trying to find the location where Judy hid the products.  She likes it so much, she hides them so when it is shampoo time she will be able to use them.  We will probably have a his and hers section for shampoos and other commonly used products.

They come out of the creek and cross the road onto the banked front yard and go up the side year up the hill to the deep woods where they and the other critters frolick.  Those little hooves leave marks in the grass and soon the holes dry up and beg for care.  I could not wait to use this shaker jug to see if the contents could possibly improve the ground and its path.The process could not be easier even for me.  The jug is not heavy nor awkward.  The product comes out at a satisfactory rate and does simply leaves a neat path (in my case) to ask the deer to consider using another route.  Maybe it was the odor or the size of the pellets, but our deer family did find another route but this time it was around my neighbor's property.  Each of us enjoys sticking our heads out the back door while watching the family take a feeding break or whatever and just relax on the yard above the grassed area.I said in the beginning that the real key to this product is not only does it change the composition of the dirt and other ingredients of the yard, it make it so growth can take place with better ease.  That does not take place over night and now with winter on the way, the ground will harden and make vegetation more difficult.

Something was not right with what I had done and I put the AMP to it to tell me that I am about as stupid as they come.  Black to black and red to red.  Not the reverse.  Pay attention  the next time.  While I was there making a fool out of myself (alone, thank goodness) I checked the other connections on the circuit and found out that I needed to put in a new circuit.This is a terrific tool and while it is not used as much as a screwdriver or a drill, it is a tool that occupies a special place in my garage so that I can have ready access to it when needed.

"Out of no where I was, seemingly, attacked by some invading critter or a wild imagination.  My feet soles were cracking and bleeding even though I knew of no reason for the actions.  I went to my stock of bandages and began covering the several wounds on each foot.  Some of the bandages fell off immediately and others stayed on overnight.  Not the Kendalls.  Thanks to atrial fibrillation and its blood thinning drugs, I bleed at the drop of a straight pin.  Kendall's covers the wound and keeps it closed for quite some time.

"Hershey's found a place on my taste buds many decades ago and it remains today.  A 3 pound box of these individually wrapped goodies is next to sinful or just plain good.  Best of all the 4 variety works well for the two of us.  Two for Judy and the other two for me.  Even though Halloween is only a few days away, there is little likelihood that there will be any left.  Today's trick or treaters prefer rich neighborhoods and we keep the bears in the front yard.Seriously, this box of goodies is a good, convenient way to hold small servings of a delicious candy especially on the go type quickies.  I had to run to the drug store earlier; however, I picked up two of these at random, ate one, got my drugs and ate the other on the way home.  It is a small box and does not take up too much counter space or refrigerator space.  I could see Hershey's selling single product items in boxes of this size.

"John beat me to the review of our watches; however, while my star rating is the same, it is that way for different reasons.  This is a watch that I can see without help and adding a magnifier to the small date wheel makes it close to perfect.  This other than looking great on my wrist, is no more than a watch that tells time in minutes, seconds and hours plus the date wheel.  That's it.  This Invicta is water resistant up to 200 meters.  The probability of my seeing that depth is close to zero.  Not even 20 meters, either.I could not find the model number on the outside of the watch and did not open it to look for it either.  As I write this the model number is irrelevant; however, at some later point I might need it.  Far more important that a model number is the fact that this watch keeps accurate time to the second.  We use about 5 different and now 7 time pieces that keep time in seconds and we set our clocks by one of them.  (Can you imagine having to set clocks in seconds accurately when the power fails?)  Just a few seconds ago, I checked the Invicta against one of the clocks with seconds and it has not lost nor gained a second since setting it several days ago.  The watch is so quiet I can barely tell it is ticking or tocking.  When I put my stethoscope to it I could not hear it at all and concluded the stethoscope is of little value.  I could hear John's regurgitation from his heart valve,I have enjoyed wearing the watch and using it for its intended purpose; however, the only drawback I can see is its bulky weight.  I seldom have had to concern myself with hitting walls or other vertical surfaces.  With the 21396, it is easy to hit a car door or an elevator's door when I am thinking about getting somewhere.  I almost need another watch of the same weight for ballast purposes but I joke.  Overall, I like the watch in spite of its weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARYRDJLZ6XP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011N5PJMY#wasThisHelpful","R3ARYRDJLZ6XP2","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first Invicta watch and I am quite pleased with it.  As far as its watch functions, it is exceedingly accurate but not perfect.  In the past week it about 2 seconds slow compared to the national clock's time.  Minutes, hours and days are perfect.  I especially like the sweep second hand and the fact that it is visible to most folks.  The hands are large enough to be seen.  For all practical aspects, this the end of this product's timekeeping attributes.I downgraded this Invicta for several reasons.  It is big and heavy relatively speaking.  I am used to lightweight unobtrusive time keeping devices and ones that do not have a plethora of features.  I have one full feature do-it-all watch that almost does everything except take the garbage out and it is not gaudy or heavy.  This dial appears to have multiple time keeping features; however, it is stationary and just sits there in full view (a nice feature for those of us who need sight assistance.)  It's weight is merely a distraction more than any other factor and not too significant.  The strap is sufficiently large enough to fit most wrists and nothing special.For me, it is nice to have a watch that does not have all those available bells and whistles found on many more expensive watches.  When I look at the watch, I get what I see without having to wonder what the time is in another time zone or wonder what the elevation is in the location I am standing on.  Simply, it's a watch and a pretty good watch at that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4VH9AAPVKYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XNS6#wasThisHelpful","RR4VH9AAPVKYN","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I (Judy here) really like this razor for the simple fact that it does what I expect it to do.  It removes all those unwanted stragglers with ease.  Best of all there is no pulling or leaving body parts with blotchy red spots where used.  I normally use this in the shower so I do not have to soap up all over again.  Instead, I use a little hair conditioner to add to the smoothness of the Panasonic.  At no time did the battery run out or even low.The main feature aside from cutting smoothly and properly is that it fits my hand so well I do not have to be concerned about dropping it and therefore reducing or eliminating the probability of damaging it.  Typical of Panasonic's 'add a little extra' is the inclusion of a nice white carrying bag.  I can reach in our utility bag and see the Panasonic white bag and know 'there it is.'  I will sometimes use it while watching a TV program and the sounds are so low, it does not disturb any one else in the room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3O3IIWX62J6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PLHA#wasThisHelpful","R1T3O3IIWX62J6","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To a degree I have been hampered in my intent to write a complete review.  I want to start with my failure to own a device that permits me to download from Google Play an Android app for the NuYu.  Of the 8 computers, tablets, notebooks and cellphones, not one of them will permit pairing the NuYu.  Not even the two smart TVs will permit the pairing.  Nor could I get the Fire HDX to pair with it.  It appears the only device I could use to use this watch is a smartphone and right now my budget does not have space for a $50 per month marginal increase.In spite of my inability to update and sync this device in the manner described by the instructions and the Google's website where the app resides but unavailable to me, probably due to my really low threshold in apps for devices.  The clock works but, I do not know how to set it to today's time.  The dial is small; however, the numbers show quite clearly.  I have not attempted to use it in the sunlight.  We have not had any recently and I am tired of all the rain and warnings.  Several other features appear to work such as distance, calories burned steps and exercise timer.  Each changes when I do something, but without a means to use the features, it is mostly just for personal satisfaction.Until I receive a large inheritance or some new capability for pairing the device, it will sit on my arm looking good.

"EDIT on September 20, 2015:This is a meager edit to this terrific product.  I noticed when scanning other reviews of this item that one poster mentioned how the interior space was reduced by the addition of the blue cover and, therefore did not leave room for a charger.  That is true.  I found an alternative solution to this condition.  I try to carry at least two fully charged cigar shaped chargers at all times so I'll be ready.  I use a sunglass case of similar construction as the Case Logic and it works well and if not in the way while hanging off the side of the case.I knew little about Case Logic until last year and fully enjoy the quality of workmanship and versatility of the case.  I emptied another camera case and began using the DSH-101 instead.  My camera fits perfectly with a small amount of play on the sides.  With the lens pointing down, the extra padding on the bottom adds more protection.It sports extras many other cases do not have.  I had already located a cloth to clean the lens and one was included in the package.  The water resistant case cover is a nice touch especially if I ever need protection.  I never think about it, but a little protection from the rain or snow is a good thing.  The strap is double for the most part; however, it does not have a shoulder pad to ease pains that work their way in when least expected.Unlike other cases, this one has a zipper that has not got caught on fabric when attempting to open or close.  That is absolutely an unimportant issue; however, when that just perfect shot is on its way, I do not want to be delayed because of a stuck zipper.  Last winter a deer died in our creek and in a few days the buzzards began to gather for a meal or two.  I went for my camera and the zipper got jammed.  I missed most of them arriving; however, by the time I opened the case, there were about 30 buzzards roosting in a single tree, waiting for a taste.  No clogged zippers yet with Case Logic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R40JY8QHGO6S4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYS07K#wasThisHelpful","R40JY8QHGO6S4","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hardly a day goes by without using this little 5"" bright light with a zoom in and out feature.  It claims to be 900 Lumens; however, I do not have a method to measure it.  It is not as bright as some of the other small hand lights we have; however, most of them use C-123 batteries and not 3-AAAs.  It works quite well in a short distance situation; however, for long distances, I have to revert to more powerful lights.  Sadly, they cost 3 or more times more than this one and they take at least 4 C-123 batteries.

"In the middle of the last century, toilet paper consisted of one sheet of paper that might or might not be perforated, but we could count on its tearing apart while using it.  Forget absorbency or any other frills.  Along came some wonderful companies who no more liked those flat sheets of near nothing and provided us with real toilet paper that goes beyond just cleaning our personal habits,The market is full of several real toilet paper companies and my favorite is Charmin.  I normally choose the soft variety; however, I am using UItra Strong now and now I have a problem:  which one or just alternate between the two?  These double, durable sheets work better than any other TP  I have used, even the Soft Charmin but not by much.  While there are no standards in this industry, the sheets and size of the rolls will vary with the wind.  Every time I measured the size of a sheet or the content of a roll, I would come back with different sizes depending on the product or when I bought it.  I sure hope the size is not reduced much more.  Mage Roll is not definitive either, but it is a point for comparison.One big deal matter for us is suitability for use with a septic system.  We cleaned our septic tank out a few months ago and all was well including no backups caused by anything and especially Charmin TP.Overall, this is a 5-star product and will rank #1 or #2 on our house depending on the user and circumstances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0CLOTC4DBKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMVI5DC#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0CLOTC4DBKT","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have 7 different types of these 'floor cushions' and can solidly say that this one is the best of the lot.  The previous 6 pads have a several year jump start on this brand and that affords a direct comparison ..The one thing I learned is that one person's softness is not necessarily the same softness as mine.  Each mat (pad, cushion, etc) has its own attributes.  Imprint Cumulus9 is the best in terms of all around suitability.  Even though that is a completely subjective statement, it matches my needs best.  Some pads are too soft or too hard and this one is, you got it, in between and just right.  This pad's Viscosity is most suitable for me and it receives a lot of footsteps during the course of a day.  It occupies that space in between the garage and mudroom/pantry.For most persons the height of this mat is just right for me.

"This is what I will call a binary product.  It either works, i.e. kills ants, or it does not.  A few years ago, I had a visit from a fire ant family and they enjoyed their stay so much, they took out a lease on the far end of our back yard and began raising a family and who knows what else. We did not pay much attention to them since they were about 40 yards away from habitation.  We watched the deer get ancy when the ants apparently attacked.  The skink and other unwanted critters chose to live elsewhere.  This spring they found their way down the hill and into the viewable area of the yard.That invasion and Ortho's MAX Fire Ant Killer prompted a generous broadcasting.  I applied one application and in a month applied another.  Today, I have about half a bag for future use or application to a friend's yard.  Ortho is a killer and for me 'ant lives do not matter.'  The bag is sturdy and seals well with an air tight seal that keeps smells out of the air.  As those old guys on The A Team said, I really like it when a plan comes together.

"I chose a 5 star rating simply because this Samsung 50"" 4K Ultra TV has the best picture I have ever seen.  While I fully understand that no output is better than its source, this TV has taken my cable output and makes it appear life-like.  On my older Samsung, I can see pixels when close to the screen; however, with this 4K I have to get unnaturally close while attempting to identify the many pixels.  I had hoped to have FIOS installed by now; however, my provider thwarted attempts to get a better source or not.  It's just as well.  The final location for this fantastic set is in our secluded quiet zone with only one cable source and multiple other connections that work quite well with 4K.Out of the box setup is simple.  Screw the stand on and set it on the table where it will reside until it is time to move it.  Even though the TV weighs about 30 pounds, I would suggest having an assistant who can manage handling a similar weight.  Allocate about one to two hours to set the TV fully and then sit back and enjoy.The two 10 watt speakers only handle minimum sounds and with most of today's TVs the sound system is less than satisfactory.  That is the reason for my less than 5 stars.  I would consider adding a simple 5.1 surround system or no less than a soundbar with subwoofer.Unlike every other HD TV in the home, this TV was calibrated for me right out of the box.  I am sorry that Samsung did not include a printed calibration sheet for nurd-heads like me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158AOKOA28WS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZIGRX4W#wasThisHelpful","R158AOKOA28WS2","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Assigning a star value to this griddle was tough for me.  Based on my use so far, the George Foreman 240X has all the makings for a 5-star unit; however, it does not present the quality workmanship of George's original grill. On the other hand, however, the original is just a simple grill and has no where the superlative features as does this griddler.  I reexamined my feelings about this tool and it really is a 5 star unit.We eat breakfast foods a lot and time is not a delimiter.  Bacon or sausage for dinner is just right especially after recent events with our health care providers.  Bacon and or sausage on the side ramps with almost any other goody in the center.  One of my favorites is chile con queso with sausage pieces.  When using the center surface we can cook-up batches of hot and another of medium or mix them together.  The point of these examples is that 240Z is very versatile with fewer cooking pots and pans to manage or clean.Cleaning is a breeze too.  When I begin with a non-stick surface it is hard to make mistakes even though not necessarily for me.  The drain holes are located up front and not in the back as with original GF.  When there are lots of greasy meats draining fat, it is nice to be able to remove the grease trap with few hassles.The unit is lightweight and even though it is larger than I expected, it is handy and easy to move along with use for its purposes.

"The days of not having a helper are almost gone.  This shoe horn by Vive is just that perfect tool and has claimed its own place readily available to each user.  When it is time to go out, to the mailbox or to the store, I go to the Vive Horn and use it instead of hopping around the garage trying to get one shoe on and then the other.  Too bad we did not capture that on the SD Card.  It is made of first class plastic that is smooth as 10-30W oil and is the perfect size for this old 75"" frame.  The oval holder at the top fits 3 of my fingers and bends just enough to make slipping on a shoe easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FSHCVWBDNX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ7JI7U#wasThisHelpful","R20FSHCVWBDNX5","A3963R7EPE3A7E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3963R7EPE3A7E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this is 'almost' Greek to me.  My step-father was Greek and he was in the restaurant business.  That included making all those wonderful Greek dishes many of us adore.  This product is close and just misses the tastes I grew up with; however, it tastes fantastic.  I add a little more lemon juice to give it that 'my' taste, but nothing else except saltines and Ouzo.  Luckily, there are producers of the soup and unluckily, they are few and far between.  It literally took years before I ran across a clam chowder soup that mirrored the real thing and it was just a few hundred miles away in Maryland.  Our local grocery stores do not carry slow selling products.  The store manager said soup that is over $3 - $4 a can is too expensive.

"2nd album from U.K. band delivers short, terse, angular post-punk minimalism that flashes vehement socio/political messages through addictively jagged dance rhythms on staccato guitar lines, punchy bass and conversational vocal interplay. Reminiscent of bands like The Raincoats, Au Pairs, ESG, Young Marble Giants, Gang of Four, Savages, Ludus, Delta 5, Prinzhorn Dance School.  Includes members from Covergirl, Trash Kit, Wetdog, Golden Grrrls.

"The 3rd album from this Nashville, Tennessee band is a keeper.  Dying Surfer Meets His Maker starts with some lope-along, bluesy guitar rock that has a slow-building thread of intensityand quickly escalates to the land of dark, blistering psychedelic metal.  Drums pound and struggle to explode with primal strength, while the guitars reach out to those strange, zoned-out dark holes of the universerealities only the bong-bowl rockers can find.  Acoustic guitars and electric acid-licks reside here in perfect harmony.  This is thoughtfully twisted rock n  roll with a semi-raw honesty that explores and prods the echo-whispers of classic rockers, blues masters and drug-land pioneersmixing it all into a chunky, soulful stew with a uniquely creative and primeval core of ROCK.

"Debut release from Matt Berninger (The National) and Brent Knopf (Menomena, Ramona Falls)El Vy play memorable thumpy-bump indie pop songs with a quirky rhythmic flow of eccentricity thats balanced by Berningers incredibly affective and embraceable baritone.  Its a surprisingly congruous fit that pits the lightness of the music against the warmth and weight of an inviting vocal despair.  Honestly, if the National rocks your boat, youll want to sail on this one, too.  Knopfs musical contributions give the songs a slightly different twist, adding a strain of subtly playful overtones, but its still Berningers Leonard Cohen-esque voice that guides the ship and dips into the dark waters.  Overall, Return to the Moon is a huggable sliver-shiver of an album that will touch your heart with the authenticity of its beauty and subtly strange melodic turmoil.

The production is thick and purposely muddled, with a dreamy tin-can ethos pushing all the sounds to the center in an echoic blend of mid-fi  Americana rock drone.  Sometimes recalls bands like Coke Weed, The Warlocks, The Holydrug Couple, Ty Segall, Psychic Ills.

Fernando Almeidas sensually resonating vocals deliver the peculiar lyrics (sung in Portuguese with an English translation insert) through an ethnically tinged haze of mind-altering melodies and musical twists.

"On their 9th album (and the first in ten years) these legendary U.K. synth-pop veterans of the dark-edged dance floor return with a worthy revitalization of their classic sound.  Sumners voice is as riveting as it ever was, the bass lines thump & drive with authority, and the synthesizers dominated the glitter-ball world of black leather boogie.  Core members have recorded with Electronic, Bad Lieutenant, Joy Division, Marion.  Includes guest appearances from Iggy Pop plus members of The Killers and La Roux.  Although it feels somewhat dated and registers as a bit of a guilty pleasure, there is an undeniably hypnotic allure to the repetitive electronic rhythms hereand the two or three songs that rock it up a bit lend a much needed edge to the album.

"Baltimore band returns with their 6th album (and the 2nd one this year) featuring more dreamy shimmer ballads that radiate a mysterious beauty and a shadowy eloquence.  On Thank Your Lucky Stars the guitar is a bit more prominent, the tone is just slightly darker, the mood demands a deeper listener immersion, and Victoria LeGrands voice is haunted by an open-eyed maturity that rings less of innocence and more of celestial sensuality.  Though the songs are laced with a mystical secrecy and a spooky sort of charm, its still very much a Beach House albumwhich is a good thing.  Like their previous albums, the songs arent really memorable beyond the moment, but thats not important; tone and mood are the keys here.

"The 3rd album from the Swedish band absolutely nails the concept of psychedelic rock in a dirty-earth, organic way.  It is brilliantly, cohesively experimental; a fresh, original, incredibly creative rock album filled with desert ethnic shadow songs that buzz like a peyote vision and some serious flirtations with Middle Eastern meditative noise/metal.  Twisted and trippy electric acid-blues guitar licks explode from a mantra/drone raga-rock expansion of dynamic sound & the evolution of consciousness.  Shades of Goat, Bardo Pond, Telescopes, Spacemen 3, Dungen, Bong, Hawkwind, Voice of the Seven Thunders, Jimi Hendrix, Prson Sound.

"Buffalo, New Yorks iconic weirdos return with their 9th album, projecting an ultimate dreamy transcendence.  Listening to Jonathans soothing interplanetary voice  and floating around in Grasshoppers instrumental world is like the mellowest, most beautiful pure acid trip youve (n)ever taken.  Theres a lush orchestral feel to much of the album, spinning a colorful kaleidoscope of luminous sound.  The air is full of strings, bells, chimes, guitars, keyboards, horns, sitars, mandolins, moon glow and a magical sparkle.  Pop, jazz, choral, classical, prog, psychedelic, experimental and elegant rock all  take their turn pushing the current of the flow.  The sometimes melancholy lyrics reference bands from The Pretty Things to Dead Can Dance, from Popol Vuh to Elliott Smith, from Terry Riley to Talk Talkand remind us about the days when vinyl was king by default.  Celestial nymphs thread opulent strains of audio magnificence through the marshmallow clouds.  Reality takes a back seat, and your body is disconnected, gliding along on sumptuous soundwaves in an open-ended, luxuriant atmosphere.  Contributions come from members of The Posies, The Disciplines, Midlake and The Fugs.  The Light In You is a complex and beautiful album, with a rich sense of musicality and a touch of magic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Q0A4TVHKJK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTAPYXU#wasThisHelpful","R22Q0A4TVHKJK4","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3rd album from Boise, Idahos Trevor Powers; his yearning, haunted high-register vocals guide songs that ebb & flow through a psychedelic wonderland of emerging pop sounds.  Synthesizers, horns, strings, piano & variophon flesh out the guitar/drums/bass core.  Many of the songs move sinuously through a fragile electronic web of sound.  The music often feels complex and orchestrated, with Powers voice straining to push some organic wave of emotion through the swirl of clutter.  Reminiscent of Tame Impala, Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev or Neil Young singing for the softly weird side of Wand.  Savage Hills Ballroom is a strange album that requires time and effort to dig out the reward, but it is there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSKLJGNORK8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011HTUZIE#wasThisHelpful","R2NSKLJGNORK8J","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Debut album from Boston artist; Carpenter is a former member of Beat Circus & Ghost Train Orchestra and has played with The Swans, Colin Stetson & Marc Ribot.  Hes also a lyrically adept storyteller with a  hauntingly eerie baritone voiceone that calls to the listener with an emotional warmth & vulnerable, perceptive strength.  The music is generally low-key, with a complimentary sparseness that accents Carpenters vocals and can expand at a moments notice with the sound of reverb-soaked desert-twang guitars in a folk-tinged setting punctuated by the ebb & flow of female background vocals, strings and theremin.  Recalls artists like Leonard Cohen, Bill Callahan.  The Far End of the World is an album of subtle strength; the kind that will quietly crawl under your skin and finger-tickle all of the slow-festering, hidden secrets there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R246XUP01RQTT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UE9WRS#wasThisHelpful","R246XUP01RQTT5","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"6th release from this band out of Barcelona, Spain who play dark, rhythmically driving guitar-electro rock with a viciously jagged edge of punk-funk industrial tension and soaring, distorted riffs hanging in the air.  Still, theres a distinct emphasis on a tight & catchy, melodic center that effectively balances the noise and potential chaos.  Static, penetrating guitar notes and a solid thread of Gothic drone-rock mix into the compellingly hypnotic structure of the music.  Vocals in the native language (Cada Dia Es Asi translates to Every Day Is So) dont detract from the power at all.  Members have played in Linn Youki, Glissando, Anna & the Bananas, Mena.  Theres something very powerful and riveting about the nature of these five short songs that manifests itself in a potent immediacy.  I think youll be hearing more from them.

"Debut album from duo out of Sydney, Australiaoscillating waves of atmosphere-driven synthesizer pop/rock with throbbing bass lines and rich, complex, darkly fluid melody lines.  The songs vacillate between a dreamy pop flow and mysterious washes of epic electronic transmissions. The production, although clean, feels purposefully muddled at timesmixing the instruments into a soup of undecipherable ingredients.  There is an intriguingly dark, post-Goth industrial edge that penetrates the murky drug-club aura with surprisingly melodic splashes of hypnotic & ghostly dance-floor angst.  Former members of Parades and Ghostwood.  Overall, Janes Lament offers an appealingly strange mix of beauty in  a mesmerizing rhythmic flow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25O1IGR4EA436/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2SYMYC#wasThisHelpful","R25O1IGR4EA436","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2nd album from Louisville, Kentucky band who play darkly sinuous, epic & creepy atmospheric rock with a desert drone-twang guitar edge of bluesy turmoil.  Thick chords hover and reverberate with the subtle roar of demonic authority, while desperately echoing vocals demand attention, and a motorik blues rhythm marches into post-rock oblivion.  Strains of psychedelic resignation fight for their place in the blood-splattered arena dust, driven by never-say-die drums and surrounded by the gritty, soul-deep twang & flow of sustained guitar notes searching the answer.  Some similarities to Gallon Drunk, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds/Birthday Party, Crime & the City Solution, The Amazing Snakeheads, Blue Ruin.

Big Uns is a choppy axe-chord, metallic groove rocker with a  big guitar churn, some blistering & twisted lead riffs, creepy vocals and an overall classic rock feel thats mutated by some odd timing, manipulated voice & sounds, and some alien kazoo-like guitar notes.

"2nd full-length album from duo out of Santiago, Chile who play deeply restorative, beautiful and warm psychedelic indie pop with sweeping, yearning melody lines that roll along in a mellifluous dream-state on big, friendly keyboards and fluid bass guitar thumps that sometimes double as lead notes.  Guitars lend a softly supportive rhythmic base, while exotic synthesizers wash over hypnotic songs that radiate a comfortable and druggy lounge-pop bliss.

A deceptively simple sounding dramatic flair of stinging blues notes pierces its backing atmospheric drone.  And, finally, a snail-slow metal monster screams through the universe.

"Slim Twig is an anomaly.  His 4th album of manipulated musical collages is part of an alien world where the rules of production and musicality are twisted & molded to be consumed by open-eared listeners with alternative brain patterns.

The press has compared him to Ariel Pink, Ty Segall, Royal Trux & Tame Impala.  Add a bit of Gary War and Peter Ivers and youre in the general area.  Its not an easy listen, but its not supposed to be.  As in life, there is a good amount of confusion and unexplainable occurrences.

True to the title, these are ambient soundscape instrumentals that move from a fascination with minimalist dirge-dream mantras to exploratory psychedelic atmospherics.

"On his 3rd album, Australias Kevin Parker has removed the rock element, opting for a lush soundscape of bubbling, kaleidoscopic pop shimmer.  Its a brave and dangerous move that mostly works.  The albums title, Currents, is a perfect fit for the sound, which has the sort of unpredictable, wavy ebb & flow thats only found below the surface, deep down where few people venture.  In this dark, liquid environment, club tentacles writhe & dance to a beat of mysteriously skewed origin.  The warm, orchestral, multifarious production technique results in the kind of eyes-glazed relaxed absorption brought on by lying underneath a soft waterfall on ecstasy, while neon birds paint the sky with color-trail clouds.  Currents is a radiantly chilled-out psychedelic eruption, colored by subtle tweaks of gently twisted beauty.

"2nd full-length release from this musician collective with members in the U.S. & England who have also recorded three albums under the band name End Of A Yearplus tons of singles, cassettes, etc. under both names.  Self Defense Family play intelligent, atonal twang guitar punk with vehement socio-political lyrics delivered in a passionate talk/sing vocal frame.  The singer implores with a vein-bulging intensity while guitars spin an accessibly tension-mounting ambience.  Songs sometimes carry a subtle promise of impending pain that dwells as much on atmosphere as it does on anger.  Unexpected and angular psychedelic riffs crawl around behind the voice, painting a droney punk rock soundscape.  Beauty makes a surprise appearance on a dry, gray, cracked aural canvas.  Some similarity to Coliseum, Black Level Embassy, Poison Girlswith a touch of Television and The Fall.  This is music that requires & rewards a closer listen than you might first expect.

"3rd album from French bandclassy & heavy power metal trio with a muscle-flexing psychedelic twist.  Massive bottom-end drums and behemoth bass guitar runs drive the engine.  The lead work is often subtle and always brilliant.  Atmospheric interludes and fluid rhythmic changes abound.  Trippy sounds are carefully pummeled into the earth hard enough to shake the planet core.  This is metal thats more fierce than brutal; rock music that draws on passion and creativity, molding it into the crunch-worthy strength of a giant warriors fist.

Shades of Milk, Dead Moon, Bleach, or X (the Los Angeles one) meets Dylan with punk intentions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV6EHFHA1RQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113YTYYE#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV6EHFHA1RQO","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"5th album (first in nine years and the first one since 1998 with the original line-up) from this Chicago area band is packed with potent, classic female vocal led indie rock.  For me, Veruca Salt always fell in the same category as Smashing Pumpkins:  Everybody I know loved them and I thought they were just pretty good.  Well, either my taste has changed or theyre better than I remember.  Ghost Notes is built with addictively expressive voices, strong melody lines, and solid, ripping rock guitars spitting out some viciously hummable power pop tunes.  The songs sparkle and roar with confidence and the kind of fun-but-muscular melodic density that is so often lacking in indie rock today.  There are no weak tracks here!  Recalls bands like Throwing Muses, The Breeders, Sleater-Kinney, Hole, L7.  It may not be a world-changer, but there is a fresh & vital feel to Ghost Notes that gives it a power I want to experience again and again.  Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGE6LDPFW1LFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XM0FS20#wasThisHelpful","RGE6LDPFW1LFL","A1AL15PY5AVFNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AL15PY5AVFNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*I was provided a free sample of the product in exchange for an honest review. My opinions are my own and I have not been compensated in any way.*This shower head is easy enough to install. I won't put any instructions here, there are plenty of places to find them if you need directions on how to put this in. You can probably figure it out by looking at it.Here's what you need to know. You get what you pay for. This works and works well but it is not heavy duty at all. I haven't had it long enough to test longevity but everything about it is cheap plastic and you can tell right out of the box that that's what it is. Understand that there is a good possibility that it probably won't last a super long time. If you live in an area with a lot of minerals in the water (like I do), that will probably make it worse. It's good if you just need to get a new shower head right now for whatever reason. If you're looking for a durable, long-term shower head, I would recommend in investing in something heavier duty.*UPDATED 10/25/2015*The company contacted me and asked me to change my review to a five star review. Of course, I'm not going to do that, it is unethical. They asked for an honest review and I gave it but apparently what they really wanted was just to get five star reviews. This is NOT a five star item. It is a three star item and I feel like I'm being generous. This may explain why it has so many five star reviews.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8WHW2EPVCVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ODXQVU#wasThisHelpful","RS8WHW2EPVCVR","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Corel Paintshop Pro X8 is a graphic editing software package that gives you some powerful tools but at a fraction of the cost of Photoshop. As a caveat, Photoshop is also far more robust but much of that power is not needed for the average user. The important thing here is that the ""average user"" does not necessarily mean a beginner. If you are not familiar with how graphical editing programs work, you're going to have a learning curve regardless of what you use. For me, Corel is easier simply because I don't need everything that Photoshop offers. If I was doing advanced editing for a photography company or magazine, then yes, Photoshop would be for me.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the installation. I don't know about other users, but it was a pain. I'm not new to installing software. But when I went to set this up, it brought up an interface where I had to put in info to get a code only I didn't get a code. I had to jump through hoops.

To put it to the test, I had a friend of mine put it on because he has elbow issues and we trained in Krav Maga. The sleeve didn't roll up or shift which is good, considering we were training in ground based techniques which involve a lot of rolling and tumbling.The sleeve doesn't have any nasty odors or anything like that. No weird things fell out of it and there were no complaints of it being too tight or anything like that. The wearer reported that he really didn't feel much different in his elbow than normal but that could be because of the level of his old injury and it might be beyond the scope of this compression sleeve to offer relief. It's probably more effective for lesser pain and issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O5A3EYP10V4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI9Z3WE#wasThisHelpful","R2O5A3EYP10V4H","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received this item free of charge for an unbiased review.*Tempered Glass screen protectors offer far more protection for your phone screen than the traditional, cheaper plastic ones. They can take an impact and save your actual screen. It may break the protector but if that keeps your screen from getting broken, it's done a good job.The LaoHe Tempered Glass screen protector includes a wet wipe to remove excess dirt, and then a dry wipe. There were still streaks after the use of the dry wipe (it's not microfiber, it's the same material as the wet wipe only it's dry). I used my T-Shirt to dry it. Once the screen was cleaned, I lined the protector up and laid it down on the phone. It sticks nicely and looks great. I didn't need to use anything to squeeze out the bubbles. It covers just above the ear speaker to just below the home button but it doesn't cover 100% of the face (it does cover the part that you'll touch). It might be designed this way purposefully to be compatible with cases, I really don't know.Once it's on, the feel of the screen protector feels like you are touching a phone screen. Some cheap plastic ones change the feel of the phone but this one keeps the original feel of it. Overall, it's a good screen protector.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Y0N628D1I1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CDHOTA#wasThisHelpful","R29Y0N628D1I1P","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this magnifier to go with my EOTech XPS2-300 Whisper/Blackout red dot. The decision to go with the Vortex instead of an EOTech magnifier was based on previous reviews indicating that it's just as good for a fraction of the price. After testing the combination myself I concur with that assessment.To start, the Vortex magnifier is well built. It feels nice and solid. The hinges for flipping it to the side are well built. Mounting it was a snap. I didn't need any risers or anything like that. I just put it on and then put the EOTech on, sighted it in, and it works like a charm. Flipping the magnifier to the side is easy. I just reach up with my left hand, push the button with my thumb and roll the optic to the side with my fingers and then grab the forward pistol grip that I have mounted to the rifle. Same process to flip it back into place so it's easy to transition from close quarters to distance.This magnifier is definitely a gem and is one of those rare times where the cheaper item is just as good. I highly recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33UGCLJN1UQ7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQWTC14#wasThisHelpful","R33UGCLJN1UQ7V","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fobus paddle holster is a convenient, quick clip on holster. Simply take it and slide it onto your pants and you're ready to go. These are my impressions:1. The holster stays in place well. Drawing from it didn't dislodge it.2. It's easy to take off but does require two hands so if it's on right, it won't just slip off unless the material your clothes are made out of are very slick.3. The gun feels secure in the holster. I wouldn't recommend hanging upside down like a bat but you should be able to move around with no problem. If you have baggy or loose fitting gym shorts you may have a problem, simply due to the weight of the firearm.4. It does not have a locking mechanism or anything like that so if you were to wear this in an area that allows open carry, it would be easy for someone else to remove it. Always be aware of your surroundings.I got this holster mainly to attend training sessions and as a spare to lend so a range buddy who might not have one. I also use it as a ""get ready quick"" item. If something were to happen, I could slip this on and the Fobus mag pouch very quickly and be ready to confront whatever trouble pops up. Also, if I store a loaded Glock in a quick action safe, I store it in a holster so the trigger is sealed. This holster certainly has its uses. If you live in an open carry state and are going to go out in public (or if you do security and are appropriately licensed to do so), you should probably at minimum get a level 2 holster for that. Otherwise, it's a good holster to have handy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LPYM1I1DB8UE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001C5ZQTM#wasThisHelpful","R2LPYM1I1DB8UE","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this double mag paddle pouch to be able to quickly put it on and take it off when necessary. This includes trainings or if something happens and I need to get ready quickly. Here is my impression:1. I have a double mag pouch that attaches via belt loops. Though it is not easy to put on or take off quickly, it does keep the magazines close to my side so when I drop my shirt over it, it's concealed. The Fobus pouch doesn't do that. They stick out too far and imprint too much so I don't use it for concealed carry.2. It slips on nice and easily and stays on for me.3. I used 9mm and .40 caliber Glock magazines (Glock 17, 19, and 23) and it works great. The magazines stay seated as I move around and the holster doesn't get pulled up when I remove a magazine quickly for a combat reload.4. If I'm already wearing my regular pouch, this is great to quickly hand to someone else in a session at the range so we can work on drills (I always like to have spare gear).5. It is easy to take off but requires two hands as it does stay on securely.This is a good overall mag pouch. Though I don't use it for concealed carry, it's good in training sessions or to get ready quickly if trouble finds its way to where you are. It seems well made, nothing that strikes me as something that's going to break quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30818UAX1KH8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000C53LF#wasThisHelpful","R30818UAX1KH8E","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*This is a review of a free product*The VicTsing is an adjustable, programmable, 9 button gaming mouse. The device itself seems to be sturdy yet lightweight. I haven't pounded on it the way a lot of people do, mainly because I just don't do that. The buttons feel crisp and resilient. it slides around on the desk nicely. The cord is strong. It even has LEDs on the inside so it lights up (and you can customize how it does that).In the pictures you can see the software on how to customize it. First of all, when you plug it in, it works as a basic mouse so you don't have to install drivers in order to get it running. The software it comes with (mini CD) is easy to use. On the basic settings, you can set up the DPI settings and customize the buttons (and you can have two pre-programmed modes in case you want to set up macros or button combinations for different games). Under the advanced settings, you can adjust mouse speed, scrolling speed, double click speed, and set up macros for customized button responses.In actual use the mouse feels natural to grasp. The buttons are all in easy to reach places and it shouldn't be difficult to get used to their locations.

"Nerf does it again, this time with a bow and arrow set. I've gotten several of the Nerf blasters, so this is an interesting change. I decided to get this because the cheaper, non-Nerf bow and arrow were destroyed quite quickly. I decided to give this one a try.It has a cylindrical ""cartridge"", kind of like the revolver of bows and arrows. It holds six rounded tipped arrows (won't break windows or penetrate skin or anything like that but the tips are plastic, not foam so they might hurt if hit from up close). Someone can fire one arrow after the other, but after that, you'll have to reload (the set comes with six arrows total).Durability wise, this thing has been dropped on the concrete patio, tossed to the ground, thrown in a pile of toys, etc, and thus far nothing has broken. The ""string"" is thick and doesn't seem to be getting wrecked (only time will tell with this one). The only issue is that the arrows along the shaft are thin. Step on them, and they're through. Other than that, I haven't found any complaints at this point. It's overall a decent addition to the Nerf reputare.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BWB4PN4KOWYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVIFZ1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1BWB4PN4KOWYI","A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So when I was given the opportunity to evaluate these sparring gloves, I could not pass them up.First and foremost, these are boxing gloves. It means, either you're boxing or if you're sparring in a fighting style, you will be throwing basic strikes because the fancier stuff won't be possible. But sometimes that's just what you need.

"The Seaside Knitters' series definitely offers a good deal of small town atmosphere, shared friendships, and strong family life.  I've followed the series since the beginning, mainly because I enjoy these connections, but the mystery itself is usually somewhat less important.  I would recommend this installment to readers who have read at least some of the previous books in the series.  There are about 50 characters (fortunately there's a list at the beginning, but it's still a lot!), and there's an interesting mystery, but in my opinion, it takes second place.I was surprised that one young member of the family (Gabby) was inexplicably missing this time.  She was prominent in the last book, so what happened to her?  That seems to be a mystery on its own.  Once again, there is a knitting pattern supplied without a picture, making it difficult to use.  A website is given too, but I looked, and apparently it has been moved.

"The 5th in the Ashton Corners Book Club mysteries, this one is a strong addition to it.  I've followed the series since the beginning, mainly because I thought the first one (A Killer Read) showed a lot of promise.  This one for me ranks as highly as A Killer Read.  Its main strength comes from the individuality of the characters in the book club--men and women, old and young, with contrasting personalities.  The two cats, Edam and Brie, are more in evidence this time too, and I thought that was a nice plus.  Two small regrets are that there isn't really much sense of place in this series, other than the fact that we know it takes place in the South. Also, in this book, the ""outside"" characters are quite important, and I always think that makes it hard to keep readers' interest.  We care about the characters we know best, and I usually prefer to see them as central to the plot throughout.The lists of mysteries at the end that each character likes are quite fun, and there is also a preview of the author's new series, where she will be writing as Linda Wiken.  It is based on books too, but cookbooks this time, and a group of characters who arrange a meal based on a chosen cookbook.  No title was given for this new book, but I intend to watch for it.  The writing is consistently good in the present series, and I think the new one sounds promising too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZGCIEZDTTMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425278204#wasThisHelpful","R10ZGCIEZDTTMO","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new series that features six seniors who have decided to live together and share their strengths and good company has several strong features.  Who doesn't enjoy reading about characters each of whom has different abilities and a singular personality?  Sherry's niece, Nixy, visits the small community and adds her share of deduction and common sense, mixed with a bit of light romance.I found the pace a bit slow overall, owing mainly to a lot of dialogue (maybe this is inevitable when you have so many main characters), and not many suspects.  Also, the victim's death is described on the back cover, so we know it will take place, but it doesn't actually happen until the middle of the book.  To me, that slowed the pace considerably.Apart from these criticisms, the book and the series seem to show some promise, so I'll continue with it and see how it develops.  Readers who enjoy Southern hospitality and charm, around which many cozies are set nowadays, will find this one entertaining too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YLJJM4OCS4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425275728#wasThisHelpful","R13YLJJM4OCS4N","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the cozy ""quilting mystery"" series, and I think it's the best thus far.  It has an independent protagonist, Martha Rose, who is smart and capable; along with her quilting buddies, Lucy and Birdie, she manages to sort out clues in a plot that has some originality.  I enjoy the references to quilting in this series; they are more sophisticated than what one finds in some other quilting mysteries, and in this case, the involvement of a historically significant quilt was very interesting.  The cat Bumper and the dog Arthur are good additions too.What has held me back from enjoying this series completely is Martha's personality and especially her romantic relationship.  Both she and her boyfriend, Crusher, seem to rely on physical attraction and scarcely talk to each other about the commitments they would, or would not like to make.  I'm still on the borderline with this series, and I'm trying to convince myself that it isn't essential to like everything about the principal character.  I'll stick with the series, mainly because I found this one to be the strongest one yet in terms of plot development, deduction, and ongoing suspense.  Recommended then, especially to quilters, with small reservations on my part.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJPL0T0FQLQDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758292090#wasThisHelpful","RJPL0T0FQLQDR","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second installment in the Lighthouse Library Mystery series, and I think it is a good contribution that will keep me interested in the series.  The lighthouse as a backdrop for the library adds some originality, and the writing is good.  Charles, the library cat, is also a fine addition. He doesn't really take part in the action, but his intuition about the library patrons is quite interesting, and he's clearly intelligent and popular.  Lucy, the protagonist, is smart and capable, and the mystery unfolds well.  There aren't really any deductive clues to be had, but the possible suspects are identified.  I agree with another reader that the ghost tales don't really add anything; some readers may enjoy a bit of diversion there, but I would be happy if they disappeared.  We could afford to have more capers with Charlie the cat instead, but then that's only my view.  It's a good series with some originality, and I look forward to the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BD46FXWM2PF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045147094X#wasThisHelpful","R3BD46FXWM2PF8","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The fourth installment in this ""book collector"" series has the outward elements of a cozy, but it also has a great deal of originality in the makeup of the characters, the way the plot is carefully designed, and a slight quirkiness to the characters.  I am a devoted followed of the series now, but I admit that I wasn't always fully on board with the quirky side of Jordan, the main character, and her ""outlaw"" family, nor did I understand her employer, the elderly and very crotchety Vera Van Alst. I did like The Sayers Swindle (book #2) very much, and this one is also outstanding.  The series overall a very strong one, as long as readers don't expect every character to be entirely believable and rational all the time.  We learn more about the characters in each new book, and although it isn't essential to read them all, it will add to one's pleasure, for sure. In this book, I especially enjoyed the part that Jordan's friend Lance, the librarian, played in the investigation.  This series is a real winner, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an unpredictable plot and many surprises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28X1NW1NPBGUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425280349#wasThisHelpful","R28X1NW1NPBGUD","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm following this series, although this is only the third one I've read.  I think I may have missed one or more, but it really doesn't matter.  They can easily be read alone, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them on that basis.I do like this series, probably most for its interesting setting--a side-by-side caf and a weaver's shop.  Della, the protagonist, and her friend Jenny run the two shops, and there is also Matthew, Della's boyfriend, who is an ex-FBI man.  Della seems to me to be a bit insecure, or perhaps just immature, and she hasn't demonstrated any deductive skills as yet.  These traits made this mystery move a little too slowly in the second half of the book, and the person responsible for the crime was too easy for readers to identify.  However, I'll stick with the series for now; the reading about weaving is quite interesting--Navaho designs in this installment--and the writing is engaging enough to keep me coming back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNB8BKO7UOGAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474880#wasThisHelpful","RNB8BKO7UOGAS","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought the location (Vermont) and the Scottish charm of this series sounded promising.  The book isn't advertised as a ghost story, and it wasn't until I read the brief summary on the back cover that I saw a ""spectre"" mentioned.  It didn't sound as if the paranormal was going to take over the story, so I decided to give it a try.  The beginning, which took place in Scotland, was quite fascinating.  Then, back in Vermont, it became a ghost story, and the ghost became the main character--or at least the dominant one.  For me, that was a turn-off.Nevertheless, I did finish the book.  The author writes well, and the plot unfolded well too.  It was a little disjointed at times, I thought, and so much of the book revolved around the disparity between the ghost's 13th-century understanding and modern life that it got tiring.  The end was surprising in some ways, and I would say that if you love ghost stories, you might enjoy this one.  I might try one more book in the series, just to give it a chance, but so far it seems like the wrong choice for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NK5TE7X50W9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270319#wasThisHelpful","R17NK5TE7X50W9","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new series has several features that make it attractive: an interesting setting in a library that is in an old lighthouse, an exhibit of rare Jane Austen books, and a library cat named Charles.  The main character, Lucy, is tolerable, but I agree with some other reviewers that she doesn't use deduction and at times is a little flaky.  It's only the first book in the series, though, so I'm willing to give it another try with the next one, since the other features were intriguing, and the ending was also quite a surprise.  I always like that in a cozy mystery, since there are often similarities in the plots within this genre.  So, all in all, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35HD2GJV62TYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451470931#wasThisHelpful","R35HD2GJV62TYI","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read all but one of the 6 books in this cookie cutter shop mystery.  Somehow I missed ""Cookies and Scream,"" but I think I'll wait a while before going back to that one.  It isn't that I don't enjoy the series; there are things I like about it, such as the good friendship between Olivia and Maddie, and their cookie cutter shop.  The little Yorky, Spunky, is a cute addition, and there are other characters who are also well-drawn.  My main objection is that there is a great deal of detail not only about cookie-making, but also about cookie-eating.  Everyone seems to eat cookies all day long, and it gets a bit tiring to read about it again and again.  The mystery itself is OK, without surprises but still fairly engaging.  It's just cookie overload that makes me want to pause before reading any more in the series.  I think the series would benefit from a trim--fewer cookies for everyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQ7DYJJTLRSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425260712#wasThisHelpful","R3AQ7DYJJTLRSD","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 8th book in the Miniature Mystery series, and like the others, it is beautifully written, full of colorful atmosphere, and centered around retired English teacher, Gerry Porter, and her precocious 11-year-old grand daughter, Maddie.  Their usual home is Lincoln Point, CA, but for this installment, they visit New York City, and the mystery unfolds there.  I would recommend this series highly to readers who are interested in miniatures or crafting in general, and to readers who especially enjoy a plot in which family and relationships are of prime importance.  For me, it's the fine writing and the interesting detail about miniatures that keeps me coming back to this particular series.I am even more enthusiastic about the author's other two series--the Mathematical Mysteries (written as Ada Madison) and the older one, the Periodic Table Mysteries (written under her own name, Camille Minichino).  For my taste, there is more development and change in the characters in the latter two series.  Nevertheless, Manhattan in Miniature is a fine contribution to this series, and I highly recommend the other two series as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AFLBLIIFBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564745627#wasThisHelpful","R33AFLBLIIFBE","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new cozy mystery series is always fun to try out, and this one will be attractive especially to readers who are interested in needlework.  The members of the needlepoint group (both men and women) are diverse and well-portrayed.  The main character, Angie, is not a needlepointer herself, although she is sharp, capable, and caring.  The problem for me was the writing. There are many very short sentences that produce the sort of reading that one can do very quickly.  That may appeal to some readers, but it's not my personal taste.  I prefer to have good local atmosphere, vivid description, and more depth to the main characters.I did feel that the writing became stronger as the plot unfolded.  There was some suspense (although it's hard to establish much suspense in a 20-year-old cold case), and the outcome surprised me.  That's enough for me to try the next installment when it comes out.  I like to give a new series a chance, but even the cat Juno doesn't hang around much in this one.  I did like the historical side of needlepoint samplers and the quotes from them at the beginnings of chapters.  If that aspect is expanded upon in future books, it could be a promising series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OS17Q1U9AUJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617730041#wasThisHelpful","R3OS17Q1U9AUJ6","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The mysteries in the China Bayles series are always complex and engaging from beginning to end.  I've read them all, and Bittersweet is a fine contribution.  Each time I read one though, I think it's the best, and then the next one comes along, and it seems equally good, but always different from the rest too.  There's no need to read them in order, but the more you read, the more you'll want to read them all.  The rugged beauty of the Texas countryside and issues around invasive plant and animal species are especially well-done this time around, and the characters have depth and interest.  Issues around women and their societal role also permeate the book, and China's multi-faceted personality is important to the resolution.One suggestion for readers who have not yet started this book: don't read the full advertising blurb on this website (or on the paper cover of the book) if you don't care for spoilers.  One of the events mentioned there happens only 50 pages from the end of the book, and for me it hung like a cloud as I was reading the book.  Some other events happen well into the plot too, so I'd say ignore that bit of advertising and just enjoy the way the plot unfolds.  There's plenty of suspense, and it's more enjoyable if you don't know what's coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26U7HY996HVK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042525562X#wasThisHelpful","R26U7HY996HVK9","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very pleased with this pie pan.  I've used it so far in a regular oven for making quiche for 2 people.  It works beautifully. The pan is not super-heavy, but it's heavy enough to allow the quiche to bake evenly, and the decorated lip on the top is very handy when forming the top of the crust.  It washes up well in the dishwasher, and it hasn't scratched from the utensils I used to cut the pie slices.  It is perhaps a little trickier to get the first piece out, as one reviewer mentioned, but I find if I use a smaller-than-normal spatula, it works fine.

"I enjoyed this debut mystery in the Spice Shop series and would recommend it especially for readers who have visited Seattle or who enjoy plenty of atmosphere and sense of place in their mysteries.  I have only been to Seattle once, but the depth of experience and description in this book brought back many pleasant memories.  The author makes readers feel as if they are there, taking in the sights, smells, and sounds of the bustling market scene.  The main character, Pepper Reece, is clever, independent, and good at deduction.  There is a good deal of suspense, and despite the fact that there were many characters introduced in the book, there were only a few possible suspects, so I didn't find it difficult to keep them straight.  Also, the important characters are well-defined, so the plot unfolds nicely.  I look forward to the continuation of this series; it's off to a strong start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DAJZ29WYUA20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425271781#wasThisHelpful","R3DAJZ29WYUA20","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 11th book in the Martha's Vineyard mystery series, and like many other readers, I enjoy the character who is the sleuth, 92-year-old Victoria Trumbull.  For many of us, she is the main reason to pursue this series.  She is quick-witted, lively, writes prose and poetry, and knows the history of her island and its people very well.  I've read all the books in the series, and Jack in the Pulpit and Touch-Me-Not were my favorites, but all of them have a strong sense of place and lovely description of the seasons and rugged terrain around the island.  Every now and then, I find myself pausing to appreciate a particularly fine turn of phrase or an unusual sentence.  That doesn't happen very often in cozy mysteries, and it's one of the pleasures here.I would recommend this particular installment for readers who are boating enthusiasts, because a good deal of it takes place on the water in various types of boats.  The plot hinges around a university setting this time, where Victoria has been invited to teach a poetry course, and the various pieces of the plot unfold over the pros and cons of tenure for faculty.  The one part that didn't appeal to me this time was the way that the ending was not tied up for all characters.  In my opinion, there should have been another brief chapter to do that; it just doesn't feel resolved.  However, there was a good deal of suspense, and the ending surprised me, so those features are certainly praiseworthy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R136VDMWHGFP6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NE06TCQ#wasThisHelpful","R136VDMWHGFP6D","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the second book in the fixer-upper mystery series, This Old Homicide was an improvement over the initial one (A High-End Finish), in my opinion.  The sense of how time passed was clearer in this one, and for the most part, the many threads of the plot were woven quite well into the mystery.  I thought that the men in the story were portrayed better and with more depth than the women were, which is a bit unusual for a cozy mystery.  Shannon, the protagonist, has an interesting job as a contractor, and the descriptions of the renovations she is involved in are well-done.Nevertheless, I prefer the other series that this author writes--the bibliophile mysteries--which is longstanding and carries quite a lot of suspense.  This one may continue to improve, but for now, it seems to have too many threads, too many characters, and not enough clever deduction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90N705LJZL4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469208#wasThisHelpful","R90N705LJZL4O","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third book in the Deadly Notions mystery series, which is named for the antiques/needlework shop that the protagonist, Daisy, runs called Sometimes a Great Notion. Daisy is in her 50s, a retired history teacher, and her interest in antiques and samplers is useful to her in this book.  There are several interesting characters too--both men and women--and there is a good deal of suspense.  The dog, Jasper, is a nice addition, and there are cats that belong to friends.  The cats stay pretty much in the background, but the whole small-town atmosphere is nicely portrayed, and the cheerful home life setting around Thanksgiving is well-done. Daisy's husband, Joe, who is a fine cook and woodworker, is also portrayed with depth and interest.I'm enjoying this author's writing. Although I read the 3 books out of order, it doesn't seem to matter in this particular case. The characters are all well-done, and the endings have been a surprise.  Daisy is a wise person, and she often states little words of philosophy that I find quite interesting and often uplifting.

"Having enjoyed Indian food at restaurants for many years, I also wanted to learn to cook some dishes at home. That is the stated purpose of this book, so it sounded like a good start.  I also ordered Vij's Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine, which is a much more expensively-produced book with excellent recipes that are special and inspiring.  Both books are based on restaurant food, but in other ways they are miles apart.  I am not sorry that I purchased Curry Magic, but so far, I am not inspired by it.  I will use it mainly for condiment recipes--chutney and raitas--which are abundant and interesting.I have 2 reasons for not being inspired by most of the recipes in this book.  One is that many come directly from restaurants and are geared toward high-volume preparation.  Some call for ""garam masala gravy,"" which is given as a separate recipe that includes 10 ingredients, 3 of which are separate purees of garlic, ginger, and onion.  Once made, this gravy is enough for 40 portions of curry, and one is supposed to put it in 10 molds and freeze it, then use it in other recipes in the book.  After doing all this, one is then prepared to make Chicken Dhansak (chicken cooked with lentils and vegetables), for example, which lists 8 ingredients in addition to the chicken and assorted vegetables.  One of the ingredients is ""Akhni stock"", which one would need to have on hand too (or use water).  One ingredient is ""curry masala gravy"" which one would have to have made previously too. The other reason is that there are a great many ingredients that one needs in the pantry but are only used infrequently.  Again, this is not inspiring to me.These steps complicated the recipes, in my view, at least for the home cook, who might prepare an Indian meal occasionally but not every night.  For restaurants, of course they can use the ""gravy"" constantly, but home cooks might not want to keep it on hand or make it and freeze it.  In comparison, Vij's Elegant and Inspired Indian Cuisine is much simpler, with only a few spices and mostly fresh ingredients.  My level of inspiration rises when I look through those recipes, but I find the ones in Curry Magic daunting.  This is of course merely a personal reaction.  Again, this book is reasonably priced (with only a few color photos), and for the cook who likes to spend plenty of time in the kitchen and who prepares Indian food often, it's probably worth pursuing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8NW87EU18OK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=178219066X#wasThisHelpful","R1H8NW87EU18OK","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike many other reviewers, I have not had the pleasure of dining in the restaurant in Vancouver from which the recipes in this book come.  I do enjoy Indian food very much, and I would like to learn to cook some dishes at home as well as understand some of the methods used in Indian cooking.  This books satisfies those desires very well, and I would highly recommend it if you want to go beyond the basics but still want a relatively simple approach to authentic Indian cooking.  The explanations in this book are outstanding about why certain foods go together, which ingredients are better for certain types of dishes, and even which wines go best with each dish.Recipes that I have tried so far have all been excellent.  I agree with reviewers who have said that there is more salt and more water in some recipes, and I tend to reduce both of these ingredients as I cook. One can add more later, if they are needed.  Otherwise, even though some recipes read as if they might be highly spiced, they are not, in my opinion.  I follow them exactly the first time I make them (lessening the water and salt), and they are excellent.  For example, I've tried the chicken breast in coconut-chickpea flour curry, in which the chicken turned out moist and had a lovely tartness because of tamarind paste in the curry.  The cilantro-mint chicken curry is also very special and is one of the easiest recipes too.  I will make it often. The vegetable recipes are interesting too; for me, the cauliflower-rice pilaf was great, with its inclusion of cloves, cumin, turmeric, and cilantro.  Proportions for the ingredients in these recipes are often very important. Most of them serve 6 people, but I often make half the first time, and that has caused me no problem.The photos and commentary are both outstanding, and there are so many recipes that I intend to try.  I recommend this book highly for anyone who enjoys Indian cuisine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S46P95GDP4KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1553651847#wasThisHelpful","R1S46P95GDP4KI","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I follow all three of Sheila Connolly's mystery series: the Orchard series, the Museum series, and this one, the County Cork series.  An Early Wake is the third in the Cork series.  My favorite was Scandal in Skibbereen, which was the second installment, and I was hoping for more in the present one. The best feature of Ms. Connolly's books is the depth of historical background, and in the case of this series, which is set in Ireland, there is tremendous possibility for description, beauty, folklore, and history, which could make a wonderful backdrop to a good mystery.  Unfortunately, it just isn't there in this installment.The protagonist, Maura, is a young American who has inherited a pub from a relative who died in Ireland.  In the first three books, she has been gradually adapting to life in a small town, new customs and vocabulary, and new people. All of these activities could add interest for readers, but I don't find Maura to be a very likable person.  She criticizes the two men who express interest in her for not being able to communicate, but she herself is a poor communicator too.  This does not make for pleasant reading while the three of them try to sort out what, if any, personal feelings they may have for each other. Also, nearly all the action takes place within the pub, so the Irish atmosphere arises mainly from the accents that appear in the dialogue.  Those too get tiring to read.I would recommend this installment if you follow the series and want to keep up with Maura's life.  Otherwise, I'd say skip this one and perhaps try one of Ms. Connolly's other series.  The Orchard series is a better bet, on the whole, than this one, in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BGWZI35H6L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425252531#wasThisHelpful","R15BGWZI35H6L2","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series about Minnie Hamilton, assistant director of a library in a small town in Michigan, has been a strong one from the beginning.  She is dedicated to her job and to the idea of running a Bookmobile, and she has friends and an aunt who support her and provide assistance.  Her boss, the library's director, can be an obstacle to her progress, but she is resourceful and intelligent, and most of all she has a positive approach to life.  The cat, Eddie, is of course a real winner; his personality is special.  He began as a stowaway on the Bookmobile but now is a regular part of the routine, and library patrons (including 5-year-olds) love him.This installment has more detail about Minnie's life and quite a lot of description.  For me, that gave her character more depth and interest, but I can also understand that some readers may find that it's too much detail.  Eddie the cat is there throughout too, with many interactions that I found very engaging, but again, perhaps it's a lot for some readers who don't dote on cats.  In any case, if you're a follower of this series, I don't think you'll be disappointed; this one is every bit as good as the first two are.  Each one can stand alone, but the series is so interesting that I recommend reading them all.

"The central idea for this new series is a familiar one in cozy mysteries: the protagonist is a young, clever woman who is not entirely happy with her life in a big city, and she inherits property (in this case, a fabric store) in a small town.  She must first decide whether to move to the new town or not, and inevitably of course, a murder happens to complicate the picture.  Happily, Diane Vallere has added a different spin to some of these events, and her new ""material witness"" mystery series shows promise.Some other reviewers have noted already that the protagonist's name, Polyester, seems like a poor choice.  I agree, but she does call herself Poly and encourages others to use that name. It's a small point. Poly is an independent risk-taker who cares about her family and family memories.  She doesn't seem to trust anyone at all, and that for me was a shortcoming. She accuses people she meets of some of the crimes that take place, and when it becomes clear that they couldn't have done it, she doesn't even apologize.  Her soft side is there though when she takes care of the two very cute kittens who were abandoned.I thought the characters were interesting, and the best part was that there was plenty of suspense.  The author often leaves an unsolved event or surprise at the end of a chapter, making one want to read on immediately.  I liked that.  I would recommend this series especially to readers who sew, or who like fabrics and design.  The author clearly has expertise in these areas, and the way she includes mention of them in the plot is quite fascinating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ACUAGI19FK8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270572#wasThisHelpful","R2ACUAGI19FK8X","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have followed this Library Lover's Series from Jenn McKinlay and enjoyed the previous installments, but I have to agree with some other reviewers who find the love triangle in this installment too prevalent.  The two men, both of whom want the affections of the librarian, Lindsey Norris, are now spending time with each other (when they're not busy chasing her), and they are trying to foil each other's attempts for attention.  It's amusing to a point, but the lack of any real change is tiring.There are a couple of action scenes, mainly on the water rather than in or around the library, and for readers who look for that in their cozy mysteries, this one delivers on that score.  However, the mystery is otherwise rather thin, and the love triangle is very prevalent, so all in all, it's a slow plot.  I'm winding down on this series, but I do like Ms. McKinlay's newer Hat Shop Mysteries.  If you're new to her books. I'd say give that series a try first.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV9II8A8QP4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425260739#wasThisHelpful","R2MV9II8A8QP4G","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second in a new quilting series, and it has some strong features.  The author manages to create a protagonist, Martha Rose, who is gutsy and has an outgoing, caring personality.  There are several ways that Jewish customs and food come into the story, and that aspect helps to bring some of the characters closer together.  I enjoyed the setting near Los Angeles, and the three quilting friends--Martha, Lucy, and Birdie--have a close relationship.  For quilters, this series is fun, because the author actually appears to have a good knowledge of quilting, and her references to it add something to the background.On the other hand, Martha Rose's personality grated on me a bit, and I didn't like some of the decisions she made.  I'll stick with this series for the next book, because the first two books were satisfying in some ways, but unless Martha works out some of her problems in a more reasonable way, I don't think I'll be around for long.  I would recommend the series to quilters in particular, but a few reservations prevent me from giving it unqualified praise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQZS5DLUZW1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758292074#wasThisHelpful","R2MQZS5DLUZW1H","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the fifteenth book in the Dorothy Martin series, and readers who know the protagonists, Dorothy Martin and her husband Alan Nesbitt, will enjoy their close relationship and co-operative sleuthing.  I've read all the books in this series, and I find that I'm beginning to tire a bit of Dorothy's judgmental attitudes and snippy responses.  I suspect the author is trying to portray Dorothy as an aging but independent woman, but I find that her personality lacks warmth.  She claims to have friends, and she and Alan are (for once) at home in Sherebury in this book, but the aged Jane, her neighbor, is the only friend that seems to be there, and Jane is not very likeable either.  Alan seems like the sensible one, but we hear less from him, even though he is certainly highly regarded by the Sherebury residents and the police.  The mystery itself is not especially compelling this time; it mainly revolves around the very political atmosphere that grows up during the choice of a new bishop.There is some suspense, at least, but given that the victim dies on page 1, it's difficult for readers to gain a full picture of who he was and why Dorothy and Alan should investigate his death.  I would recommend this installment only to readers who follow the series, or perhaps to readers who might enjoy a mystery steeped in church politics.  There is a great deal of that in this mystery, perhaps a little too much for me.  I do enjoy this series in general, though, and I will look forward to the next one, hoping that Dorothy finds it possible to be more likeable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7UQMPBOBFQLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0727883976#wasThisHelpful","R7UQMPBOBFQLB","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This needlecraft mystery series has moved to the top of my favorites with this installment, the 18th in the series.  There is never a feeling of repetition in the plots in Ms. Ferris's books, and we always learn something new about familiar characters: Betsy (owner of Crewel World, a needlecraft store), her boyfriend Connor, and various friends and co-workers, including of course her important colleague, Godwin.  What is unique, as far as I know, about this series as compared with others that also deal with knitting, crocheting, or other needlecrafts, is that Ms. Ferris sometimes includes some societal issues in the plot and connects them in some way to a particular type of needle work, in this case crocheting.  The murder victim is an individual known for being a hoarder (or a ""collector,"" as he described himself), and the plot treats that characteristic in a very sympathetic way, showing how it can affect other peoples' lives even when they may not know the hoarder.This deeper meaning of the plot is similar to what Ms. Ferris did in Threadbare, which dealt with homelessness and also stood out for me as a very special work in the series.  I would recommend Darned If You Do very highly to readers of cozy mysteries in general, but if you enjoy needle work, you will find it even more appealing.The writing is vivid and interesting, and there is a good amount of suspense.  The two cats, Sophie and Thai, each have distinctive personalities too, and their presence makes for enjoyable reading.  It's all very well-done, and the description is first-rate throughout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MOB9RAWPQB2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425270106#wasThisHelpful","R1MOB9RAWPQB2O","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this masher for a couple of months now, and I love it.  When it first arrived, I thought it was a bit large and heavy, but I was convinced immediately that it did mash potatoes to a nice fluffy consistency, very close to what a ricer would do.  I often use it for carrots too, and that works fine.  As long as the vegetables are cooked to a soft stage, they come out fluffy and evenly mashed.Today I was using it again, and I discovered that if you rock the masher slightly from side to side as you mash, it works much quicker and better!  The potatoes don't get pressed down too much either. They're even fluffier than usual.  Try it!  You might be as surprised as I was.The masher cleans up nicely in the dishwasher, but it's easy to clean by hand too.  No worries there, and the stainless steel is good quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PI44NR5GWVMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DI4ZW#wasThisHelpful","R1PI44NR5GWVMT","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cozy mystery readers know that there's a certain risk in buying the first book in a new series. The idea of trying out a new series by an author whom you already know appeals to me more, because I am always hopeful that the features I already like in her books will transfer to this one. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way for me this time.I follow Ms. Carlisle's ""Bibliophile Mystery"" series, where the protagonist is smart, creative, and a risk-taker.  The protagonist in this new series, Shannon Hammer, has potential--she's a general contractor and skilled at renovating Victorian homes.  That part works for me. However, I felt that most of the other women in the mystery were rather shallow.  Their interests and personalities just weren't cleverly portrayed.The mystery itself started off well too, I thought: an unusual murder, lots of suspects, good reasons to investigate further, and even a dog and cat that provided some diversion for Shannon. Unfortunately, these good points didn't hold throughout the book.  I found it hard to follow the time that had elapsed in the book, but as far as I could tell, the dog and cat disappeared from Shannon's life without explanation for a couple of weeks.  Then the cat made a brief appearance, but after that, nothing. No more animals. As far as the plot was concerned, again the timing seemed off, and the conclusion just seemed impossible.I don't like to judge the first book in a series too harshly--especially when the author's other series has worked well for me--but I won't buy a second book in this series.  Next time I'll borrow it from the library.  I doubt that this series is one I will be following for very long, but I'll give it one more chance before giving it up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M25GRQ9DI2TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469194#wasThisHelpful","R1M25GRQ9DI2TO","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of the three installments in this Amish Quilt Shop Mystery, this one has been my favorite.  Because I came to the series fairly recently and three had already come out, I read them all in close succession, but not in order. That didn't seem to matter; I thought they were all solid cozy mysteries with suspense, good character development, and a pleasant setting in Amish country in Ohio.This particular book, Murder, Simply Stitched, has more character development and contrast, in my opinion, than the other two books, and that is probably the main feature that gave me more pleasure in reading it.  Also, the three animals (a dog, a kitten, and a goat) each had a part in the story, and there was a little more about quilting in this particular installment.  The suspense was good, as usual, and there are a couple of twists, both of which surprised to me.I would recommend this book (and the series) to cozy mystery readers who enjoy character development, contrast of lifestyles between the Amish and the ""English,"" and a bit of quilting on the side.  I would like to see more about Amish quilting, but that might not please everyone, and this series strikes a good balance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C9B9QKRDKK42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451413644#wasThisHelpful","R3C9B9QKRDKK42","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first book in a new series billed as a ""Scottish Highlands Mystery"" suggests that the protagonist, who is actually only visiting Scotland at this point, might stay there, thus making it possible for the whole series to use that setting.  There is no real hint yet of whether that is the case, but this installment does offer some very fine qualities: a good plot with twists, a clever protagonist who manages to assist the local detective, and a setting that is beautifully described.  There is so much atmosphere here around the colors, views, the sea and hills, the Scottish food and pub, and a diverse group of characters.I would recommend this new series for its depth of character portrayal and fine Scottish setting in particular. Although one can't expect everything to be revealed in a first book, I did feel that the ending was a bit rushed and perhaps needed reactions from a few more interested parties.  Nevertheless, it's a fine beginning and a series that I intend to follow.  There's plenty to enjoy here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G4ES1J2IIS8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042526582X#wasThisHelpful","R2G4ES1J2IIS8Y","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I liked most about this first book in a new cozy mystery series was that it has some original elements to it.  As anyone who reads a lot in this genre knows, they can be formulaic: a young female protagonist loses her high-paying job (and/or her boyfriend) while living in a large city, and then moves back to a small town, usually to be with a relative, until she decides whether to stay there or not. Those circumstances are here, but there are some differences that contribute to a new angle on the familiar.  For one thing, Georgia works with stained glass, which is quite an unusual business or hobby for a cozy mystery.  I found her descriptions of the technique and the glass quite interesting.  I also thought the way the police were involved was unusual and made the plot move along nicely.  The police were neither too lax nor too overbearing, and their involvement and interactions with Georgia were believable.  Georgia herself is bright and capable, and her kitten is also a plus, even if only for cuteness.I think this series has potential, and I'll be staying with it to see how it develops.  I am hopeful that there will be more about stained glass in the next installment, but I think that for a first effort, it was certainly satisfying in all ways.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X04SS2LF0XI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425267954#wasThisHelpful","R1X04SS2LF0XI0","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have followed all three of Sheila Connolly's cozy mystery series (the other are the museum series and the newer County Cork series), and despite their very different settings, they all have a few things in common.  For example, there is a lot of historical detail; genealogy is given some prominence; and the mystery is not the most important part. All that is true here, and I would have to say that this one has less suspense than any of Ms. Connolly's mysteries that I have read.  That seems surprising in a way, since there were actually two cases being investigated, but the main one was especially lacking in a coherent development, and one large clue was entirely overlooked.  I didn't enjoy reading this installment, since I knew who committed the crime before the halfway point, and none of the characters caught on until near the end.  There were some lapses in logic too that were distressing.Ms. Connolly's series tend to start off very well and then gradually decline, in my opinion.  This one has reached its limit of pleasure for me, but I'll stick with the County Cork mysteries for now.  The setting in Ireland is a plus, and the characters are more lively.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MABVY0OBDTP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425257118#wasThisHelpful","R2MABVY0OBDTP2","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Characters from the previous book, I've Got You Under My Skin, are here 3 years later: Leo, the grandfather; Timmy, now 9 years old; and Laurie, who is responsible for a television reality series featuring cold cases.  As is usual for Mary Higgins Clark, the characters are introduced in short chapters at the beginning.  We quickly come to understand their thinking, motivation, and possible weak spots, always with an interesting psychological factor woven into the description.  This is vintage Mary Higgins Clark: it's what we love about her writing, and no one does it better, in my opinion.The writing seems (to me anyway) to be Ms. Clark's, and I suspect the contribution of Alafair Burke is in parts of the plot, especially when technology is used and when legal issues are discussed.  Ms. Burke's background would contribute nicely there, but all else seems to be very much Mary Higgins Clark.  I've read all her books and absolutely loved at least half of them, and the rest were also very fine.  This one ranks with the very fine ones; in its way, it's even outstanding, and if it's the first in a series around cold cases and TV reality shows, I think it's an excellent idea that should suit the author's ability at storytelling very well.  Brava!  Excellent all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VM5PYDOUW2YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476763127#wasThisHelpful","R3VM5PYDOUW2YG","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've stuck with this series thus far, largely because I enjoy the references to vintage cookware, the setting in a small town near the Canadian border, and two animals (a cat and a small dog) that provide some pleasant diversion.  The series came to a low point in one of the previous books, Freezer I'll Shoot, and I'm sorry to say that this one, No Mallets Intended, shared many similar qualities that for me didn't add up to a satisfying cozy mystery.The main issue with the protagonist, Jaymie, is that she has no particular reason for investigating the murders as she does, and she is not very skilled at it either.  There is a good deal of repetition too, as she asks over and over again, ""who could have done it?""  She is quite likely to accuse suspects of murder outright, and she frequently goes out on her own, even though friends and family tell her that it's not safe.I think I've given this series a good try by reading all of the installments thus far, but two that don't measure up are enough to entice me to give it up.  There isn't really very much about vintage cookware anyway, and the timing of events seemed off to me in this particular installment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PVH7LG0FVQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425271390#wasThisHelpful","R38PVH7LG0FVQP","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed this series thus far, this being the third installment.  I thought the one prior to this one, The Sayers Swindle, was the best of the series; I would recommend that one unconditionally.  This one I would recommend especially to readers who are already familiar with Jordan and her employer, Vera Van Alst.  The bond between Vera and Jordan gathers some strength in this installment.  There is good character development too in Ms. Abbott's mysteries, and Jordan's family members and friends each have very distinctive personalities.The suspense builds nicely, and I found myself imagining the plot unfolding as a movie plot might, colorful and full of action.  Jordan is a smart, capable protagonist.  She doesn't trust people, and she doesn't assume that her first impressions are correct.  This gives her an edge in solving the crime, and even though she does allow herself to break the law to do it, readers can still see the good she is trying to do.  It's all a bit unusual for a cozy mystery, but for readers who like a mystery that is not straightforward, I would recommend this series, for sure.  Even Vera's two cats (Good Cat and Bad Cat) have distinct personalities, and there are also two dogs who play a part too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAUGT9P5ZM30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255301#wasThisHelpful","R2QAUGT9P5ZM30","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always pleasant to find a new cozy mystery series that has plenty of suspense, a good cast of characters, and a setting that is unique.  This one certainly qualifies in all ways.  I'm not usually drawn to ghost stories or the paranormal, and I wasn't sure that a ""dream club mystery"" would be to my taste either, but I was mistaken.  The women who meet to discuss their dreams make a fascinating group: they are from different generations and have different interests, but they also are supportive and generally helpful to each other.The two sisters, Ali (owner of a retro candy shop in Savannah) and her sister, Taylor, are bright and independent.  Together with the ladies in the dream club and other friends, they use instinct and deduction to investigate the crime, and the plot unfolds well.Readers might find themselves thinking about their own dreams while reading about the interpretations the ladies put on the dreams they discuss.  There are two cats too, Barney and Scout, who are much-loved and have a bit of their own intuition.  I enjoyed that, and there was a good deal of suspense too right up to the end.

It takes place during the lead-up to Halloween, and there are some very good scenes that involve the possibility of ghosts--or not, depending on what you are willing to believe.  Followers of the series will enjoy the personalities of the ladies who belong to this unusual reading group.  In fact, none of them seems to be very ""literary,"" and in this installment the connection with a book for the club is quite tenuous.  The ""bad"" cat, Jerry Garcia, once again makes only one appearance, this time at the beginning of the book.  He is otherwise talked about a lot, but there is no real engagement with him and certainly no evidence that he will ever have any human friends.  It's the only series I know that has such a badly-behaved cat in it; cozies are much better known for having very cute pets in them.I didn't feel that this installment quite measured up to the previous two, and as some other readers have said, there were some inconsistencies in the story.

"This new cozy mystery series is labelled as a ""fat cat mystery,"" but it will appeal to readers who enjoy sweets as well as to cat lovers.  These two features are probably the most original ones in this series, and I thought both were well-done.  The cat, Quincy, has a distinct personality and is part of the story throughout the book, and the food aspect is featured by virtue of the story taking place in Bar None, a shop co-owned by two of the main characters and where various types of delectable dessert bars are baked and sold.I think this series is a promising one, and I look forward to the next installment.  Nevertheless, there were a few features that didn't quite work, in my opinion.  One was the way that the two store owners, Chase and Anna, as well as their two employees, seemed ready to accuse each other of stealing, without making any serious attempt to solve the problem. Chase, the protagonist, was also impulsive in other ways and too-often boldly accused people of murdering someone without a shred of real evidence.The cat, Quincy, is a real charmer though.  There are a few paragraphs throughout the book (in a different font) that give a summary of his point of view, and they add a lot.  All in all, I would recommend this new series in particular for cat lovers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1932HBDE7TY7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425267423#wasThisHelpful","R1932HBDE7TY7A","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in the Blossom Valley mystery series, and I think this one is even better than the first one.  Here, once again, the protagonist Dana Lewis finds herself obligated to help the police solve the mystery.  The victim is her sister Ashlee's boyfriend, and Dana feels a strong sense of family obligation to help.There is suspense, deduction, and a group of possible suspects, but what sets this book apart, in my opinion, is its clever use of humor on several levels.  I usually find that humor tends to fall flat in a cozy mystery; often it's strained and just doesn't go with the otherwise serious nature of the plot. Here though, the contrast between the two sisters' personalities is often a cause for smiles, as are some of the little events around Dana's dislike for natural foods and spa life.  Since she works at a spa, she sometimes has a hard time coping with her own prejudices, and the result is worth quite a few laughs.  The farm animals even get involved in some of the humor.

"This is the fourth book in the Ashton Corners Book Club series, and it's still going strong.  My favorite was the first one, A Killer Read, but each one has strengths that center largely on the way the author is able to give an individual voice and personality to each member of the book club.  Ms. Chase does this in part by describing the mystery books that each of them picks for club meetings (and she gives a list of their favorites at the end).  For frequent readers of cozy mysteries, these hints and descriptions are quite fun to read.  Lizzie Turner is a leader within the group and the protagonist as the mystery unfolds.  She is smart, capable, and a good friend to the club members and to her policeman boyfriend, Mark.I enjoyed the plot and setting.  It moves at a good pace and keeps the reader (and Lizzie) guessing.  I did feel that the conclusion rolled out a bit too quickly and, for me, wasn't completely satisfying, but the series is still a solid one and very much worth reading.  The characters and their supportive and contrasting personalities make it work.

"Denise Swanson is a fluent writer.  I've enjoyed her Scumble River mystery series, and  I came to the Dime Store series with the hope that it would be another winner.  Instead, Ms. Swanson has given so much attention and focus to exploring a love triangle that the mystery takes second place.Love triangles are fairly common in cozy mysteries, and sometimes they work, especially if the characters are well-drawn.  Here, sad to say, the three main characters -- Dev (the Dime Store owner), and her 2 boyfriends, Noah and Jake-simply don't have much depth.  Their relationships don't mature beyond physical attraction, and the mixture of first and third person in the telling of the story becomes somewhat confusing.  The mystery is not engaging either.  Some of the other characters, such as Dev's grandmother, have potential, but there is not enough attention given to them to show depth there either.  So far, I've stuck with this series to see if it would develop into a thriving mystery series, but now I know I won't be following it any further.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4LK3SLLAE32S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451418883#wasThisHelpful","R4LK3SLLAE32S","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second book in the Bookmobile Cat series is every bit as good as the first one, which I thought stood out as original, engaging, and the beginning of a very promising series.  The strengths of both books lie in the main character, Minnie Hamilton, who is a dedicated librarian and who is passionate about reading and wants to be of assistance to library patrons of all ages.  In contrast to some other cozy mysteries that feature librarians, this one gives us a truer picture of the challenges and successes that librarians face in their work.  Minnie is far from being a stereotypical librarian though, and her interest in using a bookmobile in her work is quite special.  Eddie the cat is an engaging character too, and there is much fun around the way that he appears to understand his human friends, even though Minnie acknowledges that he couldn't possibly have human traits.The main feature that for me sets this series apart from quite a few other new cozy mystery series is the originality the author displays.  The plot, the characters, Eddie the cat, and the bookmobile are all unusual and handled in enough detail to be truly engaging for readers.  Minnie lives on a houseboat, which also adds some elements of interest, and her boyfriend, Tucker, is a pleasant addition too.  I think that the only way to be disappointed in the books in this series would be by reading them too quickly.  There are so many little things that are enjoyable along the way--plays on words, plot twists, and sometimes humorous episodes involving books and patrons--that some of the originality could be lost if they are skipped over.  This is a series in which the writing is clever, interesting, and certainly worth savoring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJ3TQW266XG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451415477#wasThisHelpful","R1OJ3TQW266XG3","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second in the Merry Muffin series from Victoria Hamilton, Muffin but Murder emphasizes the quirky characters in the town of Autumn Vale in upstate New York and centers around a costume party during which a murder is committed.  The mystery itself is certainly adequate, but I found the characters and circumstances this time to be a little too unbelievable.  I do enjoy the author's other books in the Vintage Kitchen Series, so for readers who like cozy mysteries and have not yet read Victoria Hamilton's books, I'd say the other series might be more fun as an introduction to her writing.  I will probably continue with this series too, but I'm hoping for a little less dialogue next time around and more lifelike characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCOK09ZNH2LL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042525884X#wasThisHelpful","R3UCOK09ZNH2LL","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a new series that features a protagonist named Stan (Kristan), who bakes and sells organic pet treats.  There are quite a few smiles about her habit of carrying a bag of treats everywhere she goes, ready to give one to any dog or cat she meets.  All the dogs and cats in the town love her!  In this installment, the victim is someone we haven't really had a chance to become acquainted with, and I always think this makes suspense more difficult to build.  Often the motives are less clear too.  Those features are true here, but it still works well,  especially since there's plenty of action in the second half of the book.Stan is likable, and she has now made some good friends in her new small town life in Frog Ledge, CT.  Her mother also comes to visit her this time, which adds some interest.  The author is good at showing contrasts in personalities, and I enjoyed the character of Stan's friend Char in particular.  The pets in Stan's life are also well-drawn and full of vigor, which adds a lot to the story line.  It's a series to follow in order, since each book features a few developments in Stan's life that are important.  There are some good-looking recipes included for pet treats too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R89TSOQTF20I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758284802#wasThisHelpful","R89TSOQTF20I5","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this small slow cooker to replace a Betty Crocker one that was about 10 years old and was no longer keeping its high and low settings.  This one also has high, low, and warm settings; it's a little smaller than the Betty Crocker, and like most cookers, the advertised liquid amount can be misleading.  This one holds about 4 cups of liquid if there's nothing else in it, but if you add veggies or meat, count on using no more than 3 1/2 cups of liquid.  (A slow cooker is made to be filled between 1/2 and 2/3 full so that it won't leak or boil over.) There is no timer.  The handles on the lower part stay cool when it's cooking; this is nice, in case you need to move it while it's hot.  The insert washes up nicely in the dishwasher, and so does the lid.  There is not a tight seal between the lid and the insert when cooking, but for most dishes, that doesn't matter.I would recommend this little cooker as a second one for a household, especially if you like to make small batches of food occasionally.  I like to make applesauce, granola, and small meals in it, whereas for soups and stews I use my larger slow cooker.  For either one, I generally heat the food on HIGH for about an hour first, then turn it down to LOW and leave it while I go out. (This isn't essential, but I like to get the food up to cooking temperature relatively quickly.) Each slow cooker is slightly different, so one needs to experiment at first to see if the timing in a recipe is right for yours.  Timing is especially affected by the size of the cooker, so even recipes you know from a larger cooker may be different in a smaller one.As others have said, this cooker should cost you around $10 in a big box store.  For the price, it's certainly worthwhile to have as a second cooker, since it's small, easy to store, and will prepare small amounts of food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXIFIVDQFF3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SYH7VQ#wasThisHelpful","RHXIFIVDQFF3P","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are certainly enjoyable features to this cozy mystery series: the theme of vintage kitchen equipment is nicely worked in; the little dog, Hoppy, is a cute and loyal companion to the protagonist, Jayme Leighton; and the island/mainland setting between Canada and the U.S. offers some good contrasts. Jayme's boyfriend, Daniel, and both sets of parents also offer a bit of interest to the plot.  What doesn't work for me in this installment is the considerable amount of repetition.  Jayme's interest in solving the murder doesn't really go beyond being nosy, and she clearly doesn't have much skill as an investigator.  Her main technique is to ask who could have done it over and over again.There is less detail about vintage kitchen supplies in this installment, I think, and that makes the repetition even more apparent.  I might try one more book in the series to see if the story line is a little tighter next time, but at the moment, I feel slightly disappointed in this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FZZ5URO6S4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042525237X#wasThisHelpful","R4FZZ5URO6S4A","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had fallen a bit behind in this series that incorporates the craft of constructing miniature houses and interiors, and so I read the precursor to this one (Mix-up in Miniature) and Madness in Miniature one after the other.  For readers who know the series, it is very enjoyable, well-written, and has characters that have several dimensions.I thought Mix-up in Miniature was possibly the best in the series thus far, and for me, that view still stands after reading Madness in Miniature.  The latter one wasn't quite as intriguing as the others.  The mystery isn't as well sustained; there is less about the craft of miniatures (except in the early part of the book); and the ending isn't quite as thoroughly explained as usual.There is still a nice surprise at the end, and the series will no doubt keep going nicely.  The author is skilled at pacing the story line, and the main character, Gerry, is a thoughtful, kind, and resourceful person.  For readers who find her 11-year-old grand-daughter, Maddie, a little too ""perfect,"" this installment may support that view, but I still find the entire setting a very attractive one and would recommend it highly, especially to readers who have already sampled the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJV7LX056N2OH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1564745430#wasThisHelpful","RJV7LX056N2OH","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this 7-cup processor for about 6 months, and my conclusion is that I like it a lot.  I have owned several food processors in the past 20 years, alternating between Cuisinart and Kitchen Aid.  Each time I buy one of these dependable brands, I always think ""this is better,"" but then something happens, and I switch brands again.  Usually it has been a crack in the plastic feed bowl.  I have had some difficulty deciding which size was better for my needs too.  In the end, I hope this is the last food processor I will need; so far, it fits all my desires quite well, although there are some drawbacks that took some getting used to.First the good: the plastic in the work bowl is heavy-duty and does not cloud over from washing it in a dishwasher.  This is a major difference between this model and all other processors I have owned.  They all clouded over after one or two washings.  Also, the slicing disk has 6 different thicknesses that you can easily dial to choose one.  I can make coleslaw with just the right shreds on thickness ""2,"" for example, which was something I could never do properly with the Cuisinart machine.  The shreds were too small and mushy.  There are also two choices on the shredding disk, which you can get by simply turning it upside down or not.  I love that.  The design with 2 holes in the disks is also amazing: you can pick it up easily without trying to slip your fingers between the disk and the bowl in order to get it out.  The difficulty of attaching the top is not a problem, once one gets used to it.  You just need to remember the steps.  Both the bottom and the top snap into place.  Every machine has its quirks in this regard, so one just needs to learn how each one works.Now the bad: The push-button system at the front is difficult to manage when you want short bursts and are trying to cut or chop in a particular way.  You need to press the ""low"" or ""high,"" and then press ""off"" to stop the machine.  (""Pulse"" does go off when you release the pressure.) Cuisinart machines are much easier to regulate, since they go off immediately when you let up the button.  Pulsing in short increments is also much easier with Cuisinart.  The pressure required to start the button on this machine is significant.  Maybe that's a safety feature, but I find it too stiff and hard to start.All in all, I am very happy with this Kitchen Aid processor.  The feed tube is large, and the work bowl is a good size for 2--4 servings.  It doesn't leak either--at least it hasn't yet--which is a difference from other processors I have owned.  I gave it 4 stars, because the buttons are too hard to press, in my opinion, which makes the chopping and shredding time hard to regulate, but otherwise it's a fine machine, and I recommend it highly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCQL83ZUEX2ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P205QU#wasThisHelpful","RCQL83ZUEX2ZW","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the eighth in the seaside knitters' mysteries, Murder in Merino has characters who are familiar to readers, a lovely seaside community, and lots of friendship and supportive relationships.  If you have liked other books in the series and haven't noticed the editing slips, and if you can overlook the over-emphasis on food and eating in restaurants, then I would still recommend this installment.  It is fun to get to know Izzy and her baby, Abby.  Birdie, the wise older lady in the group, is also unique.All that being said, I am winding down on this series, I think.  There was a group knitting project this time that did progress nicely, but in general there is not really very much about knitting in this series.  The plot gets covered in details that don't matter, and this time the mystery was quite easy to solve.  I kept wondering when the main characters were going to figure it out, since I had done so without much trouble.  The principal characters eat almost every meal at restaurants, which gets tiring, but it's their way of coming together to gossip, which they do a lot of too.The cat, Purl, who is pictured on the cover, made a cameo appearance near the beginning, as did Red, the retriever, and then they both were absent for the rest of the book.  A pity, I thought, but it's only one of the inconsistencies that one does notice unless you like to read very fast and don't pay much attention.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4F4YLWW3BSSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451415361#wasThisHelpful","R4F4YLWW3BSSK","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new mystery by Carolyn Hart is always worth looking forward to, and this one is no exception.  Annie and Max Darling combine efforts at solving three murders that touch people they know, and the police chief Billy is also a fine collaborator.  The familiar trio of friends, Laurel (Maxs mother), Henny, and Emma also contribute in their own ways, and their personalities are well-drawn.  The plot moves along nicely with every detail in place, and Ms. Harts descriptive writing is colorful and beautifully written.I always enjoy the passages that feature Agatha, the black cat who lives in Annies mystery book store.  The second cat, Dorothy L., who is white, is a little more docile, but Agatha is in fine form here with her diversionary measures and some pleasant catitude.  My favorite of Ms. Harts recent mysteries is still What the Cat Saw, but every one of her books is outstanding, and this one is no exception.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9VMUKFSBQQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266176#wasThisHelpful","R1S9VMUKFSBQQS","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not particularly taken with the first book in this series, but I decided to give the author another try.  I do like the setting in Snowflake, Vermont, and this book also takes place in the summer, which is a welcome change.  The Vermont atmosphere is very well-done, and the battle re-enactment around Bennington is nicely described. I did think this book was a little better in terms of character depth too, but I still felt that the pacing was a bit ""off"" somehow, especially in the more active second part of the book.  There were two important parts to the story at that stage, and we often spent too much time with one or the other, not knowing what was happening on the other side.  It made the plot drag a bit, I thought.I haven't given up on this series yet, because this one did seem stronger to me than the first book.  The recipes are usable and original too, so that's a plus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQ3RBHY0B53F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425252086#wasThisHelpful","R3FQ3RBHY0B53F","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would have to call myself a fan of Mary Higgins Clark, in the sense that I know her style well and am always ready to read another of her books.  I have read them all, so I am happy when a new one comes out.  This book is no exception; I thought it was certainly up to her previous standard.  It's chilling in some ways, and she writes a well-plotted story with just the right amount of description, and with characters who are vividly portrayed.The one thing that held this book back from being outstanding, in my view, was that most of the characters had some ""evil"" in them, and their personalities remained much the same throughout.  The 3 main characters (one of whom is the boy, Timmy) aren't evil, but the ""good"" in them is not a focus either.  For me, that aspect made the storyline a little too dark for my taste, but nevertheless, Ms. Clark's style wins out in the end.  I recommend ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" to readers who know her style and reputation.  I don't think you will be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQ4YBVG14P8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147674906X#wasThisHelpful","R2LQ4YBVG14P8P","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After the first book in this series, Final Sentence, I thought it was worth trying one more book before deciding whether it's a series I want to follow.  Unfortunately, I know now it's not.  The characters are not well-developed, and the protagonist, Jenna, has very poor investigative and deductive skills.  She compares herself at one point to a pinball machine, and I would have to agree; for her, picking a murderer is like a shot in the dark.  Tigger the kitten is still as cute as ever, but he's not enough to make up for other drawbacks.I could only recommend this mystery as a very light, fast read, perhaps for vacation reading, and for readers who like plenty of dialogue.

"It's hard to believe that this mystery is the 22nd in the China Bayles series (and that the author has written several other series too!).  This series is my favorite of her works.  I love the combination of folklore and history about herbs and plants, Texas life and landscape, and a protagonist who is intelligent (a former lawyer) and able to use her deductive skills well. China's friend, Ruby, has a more emotional, intuitive personality, which is a good mix with China's ""cool"" exterior.  The police chief (nicknamed Smart Cookie) is also clever, as are the husbands, who have police training too.  Even with all this expertise, it's fascinating to see that law enforcement doesn't always work exactly as it should.Every book in the series has information about herbs, usually related in some way to specific events or the overall theme. This book will appeal in particular to readers who enjoy a lawyer's view (China uses her law training a good deal here), and an excursion into the history of Mexican art and artists. The writing is excellent, as always.  I did feel this time that readers could have used one more chapter at the end, to let us know how some of the other characters reacted to the conclusion.  It felt a little unresolved in that regard, but if that is an indication that we can anticipate another book in the series before too long, I can easily accept the story as far as it goes.  It's a fine mystery, and I would recommend Ms. Albert's series unconditionally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO3VG354WTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425255638#wasThisHelpful","R2AO3VG354WTE","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sixth in a series about Tori Sinclair, a librarian in the small town of Sweet Briar, SC.  She and her friends belong to a sewing circle, which is their excuse to meet, gossip, and snipe at each other (some do more of that than others, but after six books, we pretty much know all their views by heart).  The twins, Leona and Margaret Louise, have a prominent role in this particular book, and there is even a bit of growth in their personalities in the latter part of the book. I enjoyed that part.  There are good reasons for Tori to want to solve the murder, but as usual, she doesn't approach it in a very logical way.  Also, the sewing group doesn't do much real sewing, so readers who are looking for a crafty cozy are not likely to be fully satisfied. Paris, the bunny, is still fluffy and cute, if a little unconventional as a pet.I think that my interest in this series is waning; this book just doesn't have much suspense, and it's overladen with dialogue and repetition.  For readers who like to read quickly, it may be fine. I prefer to have more depth of description, character development, and a more complex mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8AM5RAOYXPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425247066#wasThisHelpful","RB8AM5RAOYXPJ","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered 3 of these penguins for gifts to children, and they are certainly very special and cute.  Seeing 3 of them side by side though, I noticed that 2 of them are 11"" tall (not 12"", as the ad says), and the other one is 10"".  The difference is noticeable enough that I'm glad I'm not giving the 3 penguins to children in the same family, because they might not have been satisfied.  If you're ordering only one, it's worth knowing that the height will be less than 12"".  They are about 6"" in diameter, and the grey fleece is quite long, so it looks sort of feather-like.  The ""wings"" (if that's what they're called) lift up and have white beneath.  The beak is squishy, as are the feet, and the whole penguin is very light and soft.  It stands well too.I recently read a story about an oil spill in which penguins were injured, and they were given sweaters to wear so that they wouldn't preen until after workers had removed the oil.  I thought I would make a little sweater for each of these penguins and explain that operation to the kids who receive the gift.  It might enrich their play with the toys a little bit.These penguins are truly cute and just right for gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE2O5VYP4ZKH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001251326#wasThisHelpful","RE2O5VYP4ZKH3","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Outcast Dead is the sixth in this series, one that I have followed with great interest.  I think this installment is the best one thus far.  It's hard for me to say that though, because I already thought each previous book was worth five stars, so I can't really rate this one any higher.  The author makes each book in the series unique in some way.  This particular one shows a gentler side of Ruth, the forensic archeologist.  The two story lines about child abduction run parallel: a cold case from Victorian times, and modern child abduction that happens within Ruth's circle of friends.  We learn more this time about how the characters think, and especially about police work (Harry Nelson being the all-important chief investigator and long-time friend to Ruth), successes as well as failures, and perhaps most interesting of all, the emotional toll that investigative work takes on the staff.  There is a lot of suspense (as always in Ms. Griffiths' books), a sense of foreboding as we get to know the mothers and children better, and a resolution that is, for me at least, quite unpredictable.Would I recommend this book?  Yes, without reservation, but perhaps with some advice.  I know that a few readers have objected all along to Ms. Griffiths' use of present tense, and that feature continues here.  Although I found it unusual when I started reading her first book (The Crossing Places), I now accept it easily and even think it adds a certain immediacy to the storytelling.  Some readers haven't found it possible to understand Ruth's decisions either.  For that reason, I would say if you've not liked a previous book in this series, give Outcast Dead another try.  It's a more approachable book than some of the previous ones.  The cover makes mention of the author having received the Mary Higgins Clark award, and though Ms. Griffiths' work is much more atmospheric and unpredictable than that of Mary Higgins Clark, in some ways I was reminded when reading this book of some of Mary Higgins Clark's best mysteries.  They were sometimes chilling too, in the same way that this one is.  In other ways though, Ms. Griffiths moves mystery writing forward to a new level, one that I very much admire.  I was also glad to see Ruth back at home, with her daughter Kate and their cat, Flint, who has an endearing personality and who has been absent in some of the other books.  They are all reunited here with very positive results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEZ0UXBQNBDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547792778#wasThisHelpful","R3SEZ0UXBQNBDR","AY6RKDK61SZC3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY6RKDK61SZC3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I thought the writing was good, the plot was on par, and the characters were pretty interesting.Rhiann is a 16 year old girl, and pretty naive at that. But then again, aren't most 16 year old girls a little naive? She has an innocence about her which makes her beauty shine through even more. The Normans aren't well liked, but Rhiann likes them very much. They treat her kindly, and she appreciates that. She falls in love after a night in bed with a man, which is one of the biggest reasons why people around her call her naive. However, she is not naive, she is simply sweet. There are a lot of struggles she goes through, and there are a lot of characters in this book as well so it gets difficult to keep up with. However, I did enjoy it.I will definitely pick up Book 2 because this one really did have a lot of potential. Kudos to the author on a good try, I can definitely respect it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JD6W6YKL3937/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXK52W2#wasThisHelpful","R2JD6W6YKL3937","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purple Hearts, by Paul Kelso, was an excellent read overall. It was well written, easy to follow, and highly enjoyable. From start to finish, I did not want to put it down until I reached the last page. The way that the author wrote the story, it almost felt like it was a non fiction instead of a fiction. Quite a few times I had to remind myself that this isn't based on a true story.Main character Carl Donner was fabulous, and definitely relatable. I found him to be very funny and well developed as the story went on.  Carl Donner is a 34 year old Vietnam Veteran, now living in America in 1982. He is a folk singer currently looking for gigs, even though he can't seem to get enough of good ones. On top of that, he is on the hunt to figure out what happened to his mother, who mysteriously died. In his search, secrets are revealed and the truth becomes more clear. One of the biggest pieces of dirt? Carl is actually the love child of President Ronald Reagan!Interesting read, couldnt put it down, five stars all the way! Definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8YBT2JU2CNIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153G56BS#wasThisHelpful","R8YBT2JU2CNIK","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being an elementary school teacher, I am constantly in search of a good book for the classroom. I like things that are a bit out of the box; not to similar to the major authors on the market. Tess and the Giggle Pajamas, by Sheryll Raye, is probably one of the best ones I've read in a long time. Such a funny read, easy to understand, and really helps with their comprehension. The day that I brought this book to the classroom and read it, they couldn't get enough of it. I've had to read it about 5 times since purchase.This particular book is about a little girl named Tess who has a BIG personality. Her worst nightmare is getting dressed; how is she possibly going to manage that one? I can tell you one thing; it's going to end up being a big laugh! The kids couldn't stop giggling, and neither could I.Can't wait to see what other silly adventures Tess can get herself into!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPMCA4587HXPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D1UGMM#wasThisHelpful","RPMCA4587HXPW","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PALLBEARERS AND GAMBLERS, by Michael Cruit, had everything in it to help me escape from my life for a little while. It was an exciting, heart pumping, edge of your seat kind of a read. It was extremely well written, quick paced, and the characters just sucked me right in. It was a bit different than what I usually read, but sometimes different is better, and that was the case with this one.Main character Michael Dibiso just returns back home from Vietnam. He is assigned to Honor Guard as a pallbearer for his fallen brethren. This is no easy position, however. Even the strongest man on earth would turn into the most bitter after dealing with this position. In the midst of all of this, his family has ties in the Chicago Mafia, which makes things a lot trickier than they already are. Seven million dollars now comes into question. With so much happening, it was extremely difficult to put this one down for even a second.I enjoyed it, and look forward to reading more by Michael Cruit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9GFHJ97EZ9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3IHP6Q#wasThisHelpful","RS9GFHJ97EZ9X","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amarantox, by Tam Linsey, is the Prequel to the Botanicaust Series. Having read the series, I must say that I am very impressed by the writing of Linsey. She truly knows how to capture your attention, and leaves you pondering for long after you are finished reading the book. This was a very powerful type of a read, that affected me in a way. People have their own theories on how the world will end, but Linsey's vision is much darker than most could ever come up with.I don't want to give too much away in terms of plot, but the main idea of this story is about a womans fight against big businesses that threaten to negatively influence the planet in which we live. It's not an easy struggle for her, as she is only one person against a huge mission, but she is determined to get it done.There is so much more to the storyline than just that, but It's a definite must read.

"Lady Grace & the War for a New World: A Paranormal Adventure, is Book 2 in the Earth's End series. Author Sandy Nathan has been doing an excellent job in this series, truly knowing how to keep readers on edge from start to finish. This is not your average ""fantasy"" type of read; there are so many more elements to it than that. It is filled with action and suspense that will get your heart pumping. The character development in this particular novel really did blow me away. The main question posed in this novel is, is there a way to recover a society that is violent and troubled? So much turmoil goes on, how do we possibly redeem it? Lady Grace shows us that it is possible, but it takes some effort and dedication.

"Triangle of Death, by Michael Levine, definitely takes you on a wild thrill ride. Even though Levine has pretty much lived this type of life, Triangle of Death is a fictional story based on what he's seen and been around during his career. However,he takes his experiences to create a spy saga unlike any other that I've read. At times, I wondered if this actually is a non fiction read because most of it sounds like it could really be happening, as unbelievable as that sound. There is so much action and suspense in here, you will have a very difficult time putting it down. It is a definite thought provoking read, which will probably keep you up at night.

"The Conversion Prophecy, by Michael Solomon, is an International Thriller that I had a lot of trouble putting down. It's action packed and really has a way of capturing your attention on every page. This was an extremely well written novel, that was very believable. It takes the current events of our times and makes a major conspiracy out of them. Right now were living in a scary type of the world, and Solomon poses a question: what if Islam was to take over the world? What kind of society would we be living in? By the end of reading it, I felt like the novel could be a real life, non fiction kind of a read - scary but true.

"Michael Levine did an excellent job with Deep Cover. This is a true account of an international drug sting operation that went on. The operation ended up going very wrong, and deeply effected the lives and families of everyone involved, along with the US Government itself. I don't want to get too much more into it because I feel as if this is a book worth reading, but I do want to stress the fact that Levine did an excellent job with it overall. It is well written, extremely informative, and shares a lot of information about what goes on pertaining to the ""War on Drugs"". Maybe of us are still so clueless about it, but It's time that we open our eyes to it and understand. Something seriously needs to change in our Government, and Levine deserves a lot of kudos for having the courage to come out and write about what exactly is happening all around us.

"I picked up the Go-Getter Guy Secrets To Successful Dates, by Titania Hudson, just for the entertainment value of it. However, I was really impressed by it, as it contains a lot of very useful tips on being that man that every woman wants to have. I feel as if most men are completely clueless when it comes to women; some outright have no idea how to even approach them. Others struggle with how to keep a woman for the long term, and are constantly wondering why their relationships don't work out. This book is broken down into different chapters, and goes into in depth detail on how to attract, and keep, the women that you want. It is well written, straight forward, and easy to follow. It's definitely recommended to any and all males, regardless of what you think about yourself in terms of relationships.

"Wow, what an interesting read! The Apache Black Missile, by Joseph Groth, succeeded all of my expectations. I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into when I jumped into it, but I was pleasantly surprised with what I ended up with. This is a story about an international disaster that is just lurking in the shadows. Even though it is a fictitious read, I got so immersed into it that it felt like real life. It's written in such a believable way, you almost can't believe that it didn't really happen. Everything you could want in a good read is in this one; suspense, action, and a lot of thrill and mystery. There was also a lot of diversity taking place as well, which made it even more enjoyable.

"Wow, what a thrill this story was! The Test, by B.A. Sherman, is Book 1 in The Greg Dorn Series. What a great way to start this series off. It was heart pumping, exciting, and thrilling from beginning to end. So many twists and turns that I did not see coming, and the ending left me yearning for more.In a small town in Kansas, 17 year old boy Greg has to deal with his fair share of tragedy. Both his mother and sister lose their lives in a car accident, that was caused by a mental patient. He doesn't know where to turn after this, but one thing remains: he is full of anger towards road rage drivers. This rage results in Greg turning to the police force, becoming a cop. Once he takes this step in his life, things start to look a bit brighter for him. He falls in love and marries his high school sweetheart. They move to Denver, where Greg finds a job as a cop there as well. However, something stirs up inside of him and his repressed anger comes out in the worst way possible. He now has a strong desire to kill. This causes him to lose everything; including his family.

"An Imperfect Union is truly what this book is all about. Author Georgiann Baldino writes a story that could of actually happened in real life, during the American Civil War. She has a passion for History, and has written many novels pertaining to the subject, along with travel and suspense. I feel as if this particular novel represents all three of those categories, into one. I found the two main characters to riveting and exciting, and they had excellent chemistry together. Dr. Fred Dudley is a surgeon on the front line of the war. Cornelia Hancock is a nurse. The two of them come together through witnessing tragedy and many wounds. They learn to lean on each other through the hard times. What I liked best about this novel is that it truly does have elements of being historical non-fiction, even though the characters are fiction. Reading through, at times I felt as if these were real people and this was actually happening. I connected well with them, and found them to be extremely relatable. This was an excellent read, one that I would truly recommend to any and all historical fiction buffs.

"At The Sharp End of Lightning, by NR Bates, is a pretty interesting story that combines a lot of different things. It can be difficult to keep up if you don't follow along closely, but I found it to be pretty fascinating overall. A lot of research has been put into this by the author, which is extremely evident. I always appreciate it when an author takes the time to do their research before writing a novel like this.This is more than just an average science novel about the ocean. It's also science fiction with a bit of fantasy involved in it as well. Main character Yalara Narika is a sea sprite in desperate search for her lover in the never ending seas. Along with that storyline, there are other elements mixed in; sacrifice, losing a loved one, dealing with disabilities, and of course, climate change.

I have been dying for a good detective book for ages now, and finally got my full with this one. It was intense, had me on the edge of my seat, and was just fun overall.

Who Knew (And When), did not disappoint me in the least. It was everything I expected, and more. I am sad to see this series come to an end, but I am delighted that I had a chance to discover it.

She has finally gained the confidence that she was always lacking, and feels at peace with her life - finally. However, she quickly comes to realize that not everything is as clear cut as it appeared to be. She will be disappointed, yet again. However, the ending of this one is slightly different than the other two - and that's all I'm going to say.I am so sad that this is the end of this wonderful series, but I am definitely going to keep me eyes out for more books by Proteau, because she has quickly become one of my favorite authors.

"A majority of people in the world have faced bullying at least once in their lives. Some of us are lucky enough to get away from it without any major scars, but some of us aren't so lucky. Bullying has become such a serious issue in today's world, and we need to become better aware of it so that we can help to make it stop. Some people view bullying as not a major big deal, but in reality, it causes a lot of psychological and emotional damage that stays with a person throughout their lifetime. A Ladder In The Dark, by Alan Eisenberg, is a first hand account of what the author had to go through in terms of bullying, and the after effects it had on him. He was faced with repeated childhood bullying, and this story is about his road from recovery. He makes us see that by telling his story, it is actually helping him to heal. When you keep traumatic events to yourself, they tend to eat you alive.This book is extremely relatable because most of us have been through similar situations as Eisenberg. Bullying comes in all forms, and doesn't only happen in childhood. There is workplace bullying that goes on, bullying among family members/friends, etc. This is an eye opening read that shows us what kind of damage is done by it, and how we can become more aware of what goes on around us to ensure that we never put anyone else in the situation that Eisenberg was in.I believe everyone needs to read this book, in order to gain a better understanding of a serious issue happening in our generation. Kudos to Eisenberg for being able to share his story with the world.

"Now What, by Wendiann, is the sequel to And When. I enjoyed And When SO much, I couldn't wait to pick this one up and read it. I am just as impressed with this one as I was with the first, which is a rarity. Wendiann has a lot of talent, and it really shows through in these two works. Such interesting story lines, believable characters, and great character development. I feel as if the main character is someone that I know personally.Jade Prency has been through a lot. She had to struggle through a discovery of a tumor, then her dad's diagnoses of a terminal illness, not to mention a dream relationship taking a turn for the worst. However, Jade is an extremely strong woman, and manages to pick herself up after each and every struggle. In this novel, Jade is a successful, best-selling Author, and the world seems to be on her fingertips. She is finally happy again, feeling as if the bad luck that she's been dealt with has finally come to an end. However, things are never quite that easy for Jade. The man who broke her heart reappears in her life, and she has no idea how to cope with it. It took her years to get over him, and just when she thought she finally had, there he is again. All of the memories came racing back to her, and she has no idea where to turn. The storyline just keeps getting better and better from there.Excellent writing overall! I am now a die hard fan of Wendiann, and can't wait for her next book to come out. These books just have a way of capturing my attention from start to finish. Five stars all the way, highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R399I4U40IUZ03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CR0DNBO#wasThisHelpful","R399I4U40IUZ03","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And When, by Wendiann Proteau, really took me by surprise. As soon as I read the description I knew this would be a book that I was going to enjoy, but I didn't realize how invested in it I was going to get. Such a unique story line that feels almost too real, it drew me in and didn't let me go until the very last page. This is a story of how the real world and the online world collide and become one.Main character Jade Prency has to overcome many obstacles, and deals with too many hardships. My heart broke for her throughout this novel, as the character herself felt very real. The doctor informs her that she has a tumor, which quickly turns her life upside down. However, devastation strikes her yet again when she finds out that her father has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. She can't cope with reality any longer, which is when she turns to the internet, in order to escape. The online world becomes an alternate reality for many people, and this is exactly what Jade engrossed herself into. She is able to hide her appearance, and quickly becomes friends with an online support community. She tries to stay away from the men, but one Brady Gibbs captures her attention. He quickly becomes her hero, helping her every step of the way with all that she's going through. However, not everything is quite as it seems, and yet again, Jade is faced with more challenges. Is Brady really too good to be true, or is he the real deal?I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it evoked a lot of emotions in me. I would definitely recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of reading in general, as I feel that it caters to most. Proteau is an excellent author, and I am truly excited to read more of her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZ5HVUATH2SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JTX6YU#wasThisHelpful","RHZ5HVUATH2SZ","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Monster Chase, by Marion A. Stahl, is a fascinating read that everyone should pick up. Even though it is a work of fiction, it focuses on our ailing health care system and the corruption that ensues behind the scenes. It's no secret that thing's aren't always as they appear, especially when it comes to our health care systems. I feel as if the struggles and hardships the main character in this book goes through are ones that real time physicians have to endure as well. This was a pretty dark read, but an important one as well.Main character Dr. Quaile is an excellent doctor, who takes her job seriously. She does everything right, treats her patients fairly, and somehow, gets the raw end of the deal. She makes sure she follows every rule and regulation set in place, in order to ensure that she will never be involved in a malpractice suit. However, she is ultimately forced to leave her practice due to health issues, and becomes the main target of a witch hunt. The powers to be will stop at nothing to make sure she loses her license to practice medicine. Due to the injustices that arise, Dr. Quaile's life quickly goes downhill, and she loses a lot. It's very sad, as well as eye opening because sadly, these things do happen in the real world.Once again, this is a work of fiction, but It's written in a way that Stahl probably has some first hand experience. We need to become better aware of what's happening around us, and the injustices that people are facing. Our health care system is failing, and if we don't have our facts, things will only get worse. I highly recommend this read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JDE7NN770JV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B0AGGY#wasThisHelpful","R7JDE7NN770JV","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drachen: A Thriller, is Book 1 in A Matthys Rossouw Pursuit series, by Brendan le Grange. This book was almost like being on a wild ride, not knowing what was going to happen next. Grange has an amazing way of throwing readers into loop after loop, action after action. It just didn't stop until the end, which is something that I can definitely appreciate. This book was so complex, there was a lot going on in it which made me unable to put it down. Excellent writing.The book starts out on a high note, and ends on one as well. Brett Rivera's main goal is to outrun a group of assassins who are being run by Kalev. Brett is fortunate enough to find the wreckage of a looted treasure ship, Drachen. Everyone has been searching for Drachen, but up until Brett, no one has managed to find it. However, she discovers that the treasure has already been looted, by clues are left behind as to who took it first.There are a lot of characters involved in this book, and they all have one goal: find the lost treasure. I love that the main character is a woman, as she is portrayed as a strong lead. The only word of caution before starting this one is: don't start it at night! It will be the quickest way to lose your entire night's sleep. Five stars all the way for a brilliant story, and I truly can't wait for the next one to come out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X65GOSK36Y80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0133U3HGC#wasThisHelpful","R1X65GOSK36Y80","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deception's Sins, by Karen Truesdell Riehl, is the mystery story that I have been waiting for for quite some time. This one is extremely well written, and stumped me quite a few times. The plot line is extremely interesting, and definitely well thought out. This is a sequel to Freedom's Sins, but in my opinion, you don't need to read both in order to figure them out. This is a great stand alone novel as well, even though I would also recommend Freedom's Sins since It's just as exciting as this one was.Main character Roger Sundbee lands on Deception Island after failing his tell all book about the residents of Freedom, Indiana. He was in desperate new of a new start, and this small little Island off the coast of Washington appeared to be the perfect place for that. However, a twist is thrown in when the coroner's body is discovered dead, and no one knows who did it. Roger was the last person to be seen with him, which makes him prime suspect number 1. Roger now has to clear himself, and figure out what really happened to the coroner. Brilliant writing, and I loved the development of Roger as well.Overall, I would highly recommend this one. It will definitely leave you at the edge of your seat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11VOGNUFZQCY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MVWKU0#wasThisHelpful","R11VOGNUFZQCY4","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Goddess of Fortune, by Andrew Blencowe, is one of the best books I've read in a long time. What makes it so interesting is, it poses the question of what would happen if certain things were changed during World War II? It's a very interesting take on a piece of history, and definitely left me wanting more.This is way more than just your typical war story. There is sex, politics, business, and strategy all involved as well. Some scenes were extremely erotic, which kept this so interesting. The people in power plot out strategies in order to positively boost their Country. There are secret alliances, a lot of lies and hidden secrets, along with betrayals. Louise was my favorite character in this book, due to the fact that she's only 24 years old and was smarter than most.If you are up for reading about a possible alternative to World War II, I would definitely give this one a chance. It was highly entertaining, and I am truly fascinated by Andrew Blencowe's writing style. Five stars all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSOTJFGIEGFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J08X51E#wasThisHelpful","R2RSOTJFGIEGFZ","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I begin my review, I just want to say something about the author, Firdevs Dede. I recently read another book by her, and was blown away by her writing style, and extensive knowledge. Her surrealist imagery is unlike any writing style that I've never seen done before. Her brilliance is astounding, and I do believe she will make it far in her writing career. I just finished reading DREAM Foundation, and was just as impressed as I was after reading the previous novel I read by her. DREAM Foundation is different, however. This one focuses on having a deep affection for art and human beings. It is about a woman who was about to give up on her dreams, due to difficult circumstances she had to overcome. Inspiration soon follows, and Nuala realizes just how important your passions are. The relationship between her and Patricia was very enduring, and truly helped Nuala along the way. This is a complex read but definitely a worthwhile one, and I would highly recommend it. I do plan on going back and reading some of Dede's earlier works, and I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PSL47GXF4NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060LDZIC#wasThisHelpful","R28PSL47GXF4NK","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ephiphany - THE GOLDING, by Sonya Deanna Terry, is a well written page turner. This is a unique kind of story, one that would be difficult to tell. Terry does an excellent job creating a story within a story, and it captured my attention almost from the beginning. I loved the plot, the characters, and the overall feel of the novel.Main character Rosetta Melki is a part time tarot card reader. She has a teenage daughter named Izzie, who also plays a big part in the story. Things get interesting when Rosetta joins a reading group and gets more sucked into the novel, (Our True Ancient History), than she ever imagined would be possible. This fictional story comes alive, and the two stories in Ephiphany play out together, which is a concept that I haven't seen done before. Our True Ancient History is filled with mystical creatures, such as dryads and fairy clans. Maleika an elf stars in this novel, and her and her son are able to travel into outer space. This is where it delves into the different realms and dream spheres. Rosetta is caught up in a mystery that needs to be solved.This was an easy to follow book that was fun to read and pretty fast paced. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and felt like I was in the novel with Rosetta. I would highly recommend this one to all reading fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36JFVZA8F27CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RF4A9YG#wasThisHelpful","R36JFVZA8F27CF","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awakenings, by Mary D. Brooks, is book 4 in the Interwined Souls series. Having read the previous 3, I knew what to expect and couldnt wait to dive into this one. This has been an excellent series that has truly drawn me in and left me wanting more by the end. Brooks has so much talent, Its almost unbelievable. Historical fiction is definitely on the tops of my favorite genre, and this entire series is one that I will never forget.In book 4, we see Eva and Zoe yet again. I love how the author writes for these characters, the development is great and you almost feel as if you know them personally. Eva and Zoe are the stars of this series; they met during World War II, on different ends of conflict. They fell in love, but their love isnt easy. They have faced so many challenges that threatened to tear them apart, but they stayed strong through each and every one, and stayed together. They become world travelers, and have lived in quite a few different locations. Eva has some secrets that are about to be uncovered, and we get to see how the two of them deal with those.Another great book in this series.

"Songs of the Deliverer, by Elvo Bucci, is a pretty touching story that is wonderfully written. As a Catholic myself who knows the entire history of the bible, I found this story to be enlightening. It poses the question: what would the world be like if Jesus was walking amongst us today? I have asked myself this many times, so it was great to read a story about what things may be like if that was the case. This is a very different take on an old story, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a believer in Jesus.Even though this is a work of fiction, each story and chapter focuses on the Gospel stories of Jesus. You get a chance to see him in a new light, which is very refreshing. Instead of being Jesus, however, he reappears as Emmanue. Very inspirational overall.Bucci did an excellent job with this story, and I got a lot out of it. I felt touched, and did feel a closer sense to Christ by reading this one. I recommend it to anyone of the religious faith; you wont be sorry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37WZKE5MKRCMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8T8788#wasThisHelpful","R37WZKE5MKRCMK","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Illuminarium, by Truth Devour, is book 1 in the Soliloquys Labyrinth Series. I must say, this series is off to a great start! I wasnt quite sure what to expect when I jumped into this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. I am not usually one to read urban fantasy types of books, but I read the description to this one and was instantly intrigued by it. It was thrilling and fun to read, and I cant wait for book 2.Main character Harper is forensic psychologist who has seen a lot of bad, but still has hope for peace and harmony in her own life. One day she comes across an owl, and decides to follow it. She stumbles upon a mysterious book in the woods, and just like that, her life changes. All of a sudden, she is stuck between good and evil. Because of her current state, she has to live on the run and constantly hide out.

"The Absolute Truth: Grace of God, by Amrik Binapal, is not a novel as others may perceive it to be. I do agree that from the cover, along with the description, it can be a bit misleading, but I gave it a chance and read it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Instead of being a novel, it is a collection of different poems and quotes. I happen to enjoy poetry and quotes, so I didnt mind it. However, if youre expecting an actual storyline, you wont find it here.Amrik Binapal is clearly a religious man, and it shows through each collection. I like how he breaks them down into sections; there is a social section, political, religious, etc. Each one has a theme of offering yourself up to God in one way or the other. As I was reading through each one, I did feel a bit powerful. These are inspirational writings, that can really touch your heart if you allow them to.

"Joseph Ray is one of the best authors that Ive come across in a long time. His writing is superb, way better than the rest. This particular Sons of Abraham collection is the entire series, composing of volumes 1, 2 and 3. At around 550 pages, this is a pretty long read, but worth every second of your time.The year is 3026. which is way more ahead in the future than most books in this particular genre. During the 2500s, mankind had issues with maintaining their populations, due to the fact that resources were quickly vanishing while the population continued to grow as a massive amount. When you have more people than you have food supply, the natural occurance is, people begin to starve. Even the most brilliant minds couldnt figure out this problem, so they decided to build something that would; the Cybers. The Cybers were built by scientists, and the first generation of them were able to solve the issues and save mankind.Over 500 years later, the human race is still facing some issues that they cant seem to solve on their own. The population is quickly dying out, and people are unable to feed themselves. New planets begin to arise and form their own civilization, learning from the mistakes of the Earth. However, with anything else, new planets also have their own set of problems to deal with. In come the Cybers, who once again are summoned to save the human race.A lot of action and suspense in this collection, but it kept me turning the pages for more. I was sad when Volume 3 was over, but in a good way.

"Time is Relative for a Knight of Time, by Brett Matthew Williams, is one of the best novels I've read in awhile. The story line was unique, and definitely different than what I first thought it would be when I jumped into it. It's one of those books that you can't put down until you reach the end. Very well done.Rolland Wright is a seventeen year old orphan, who is living out of his car in Woodland Hills, CA. Having a drunken father who abandoned him two years ago is hard enough, but trying to live an actual normal social life is even tougher. On top of that, his mother was murdered, which truly puts him in a state of being completely alone. One day he gets attacked by someone who claimed to of killed his father, and that's really where his life changes. He quickly realizes that he has the ability to slow down time, and he reverts back to the 19th century. Here, we get to see a lot of familiar characters, such as Joan of Arc and Jesse James. Rolland goes on a journey of his lifetime, trying to solve his mothers murder while falling in love, competing in battles, and finally finding a home in Eden.All in all, a lot was happening in this novel and I couldn't help but to be enchanted by it.

"First of all, I am extremely impressed by the writing of J.M. Taylor. You can just tell through this novel that he's an expert on this subject matter, and the story really comes alive. He has passion for what he is writing about, and that's the best part. One Stick and a Waco has a lot going for it, and keeps you fascinated until the very end. I am a huge history buff, so I enjoy reading anything and everything involving History. This is a story about World War II, and the military in general. Set in Europe, the story truly comes alive. The characters are fictitious, but are extremely relatable and make you feel as if you are along side with them. The best part is, there are dogs involved!Even though the characters are fiction, Taylor does an excellent job with keeping history alive. He got his facts right on this one, and most things in this book are spot on to what it was really like. That's the best that I enjoyed most of all.

"Blood Bond, by Alicia Ryan, is a paranormal vampire read. It is well written, extremely enjoyable, and a definite page turner. The characters were all extremely intriguing, and I couldn't help but to be sucked in by them. I wasn't too familiar with Alicia Ryan's other works, but after reading this one, I'm definitely going to have to look into her more.In Blood Bond, Roxanna Collins is stuck in a rot. She's a Vegas singer, but feels as if her career is going nowhere. Everything suddenly changes for her, when she's sucked back in time by a vampire to Regency England. Darren enters her life, trying his best to convince her that vampires actually do exist. He wants to be with her desperately, but she's more focused on becoming a singer in a gentleman's club. Phillip Branham gets thrown into the mix, and he's willing to do anything for Roxanna. This is where the ultimate love triangle comes into play, and Roxanne must choose between the two - or try to have them both.The time travel aspect of this novel made it even more enjoyable to me than other novels in this genre.

"Carla Prince has done it again! I absolutely loved her first novel, and enjoyed this one just as much. These are such quick reads (mainly due to the fact that I get addicted and won't quit until I'm finished). I love the fact that both novels have animals in them, more specifically, dogs. The dog plays a pretty huge role in Love in a cala, because he's how Tessa and Luke meet. These two have SO much chemistry together, It's unbelievable. Tessa doesn't even want a man since she's been so burnt in the past. Luke would NEVER give someone like Tessa a chance. Yet they meet, and sparks fly. I love reading stories with substance to them, and this one does have a lot of substance. Tessa actually helps Luke along the way to become a better person than who he is. Excellent all around, really did not want to put this one down. Five stars all the way. If you're a romance junkie the way that I am, then you definitely need to read Love in a cala.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1UBD769T3JI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NHQSLQ#wasThisHelpful","RL1UBD769T3JI","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, this book really did make me feel good! I have been going through some difficult times lately, so I look for books that will help to cheer me up a bit. This one definitely did it. I appreciate Carla Prince's writing style; It's fresh. Love in a boat is a Mediterranean Romance novel that will keep you wanting more. It's definitely a romance novel, but not your typical type of romance. The writing for both of the main characters is great! Each has their own unique personality, and after awhile, you'll feel as if you're friends with them. Kate and Flynn really have nothing in common, expect for both enjoying boats. Kate has a passion for old boats, and Flynn owns a high luxury yacht. They are complete opposites of each other, but you know what they say, opposites attract.

"The Blue African, by L.W. Samuelson, was a different kind of read for me. Completely unexpected and something I don't normally read, I found it to be incredibly eye opening. The author intended the storyline for this novel to be different than what it actually came out to be; a little fact that I appreciated.This book is part historical, part science fiction, and part religious. I think all three of these elements combined makes for one excellent read. Like I said, I don't normally read books like this, but I was surprised as to how sucked in I got after chapter one. This is a novel with a purpose, and a message to be told. You definitely need to read this one with an open mind, but I promise, you will gain a lot from it and come to appreciate it for what it is.I won't give too much away, but I will say that even after reading this one, I am still thinking about it. L.W. Samuelson did an excellent job, and It's evident that he is filled with talent. I highly recommend it to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41GLY5CD6R7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036TH5WS#wasThisHelpful","R41GLY5CD6R7P","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right to Kill, by Jim McGinty, is a touching read that I believe everyone should take the time to read. It really touched me, but that could be because my Grandfather was part of the Vietnam war. This is a story about what marine life is all about, and how it effects those poor people who suffer. As the author states, war was not the same way back then as it is now. There was no outpouring of support for our soldiers, but instead, there were protests against them. It was really a different way of life, and the mentality of people was not so much like it is today.This story focuses on Sean Cercone; a man who puts his entire life on hold in order to serve. During a leave period, he meets and falls in love with a woman named Sandy Gold. After she confronts an antiwar activist at college, tragedy begins to happen. Sean begins to lose his entire hope and faith in humanity, especially after learning about what's happening back home. He is a broken spirit, at the point of no return. This is where people begin to pitch him to try and help him rebuild his life yet again, and gain a sense of hope.This was extremely touching, and I would highly recommend it. McGinty did an excellent job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J4NQ82AAVV54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARAQS86#wasThisHelpful","R2J4NQ82AAVV54","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read so many dating books in the past, but nothing has even come close to The Love Magnet Rules, by Chad Stone. Everyone should read this book, regardless if you're in a relationship or not. There are so many helpful tips in this one that will not only enlighten you, but give you the skills and confidence that you need in order to have a successful relationship.As we all know, relationships are tough. We all want love, that is just reality. Most of us are able to find it, but It's the keeping it part that poses the biggest challenge. I think the most important thing that Stone stresses about is not just the act of falling in love, but the act of falling in love with the right person for you. In order for love to last, you need to be able to find it with a person who is perfectly suited for you. The tips being portrayed in this are extremely straight forward and easy to follow. He teaches you how to become a love magnet, so to speak, and how to keep that energy alive.I thoroughly enjoyed this one, and would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTKV1CIORR6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R6H61W#wasThisHelpful","RCTKV1CIORR6U","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erotic Encounters, by Robyn Ooh, definitely took me by surprise. It's a very short read, but a good one at that. In most cases, erotica's don't need to be very long; short and simple is what works best. This is a pretty hot read, with a lot of expressive, and ""explosive"" scenes. There was a bit of a storyline behind it as well, which I found to be equally as interesting.Roxy has always been faithful to her cheating girlfriend. However, everyone reaches a breaking point and Roxy is reaching hers when she finds out that she's cheating yet again. She finally decides it's time to start anew, and teach her cheating ex a lesson during the process. I enjoyed the entire scenario a lot, and really wanted more when it was over. In story two, Sam, a butch, is newly single and ready to have some fun. She embraces her new status by getting a piercing. Kiara enters, and is about to take Sam on a wild ride, one unlike any that she's ever been on before.Both of these stories had everything that a perfect erotica should contain. I found them to be equally as enjoyable, and I can't wait to see what Robyn Ooh has to offer next. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PJI8SXP4Q54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KAM4GQ#wasThisHelpful","R10PJI8SXP4Q54","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenten Reflections, by Milton E. Lopes, is a very interesting read. If you're even a tiny bit spiritual, this is definitely one that you're going to want to look into a bit. I found it to be extremely enlightening and fulfilling; not to mention, well written and easy to follow. This is not just strictly a spiritual novel either, which is something I appreciate. There's also a lot to do with philosophies, Shakespeare, etc. I believe that if you have an open mind, this could be a book for anyone to follow.If you have ever had a difficult time period in your life (which most of us have), then you will understand exactly where the author is coming from. The main reason I purchased this one was because I have been looking for ways to be a bit more spiritual in my life. It goes into detail about the historics behind Lent, and why it started and what it really means. The book poses questions that you will need to think long and hard about before answering; I am still pondering those questions.I enjoyed this thoroughly, and will be using it to refer back to whenever I hit some rough patches in my life. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MYLAQ6TK6HMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ERQBRI#wasThisHelpful","R3MYLAQ6TK6HMX","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, what a mystery! Queensboro, by Thomas Drago, will absolutely suck you right in! A good mystery novel is hard to come by, but this one definitely exceeded my expectations by a lot. It's more than just a good mystery novel; it also contains elements of suspense, crime, and horror. It wasn't so horrific that I was anxious reading it, but it had an excellent balance that wanted me to just keep on reading. There was also a supernatural feel to it, which I found refreshing.Ashley Smith is the brightest student in her 4th grade class at Crow Creek Elementary. She volunteers for the task of line leader, is the captain of the book club, spelling bee champion, and will never be absent from school. She is the dream student, along with the perfect child any parent could ever ask for. One morning, gravedigger Schreck, snatches her from a bus stop. Sheriff Brad Gleason immediately steps in to help aid the search effort for Ashley, but more chaos is erupting. Several locals are being killed in the woods. Mrs. Scott and Curly both witness these attacks, and are absolutely shocked by what they see. The chase ends up leading all the way to Queensboro, which is a town along the Haw River. It's also home to a medical research lab which is run by Margaret Ganis. Due to her appearance, she is nicknamed Red Queen. The main question is, how does she tie into this story and where is all of this bad coming from? Will Ashley ever be found? These are questions that had me turning the page as the story went on.I enjoyed the ending a lot! There was still a bit of mystery involved, which proves that there will probably be a 2nd part to this story - I hope so, anyway. Definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSVIL63D2Y1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692411275#wasThisHelpful","R1JSVIL63D2Y1O","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Silent Swing, by Robert Fowler, really did touch me a lot. It was a beautiful story with a lot of vivid scenes and vibrant character development. I wasn't really expecting what I got after reading this novel, but I mean that in the best way possible. This one really took me by surprise, and had me thinking about it long after I was finished reading it. Both the pacing and the balance of this novel kept me interested and engaged, and I'm beyond grateful that I stumbled across it.Jimmy Carter, recently divorced, decides to travel to Tuscany to sell the family Villa. Shortly after arriving, he meets Carla (a 19 year old girl), who completely takes him by surprise. Immediately, he is captivated by her. The issue with Carla is, she is pregnant, and the father of the baby died in a motorcycle accident. Jimmy is determined to find out everything about her, and he digs deep. He finds out her baby father's name is Salvadore, who was a hero in the village. It doesn't make sense to Jimmy why the two of them would be together, considering the fact that they seemed to be complete opposites. The story between the two of them is told from Carla's flashbacks, and also the bar owner who Jimmy comes across. What readers will be most surprised about is the secret that Carla is holding inside of her.I was definitely surprised by the twist in the book, I love when authors can take a usual type of story and turn it into something more unique. I give a lot of credit to Fowler, who drew me right in and didn't let me go until the very end. Five stars all the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIQXSDUZUCGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ4Z8TS#wasThisHelpful","RIIQXSDUZUCGW","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bar Nights: The Mire Man Triology Book 1, by Dave Matthes, is an excellent debut novel to this collection. It contains elements of intrigue, drama, and a bit of tragedy as well. This is not an uplifting story by any means; in fact, Its quite sad. However, the characters are extremely interesting, and the storyline just sucks you right in. I couldnt seem to put this one down and by the end, I was wishing Book 2 would be released already.Main character Arlo has had enough. He walks in to find his wife sleeping with another man, and is pretty much fed up with the way his life is turning out. He decides he needs an escape, so he abandons his wife, out of control teenaged daughter and her fiance, and his job all behind and hits the road. Shortly after leaving, his car dies on him, leaving him stranded without many options. He decides to stay in a room for rent above a dive bar called Purgatory, and things start to get interesting. He takes a job working in the bar in order to pay off his rent. One night, he wanders off into the night and gets hit by many realizations; one of which, why he ended up in a place called Purgatory.I dont want to give too much away, but It gets pretty intense after that. Matthes does an excellent job with this novel, and I commend him greatly. I truly cant wait for Book 2 of this trilogy to be released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DV9UNE9IU6YL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4W1RL0#wasThisHelpful","R1DV9UNE9IU6YL","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rational Polemics, by Richard Todd Devens is definitely a different kind of a read. You have to jump into this one with an open mind, but I promise it will be worth it. I found it to be extremely interesting and engaging as well, and I did learn a lot from it. Devens has a unique take on a number of different topics, and I found his voice to be refreshing.You need an open mind when it comes to this one because Devends delves into a lot of different controversial issues. You need to be able to take in alternative viewpoints to certain subject matters, such as religion, politics, and performance enhancing drugs. These are topics that we all have our own opinions on, but it never hurts to read about, or experience, other viewpoints. Even though some parts of this book made me annoyed at times, I couldnt help but to shake my head on a lot of points that Devens brings up, a lot of which makes sense.If youre willing to be open minded and get new ideas on topics that you think you know everything about, then Rational Polemics is definitely one worth reading. I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUJ0D8SWDNOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D91DNUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TUJ0D8SWDNOZ","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off let me start out by saying that I am a fan of William Graham and his writing. I have read The Red Planet novellas, and have been absolutely fascinated by them. When I saw that he wrote a different kind of novel, entiled Greenfields: A Novella, I knew I just had to have it. As I expected, Its a wonderful novel that kept me captivated from start to finish. This is another science fiction, which is something that I thoroughly enjoy.I love the characters in this one. We have James and Helena, whom we follow throughout the story. The two of them and their family struggle to live in a world that isnt exactly just; unless you are a wealthy Titan, youre life isnt worth too much. This relates so much to our modern day society, unfortunately. Thats why I found the premise so interesting, because Its almost reality like.I loved the imaginery in this novel, the character descriptions provided, and the way that the story just jumps out at you. I felt like I was in the novel as a part of James and Helenas family throughout the whole story.

"Franklin Bean Secrets of the Bay is book 2 in the Franklin Bean series, and another one on the top of my daughters list of favorite books. This entire series is wonderful, and incredibly adorable as well. Franklin Bean, his buddy Kirby and superhero Pancho Frijoles are back to save the day yet again. The mystery this time is, why isn't Franklin Bean ever around at the same time as Pancho Frijoles is? That's the main mystery in this book that my daughter loves to try and figure out. I love the fact that this story helps her to use her imagination to come up with different scenarios. I also love the fact that these books revolve around the fact that bullies are bad. John faces the bullies in both of these books, and It's up to the superheros to save the day. Love the concept, the pictures, and the characters.

"F.O.R.C.E., by Sam B Miller II, was such a fantastic and refreshing Sci/Fi read. Being a huge fan of this genre, I have a lot of knowledge and experience when it comes to this topic, and I found this book to be mind blowing. Miller puts a new spin on the average alien invasion subject, and by the end, I definitely wanted more. I love the fact that in the opening of this book, Miller delves into a real unsolved mystery that most people will be familiar with. That gives this novel more of an actual feel, as opposed to just another science fiction read.All of the characters in this one are intriguing, my favorite being Whatsit. Earth's future is threatened, but Earth has a chance to plan a response in order to stop any threats from happening. There are a lot of secrets involved here, not to mention planning and strategizing. A special group of people are chosen to save humanity from an invasion, and they will pull out all the stops to make that happen.

"The Angel of Antioch, by Daniel Molyneux, was a new type of read for me. When I read the premise I knew I had to give it a try, but didn't expect it to be as good as it actually was.

This novel contains all the elements that a good novel should contain and for that, I'm giving it five stars.Elias is a stranger who shows up in the Great Synagogue. His great talent is his ability to recite the scripture from memory, and once he speaks to the assembly, he disappears. He reappears, recites the Scripture, and then disappears once more. By this point, people are extremely curious about him, trying to figure out who he may be and where he goes. Of course, some people think he's a complete fraud, but others people that he truly is a spiritual leader who should be worshiped.

"The Giggling Boy, by RaLynn LoneWalker, had me so intrigued that I couldnt seem to put this down. Im not too familar with this author, but I am very impressed by her writing style and ability to tie everything together into one.This is a story about children who have been stolen from their parents. What they face is pure horror; a parents worst nightmare. The ones who captured them have now forced them to go to a mission school, where they face cruel and unusual punishment. They are desperate for someone to rescue them and take them back to safety.Smiley, age 11, was also taken and forced to live at the mission school.

"Kill The Lights: A Mystery, by David Wahlberg was not what I expected when I jumped into it. Instead, it was an interesting take on your regular mystery story.

Ty Malone and his tenants are extremely concerned, since the property he owns is home to small time crooks.

"Secret Not Forgotten: The DNA of JESUS; Eighteen missing years, by Edward Morris, is a different type of read. Definitely very interested, and held my interest from the very first page up until the last. Morris did an excellent job with the writing of this book.This book focuses on a hypothesis about the missing 18 years of Jesuss life, during his ages of 12 to 30. Most of us dont know what happened during those years; how can we, when nothing has been documented? Professor Homer Paulus, the head of the DNA lab at the University of California, is the one who came up with this theory and is driven to prove it. Did Jesus stay in Nazareth, or did he travel to India and Tibet?Yes, some can say that this is a controversial novel, but I found it to be an interesting take on the life of Jesus. Its something new that we havent really seen done before, which is why I was into it as much as I was. Definitely out of the box, but worth reading nonetheless.

"Duilleog, by Donald D. Allan, is Book 1 in A New Druids Series. For being a debut novel, I was very impressed. This is a story about discovery, which is a topic that I can definitely appreciate. Many people may not remember what Druids means, but Druids basically are members of an educated professional class who live among the Celtic people during the Iron Age. This is a difficult subject matter to write about, due to the fact that It's unknown to a lot of people, with no much history to go by. Allan did an excellent job creating a storyline about Druids, and I commend him for that.Will Arbor is the main character in Duilleog, one that the author decided to focus heavily on. He is the last in the long line of druids, and he discovers that he has healing powers, which sets him off on his journey to discover himself and also to reclaim the past that was once his. During this journey, he comes across the Archbishop of the Church of the New Order whose main objective is to destroy the druids in order to regain control over the Realm of Turgany; on the other hand, the Protector of the Realm is committing horrible acts in order to ensure his authority stays in tact.During his journey, Will Arbor will not only see the bad and evil in the world; he will also come across great joy, a world of magic, beauty in nature, and of course, the druids who are now long gone. He is an amazing character, one that I grew to appreciate as I kept reading the book. The plot of this book is something original; something that most authors wouldn't dream of even touching upon. I found it to be fascinating and intriguing, and I truly do look forward for Book 2 to be released. Excellent writing, especially for a debut novel. I would highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1H2UXW3XUL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0103EAM6O#wasThisHelpful","RM1H2UXW3XUL9","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have finished Chasing Joseph, by Jamall Joseph D. Robinson, and I am at a loss of words. This is such a heart felt read, that pulled on my heart strings. This is a story that needed to be told, the author makes that very clear and I can't help but to agree. What people must remember is that there are always two sides of every story, and the media doesn't always get things right. If they want to run with a story to make a certain look bad, that's what they are going to do. Not all of it is factual, and not all of it is fair. The public should know every side of a story before making rash judgements against people, and crucifying them. Were all human, we all make mistakes. I think that's one reason why he felt the need to release his story; to share himself with all of us. I commend him for that, truly.Joseph feels trapped in his life. He made mistakes, and those mistakes follow him throughout his life. He refers many times to, ""Jamall"", the person in which he is trying to escape. Jamall made a lot of bad choices during his life, choices that he wishes he could undue but can't. He was sucked into a violent world, a world that his mother introduced him to. He had such a promising life for himself. He was a good boy, a boy who had a lot of great successes in his life. He was an associate of Yusuf Bey IV, and owner of Your Black Muslim Bakery. He was well respected by the community, until he took a turn into the dark side. He then became someone unrecognizable; between his scandals of welfare fraud and murder, somewhere, something went terribly wrong in his life. Joseph now recognizes and feels remorse for all that he has done in his past life, and everyday he is trying to rectify his mistakes. The problem is, the media does not print the positive sides of him, but instead, keeps on reflecting on the negatives.I do believe that there are some people in this world who can never be forgiven; however, there are those who truly do deserve our forgiveness because they see the wrongs that they have done and they work hard to try and correct them. Those people we must respect, not condemn. I am happy that I read this one, because it was truly insightful and gave me an alternate view of this man's life and views. It was touching, for sure. I would highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HSZZH3GE03PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EK2QAW#wasThisHelpful","R2HSZZH3GE03PX","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally, For Me is Book 1 in The Finally Book Duo series. This is Roseanne Burke's debut work, and I must say, I am very impressed. Her writing style is excellent, and the plot of this book sucked me right in. I love the characters and the interactions between them, I felt like I was a part of the book at times, engrossed with them.Lacey Singer is a victim of an abusive relationship, but finally breaks free of it. She moves to a new town to escape, where she really doesn't know anyone. She meets Ben Anderson, who is an incredibly handsome lawyer, and they instantly connect. Everything seems to be going perfect for Lacey now, but the only problem is, Ben is about to get engaged. This means that there are certain boundaries that can't be crossed, and they will have to remain just friends. However, this proves to be an extremely difficult task. I found myself rooting for the two of them the entire time.It's a very spicy read, but still manages to have an excellent storyline behind it. Kudos to Burke for an excellent debut novel; I will definitely be on the lookout for her next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H4SFTUG1E9X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWH9UAM#wasThisHelpful","R3H4SFTUG1E9X2","A3PVBZBG4FV89X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PVBZBG4FV89X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have been using this cup with my 20-month-old to try to teach him how to drink out of a cup.  He can drink well out of this cup, but he still has to suck a bit on the spout, so it's not really teaching him about drinking out of a regular cup. I would describe this as a half-way point between a traditional sippy cup and a regular cup. We are considering trying to make the holes in the spout bigger so that the liquid is more free-flowing. The tilted design is nice because it allows easy drinking without having to have a big head tilt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAHN4FFEQO0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHXJ01W#wasThisHelpful","R2XAHN4FFEQO0J","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is a summary of this book, straight from the introduction: ""I'll show you how to break the rules just enough ... to get on the road to great health, great energy, and great lives. This journey is all about eating well, moving well, chilling out, and feeling amazing without having to give up the things you really, truly don't want to live without. This approach is guilt free. Don't think kale, not coffee. Think kale and coffee.""There are short chapters on eating meat, exercise, sugar and carbs, salt, coffee, and alcohol. Each chapter is short enough to give you the very basics, but you won't get too much detail or science. All in all, the approach is about moderation and not overdoing it, including with eating that is too healthy (Extreme vegan diet) or exercise that is too intense. I liked this commonsense approach, and it was nice to have all of these topics handled in a brief, readable way. This book will not give you very much detail, though, or much scientific research, so if you're looking for something more in depth. Look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K8O57A93W3ON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946178#wasThisHelpful","R1K8O57A93W3ON","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:1.  Aesthetics:  This fitness monitor is able to be worn in several different ways.  It can be worn over a waistband or clipped onto a bra for a more subtle look, or there are four different colors of wrist bands that can be used to make this look more like a watch.  I love this flexibility, and the wristband is more attractive and sleeker (less bulky) than the other wrist monitors Ive used (Garmin/Jawbone).  All in all, this fitness monitor is the most attractive one available on the market, I think.2. The internal watch battery means this tracker doesnt need to be plugged in to recharge (unlike the Jawbone UP).  This is very convenient.3. Bluetooth technology:  The fitness monitor uploads to an app you can have on your phone.  Its wireless and automatic and very convenient.  Its also extremely easy to set up.Cons:1. The biggest and most important con is that this fitness monitor isnt very accurate.  It overcounts my steps and overestimates my sleep.  In order to test the accuracy, I wore this monitor at the exact same time that I wore my other trusted monitors (FitBit and Jawbone).  The FitBit and Jawbone recorded very similar numbers for steps and sleep, but the Nuyu added about 30% more steps and about 20% more sleep consistently.  Thats a big problem, at least for me.  I suppose if youre not very interested in actual numbers of steps but more interested in relative trends from day to day, then this monitor would be fine for you.  If youre trying to get the recommended number of 10,000 steps per day, though, youd better shoot for about 13,000 with the Nuyu.2. In order to read the time and number of steps (and other metrics) on the monitor, you have to swipe the face.  But the touch screen is not very sensitive, and it requires a very deliberate swipe in just the right place.  It took me some time to figure out how to read the screen reliably, and I thought my touch screen was broken at first.  It wasnt, but it isnt a very good touch screen.3. Lacks bells and whistles.  Keep in mind that this fitness monitor is at a lower price point, so youre not going to get very many bells and whistles.  If you want silent alarms or vibrations to remind you to be more active, or if you want to track number of workouts or glasses of water, then youll need to spend more and get a different monitor (like the Jawbone UP).","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R4UYDJAJRNHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1INOU6#wasThisHelpful","R1R4UYDJAJRNHJ","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Perhaps its a bit more like muesli than granola but without the satisfying chewiness of most mueslis.  With this quality, Id say this granola would be best as a topping for yogurt rather than eaten as a cereal with milk.  The other strange thing is that the Nutrition Facts seem to contain an error.  The Facts say that a serving is 1 cup and that contains 220 calories.  The Facts also say there are 6 servings per box.  None of this is true.  There is about 2-3 full cups in each box, so Im guessing the serving size should really be  or 1/3 cup.

However, it is very annoying that the pieces of this set fit together like puzzle pieces.  I understand that the manufacturer is trying to give greater flexibility.  The puzzle pieces can be rearranged in different ways to keep the toy interesting.

The main work is a novel titled ""Thirteen Ways of Looking,"" and it's about an 82-year-old trial court judge in New York City--Mr. Mendelssohn.  In my copy (an ARC), the novel is 143 pages long, so fairly slender but still a novel, I think.  This story is a beautiful character study of an elderly man and his struggle to come to terms with his failing body and unreliable mind.  I loved this story, and McCann's writing is sensitive and illuminating.  This novel is well worth reading and needn't be packaged with other stories to make it worthwhile (although the stories are great too).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BN8PGQSC2HU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812996720#wasThisHelpful","R2BN8PGQSC2HU2","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of things I like about this watch. For one thing, is pretty cool looking with the clear band and monochrome coloring. I also like how easy it is to use and program. It is very intuitive, and I did not even need to refer to the instruction booklet. There are a few odd things with this watch, however. It is bizarre to me that a quarter of the face is taken up with the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday,). Do people often forget what day of the week it is? I don't. That space could be better used for something else. Also, the indicator for Wednesday is ""Wen""... Clearly not how a native English speaker would indicate ""Wednesday"". My other complaint is that the beep sound that indicates changing settings is annoyingly loud. That is a small complaint, though do not expect to be able to adjust the settings when there are other people around (e.g., in an office setting). All in all, I am happy with this watch, particularly at this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVR4NYGFNS9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0QPTW4#wasThisHelpful","R2CVR4NYGFNS9E","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My dinosaur-crazed daughter was very excited to try putting these models together.  What actually happened, however, is that I put them together for her.  As others have noted, these models are fairly tricky to put together as many pieces look alike, and the instructions arent very clear at all.  I will say that my daughter really enjoyed watching me get quite frustrated while putting these together, so it was a good lesson for her in patience and perseverance.  Also, the finished models are quite nice, and she really enjoys playing with them. I like that the models arent made up of tiny, tiny pieces falling off all the time, so were both happy.

"My kids (ages 5 years and 18 months) love bubbles.  Because they always end up spilling the bubble solution every time we play with bubbles, Ive been wanting to get them a bubble container.  This bubble bucket is very sturdy and quite heavy for something made out of plastic.  That ensures that it is stable on the ground and doesnt tip over easily, which means we dont lose as much bubble solution.  The bucket comes with three bubble wands that insert into slits on the top of the bucket.  The fit is pretty tight (probably to avoid bubble spillage), so both of my kids sometimes have trouble getting the wands to go back into the bucket completely.  This takes a bit of coordination, and I often have to help out.  I think this problem could be solved by making the slits a bit bigger so the fit isnt as tight.  The result would be a little more bubble spillage, but its probably worth it.  Also, the wands themselves are not great at producing good bubbles.  They are sturdy but too thick.  All in all, this bucket is a good way to save bubble solution, but we prefer to use it with long, skinnier wands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K24OFJ6KG5XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007KGZG#wasThisHelpful","R1K24OFJ6KG5XR","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a bit of a thriller and a bit of a morality tale, mixed together with a touch of politics (mainly around the issue of drone warfare).  Owen Sheers explores how one bad decision based on incomplete information ripples outwards to cause a lot of other things to happen, some good and some bad.  Sheers very ingeniously manufactures suspense.  The method felt contrived and perhaps a bit cheap to me, but it did result in a very suspenseful read that kept me rushing through the pages.  My other complaint is that certain parts of this narrative are extremely far-fetched, but I was mostly able to set all that aside while reading and enjoying this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DUKIGGQV8DXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385529074#wasThisHelpful","R2DUKIGGQV8DXK","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Jot Script pen has been useful for turning my iPad into a good device for note taking.  The fine point of the pen makes it easy to make precision notes.  I also enjoy the functionality of the pen: it can erase and highlight and does a good job ignoring my palm when I am resting it on the iPad while writing.  There is a slight delay in the notes that I write, but that is a relatively small complaint.  My biggest complaint is that I have to resync the pen every time I want to use it, and that takes some time.  I wish I could skip that step.

"This was an interesting character study of an American housewife living with her husband in Switzerland.  For nine years, Anna has coasted along basically ignoring the fact that shes in another country.  She never manages to learn the language or make any real friends.  Her passivity is annoying but understandable too.

"I love Tom McCarthys books, so I was excited to read this new novel.  In Satin Island, the protagonist is an anthropologist employed by a big corporation, and he is tasked with the impossible project of writing a book that captures everything about our current times. This is an ideas book without a cohesive narrative.  Instead, there are real-life experiences mixed with dreams mixed with philosophical mental meanderings mixed with stories told by others.  Very postmodern.  Some parts captured my attention more than others.  Theres a chapter, for example, that tracks the protagonists thoughts as he crafts a speech in his head.  Its a masterful depiction of a thought process many of us have been through, and I loved it.  Other sections were too obscure or overblown.

"I love the tight fit of these earbuds.  They stay on through the most high-impact activities, even when there's plenty of sweating happening.  They also fit close enough to the head that I was able to wear them lying on my back for exercises like the chest press.  Sound quality is fine for a pair of exercise headphones.  For me, sound quality is usually hampered by slippage and movement, but that doesn't seem to happen with these earbuds.  My only complaint, and it's a pretty significant one, is that my ears get sore (the outer parts) after wearing these for more than an hour.  So, don't plan to run a marathon in these or anything like that.  For most usual workouts, they feel fine, and the tight slip-free fit is wore a bit of ear soreness to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ASP4CFNT8DV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0JYQ50#wasThisHelpful","R31ASP4CFNT8DV","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very difficult book to describe.  Its organized as a series of numbered paragraphs in sections titled A Few Things I Know About my Grandfather and A Few Things I Know About Myself.  Its not a traditional novel in the sense that theres very little narrative arc.  Its more of a close examination of the key episodes of a life.  The first-person narrator tells about his grandfather who survived Auschwitz, his father who has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimers, and his own childhood and adult struggles.  Im not sure exactly how he does it, but this protagonist manages to cram a great deal of the most important things about being a human into these slender 200 pages.  This book reaffirms the strong connection between who we are today and the parents we came from, even when we dont realize the connection ourselves.  This is a great antidote to the disjointedness of our modern lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEYSRM9MDPG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQQUW58#wasThisHelpful","R2LEYSRM9MDPG3","A2KIVODZRTGY4U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KIVODZRTGY4U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I appreciate that these gummy vitamins include high-quality ingredients and bio-available forms of vitamins.  The DHA is made from anchovies and sardines, which is a sustainable source that is generally low in mercury.  However, there are certain key nutrients lacking here, notably calcium and iron.  Also, there are a host of minerals that are absent (e.g. magnesium).  That means that to truly get everything you need from a multi-vitamin, youll need to take another one to supplement what is in these gummies.  As for the flavor, I find these to be rather vitamin-y tasting, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth.  Further, the serving size is 6 gummies, which add up to 50 calories.  If you were to eat an additional 50 calories per day without adjusting downwards your calorie intake, you would gain more than 7 pound per year.

The narrator is a writer who travels to Athens to make some extra money by teaching a writing seminar.

The biggest topics of conversation include relationships and all the many types of failure.  I found highlight-worthy ideas on nearly every page of this novel.

"Scharffen Berger Tasting Squares Assortment Gift Jar, 21.16 OunceThis four flavor assortment of wonderful chocolate squares will make a great gift for the holidays or the chocolate lover in your life. It is delivered in a beautiful display/serving jar with a brown, chocolate brown, ribbon. It is beautifully packaged for travel on delivery trucks. It is essentially secured in a cardboard brace and floats in the packing box. Its going to arrive in fine shape.For reference heres my rundown of the four flavors in the jar:Milk 41% Cacao; Soft to the bite, melts fairly rapidly and has a wonderful mouth feel. I feel no bitterness and just a very smooth chocolaty velvet in my mouth. A slight caramel note is there too.Semisweet 62% Cacao; A harder bite than Milk. It melts a touch slower and we are entering the dark realm. It is not as rich on the tongue but rather seems to make itself known further back in your mouth. An almost woodsy note and an excellent entry to dark chocolate if youre uses to standard supermarket candy bars.Bittersweet 70% Cacao; Bites a little softer than the semisweet, and melts a little smoother. It envelops your tongue with a joyous chocolate sensation. My favorite as Im sequentially tasting with palate cleansing and breaks. So far this one has the most intense chocolate feel and best texture and purest taste.Extra Dark 82%; This one has a hard bite and slow melt. Very intense dark taste. A hint of a burnt note that is pleasant. I taste a hint of cherry/fruit in the chocolate. It feels as if its going to the sides of your mouth as it melts. Contrary to the percentage I get a burst of sweetness as it is finished melting in my mouth. Maybe the most intense experience of the four varieties.I totally enjoyed tasting the four flavors and think the recipient will just be blown over. This is the gift for a chocolate lover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PGQS4NRNOJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116DEBFO#wasThisHelpful","R23PGQS4NRNOJL","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"San Francisco 49ers Stapler, NFL, Swingline 747, Staples 25 SheetsI still dont get why most staplers, including this one, dont come preloaded with a row of staples. Would it kill them to spring for a row, a half row? If you want to use this right away, be sure to have some staples ready to go. This is a nice stapler and it is available in all the NFL team colors and logo. So as the Football season gets into the Red-Zone you can be ready to root for your team at the office.It is an all steel constructed body sitting on a rubber base to protect your desk. It is very heavy duty and feels like a top quality build. It will go through 25 sheets but isnt power driven, you need to push down hard. It can be opened for flat tacking and you can spin the anvil for the flat open staple shape. It also has a peek hole to see when you are running low on staples. This is a top notch office product and a must have gift for the football fan in your life. Other than the missing staples, this is a great stapler with team pride.This Vine review product was not free but attained for a tax liability charge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXVIDN0NU3HC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SLAECU#wasThisHelpful","R1IXVIDN0NU3HC","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"iMobi4 Apple Watch Stand Docking Station & iPhone Holder Dual CradleI have a major problem with this charging stand. I ran into the same design flaw in another wooden stand from a different company. The space where the charging disk for the Apple Watch goes is both too tight and has no access hole from beneath to push up on the disk to remove it. This leads to a trapped disk and the only way to remove it is pull very hard on the cable or chisel away at the area around the disk or in my case with the wooden stand, both. I would up cosmetically ruining my charger that came with my Sport Watch. I bought a replacement from the Apple web site and the one the sent is ringed in chrome. This makes it ever so slightly wider which leads to the iMobi4 stand.It is made of plastic and lined with a soft material at the circle top. It is impossible to easily put in the disk. I reported this to the company and was instructed to push harder. I know where that goes and Im not damaging or destroying a second charger. This is a failed product. From my experience, if you do not see a finger hole below where the disk will seat, do not buy it. I do not recommend this product or any stand without an access hole.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19F7ST295JBIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011I9ZLYG#wasThisHelpful","R19F7ST295JBIT","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pomarks 4in1 Multi-function Business Pen, 32GB OTG USB Flash Drive with Micro USB Port, Stylus & Ballpoint Pen & Flash Light  BlackThis is a very good gift for the technology geek in your life. This pen does about everything this person would love to have all in one compact device. First its a pen (with a refill) for those times when you actually have to write something. Then its a stylus for use on your phone or tablet and thats going to be used more than the pen, for sure. Next its a thumb drive with 32GB of storage. Its double sided so it connects to a MicroUSB port or a standard port. Its also a LED flashlight. Could it do anymore? I think not, but it certainly does enough.It comes in black or white for your styling choice, mine is the black one and Im uploading a bunch of pictures. Like I mentioned it comes with an extra pen refill. I wish the stylus tip was replaceable but hopefully it will last a good long time. If it came with more refills, or a link to where more can be bought and a replaceable stylus, this would be perfect. Still, with the upcoming holiday season, as I write this, its beautifully packaged and will make a great gift.

"Codream Micro Perforated Stainless Steel Colander 5 Quart with HandlesI love my new colander. Ive been using plastic ones which the truth be said are on the flimsy side. This is a solid stainless steel colander and it is big and it is tough. It is wide with a large circular base so it is very stable in the sink. My main uses are for washing produce and straining pasta. It did those jobs perfectly. I took pictures of me washing grapes, Im posting them. The handles on the sides are big and easy to grip with or without kitchen gloves on. The massive amount of holes makes for quick draining but is more durable then the mesh type.It is a very fine addition to any kitchen and it will serve you well. The quality of construction is excellent. It isnt heavy at all, for its size. It is made entirely of 18/10 stainless steel so it will keep its good looks, long term.

"Jabra Eclipse HeadsetThe first thing I did was plug the charger in and made sure it and the headset were fully charged. In the box you get the charging dock, the headset, three more different sized gels, a MicroUSB charging cable and all the paperwork. When you then press the button on the bottom of the charger and put the headset in your ear, you are instructed to go to your phones Bluetooth menu and the pairing happens easily. All this worked well. I was also instructed to download the Jabra app. I did that and went through the settings and updated the firmware. Here you will also find the full manual and the ability to change the talking language of the headset.This is a very impressive Bluetooth headset, I just wished it worked better. It is unique in its design in that there are no buttons to press to do things. Instead, you get to tap the logo area ion the microphone bar. Great I thought, just tap or double tap to answer a call, summon Siri (I have an iPhone) or some other features. I tapped and tapped and sometimes I got one tap right and heard the lady tell me the battery level. Then I had success and actually got two taps right, Siri came up and I had her make a call. I called a friend and started testing the voice quality. At first my friend sounded very good and clear. Then after a while he was complaining of my voice digitizing. Then a little later he was digitizing on my side. We called back and forth and I went out of my home to change location. The digitizing continued until I placed the Eclipse back in the dock and went to the iPhone directly. Our connection was good the Eclipse was the source. It didnt happen all the time but was annoying enough to make it troublesome to use. Compound that with the wonky tapping system, the volume controlled by your phone not the device in your ear and always having to carry the charger to be able to turn it off. Im a bit frustrated.This should be a much better more reliable headset, Jabra has a good reputation. I just dont think this is as good as the price level deems it be. I think you may want to look further.Amazon Vine provided this demo unit for a tax liability fee, it is not free as listed in the green description.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SODJ0UIZF1YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014EUQ492#wasThisHelpful","R1SODJ0UIZF1YA","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Syllable D700 Bluetooth 4.1 in Ear HeadsetsI previously tested a similar headset to these. For whatever reason these sound better and fit me better, maybe a revision? They looked identical but seemingly arent. I was able to get a good fit for my ears and having three sets of buds helped. I liked that it came with three sizes. I got all the volume loudness I could hope for, high enough for pain, but I could level off to a good loud level. If you are getting a tinny sound you need to reseat the buds. They need to really seal in your ear canal. Once they do you get a rich and deep sound. Very good for this price point. Experiment with positioning and the different sized buds. I like the ear-hook design for stability on the ears. Also included is a MicroUSB short cable for charging.It comes in a nice package suitable for gifting. It certainly will make a great stocking stuffer for the upcoming season.

"Syllable A6 Necklace Neckband Running Wireless Bluetooth EarbudsThese earbuds are a decent performer but has some exclusions I have trouble overlooking. First the good. These earbuds are well built and have some unique features. The first one is the magnetic section that opens up to reveal the MicroUSB charging port. You open the magnet to wrap the cable cord around your neck. The earbuds go up to your ears and the control dongle/mic rests on your upper chest area. It wears fairly comfortable but this leads to my first issue. There is only one set of earbud covers included. So many now at least include three sets of different sizes I have to note this as an omission. If you usually use the mid-sized set you should be OK as they fit me and thats what I usually use. If you change out the normal standard ones you may want to look elsewhere.I then tested the sound quality and it was reasonably good for this price point. My second problem is here, I could not get the volume to increase to a loud level. Ive not had this issue in a long time and thought it might be my iPhone at first. I tested with another BT set and it was loud. The music I listened to sounded good but I always wanted more. I made some phone calls and for that it was loud enough. Its a generic Bluetooth and isnt specific to iPhone so I couldnt summon Siri but its not designed for that. If you have an iOS device you may want a more compatible set. Even so it worked for the basics of answering and disconnecting calls.Overall this is a decent but flawed earbud set. If the limitations dont phase you it has some unique features that are good.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFV8VF4PJ7HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R1S6LC#wasThisHelpful","RYFV8VF4PJ7HQ","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OtterBox DEFENDER iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus Case - Frustration-Free Packaging - BLACKI have an iPhone 6 Plus and previously tried the Otterbox Defender for it. I totally hated it and was hoping against hope that some revisions would be made to the version for the 6S+/6+ combo version. Sadly I cant see or feel any difference. Yes its very protective but it makes my 6+ feel even more gigantic than it actually is. If there is any difference it is only microscopic as the case is rated for both phones. I was so hoping it would be slimmed down yet still be protective. I still feel the space between the screen and the plastic cover. I never had any of these issues with the Defender for my iPhone 5. That one was trim and tight compared to this series. Im very sad. Im quoting my previous review as nothing has changed and I see no reason to say anything different other than the color is different and the packaging is a Frustration Free cardboard box that was more difficult to open than the standard Otterbox box.>>>I have had Otterbox Defenders on my iPhones since the 4. I like to trade in my phones after two years and want them to be as pristine as can be and those Defenders did their job very well. Now I have an iPhone 6+ and was disappointed that unlike my 5 the Defender was not ready to go on day one. I was also disheartened to learn that the 6+ Defender was going to cost seventy dollars? Thats twenty more than the regular Defender for the 6 or 5 or 4. {Its down to a more reasonable $60 list price}  Most Defenders come out at about the fifty dollar price point so Otterbox must be using gold infused silicon to make up the twenty dollar difference for what is essentially an extra ounce or two of plastic. Seems exorbitant to me. Luckily the price is dropping and Amazon had the Glacier color for thirty seven dollars, a much more reasonable price. My iPhone in the case weighs just under 10 ounces. But what really gets me is the size. It makes the 6+ huge! Oxymoronic, I know, but there is a tunnel leading to the speaker at the bottom, a tunnel. I know you can drop the iPhone from staggering heights and it will survive but my iPhone 5 was intentionally thrown across a room with a hard floor and no damage. That Defender was darn near svelte compared to this one and was very very protective.This version is curvier and I think thats why there is extra bulk. The covers on the ports are all curved and make for deep pockets to get through. Though I see that just about any connector will get access to the headphone jack and thats a good thing. Another improvement I can see from my 5 series is how the belt clip latches to the case. The old way was to latch through the silicone to the plastic, which wound up wearing out the silicone and Otterbox replaced a skin for me that became ugly. Now there is a notch in the silicon letting the snap pass right over the silicone and latch into the hard plastic. That should make for a cleaner and long term good looking edge.I have a lot of problems with this new case and dont think Im going to keep it. That will be the first Defender I didnt love and keep. First up, and many have said this, the screen protector is a nightmare. It rests above the screen and absolutely kills sensitivity of the screen and Ive been making more mistakes since I put on the case. An easy example is; start the Facebook app and try to quickly scroll down the list of posts. You can see the screen stop even as you are swiping on the screen. There is no contact to give the command. Typing is a pain and leaves way too much for Auto-Correct to handle.  There is also much more reflectivity and finger print smearing then the naked screen or when I had a glass shield on it. I had to remove the glass to fit the Defender. In a somewhat related problem, there is a double cover over the home button which doesnt let you feel the feedback of clicking the button. Also the area seems to especially like to attract air bubbles. So the button looks weird. Amazingly it can read my fingerprint just fine, so thats good.All three buttons are covered with button bumps on the main silicone body. The silicone is much stiffer than the 5 series I had previously. That makes for a very difficult button press. Ive tried a number of cases lately this is one of the worst for tactile feeling of the buttons, even compared to a previous Defender. Another fit and finish issue is the hard plastic shell. On my other Defenders the hard shell snaps tight around the iPhone then you slip the silicone around to complete the protection. That included the Defender 5 which was available before I had my iPhone 5.>>>An improvement I have noted on the new version is the tight fit is back, I previously complained, but removed the text above, about a poor fit. That was fixed. It is properly tight. I just wish it was a bit smaller and still as strong. Its just big and heavy and very clunky. I carry it on my belt, the main reason for a Defender and it just pulls down on the belt too much. I cannot recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IU37QIF117HK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7SX51Q#wasThisHelpful","R1IU37QIF117HK","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CeeOne Premium Micro USB Cables in Assorted LengthsIf youre like me theres never a cable around when you need one and when you finally find one its the wrong length. Well, too short is worse than too long but why not get a bunch instead of just one. For the price of one mid-length fancy cables, this CeeOne kit gets you a half dozen assorted basic cables.

One of these sizes almost always will do well by me.The quality of construction is very good. There are your basic rubber cables, not fancy braided ones, but CeeOne has those too.

"Proactiv+ Redness Relief Serum, 1.7 OunceThis expensive little tube worked well for me. I did put it in the fridge as the instructions say.

I also used it on my face in a Rosacea area that gives me problems. It did feel nice and I left the serum on for the prescribed ten minutes. You are only supposed to use this three times a week, so I assume its pretty strong. I rinsed with warm water after the time and I did feel better and less itchy. I think I might be put off by the cost and use cold compresses and appropriate lotions. Still this is an easy solution to a problem and the tube is very easy to use with the rotating top assembly.

"Stander Metro Car Handle Plus - 2 in 1 Automotive Standing Aid and Support Handle + Included FlashlightIf you are a driving senior or take care of a senior you want one of these in your car available for use. The metal end slips into the car door latch on the center post of the car. It then makes a strong leverage handle to push up against to help the senior or impaired person stand up or for that matter to balance and sit down. The surface is a very hard rubber and provides a good grip. The opposite end of this handle has a flashlight (batteries included) with a twist actuator. You tighten the lens cap to urn the LED light on and loosen to turn off. Its very handy if you drop things.The metal end can also be used to break a windows if you are trapped in the car. The only thing missing is a seat belt cutter but it probably was traded for the flashlight in the design stage. I would advise storing it in a center box or glove box as opposed to the little storage section at the bottom of many car doors. In a crash this could be a very dangerous projectile. Better keep it secured. If you are leaving the car then that door shelf is fine but upon reentering the car storage it securely.

I tested this Vive oral against the Vive Infrared Ear thermometer, my trusty Timex oral and an Exergen temporal scanner. After all my testing Im not sure if Im sick or well. Here are my results all taken twice all within a couple of minutes it took me to do the test.Vive Oral = 99.7, 99.6Vive Ear = 98.2, 98.2Timex Oral = 99.3, 98.8Exergen = 97.4, 97.0In terms of speed, the Vive Ear is the fastest, then the Timex then the Exergen and finally the Vive Oral. None took more than about 10 seconds. Only the Vive Ear gave the same temp moments apart. The Vive Oral gave the highest readings and the bell rang the fastest on the result. I dont know which to believe, to tell you the truth. To me the Exergen is the most difficult to use, the Vive Ear the easiest and quickest both orals about the same with the Timex being quicker of those two. I dont have a doctors office thermometer to meter against. Both Vive products are rated as guaranteed accurate but I found the Ear the more so of the two and the Oral to be the highest reading. I love the display on the Vive Ear thermometer. It is large clear and backlit in blue, best of the bunch. The Vive Oral is a large clear display but not backlit. In low light conditions thats a problem. The Ear comes with hard clear plastic protective holder the Ear comes with a zippered protective pouch. Both Vive thermometers came with batteries and are easy to replace when needed.Of the two Vive products I like the Ear best of all and am worried that the Oral may be reading high.

"Coolife Door Stopper [Free Hook+ Rubber]This door stop works great, as you can imagine. It is made of steel and has replaceable rubber treads. It also come with a stick on hook to keep it near the door you want to stop it with. It also hare a set of replacement rubber treads, a nice inclusion. The only problem I ran into is my main front door. The gap at the bottom is just too big. It swung right over the stop. So I will wait for the XL version for my front door.

"Attmu Silicone Pastry Mat with Measurements, Pastry Rolling Mat, Reusable Non-Stick Silicone Baking Mat, Set of 2, 2 ColorsI like to protect my counter top when prepping food. My most difficult chore was rolling out pizza dough. This Attmu silicone mat helps with both. While not a cutting surface, use a cutting board for that, it can stay on my counter top and protect the surface and has useful measurement markings that come in very handy. I especially like the circle markings for expanding sizes when I roll the pizza dough. If you have a full sized sheet pan this can line that and go right to the oven. I only have a half sheet pan.The quality and design are quite good and pleasing. It is very attractive on the counter and adds functionality. For me the blue goes with my kitchen best and will have a place there. The pink will be my backup. The price point is excellent considering the size and function.

"Aukey 3 in 1 Clip-on Cell Phone Camera Lens Kit, 180 Degree Fisheye Lens/ Wide Angle Lens/ 10 X Marco LensIve always bemoaned the fact that my iPhones have never had a good zoom lens. Now with this Aukey kit I can at least get some good wide shots and a really nice macro. You get two main lenses and two snap on holders and a cleaning cloth. Both main lenses have caps and there are very basic instructions. I wish the instructions were a bit clearer. It took me a bit to realize the macro lens had to be unscrewed from the wide lens. It was a Doh! moment for me.Once I had everything sorted out and the case removed from my iPhone 6+. Yes its a tight fit so most likely youll have to remove your case. A bumper may get away with staying on. It was very easy to snap on and position the lens, in the mount, to my iPhone. There is nothing to set just let the camera focus and take the shot. I am uploading a series of pictures. Most are outside shots just starting with the standard iPhone lens and then the fish eye and wide lens. I used the macro lens to shoot a penny. I need more practice but for a novice got decent to very good results. I see need for improvement in my shill level but I got some good results. I especially like my penny result.I think for the very reasonable cost and very good quality its a great choice. The only thing I wish was a soft carry bag so I can keep everything together in my pocket and protected. Ill just buy one in the usual places.

I was using a chrome cover from Ozaki Plated Apple Watch Case - OZAKI O!coat Wardrobe+ 2 in 1 Ultra Slim & Light Weight Case Set for Him. Coat Your Apple Watch Daily / Full Access to All Functions / Compatible with Apple Watch Sport 42 mm and liked the look. I wanted to make a complete white look for the watch and found this JETech case for my watch. I bought this as it was a no-brainer price and looked like what I wanted. It does look great to me, on my watch and really completes the look. It matches the ceramic band very nicely the only thing different is the matte finish vs. the shine of the ceramic. That said its as perfect as I was able to find and the budget wasnt broken. I saw some reviews that said it came off easily? I havent experienced that and think maybe they hit the watch hard enough to knock it off and the case protected it. Overall Im thrilled with the case and have gotten compliments on the look. The combination does attract compliments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P9F6PHLR09SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSI646Q#wasThisHelpful","R3P9F6PHLR09SH","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Protectif RFID Blocking Leather Wallet for MenI have a dilemma. I really like this wallet and love the RFID blocking feature. My problem is my old Joseph Abboud wallet holds more than this one can.

I now have a challenge I didnt want to face. I want the extra protection of RFID blocking, so Im going to have to trim back what I carry.The Protectif wallet is quite beautiful and smells great. I know the smell will go away with use but its nice now. It is a real leather wallet and is nicely packaged in a box suitable for gift giving.

"Fill N Save 2 Pack Reusable Carafe K-CupsI love how these smart companies are defeating the Green Mountain Evil Empire. I have a Keurig 2.0 machine that I got from the C warehouse membership store. I knew going in that there were compatibility issues but wanted C protection as I was more worried about the pump breaking as I was for compatibility. Well now thanks to EcoGreen Fill N Save I can make my carafe of coffee using any coffee I buy or grind. Orange (and purple) are the colors of freedom and these carafe cups are orange and take any coffee and fool the Keurig into brewing it.I love that they have a steel filter and are dishwasher safe. It is very easy to fill one with coffee, insert and brew. Now error messages and compatible with the favorites system too. I had some fine ground French Roast and used it for my testing. It worked perfectly and I found now grounds in my cup. Taste of the coffee is a function of the coffee and brewer so I wont rate that other than to say it was just fine. Im uploading some pictures to show that it worked with no errors. I cant recommend these orange cups highly enough.

"Philips Norelco Bg1026/60 Bodygroom 1100This is an OK Man-Groomer with the capability to trim lightly hairy guys. Its 1 AA battery powered so its not going to be that tough. It still works well for what it is. It is NOT for backs that are hairy. Well, not without someone to help you and if your back isnt too hairy. It will roll along your body in two directions so you dont have to flip it. It isnt too noisy so it isnt unpleasant to use. This product is guilty, though, of one of my top pet peeves. It is a device with little accessory parts but no case or bag to hold them in so you dont lose them. I do like the tether to secure it to your wrist.

Oh I get it, take the milk butter vanilla starting place and add high fructose corn syrup and palm kernel oil as well as a bunch of unpronounceables. I get it, we made it cheaper and mass producible.Still, they do taste good and came well packaged so if you are shipping it during the holidays it will arrive in great shape.

On top of the physical beauty of the cable, it is slimmer by not having the ferrite filters on each end. The jacket of the cable is both smooth and rough so it wont catch or kink on anything.

My previous cable was a thick rubber cable with ferrite so this one just works better.When all the connecting is done the picture produced on my TV is both rich and beautiful.

There are two red LEDs on this one and they are on the bright side. Its not my favorite feature but it wasnt terrible either. Just a note if your plug is at or near eye level.

"Kartice(TM) Luxury Ceramic Bracelet Watch Band Strap Replacement Wrist Band For Apple Watch & Sport & Edition, White 42mmI knew this band for the Apple Watch was special on the very first day I wore it.  I was asked how I liked my Apple Watch and how beautiful the ceramic band was. They spotted it as a ceramic band and the white color caught the eye even faster than the watch. When I said it wasnt an Apple band for the watch that was even more of a conversation starter. If you want to start conversations, this will help. Ive always wanted a Junghans ceramic watch and this band was my way of getting close.When I received the band, it came in a nice cardboard box that protected it well. It also comes with two tools. One tightens the screws on the slide in mount, the other is to remove and replace links. Use this metal tool for the links, not the plastic pin pusher you may already have. All the pins are spring-loaded and can be pushed through an access hole and release a link. Then carefully remove the link and the mini link the same way. Use the flat side to depress a spring end to reposition the links to connect. It was very easy to do once I played with it carefully.After I took out two links, one on each side, it fit me perfectly. I love the beautiful look and color of the links and how smooth they feel. I have a Space Gray Sport model watch. I used a chromed face edge cover to complete the look I wanted. Im uploading a series of pictures of this beautiful bracelet band for the watch. To me its a stunner and very unique.

Well my fears came true as the Amazon pouch was delivered warm. It also wasnt as the 15 pack would be delivered in a box.I opened the pouch then the Hershey's bag. Yeah, they were all really soft and misshaped. Well hoping that it wasnt spoiled from the heat I put it in the fridge. The next day I found that the individually wrapped candies had hardened. So, I gave one a go. It was delicious and hard but chewy. I did like it but noticed in my mouth that it wasnt a formed shape anymore.

"Poetic [Duo Lite] Apple Watch 42mm Case Gold/Dark BlueI was looking for a cover for my Apple Watch Sport in space Gray. I have a gold and stainless metal band I was looking to match or compliment.

Until then Im hunting for matches. This Poetic case is very nice looking, a lighter gold with a blue highlight, it looks snazzy and matches up to my band. See the pictures Im uploading. It is also a protective cover so thats good too, and came with two screen shields.  I like it a lot. That it also has a three year warranty, doesnt hurt on the plus factor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTCUB3GTGC3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI7QUPU#wasThisHelpful","R1JTCUB3GTGC3J","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BRI Nutrition L-Tryptophan - 1500mg Servings - 120 Count 500 mg per Veggie CapsulesWhen I first got the offer to review this bottle of L-Tryptophan, I did what I do with most of my pill offers, I trashed it. I am old enough to have remembered the name but generally, I dont like reviewing pills. I told a friend about it later that day. He told me the history of the supplement and what it was good for. I hadnt read the offer or description, pill -> trash. Well, when my friend told me about its use as a sleep aide, I perked up. Ive been very stressed out lately with family medical problems and havent been sleeping well. I was convinced I need to look at this again. Luckily, undelete worked and I was able to restore the email. I asked to try it and I received it and tried it.I took the dose of three capsules at night to help with sleep. I liked that it was a natural product, vegetarian and made in the USA. All in its favor. I also know that natural supplements may not be effective immediately and need to be used over time. Well, it took about three nights but I did notice I slept longer and better durations. I didnt keep waking up on the hour look at the clock and try to sleep again. I am very happy as having a strong cocktail or other pills wasnt what I really wanted to do and it was giving mixed results. I used the product of about a week in total and was very happy with the help it gave me during a very stressful time. My stress level has lowered and Im not taking it every night. I still dont like taking more pills than I need for anything except actual vitamins. I will be using this on nights that are more stressful than normal and am grateful for the opportunity to test it. I would recommend giving it a try and look into the history of the product.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRNB0OLTANLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO6QBIW#wasThisHelpful","RPRNB0OLTANLE","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KDL Windshield Sun Protector A Powerful UV Ray Deflector Auto SunshadeI really liked a number of features of this KDL sun shield for your car. First, it folds down to a very small and this size that will most likely fit in the pocket behind most passenger seats. It also unfolds and becomes big enough to cover the inside of most windshields. My biggest problem is my rearview mirror has a very large mount because of sensors installed in it. I was able to get it to stay put and use the sun shades to hold the top in place.It did a great job of keeping the heat in the car minimized. It's been 90* and higher lately. It was perfect test weather. It did an admirable job. I was very happy with the car not being stiflingly hot. I also love the matching case that holds it closed when you fold it up. I also love the pop open effect and twist to shrink. Ive had other products that used this type pf material and technology. This is a wonderful use of it. All in all a very good sun shield and reasonably priced.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31HNJ2R61AVY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014A0RGIE#wasThisHelpful","R31HNJ2R61AVY8","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Etekcity 300ml Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Essential Oil DiffuserThis diffuser is much larger than any previous one Ive tested. It is 300ml in capacity and can last about 10 hours. Thats about three times longer than the others or more. The first thing I noticed was that it took longer to get a head of steam on and get going. I think the larger water load took time to start to mist. Once it did get going it started to fill my living room with the lavender oil scent I was using.I first inserted the power adapter and routed the cord through the notch on the side. Then I added the water and drops of oil. Then I sealed on the lid until it clicked shut. This diffuser is different in that the control buttons are in the rear when everything is in place. While it makes for a cleaner presentation, just the pretty lights and mist, I like having control without turning it around filled with water. I plugged it in and pressed the mist button to start it going. Then turned the buttons to the rear and waited for it to get going. Those buttons control the duration and color mix. Like I said earlier it took a while, maybe fifteen minutes, until it had a good head of mist. It does look nice without the buttons showing, though. I tried to take a picture but in many attempts I only got one that showed the true color. About that color, generally its not as solid a block of color as others Ive used. Its more of a fade with lines. The pictures on the Amazon page are pretty accurate. I got one nice picture with a solid color, as it passes through the mix of colors. As I type this in the next room, the scent is catching up with me. So it does get that scent moving around, with my A/C on.I really like the long duration of the bigger tank and can forgive some of the nits Ive picked. While not perfect it is more featured than others at a similar price point. I do like it and its working its little ultrasonic heart out. I do recommend it if youre looking for an all-day unit.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SQCPWEQJQFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QB0FUC#wasThisHelpful","R24SQCPWEQJQFU","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sztrokia Portable Multi-Angle Adjustable Aluminum Phone & Tablet StandA few years ago I was looking for a stand to support my iPhone while viewing videos. It was about the same $6 and was totally made of thin plastic. While it did work, Id never have thought to use it with an iPad or now my iPhone 6+ is starting to overwhelm it. This mostly aluminum constructed stand from Sztrokia is so much more capable, it is not even a choice for the old one anymore. This is mostly made of aluminum with rubber bumpers at contact points and as feet. The switch on the side is also plastic. It has heft and feels very sturdy in how it moves and how well it supports my iPhone 6+ and iPad Air2, both in protective cases.The stand comes flat and you press the release button on the side of the hinge and swing it open. When you release the switch it locks in position and will do its stand function.  There are protective rubber pieces and feet. In the base there is a long piece of molded rubber that is removable in case you need a little more room there to cradle the tablet.There are a thousand uses for this stand. In the kitchen if you are using your tablet as a recipe book. In the bathroom to watch videos on your phone. The ideas are basically endless. The price for the quality level is amazing. When you receive it you will be amazed that it was six bucks! If Apple sold this, Jony Ive would make a video and it would cost $49. The look and feel is very Apple, in my opinion. I love it and you need one now.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FTMPJEEBZ786/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U4ZM1G#wasThisHelpful","R1FTMPJEEBZ786","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karnotech Mini Monopod (Battery Free No Bluetooth) Selfie StickYes, you read that right, it doesnt need to be charged or paired with your phone. Just plug it in to your headphone jack and away you go. I tested this with my iPhone 6+ in a rugged case, which just barely fit in the spring loaded holder. A very special and unique feature of this stick is the little tiny mirror on the head of the stick. You can turn your phone around and use the good camera to take the shot. You use the mirror to get a decent frame up of yourself and then press the button. You can also use the flash with this reversing technique.It worked like a charm. You wind up with hi-res photos and thats a good thing. You also get with the stick a soft case and a tether for your wrist. It says that there is a mount for a GoPro and I cant find it. I dont want to try to unscrew anything that I shouldnt. Im thinking that description may be for another model. Maybe a rep will verify and correct me or the Amazon site. All in all this is a great selfie stick that is very pocketable as if collapses really small. Its easy to use as theres nothing to install on any modern phone. Some older phones and OS version may not work, look at the compatibility list. This is a great choice of selfie stick.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35OOJSD6OFWUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012T4JBDQ#wasThisHelpful","R35OOJSD6OFWUZ","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sztrokia 34W 6.8A USB Car Charger with 3-Port USBThis is a great car charger and heres why. First, it does the job. I plugged in my iPhone 6+, iPad Air2 and dash cam. All were powered or charging while I drove around. I love the matt rubbery coating (like on a TV remote) and no bright LED on it. The coating makes for no reflections, like some chrome covered chargers and the rubbery surface makes for a good grip when you need to unplug it. Not having a blindingly bright LED on it is also a blessing at night in a dark interior of your car.That it kept everything going and charging, quickly, is the best of it all. It worked perfectly for me and I couldnt be happier. Well maybe a four port? One can dream.

"Pomarks 42mm Stainless Steel Watch Band for Apple watch, Polishing Metal Watchband with Butterfly Buckle & Quality Connector (42mm-Black)The first thing you need to know is, if you havent read all the descriptions, is the watch band is not fully assembled. You will need to do the final assembly of attaching the connectors on each end. Pomarks does include the screwdriver youll need. They are really tiny screws and parts you are dealing with. If this doesnt put you off, you will wind up with a very nice band for your Apple Watch. I have a Sport in Gray. To finish the look, with this band, I suggest a color matching protective frame/case for the watch. I got a black one to match my black band.The band once assembled is quite nice and has good heft and the links move fairly freely. It belies the low cost. Im very happy with the look and feel of the band. I like big chronograph type watches and this band would be at home on one and works well with the Apple Watch too. Im uploading a bunch of pictures to show my process. I needed to also remove two links but have the tool I need. It is not provided with this band but if you want to do it just search for a watch link remover, you may want a small rubber hammer to reinsert the pins. There are little arrows on the underside to show which way to push the pins out. Keep the alignment and insert the pin in the direction you removed it to secure it.I think you will like this band if you don't mind the extra step of the final assembly. I do recommend it.This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBLUFNB5ZT72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ1E2C6#wasThisHelpful","R2BBLUFNB5ZT72","A1ZCSSCAGBCD49","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZCSSCAGBCD49?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peak Reserve Premium Wine Bottle Opener Gift Set- Includes ULTRA Fast Corkscrew and Quad Blade Foil Cutter in a Luxurious BoxThis bunny-like wine bottle opener will indeed make a lovely gift. The presentation is beautiful and will impress the recipient. My only gripe is it was difficult to remove the actual tool as it is very tightly backed in the foam. Maybe a finger hole/notch would make a huge difference in using the lovely box for protective storage and to show it off. I previously used a now rare Vacuvin opener. It certainly was an impressive device but this Peak Reserve opener is both smaller and easier to use.The very easy to follow directions are printed on the back of the box. Follow them and you will be sipping wine very shortly. I previously reviewed the Peak Reserve foil cutter and noticed it has the logo printed on it and this kit does not. I dont think it matters that much but it looks cooler with the logo. Its very easy to prep the bottle with the foil cutter and get to the cork action. Once you position and hold tight to the opener while on top of the cork, its a swift down and up to remove the cork. Then repeat the action to release the cork. Now let the bottle breathe or decant it.If youve been using T-type openers or other more traditional cork screws this will change your life. Its so easy and fool-proof its amazing. You will enjoy this kit and hopefully enjoy your wine.

I was able to listen to music, which sounded great, and summon Siri to make phone calls and other Siri stuff.

"Aukey Leather Watch Band Strap with Stainless Metal Clasp for All Apple Watches 42mmIf you are looking to change up the look of your Apple Watch Sport this is a great way to do it. It will work with any of the Watches but I have a Sport and the rubber band gets tired after a while. Some of the fancier watches have fancier bands. Still, this is a change for most of them and at an affordable price. I like the nice leather on this band, it looks and smells like leather. It is very easy to remove your current strap and slide this into place. Just push the little button near each connector on the back and slide it off.

"Teikis [Set of 2 Glasses + 9 Whiskey Stones] , 10 Oz Double Wall Scotch Glasses/Whiskey Glass and Scotch RocksI like testing a product like this. I froze the rocks and washed the glasses. When the rocks were very cold, I placed five rocks in the glass and poured some bourbon over them. Its so nice to have the double walled glass combined with the rocks. The rocks give the drink a nice chill and never waters the drink down. The double walled construction also keeps the heat of your hand away from the drink. If you enjoy your beverage straight up but chilled, you will love this set.The quality of the glasses, and they are glass not plastic, it top notch. They have heft and are a pleasure to drink from with a nice deep rim. Just put the rocks in gently as they are capable of damaging the glass with excessive heavy use. It all comes in a very nice presentation box and the rocks are in a velvet bag. This will make a great gift for the person in your life who enjoys an adult beverage every so often.

"I adore sunflowers and this hat is just so feminine and pretty to look at and wear. When it first arrived it was laid flat, and like I do with all new articles of clothing, hats included, I washed this hat in cold water in the laundry then let it air dry on it's own. The colors on this hat stayed just as bright and didn't fade through the wash, nor did it bleed into my other laundry I washed it with.I am petite and this hat fits me the way I would expect it to, over the forehead somewhat but not past my eyebrows. I wore this hat out gardening and I like how it isn't a very heavy material so it leaves my head breathe while wearing it. The inside of the hat is white, and made of a silk material on inside where your head is, then cotton around the brim of the hat and on the outside. The brim of the hat is flexible so I can turn it up for a more cloudy day or wear it down on a more sunny day. This hat is easy to clean and looks great on me too.

"I ordered this tablecloth in beige for a friend of mine that just purchased a new table. The color is on the lighter side of beige and I would describe it more of a cream color than beige color. It looks absolutely gorgeous on her new table and is long enough to also fit well when she adds the leaf in the middle to extend her table out for company.The stitching on the seams is very nicely done, and the rose and leaves throughout are just beautiful to look at as well. This goes great with her dining room area which is a medium gold color. She washes this tablecloth in cold water and then hung it up to air dry and I didn't notice any shrinking or fading in color as well. This will be look fabulous on her table for the upcoming holidays with some red flowers and cranberries as accents laid on top and around the table.

"I absolutely love these ribbed tank tops! They are so soft, light weight and the colors are beautiful. I ordered the medium size in a 4 pk. I usually fit a small or medium depending on how the clothes are made, but since they are 100% cotton and my husband often helps with the laundry, I figured they would end up in the dryer eventually and may shrink.There are several different colors these tanks come in, but are random when sent out to you. The colors I received are hot pink, teal, orange, and purple. The colors are lively looking and remind a lot of spring time when all the flowers start to bloom. I tried these tanks on before washing, and they fit me just fine except a little long, which I expected they would be as I'm am 5ft 1 inch. These do say to hand wash them only, but I washed them in the washer in cold water, then put them in the dryer on low heat. They shrunk a little at the length, hence the tag saying hand wash only, but not anywhere else. The colors stayed just as lively after washing and did not fade at all. The pictures below are after washing/drying them all.I love how these fit under the armpits, as being petite, most tanks I own have too much material under the arms and leave that area looking saggy to show my bra, but that doesn't happen with these tanks. I think my favorite part about these tanks are they move with me and not against me. Usually when wearing a tank I have to be mindful of slouching when I sit, or bending over too far when gardening so I am not showing off more than I would like to with the neighbors. These tanks will show a little cleavage while bent over, but for the most part stay where they are suppose to so I'm not overly exposed. I would definitely recommend these comfortable ribbed tank tops!Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H3OZ6TQO95HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDIS6YG#wasThisHelpful","R3H3OZ6TQO95HJ","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son in law loves Moscow Mule mugs and swears they are the best mugs to keep your drink cold and refreshing for hours. After hearing about these mugs for a while, I just had to try one for myself.This mug arrived safely and I liked that it had a recipe for a festive beverage that was included with the mug and also some information about Moscow Mule mugs themselves. I had no idea some were only copper plated, and was glad to read this one is solid copper. I decided to try the recipe drink that came with this mug, but added gin instead of vodka, as I'm not a huge fan of vodka, and it was delicious! Normally, the heat from the alcohol would melt the ice pretty quickly and I'd have to add a lot more ice, but this mug kept the drink cool for a long time without the need to add extra ice.

"This is an adorable set of tea infusers! There are 4 in the set in the shape of a pear, a strawberry, a lemon, and a gourd. All 4 tea infusers are made of a soft silicone, including the tops, which I like a lot as some other tea infusers have a stainless steel top and I can't stick them in the microwave with my cup full of water, but these I can without any problems.The top half of each comes off to be able to insert some loose leaf tea into, and I found if I squeeze the bottom half a little, the opening is wider to be able to fit a half of tea spoon full into the bottom of the infuser without making so much of a mess. Each one of these silicone tea infuser will hold between 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 teaspoons of loose leaf tea. I used these with both loose leaf tea and also flower buds tea. With the loose leaf tea I did see some of it come out into the water while steeping, but not a lot, and none of the flowering buds came out through the holes of the tea infusers while steeping.The pear shaped is my favorite one out of the bunch, as when put in my cup it stands tall and still is easy to get out of my cup when I'm done with it by the top part sticking out of the cup. The gourd, strawberry, and the lemon all have a top heavy silicone leaf at the end, and when placed inside the cup, if not placed well over the rim/handle part to balance it, will not allow the infuser part to sink too far into my cup, but rather stay floated at the top part. Just a note with these tea infusers, they do not come with a drip tray so when taking them out of the tea cup, they will make a mess dripping, but I set them on a plate when finished with them. These are really simple, easy to use tea infusers. They work well and look really cute in my tea cup!Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TOFMU67QE3XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LRHPO2#wasThisHelpful","R3TOFMU67QE3XM","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband isn't an athlete, doesn't participate in organized sports, although does like to kick the soccer ball around some with our son, goes hiking, and enjoys a nice jog outside every so often. He has, what I call, swamp feet. His feet sweat in the summer, winter, with or without socks. His job has him on his feet and walking several miles during the work day, and when he comes home from work, he peels the socks off his feet like a second skin. Gross right? Yes, so is the smell and feel left behind in his shoes. I try to not go near them, or even touch them because they feel like a wet sponge. He is often telling me he needs new shoes because his start to smell and we can't get rid of the odor, and has (not kidding) 8 pair of sneakers just to trade off and on to let them air out for a good many days.We have tried shoe inserts, baking soda in his shoes, and various other types of sprays/powders in his shoes and on his feet as well as sticking his shoes in a plastic bag and in the freezer, to help with his swamp feet, and they either don't work to get rid of the moisture and odor left behind, or they just blend in with the moisture and odor to add yet, another smell to the shoes, but not a pleasing one.I was really skeptical these capsole order eliminator would work well, if at all. They're straight forward to use without needing to read directions, just twist the top half away from the bottom half to open them up. The smell of these capsoles when opened reminds me of a dryer sheet, and one that my husband doesn't seem to mind at all. When my husband got home from work, I put these opened capsoles right into his shoes after he took them off. Before I went to bed hours later, I took one of the capsoles out of his shoe and sniffed, and it had a faint smell of a dryer sheet, and nothing else. What impressed me the most wasn't that it only got rid of the odor, but that when picking up the shoe it wasn't moist and squishy feeling inside like it usually is, so it did a good job of sucking up his swamp feet moisture left behind as well. As the description says, they are suppose to last 5 years, so time will tell. Right now though, they work great getting rid of my husbands swamp feet in his shoes, and without the mess of a powder or need to cut out inserts to fit as well. I am very happy with this product, and would definitely recommend these!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JESM75654DM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZWO90AA#wasThisHelpful","R2JESM75654DM6","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a petite female, so ordering anything in a size large is rather different for me, but after looking at the site description decided a large would probably fit me best. I wear a 36B/34C bra, and this large size fit me very nicely. Not too tight where I can't breath, and not too loose where it would fall off of me either.The material is soft and breathable, and yes, I did notice it was on during the day, but it was rather comfortable the entire time wearing it until it was time to take it off before bed. The stitching is done rather well around the seams and didn't irritate my skin at all. There are two removable cup pad that come with this strapless bra, and slits on the left and ride side on the inside of the bra to take them out for washing and then to be able to put them back in.While I think the bra is comfortable, and I didn't have to adjust it or tug on it to keep it up at all while wearing it, the cup pads themselves aren't so comfortable and gave me a bit of a wonder women shape to the breast area. I thought that washing the cup pads while washing the strapless bra may help to not have such a stiff starch feel to them, but no they held their shape well even through washing. I did not stick either the cup pads or the strapless bra in the dryer, but aired dried them flat. Perhaps if one had sagging breasts, which I don't, it would give them a better shape underneath the clothing, but to me, it didn't look so good. I decided to use some cup pads that I already have from another bra to insert into this bra, and it looked and felt much better. The bra itself is nicely made, and I would have given this a 5 star rating had it not been for the overly stiff cup pads that come with this strapless bra.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CAEE8MZUCFKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJ08R8U#wasThisHelpful","R3CAEE8MZUCFKL","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great medium thickness black tank top. The color isn't really dark black, and not faded black either, but somewhere in between. I love that there isn't a tag sewn into the back top of the seam, but printing on the inside instead, as tags can get bothersome and itchy after a bit of wearing.I am petite build and 5ft 1, this tank top didn't have different sizes when ordering, but fit me well at the top half, and was a bit long in length. Since it says 100% cotton on the printing on the inside of the tank, I washed it in cold water and hung it on the line to dry, and there wasn't any fade of color or shrinking. The material is soft and comfortable against my skin, and it does have some give to it, but not a lot, so I'm not feeling like I can't breath while wearing it and it still holds it's shape well after wearing it all day.When I washed it the second time, I did stick it in the dryer on low heat, and it did shrink up some on the length at the bottom, but not anywhere else. My advice would be, if you're tall not to stick this in the dryer as it may then be too short in length. The stitching is very tight around the seams, and nicely done on this tank. There weren't any lose threads after washing the second time, and the pictures below were taken after the second washing. The ribbed material is tightly woven on this tank, and when it arrived I expected to visually see the ""ribbed"" part sticking out like other ribbed tanks I own. It's there, but it blends nicely together and doesn't stand out so much as far as lines going vertically down the tank like other ribbed tanks do.Our weather is changing some here in the Northeast, and while it's warm during the day, it's been cooling off during the late afternoon/evening hours. This tank is perfect for these days as it's breathable enough in the warmer day hours, and when it cooled off added a nice layer underneath another top. In my opinion, it would be a bit too hot for me to wear in the 90+ degree weather of the summer, but would be alright in the low 80's or below. I really enjoy how this tank fits underneath the armpits too, as a lot of tanks I own are saggy with extra material, which doesn't look very nice either. This is a quality made tank top that I am truly happy with.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDDNESA0OSUWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UOSQOJ4#wasThisHelpful","RDDNESA0OSUWH","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an evergreen bush that has been grown and shaped into looking like a basket. It was one of the things I loved the most when deciding to buy my house years ago. I've always wanted to put some hanging flowers inside this bush shaped like a basket, and have tried several ways, like hanging a string down tied to top underneath, but the weight of the flowers in the pot are too heavy, as the top part is held together by a cable and chicken wire inside to make the shape.When order this shepherd hook my intended use was to hang a flower pot along the rows of lilies growing close to my house and are fading now with the end of summer near. I happen to lean this 48 inch shepherd hook against the bush that looks like a basket, and found a different use for it instead. It was fairly easy to get this shepherd hook inside the bush, and the two prongs on the bottom are separated far enough apart where it can straddle the roots inside the bush to not harm it, yet, stand sturdy enough to hold a flowering pot. I carefully separated the top of the bush growth to fit the top half of the shepherd hook inside, and then hung my flower pot. It looks wonderful and I am so happy this worked out so well for me!! Since this shepherd hook is rust resistant and sturdy, I won't have to worry about taking it out in the winter time either, but can hang some evergreen plants when the pretty summer flowers are done blooming.

"This shaking school bus is really adorable for toddlers, and I ordered one for my nephew who is 4 yrs old for a gift. He loves to sing and dance around to happy songs, yet being a boy he also enjoys toys that move with him and do something as well while he is moving around.The shaking school bus toy takes (3) AA batteries (not included with the toy) and the location of the battery compartment is underneath the bus. To take the lid off the battery compartment I needed a small Philips screw driver, which I couldn't find one handy at the time, but a small flat head works well and that is what I used to get the lid off. There are two buttons on the bottom, one to set the wheels down and turn the bus on to move, and then sliding it over to off and the wheels go up into the bus. The other button slides one way to turn the music off, or the other way to turn the music on.The song it plays is B I N G O, which is an all time favorite classic kids song, and my nephew knows it well. The music is clear while coming out of the bus, but unlike other kids toys that play music, it's not overly loud while playing. I like that the bus music has an off feature to it, as I can only handle hearing that song so many times in a day, however, after I was done testing out this toy, my son, who is 11 yrs old, went around the rest of the day humming the catchy tune, so my nephews parents will more than likely hear it even if the button is off as well. To me though, kids singing is a great sound and I enjoy hearing them so happy.When the wheels are down and the bus is set on our hardwood floors, it toggles from left to right side, and the parking lights on the front and back flash off and on. The bus senses when it hits an object as well, and will change direction once it does, which is a nice feature to have when little toes are around. Overall, this is a really cute toddler toy and I think my nephew will love his gift!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H6LROGGNYE6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WKUL7JG#wasThisHelpful","R3H6LROGGNYE6P","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I want to start out by stating right away, this is a thin cooling towel, and yes, you can see through it somewhat too. However, after trying this item out for a few days now, I'm quite impressed by this cooling towel and it's ability to stay wet/cool even in extremely hot weather.I ordered this for my son's friend, who has started football practice recently for the season. He'll come over to play with my son at times, and when his parents come to pick him up for practice, I instantly feel for him being out in 90 degree weather, and not only running around in it, but with football gear on too! Before he used this towel, I wanted to test it out for a while to see how much it would be able to cool him down when he gets all hot and sweaty during practice and then eventually games. I have to admit, feeling how light weight this towel is, I didn't think it would do much of anything beyond being able to wipe the sweat off his face.There wasn't instructions that came with this towel when it arrived, so I just did what I thought should be done based on the description of the towel. I wet it in the sink under cold running water, then squeezed it a bit to get rid of the excess dripping water. Took it outside, and snapped it in the air. Ok, so I got a bit wet when I did that, it felt good, and I was impressed with the amount of water this towel absorbed. Then I hung it out on my clothes line to see how long it would dry next to a set of cotton sheets. After checking on the cooling towel a half hour later, some parts were dry, and some still wet and cool to the touch. One may think that isn't so impressive, however, it was 92 degrees outside with a slight breeze that day, and my sheets that I hung out at the same time, were completely dry.After this cooling towel fully dried on the clothes line, I wet it again, snapped it in the air, and tested it inside in the air conditioning leaving it in a pile on my kitchen counter. Four hours later, it was still completely wet, and really cool to the touch. I had honestly forgotten about it after that, until the next morning, and when waking up to get coffee noticed it, and it was still half wet. So, if using this towel in a gym or some place that is normally air conditioned, it would stay wet and cool longer than most people would stay to work out in a gym, without the need to get wet again. I also tested it in the same fashion, wet, in a pile, but outside on my porch, as my son's friend would probably be using it in this fashion, sitting on the bench and using it in between breaks and time outs. It stayed wet and cool for about 2 and a half hours before it needed to be wet again.This cooling towel is soft to the touch, and feels great and refreshing on my face. There is a one stitch seam all around that looks to be nicely done. My sons friend has used it twice now, once during practice, and once during a scrimmage. He absolutely loves this towel, and said it's really helped him cool down after running around playing football. Although he enjoys to use it to wipe the sweat off his face, he likes it best wrapped around the top of his head during time outs.

"Water balloons are a fun and exciting for all ages in the warm summer months, and a great alternative way to cool off and get wet without having to get in the pool. I have purchased a lot of water balloons and was a bit confused when these balloons arrived as labeled ""party balloons"" and not water balloons. Compared to some water balloons I have on hand already, they're about the same size, but shaped a little different, and are a bit thinner. They're easier to blow up with air, and I can't blow up the water balloons with air, although I've tried, that I have that are labelled water balloons.That being said, my son, his friend, and I decided to give these a try to use as water balloons and compare them to the ones we have already. These party balloons filled up with water easily, they held the water well without breaking while filling them up with the outside hose, and like the water balloons I have, they also broke the same when throwing them at each other. Unlike the water balloons I have to compare to these, they stretched easier to be able to knot them off to hold the water, which to me is a plus. I thought these party balloons had a slight latex order to them, which after handling them for a while, the smell also transferred to my hands. They are labeled as non-toxic on the bags, and I appreciate knowing they are safe to use around myself as well as the kids.Regardless what these balloons are labelled as, what exactly is a water balloon? My definition would be a balloon that can expand and hold water successfully and then break while throwing to get another person/thing wet. To me, these balloons fit that definition regardless of what the bag is labelled. I've included a picture of these balloons and also the other balloons I had already both deflated and filled with water (the wooden blocks were used to keep them still and from rolling away). We all had a fantastic time filling up these balloons, chasing each other around, and throwing them at each other. I gave these a four star rating not because the balloons aren't functional as water balloons, as they are, but because of the slight odor and also that the label is a bit misleading, and also, I can't beat the price (currently $8.95) for 500 balloons.Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OMRL9872KWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ERWLOK#wasThisHelpful","R33OMRL9872KWA","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:36 MinsThis ocean wave night light projector is awesome! My son does swim competitions and he loves the water, he is also afraid of the dark at night. This projector gives off the most beautiful waves of light when on and is really soothing to him to look at.There are seven different settings to toggle through by just pushing the middle button to change each setting. The first is multi colored, and there are others that stay on a solid red, blue, or green, or flash between all the colors in different wave patterns. As I was recording the video, my son said it reminded him of water moving so much it made him want to swim, which can be seen at the end of the video as a shadow. The video was recorded in my living room, which is 23 ft by 18 ft wide and it covered the entire ceiling with the waves of light while this projector sat in the middle of the living room floor. In my sons room he likes it put on top of his dresser so the waves creep up the wall and onto the ceiling by his bed. Depending on how close you set it to a wall and distance to the ceiling will depend on how far the waves lights will go, much like you would see with a flashlight up close or at a distance.This projector can be plugged in using the provided usb and wall plug, which is how we used it, or by installing AA batteries in the bottom of the unit. I really like that it shuts off after an hour on it's own, and after my son has long fallen asleep and no longer has a need for the light. There is also an audio jack on the back of this projector that you can plug the provided audio cable into to connect to my phone or his galaxy tab, so he could listen to music or soothing sounds of the ocean while looking at the waves of light. While he does enjoy this feature off while sleeping, I think it sounded pretty good. We're really happy with this ocean wave projector and the beautiful dancing lights.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6453UY37LGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CKRU3UI#wasThisHelpful","RZ6453UY37LGC","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this set of ceramic mason jars by Vakalis as a gift for a friend. She always keeps her kitchen tidy and organized, and I thought this would make the perfect gift for her. They come in a set of four white ceramic jars, with a blue, purple, red, and green silicone lid. The lids also have ceramic in the center of them as well to give them a more cohesive look with the jars.Each jar holds 12 ounces, and is 4 1/4 inches tall with the lids on. The jars weigh about as much as a regular glass canning jar would, and each one has a smooth surface finish to them, both inside and out. I tested to see if they would leak when turned upside down holding liquids with the silicone lid on tight, and they did a little bit as I shook the jar up and down some. However, while taking the lid off and then on again, you can hear they have a good suction as there is a ""pop"" sound when taking the lids off.After filling up each jar with some of my friends favorite pantry items, I wrote the name of what's inside on each chalkboard label with a piece of chalk that is provided in each ceramic jar. I really like the chalkboard labels that are painted onto these jars, as they will save my friend money and trouble of purchasing labels to put on them when changing from one item to another. She can just wet a paper towel, erase what is written and use the chalk to write something else. Since these are ceramic jars, they can also go in the microwave and refrigerator depending on what she'd like to store in them.

"My first thought when seeing these bluetooth headphones was wow, it didn't come in some hard type plastic container that I'd have to use scissors, a box cutter, and knife to get them opened.I was pretty eager to try these bluetooth headphones right away, as I don't care much to use earbuds. They came with a set of really nice and large print instructions, which, I was thrilled with, as most come with this tiny little booklet with such small print I feel I need a magnifying glass to see what it says. Most the controls to work these headphones are on the left ear cuff, a plus for me as I'm left handed, which include the bluetooth for pairing with my phone/on/off button, the up and down volume/skip buttons all along the back side. There is an LED light at the bottom on the left side that blinks from red to blue when pairing with my iphone 6, and then stays blue once paired. It was pretty easy to pair with my iphone 6 by just holding down the power button for 10 seconds. There is also a usb port to charge these headphones with the provided usb cable when the battery drains.When putting on these headphones, they fit me well, are soft and comfortable on my ears and at the top of my head, and although a little snug, they don't hurt my ears from wearing them for a few hours. I'm a petite female, and I enjoy that these headphones don't make me feel like they are just hanging on my head, but they do adjust on each side to also fit my husbands head comfortably as well. The sound while playing the music was crystal clear and sounded great. I was able to walk all through my house while leaving my iphone 6 sit on the coffee table, as well as about 40 -50 feet away from my iphone sitting on my porch while outside, without losing a connection to each other at all.

"I ordered this bamboo memory foam pillow for my son. He is 11 yrs old and it's important for him to have a pillow that has good support for his growing body, especially while sleeping. I have one similar to this pillow and he likes the feel of it. We have tried other pillows for him and although he likes a more semi flat than fluffy pillow, they usually end up going too flat over time and no longer offer good support for him then.When this pillow arrived it came in a cloth bag rolled up and flat. Upon opening, it did have an order to it like all memory foam pillows do, but dissipated after a day of airing out. Unlike mine, this memory foam pillow has a zipper at the end of the soft bamboo outside case, so I can wash the cover as needed. I really enjoy this feature as I can also stick a sachet of lavender or eucalyptus inside the cover for my son to breathe in while sleeping.This bamboo memory foam pillow allows my son to adjust it to his liking as far as how flat or fluffy he wants it, just by pressing down on it to flatten it some, or tugging on the sides a bit to fluff it up more. He's been sleeping on it a few days now, and he said it's the most comfortable pillow he has had yet.

"I ordered this Minions One Eye throw blanket by Ibeauti for my son who is in swim competitions. He is a huge fan of the Despicable Me movies and especially those lovable minions!After swimming sometimes he is a bit chilled in the vehicle on the way home, so we usually keep a blanket around for him to cover up with. Not only is the minion on the front adorable, but the blanket itself is soft, fluffy, and rather large in size when opened up. My son is 5 ft 7 and stretched out this blanket can cover him from shoulder to ankle in length, and wrap around him entirely in width. He said the blanket is really soft and keeps him toasty warm. I first washed this blanket in cold water inside a mesh laundry bag I have, and then hung it out on the clothes line to air dry. The blanket held up well in the washer and didn't shrink, no stray strings, or fade in color at all.I found it easy to roll the blanket back up by laying it flat, minion side down, then folded in sections until it was the size of the minion on the front. Once folded up, I just rolled it up, starting from the side that has the round yellow button, until it met the other side to secure it shut with the white elastic strap. When not using this blanket to cover himself and it's rolled up, my son enjoys sticking his hand up the center and turning it into a puppet to play with, and just hugging it while carry it around. This is a great quality blanket, we love it, and will purchase a few more of these as gifts for his friends and team mates!

"My husband often travels a few hours away for work, and that usually means a lot of extra stops at convenience stores and take out food as he is traveling all day long. He is not much of a fast food person and takes fruits and veggies to work with him when he isn't traveling to eat.This cooler bag by Freddie and Sebbie is pretty awesome in size and the amount of compartments it has. I am really impressed with the inside cooler section of this bag that is located under the zipper flap in the center of the bag. Not only does it help keep his drinks, fruit, and veggies cold for hours, but it has velcro around the outside of the white lining that is attached to the inside of the bag to so I can remove the lining and clean it out easily, then once dried put it back in place. I have tried to wash other cooler bags that didn't have a removable lining, and it's quite a chore to do.This bag is black on the outside, it's made of sturdy nylon on the outside, which makes the outside easy to clean as well with a wet cloth. There is a zippered pouch and a mesh pouch on the outside of each side of this cooler bag, a zippered mesh pocket under the center flap, and inside the front zippered flap, are two large mesh zippered pockets. I really like the leather handles that is on top of this bag, it is stylish and makes it look professional enough for my husband to carry around for work.

"These Fabric Christmas gift bags are really cute! I ordered these in a size medium to take over seas with me to visit family for the holidays in a few months. TSA doesn't allow gifts to be wrapped while traveling on airplanes, so these are perfect to tuck in my suitcase and then add the gifts into them once I have arrived over seas.I have the medium sized gift bags that come in a pack of 12. They are roughly 16 inches tall and 11 inches wide, and made from a soft fabric that reminds me a lot of felt. They all are red in color for the over all bags, and then have various felt cut outs that are glued onto the front side of the bags, of a snowman, Santa Claus or a Christmas tree. Each bag has a white, nylon drawstring that weaves through some punched out holes in the fabric at the top and knotted at the side, that I can use to shut the bag closed once the gift is inside. The stitching is nicely done around the top and the seams of these gift bags, and I was able to fit a gallon of milk inside with room to spare.These are fairly sturdy bags as I could carry the gallon of milk around by the drawstring and the fabric did give some but didn't rip apart at all. I could not see through the bag to tell what was inside when closed up while having the milk jug inside of it. I really enjoy that these bags are light as a feather, so they won't add extra weight to my suitcase, and that they are reusable. These are perfect for my traveling over the holidays for the kids gifts!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEQ0OPN3OX6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PITEDIS#wasThisHelpful","R2VEQ0OPN3OX6F","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We'll be traveling to Europe for the holidays in a few months to visit family. We usually go every other year, and packing suitcases for the limited amount of weight seems to be more and more of a challenge without having to pay over the weight limit fees, especially when they keep lowering the amount of weight we can have our luggage weigh. We also tend to buy things at the last minute as gifts for people back home, especially if we have lay overs in different countries. So, what our carry on bags weighed at the last check in the first airport, they may not weigh the same at the next check in at the second airport.I really like this digital luggage scale by aGreatLife. I tested this digital scale weighing items I had at home that I knew the weight of, and it was completely accurate. This scale allows to be weighed in pounds, kilograms, ounces, and grams, which is very helpful to us traveling overseas, as they use the metric system and it saves me from having to convert kg to lbs on the return flight home. It's really easy to toggle between which weight I want the scale to measure in, after pushing the button initially to the right of the screen to turn it on, I just push the button again to change the read out of the weight.The scale comes with a battery I to insert in the back of the handle by sliding off the white end piece, sliding in the battery with the flat side up, and then sliding the battery cap back on to snap in place. The luggage scale I ordered came with a plastic luggage tag as well, which has a ID tag that I can slide out from the left side of the tag, and write my information on the paper, then slide it back into the tag. I really like that the window of the ID tag only shows my name, and doesn't expose my other personal information that I'd rather not share with others traveling that may glance at the tag. Overall, I really enjoy this digital luggage scale. It's easy to use, works well, and it's the perfect size to put in the front pouch of my carry on bag for when I need to check, and recheck the weight of my bags.Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41L20GJBMO4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XL3FFRG#wasThisHelpful","R41L20GJBMO4N","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 20800mah portable power bank is unrealistically impressive! I am truly in awe at the output and power this power bank has. Let me start of by saying, I have a few large power banks, and I also have an ipad 3 that for some reason, my ipad 3 takes a long time to charge with a wall charger and no power bank has ever charged my ipad past 50% charged before the power bank needed recharged again, until now. Not only did this power bank fully charge my ipad 3 from at the point where it wouldn't power on to 100% charged, I was able to charge my iphone 6 from 1% to 25% afterwards before this power bank needed recharged again!I charged this power bank over night with the provided usb cable, then in a weeks time, I charged my iphone 6 five times, using the dual usb ports on the power bank, my old iphone 4 and my husbands old iphone 4s twice to full charge while running video apps on both of them, both my sons and my ipod 4 at the same time twice to full charge, and after all that, this power bank still had 2 LED lights fully lit (50% charged). This would be awesome to take on a camping trip with us!This power bank also has an LED flashlight that sits just below the charging port on the front that shines really bright to see my way in the dark, and has 4 LED lights on the top black surface to indicate the amount of power it has. Above the 4 LED lights is a button that if pushed once illuminates the 4 LED lights, or to work the flashlight just hold the button down for a few seconds. I really like the soft cloth pouch to carry the power bank around, as the power bank fits in it well and also has room in it to add my charging cable for my iphone 6, as well as the cable to charge the power bank itself. I like the feel of this power bank on the outside, it's easy to grip and I haven't dropped it once while using it. It is on the larger side, but so well worth it for the amount of power and charges this power bank puts out. I definitely recommend this power bank!Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36R063WFEYP76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHWXZUY#wasThisHelpful","R36R063WFEYP76","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely little tea pot! I love trying different flower teas and loose leaf teas, and enjoy a good cup of tea to relax. I have some different tea strainers to make one cup of tea at a time or even an entire pot, but this one is definitely very unique to me.There wasn't instructions that came with this tea pot, but after looking it over for less than a minute, it's pretty straight forward on how to use it. There is a plastic tea strainer cup in the center of the glass tea pot, that I twisted counter clockwise to separate it from the tea pot. I put in one of my tea flower and then pour hot water in it. After a few minutes of letting the tea steep to my liking, I screwed the plastic strainer/infuser back onto the glass tea pot, pushed the red button on the top of the black cap and the tea streamed out into the tea pot. It was that easy!The strainer is large enough to hold about 4 ounces of water, so  I added more hot water into the strainer when I wanted more of the tea to drink. I also tried this with a lavender loose leaf tea I have, and when done steeping, neither the tea flower nor the loose leaf tea fell through into the tea pot after pushing the button to strain the tea. I don't particularly mind the smaller size of this strainer, as I don't always want a large cup of tea to drink. However, the glass tea pot will actually hold 16 ounces, so if I wanted a full pot of tea, there is plenty of room in the strainer area to add more loose leaf tea, let it steep longer to get a strong infusion, and then add more hot water to the tea pot itself once the strainer is drained. I can then either remove the strainer or just let it sit in the tea pot as is.When done with drinking tea, this tea pot and strainer was really easy to clean. I am not sure if it's dishwasher safe, but I just rinsed it clean in my kitchen since, and set it on the counter to air dry. Overall, I really love this tea pot, and yes, the little red button is fun to push and watch the tea strain out, but unlike any tea infuser/strainer I have, this strainer does not leak when taking it out of the tea pot itself. There is definitely a no mess, no fuss tea pot set. I would definitely recommend for people who enjoy loose leaf and flower tea.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSCQX69R8C67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBMRKQE#wasThisHelpful","R3NSCQX69R8C67","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loving these solar string lights! I am going away for the holidays, and wanted something to go around my windows while away so it looks like someone is home, especially at night. I didn't want to have to use a timer, nor did I want to have something plugged into an electrical outlet while away.These solar string lights are small in size, and are placed on a thin, clear wire that reminds me a bit of fishing line. The wire didn't look really strong at first, but it held up well to my moving it around, and tugging/pulling on it. I wanted to test this set of string lights out well before I needed them, to see that the solar panel worked over a weeks time, and also that the lights would continue to work.The solar panel has a clear plastic film on it to protect the panel, that peels off easily before using it. On the back is a sturdy plastic holder where you can mount the panel onto a wall or removable plastic spike to put it in the ground. I decided to spike this solar panel into the ground, which goes down almost seven inches to keep it still. I like that the mount on the back move the solar panel to the left or right side of the spike without having to move the entire spike so it faces the correct path of the sun. I stretched these string lights out the length of my pathway in the front of the house at night, after leaving the solar panel out in the sun for the day. Although they didn't give off a strong enough light to illuminate the entire pathway, it did give off enough to stay on the path without the need of another light outside.On the back of the panel is an on/off button to toggle between the lights settings, push once for steady on, push again to turn them off, again to have them come on and blinking, and push again to turn them off entirely. I love these string lights will go off when it sense daylight, and comes on when it's night to save the energy left in the solar panel, and there is no need for me to set a timer or use an electrical outlet with this set. However, I'd be aware of where they are placed depending on what their intended use is, as when I brought them under my porch light at night, and my son turned the outside porch light on, the string lights went off, and after turning the porch light off the string lights came back on again. Overall I am very pleased with these lights for my intended use. I am a big fan of solar energy, and these string lights work very well for my needs!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEXET9L1ZZGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9YWYM6#wasThisHelpful","R1CEXET9L1ZZGR","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these swim goggles for my nephew, who just turned 4 years old and has been taking swim lessons over the summer. He hasn't been using goggles so far because he hasn't liked the few my sister has tried on him, and you can see the chlorine has been irritating his eyes by the slight redness of them after swim lessons.These goggles have a thick silicone band that go around the back of the head to reduce the pull on kids hair while putting them on, taking them off and wearing them, as well as keeping them more securely in place during use. The have a clear film to protect the lenses over the front of the goggles that peel off easily before first use. The back of the goggle lenses are outlined in a soft, flexible silicone to keep the water out of the eyes and the lenses in place while swimming to keep the water out. I like that these goggles have a flexible nose piece, as not all kids have the same size nose, and they can easily be used for a longer time as the kids grow. There are two clips, one on each side, where you can adjust the strap to fit snug around the head. I had my son, who is 11 yrs old, test these goggles for comfort level as well as to see if he can see clearly under water, and if they keep the water out of his eyes. My son does swim competitions so he's worn a lot of goggles, and is really picky when it comes to goggles. These goggles were a little too small to fit him perfectly, they did suction cup well around his eyes to keep the water out why swimming around, and he said they were fairly comfortable to wear. He was able to see clearly under water as well without the lenses blurring or fogging up.Although the goggles do not appeal much to my 11 yr old with the cute dolphins on top, my nephew just loves them and wanted to wear them everywhere. They stayed on his head well and didn't slip off, and the nose piece worked for him without needing adjustments. They come in a nice clear carrying case to keep the goggles clean and the lenses safe from scratches. My sister and nephew are just thrilled with these goggles. I would recommend them for kids 3 yrs old up to about 9 yrs old for comfortable fit and wear.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23GBB1WJYT2KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9815U0#wasThisHelpful","R23GBB1WJYT2KY","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these for my two nieces who are 5 yrs and 8 yrs old, and taking swimming lessons over the summer. Both of their hair is about shoulder length and the one older one models professionally. Keeping her hair in great condition and away from the harm of the chlorine from swimming is ideal for both the girls as it can really dry out their hair.I like that these silicone swim caps come in a two pack, which I have in the girl colors, pink and purple. One of my nieces loves pink and one loves purple so it works out great for them. To test these swim caps before giving them to my nieces to use I brought them along with us to the end of the year swim club pool party and asked the girls of the swim team to give me their opinions of them. All three girls, ages 6, 8, and 16 put their hair in a pony tail, and then held the front of the cap close to their fore head, while someone else pulled it up over their head and to the back of their necks. The girls thought that these swim caps fit really nice on their head, and they really liked the sides of these swim caps because there is extra room for their ears and not so much pressure on them. The swim caps kept their hair dry while swimming in the pool and they didn't have any trouble taking them off afterwords.I like these swim caps have a little design around the edges of the caps to make them look a bit more appealing to wear and look nicer going around their faces, instead of that straight line that is usually around the edge of swim caps. I didn't notice an odor when opening up this bag of swim caps, but when putting them up to my nose individually I got a small hint of silicone smell. This smell, of course, dissipated after being used in the pool. Overall, these are great swim caps for my nieces to use to keep their hair dry and their ears comfortable.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL37TRO0BD8BJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVM9BYK#wasThisHelpful","RL37TRO0BD8BJ","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The old saying ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" is what came to mind while ordering this dictionary book safe. I wanted this for my son to keep his money inside of instead of the standard piggy bank. He's 11 years old, and now instead of toys often gets money as gifts for his birthday and Christmas from relatives. Like most boys, he has a close circle of friends and then makes new friends on and off. He usually just sits his money on his dresser in his room, and I'd like to think that no one would touch it, but now a days you just don't know. With kids going in and out of the house all day long, I thought it would just be better to have a place for him to keep it safe and away from temptation of others.The feel of this book safe is really nice, because it actually has a cloth exterior to it, and looks and feels like a real book even down the the inside realistic cover!  It comes with two keys to open the safe inside, which I really enjoy so my son can keep one, and I can keep one in case he misplaces his at some point. The safe inside is a sturdy steel metal box that easily holds off of his dollar bills, and a few extra items he feels needs to be in there for safe keeping. I have tugged hard on the metal door when locked shut and it didn't open. I've stuck this on our bookshelf along with other books, and I think it blends in with the rest of the books beautifully!

"Great 6 inch beach balls to play with and have fun! We took these to the pool with us for a end of season swim club fun and all the kids had a great time with them in the pool and outside the pool. Every so often the lifeguards ask to clear the pool for safety reasons for about ten minutes, and this gave the kids something fun and easy to do while they waited to go back into the water. All of them stayed inflated and kept their shape through the entire evening, in and out of the pool.These mini beach balls come with a few different designs and patterns on them, including smiley faces, rainbow, pastel, clown fish, sea turtle, blue hawaiian, and pink flamingo, so there was enough variety to please the entire crowd of kids. These are the kind you need to squeeze a little on the valve you blow into to blow them up, but even the smaller kids were able to do that easily with one big breath. Once inflated the valve can be pushed down flush with the beach ball so it doesn't stick up while playing with them. Each ball comes individually wrapped in a clear plastic bag so they are easy to give as party favors individually as well.

"I often like to listen to music while I am cleaning my house, but not always does my son want to hear my music. I am not a big fan of earbuds, but thought I would give these bluetooth ones by Mosiso a try. After charging them initially for a few hours with the provided usb cable, it was time to check them out.I often like to see if I can figure out how to work items without reading the instructions first, and although it took me a second or two to find the button to pair these earphones with my iphone 6, I did find the small button on the inside of the right earphone. After holding the button for a few seconds, a little LED light came on that switched from blue to red and finally stayed blue once paired with my iphone 6. The earbuds themselves have a soft, flexible and comfortable black silicone piece that are removable, and the set comes with three different sizes to fit different sized ears. I had removed the round silicone piece that were on them by giving them a slight pull, and then changed to the smallest pair, which fit in my ears nicely. There is also a neon blue silicone piece that reminds me somewhat of a waffle in a tear drop shape behind the earbuds, which at first I wasn't sure how that worked, but found as I put the earbuds in my ears the neon blue silicone just sort of melted/molded to the shape of my ear keeping the earbud comfortably in place. There are three different sizes of the blue silicone piece to change to fit just about any ear size.I didn't think these earbuds would stay in my ears as I cleaned around the house, as they felt light as a feather, but didn't even budge the three hours I cleaned. These earphones have a flat neon blue cord that is about a foot and a half long that connects them. Now, normally I would have put this behind my head and underneath my hair, but I had the cord instead in front of me and it didn't interfere with my moving around or get caught by my hands to make the earphones come out at all. I left my iphone sit in the middle of my house and had no issues with keeping the bluetooth connection.On the right earphone piece there is an L shaped button that runs along the top and the side to turn the volume up and down easily, however, when I went to adjust the volume, I accidentally hit the button on the bottom of the right ear piece, which controls taking calls on my iphone, and it called the last number I dialed unintentionally. Since it called a friend I decided to test the quality of the mic while making calls, and she said she could hear me just fine, and I had no trouble hearing what she said either the few minutes we talked.The only thing I didn't like about these bluetooth earphones is that the earbud piece that sits inside the ear doesn't move, and therefore I can not switch the earphones the other way around if I wanted to, and wear the right in the left ear. I am left handed, and would prefer to have the controls on the left side instead of the right side. Regardless, I gave these bluetooth earphones a 5 star rating, I didn't need the instructions to use them easily, and because not only is the quality of sound coming from them great, but there was a construction crew taking down a wooden garage piece by piece behind my house, and I did not hear anything but music while wearing these earphones.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBEOB2M07Y0HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLCAETQ#wasThisHelpful","RBEOB2M07Y0HV","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When giving gifts, for some reason what to put them in or wrap them with is always a last minute thought for me. Usually that means I am running to the store for a gift bag or wrapping paper, and don't always remember to buy tissue paper to stuff in the bag as well.This is a nice pack of neon colored paper party bags. Since it comes with 12 in all, and two of each color I'm bound to have enough to last for a while for just about any occasion. These bags measure 9 inches tall, and a bit over 7 inches wide, so there is plenty of room to fit a small gift inside and have room to add a card too. There are 2 of each color, orange, purple, yellow, green, red, and blue, and I like that these party bags have rope cord handles, as I have tossed a gift into a paper party bag with paper handles and they have broke at the handle, not a nice way to give a gift. On one side of the rope handle is a flat paper square that matches the color of the bag on one side, and is white on the other side to write a note or name onto.Also included is a pack of 15 sheets of white tissue paper. For paper these bags are rather sturdy feeling, and they stand up well on their own with their flat bottoms. These will be nice when I'm traveling on an airplane to see family, as they won't take up much room in my suitcase since they fold up flat, as TSA rules do not allow travel with a wrapped gift.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28GWKVHA6CQRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MZC69A#wasThisHelpful","R28GWKVHA6CQRT","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this men's leather flip tri fold wallet. My husband was in need of a new wallet, as his is falling apart. He prefers a leather wallet over nylon or other material, and something rather simple and easy to use as well.This leather wallet came in thin but soft, foam pouch to keep the leather protected. When taking it out of the pouch it has that nice, new leather smell. The black leather is extremely soft and smooth and the fine stitching that goes all around the edges of the wallet are straight and nicely done. When opening it up on the left side are three slots for store cards, credit cards, or other cards of that size, and underneath is enough room to slide a few more cards if needed. There is a middle see through pocket that moves from right to left and is attached, that will fit my husbands work ID on one side, and his drivers license on the other side. On the right side of the wallet is another see through pocket to hold a picture of our son. This wallet doesn't have any slots for pictures other than the one, but we have a plastic insert that can be slide under the right side pocket to add more pictures if he wanted to.My favorite part is that this wallet has two soft lined bill compartments in the back. We're going to head to Europe to visit family for the holidays, and my husband will be carrying both currency for the US and for Europe. Having a place to keep both currencies separated is a big plus for us! There is also enough room for receipts to keep in the back as we're traveling to keep track of all our purchases. Overall, we're both really happy with the look and feel of this wallet.

"This French Lavender Essential oil by Sun Organic is my favorite of all the lavender essential oils I have tried! I am a big fan of the lavender scent, and the smell right out of the bottle is heavenly! Some lavender essential oils are pretty strong smelling, even when used in a diffuser, but this one is not over powering at all.I placed a few drops in my diffuser that is filled with water, and set it in the bathroom yesterday after my son commented I probably didn't want to use the bathroom after he just did. After a few minutes this lovely scent came drifting down the hall way and into the living room. Instead of the usual strong lavender smell that can get a bit over powering, this french lavender reminds me more of a fresh linen smell with a hint of lavender in it. I ordered this french lavender essential oil in a 2 ounce bottle, which doesn't seem like much, but in reality I only need a few drops to add to the water in the diffuser to get a great lovely scent throughout my house, and it will last me quite a long time. Please note, I have only used this as an aromatherapy oil in my diffuser, and would not recommend using it as a therapeutic (on the skin, or ingesting) oil.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULBSJ0WRD3AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6V0POE#wasThisHelpful","R3ULBSJ0WRD3AC","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this 10 LED 180 Lumen Solar Motion Lights for my sister, who sometimes comes home late from puppy training classes with her dog. While the dog sees well to go up her front steps in the dark, she often stumbles her way up them with dog leash in hand. There isn't a light pole from the street near by or one at the end of her yard to light her way, and I thought this would be a perfect fit for her.This LED solar light came in an instructional manual, a pin to change the settings on the light itself, and some screws to be able to mount the light outside. The light has a clear plastic film on the solar panel at the top, and the LED lights at the bottom front to keep them protected, which were easy to remove. Before giving it to her to use, I tested it at my home to see that it works well. I put it out in my porch to get some sun during the day time, and then once dark I was able to use the provided pin to change the settings on the LED wall light. This was really easy to do. The hole to change the settings is located on the front of the panel by the motion sensor button, and I've also provided a picture for a visual guide. It has three settings, one to keep the light on all the time, one to change to motion sensor mode, and one to completely shut the light off. I left it on the sensor mode, as her neighbors probably wouldn't appreciate it on all the time.The light comes on when it senses movement in a 10 foot (3 meters) radius around it, and testing this outside it worked really well. After about 30 seconds of non movement, the light will go off on it's own. There is a wooden railing beside her steps that my sister attached this light to, and she found it really easy to attach the light by herself, and didn't run into any problems. The brightness is most excellent for her to see up all her steps, up her pathway a bit, and even over to her neighbors steps as well. She had thought initially she would need four lights, one for each step she has, but was so please to see this one LED light was enough to see the entire area and more. She's had this LED light installed for a few days now, and even though her front steps only gets the morning sun, it is enough to charge this LED light to shine brightly each and every night she's had it. Her and I both are absolutely thrilled with this LED wall light! I would definitely recommend this light!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FQ2PUCOWVA2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQIQ9HY#wasThisHelpful","R1FQ2PUCOWVA2K","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece, who is 5, will be starting her first day of school this fall. She is so excited and can not wait for summer to be over! To make her school days, especially the first day, feel more special I order her this Disney Frozen Backpack, by Ruz, with Elsa, Anna and Olaf the front of it. Right away she fell in love with this backpack, as most girls would.This is a large 16 inch backpack so it is a slightly big looking on her right now, although she didn't really notice and was strutting around the house with it on. The straps that go around her shoulders are a light blue, with purple edging. The are very well padded, and wide enough to where it won't dig into her shoulders and hurt her skin like some of the older kids have with the drawstring bags. We were able to adjust it so it fits her well enough to wear comfortably with little effort.There are two front pockets. The top pocket is large enough to fit her pencils, erasers, markers, crayons, and also her ""makeup"" as she likes to call it, a must and essential for big girl school she says. Both of these front pockets have one easy glide zipper pull. The front bottom pocket is large enough to fit a pair of shorts and a top for her gym clothes, and a small notebook as well. There two mesh pockets, one on either side of this bag, for her to carry a water bottle, and some juice for her lunch. Then there is a larger pocket in the middle of the backpack, that can fit all her homework, books, and school notes from the teacher, as well as her lunch and a light jacket. I like that this larger pocket has a double zipper pull that glides easily across the bag, so she can open and close it from either end and be ready for class to start quickly. It has nice stitching around the edges, and is very durable. It should last her many years through school. Overall, this backpack has made my niece really happy and she can not wait to go to school with it on!Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVOU0BL3WGQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLUG4GY#wasThisHelpful","RFVOU0BL3WGQC","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the scent of this Lemon Essential oil by Sun Organic. It smells just like the lemon zest I use from a fresh lemon while baking up something good to eat. I like to use this in my diffuser when the air in my house smells a bit stale and not so fresh, mostly in the winter time when the windows aren't opened to let in fresh air. I don't care much for the plastic dropper that came with this oil, as it was bent upon arrival and seems to be a one time use dropper, but I have some glass droppers around the house I used instead. I am no expert on essential oils, and in fact only begun using them recently. I've been reading about how to test if it's a true EO or if it's synthetic, by adding a drop to white paper, then if it's leaves a residue after evaporation it's not a true EO, but rather a synthetic made oil. After doing a paper test, this lemon oil did leave a residue on the paper days after evaporation. Because of that, I would do your own research before using this oil to see if this is the one for you.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RL1NAF46OFO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8GX5YM#wasThisHelpful","R1RL1NAF46OFO2","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this active mesh tank top for my son, who is 11 years old and a very active boy. He gets sweaty a lot in the summer time and enjoys muscle shirts as well. Looking at the size charting on the page site, I order this mesh tank top in a size 14, which my son usually wears a 12 on the top, but thought I'd order it a little bigger after reading some of the reviews that were already posted.I like the feel of this shirt, for a mesh material it is soft, light weight and my son said the material feels comfortable against his skin. All of the seams of this shirt have a great zig zag stitching that is nicely done, including around the arm pit and neck areas. I ordered this shirt in blue, and the color that arrived is in between a medium and sky blue, which is a very nice color on my son.The only thing that needs adjusting is the size chart for ordering. A size 14 on the size chart has 14  L(14-16)  (Age)11-12 Years  (height) 61-63  (waist)26.5-28, my son is 56 inches tall, and has a 28 inch waist. The length of this shirt fit him perfectly, and also around his mid section, but if he were any taller it would have been too short on him. Also, it was somewhat tight fitting around his arm pits and the neckline, which he said wasn't very comfortable. I'm not quite sure, as I don't have one in a size 16 if that would alleviate the tight fit of around the neckline and armpit area. While nicely made and the quality of the material is there for this shirt, I would recommend ordering in 2 sizes larger than one would normally wear. Had the size of the shirt I received matched the size of the chart, this would have received a 5 star rating.Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6TX6M74VCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSXZU2S#wasThisHelpful","RC6TX6M74VCH","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have own an old house, and with that comes an old pair of cement steps outside coming up the front pathway. I'm often worried about someone tripping as their isn't a light out there to see with when it's dark outside. I've tried some landscaping lights that go into the ground and while they light up the pathway well, they do not light the stairs up well enough. Also, I find my dogs trip over them quite often while running in the yard and knock them over, and my husband isn't fond of going around these landscaping lights with the lawn mower either.This solar powered LED motion sensor wall light by Elivebuy is just what I was looking for and works well for my needs. It was really easy to attach the wall light to my wooden mailbox post with the screws provided. The mailbox is close to the steps and the sun shines from early afternoon and a good part of the evening hours. There is a plastic film that needs removed from the front led panel and also the top of the wall light where the solar panel sits.I figured this wall light was pretty straight forward to use, and didn't read the instructions that comes with this wall light at first. My mistake, as there is a pin hole beside the motion sensor light on the front to change the settings of the light. One push with the pin provided on the wall light sets the wall light to on with sensor mode, another push to keep the light on all the time, and yet another to turn it all off completely.While the light is on sensor mode, it turns on whenever it detects movement in a 3 meter (10 feet) area around the wall light. My mailbox isn't far from the steps, so I was very happy the light detected my movement from the bottom step and illuminated the stairs and the landing by the mailbox very well for me to be able to see in the dark. After about 30 seconds of no motion sensed this wall light shut off on it's own. We've had a lot of thunderstorms here lately, and this LED wall light doesn't seem to have an issue with getting wet and continues to work each time. Overall, I'm happy with this light. It's easy to install, use, and works well to light up my steps out front.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3Z25P6CVDL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W135S4M#wasThisHelpful","R1K3Z25P6CVDL5","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 13000mAh portable charger by Staroc is incredible and an impressive power bank! Between my husband, son, and myself we own a lot of portable electronics that charges via usb. We're also on the go a lot and always bring a lot of our electronics with us, but not always are we near an outlet to charge them.I ordered this power bank in white and green, which I enjoy as it is a different look from the other black power banks I own. When it arrived I pushed the power button on the side and the four LED lights on the side of the power bank lit up to show it was fully charged, excellent! My iphone 6 was at 12% battery and needed a charge. This power bank comes with a short charging cable for charging the power bank, so I used the lightning cable that came with my iphone 6 to charge the phone. It went from 12% to a full charge in a little over an hour, which is really quick. After charging my iphone 6 I used the power bank to try and charge my ipad 3, which is a 10 inch ipad. It wasn't able to charge it fully but, did charge it from 10% to 65% charged in a few hours before the battery drained from the power bank. I recharged the power bank plugged into a usb wall outlet using the provided usb charging cable, and it took about 8 hours to fully charge again.I've had this portable charger for a little over a week now. After recharging this power bank fully, I charged my iphone 6 from 20% to full charge, the next day charged my iphone 6 again from 30% to full charge and at the same time since this has a dual usb ports, charge my ipad 3 while my son used the ipad 3 for a little over an hour playing games, and then charged my iphone 6 a few days later from 17% to full charge as well as my husbands Nexus 6 phone at the same time. After all that,  I still have half power (two LED lights lit) on the power bank. That's pretty impressive to me!This power bank also has a built in flashlight on the top next to the dual usb ports. Pushing the power button on the side twice activates the flashlight. The flashlight is very bright, and also has three different levels of brightness, as well as a strobe light (will blink off and on) which can be adjusted by pushing the power button once each time. The only thing I'd like to see improved on this power bank is the outside surface is really smooth, and I've dropped it three times so far by accident while using it. Although the power bank didn't break or damage any of those times, so it's pretty durable. The power bank also had a little weight and bulk to it, as I'd expect from a 13000mAh power bank. Overall, I'm really impressed with the flashlights brightness and that the level of brightness can be adjusted. The amount of times and speed at which I can charge our electronic devices on one full charge of this power bank is extremely impressive! I would definitely recommend this portable power bank!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW2HAKU0JDP42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4WPVUG#wasThisHelpful","RW2HAKU0JDP42","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chalk markers are so much fun and easy to use. I enjoy using this set of 18 chalk markers by Stardom Crafts on my Jeep windows for when we have swim meets to encourage my son and his team to do well, for reminder notes to my husband on a chalk board we have, as he never seems to see any sticky notes I have used, and also for easy decorations during the holidays on my house windows.The markers are easy to prime for first use by shaking them up and down for about 20-30 seconds, then pushing down on the tips of them until you start to see the white tip fill with the colored liquid chalk, which I just use a tissue or piece of paper to push the tip onto. I enjoy that I can just write and draw what I want on a non porous surface such as glass, and they easily wipe off with a wet paper towel to clean up the area. This saves me on wasting paper to write notes on that my husband doesn't seem to notice any way, and also having to store decorations like window clings somewhere and later forget where I put them for the next year. I also like that there is a removable tip to these chalk markers, which I haven't seen in other chalk markers I've used, so I can write in bold lines or use the other end that is chiseled for more thin lines.I would have liked to see more darker primary colors, such as dark blue, in this set instead of two different lighter blue shades, and also my box did not contain the colors that match the picture on the site page, which I would have loved to have had a red one for the 4th of July. Regardless of the colors, my son and I had a great time with these chalk markers and we look forward to continue using them around the house. They are easy to use and easy to clean up afterwards.Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UR9JKP6EP82W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW1H1NQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UR9JKP6EP82W","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I order this foldable travel duffel bag for my in laws who visit us one a year from Europe. They always are buying things to take home for their grandkids and other family members, as well as themselves, and then they need to buy another suitcase to put these items in.This foldable travel duffel bag is perfect for them and their travel needs. It comes folded in a compact size in a zip locked reusable storage bag, so it wouldn't take up much room in their suitcase to start with, and it is very light weight as well. On the inside this bag has a zippered nylon pocket inside, a spacious zippered mesh pocket, and also a side pocket to tuck some extra things into. On the top is a single zipper pull the glides across the bag easily to keep it securely shut. This is a very large duffel bag when unfolded, even though the size I ordered is a medium sized bag.On the outside is a zippered nylon pocket that is as deep as the bag is tall, and then another zipper pocket on the other side that isn't sewn into the bag so they can easily tote this page on top of their suitcases through the airport by sliding the suitcase handle between the pocket and the duffel bag itself. There are two grey nylon handles that are double stitched to the top of the bag for easy carrying, and also a grey shoulder strap made of the same material as the handles. I really enjoy that both the handles and the shoulder strap are adjustable, and have a clip that connect to the bag to make them removable for when not in use.  Overall, for this being a medium sized bag sure is huge and able to carry a lot of items.

"To me this 60 pack of Gel Pens set is the adult/older kid version of a big box of crayons for really little kids. I can remember being younger and writing on my notebooks in school, and there were very few colors to choose from, so if you were lucky enough to get a red pen, (back then used by teachers mainly for marking up your errors on your school papers), then you treated it like gold and kept it hidden and to yourself.This Gel pen set is completely awesome! There are a lot of colors and variety of pens to pick from like metallic and glitter, so everyone in the household can enjoy them, even the pickiest of the bunch! These are great for art projects for school, for the talented artist or even just to have fun with doodling. While using these pens they didn't leave ink blots on the paper, nor did they stop working or stutter in drawing the lines on the page with ink. I am left handed, and the best part of these pens, I think, is the ink dries quickly, so when I'm using them I don't get some ink transferred onto the side of my hand as other pens I've used do. Since it dries quickly, I also don't get a big smear mark going across the paper as well. That in itself is a huge plus in my book!! I would definitely recommend these Gel pens to anyone that is looking for a variety of colors and styles for serious work or even just to have some fun with!Sample provided for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEIXZRNTT4K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGQD4GU#wasThisHelpful","RXEIXZRNTT4K5","AEI2LU2WS53ON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEI2LU2WS53ON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After trying the eye cream I was pretty excited to have the opportunity to try this facial cream.  I find that it doesn't seem to provide the same results as the eye cream.  I've noticed no improvement to the tone of my skin or any fine lines.  Also, unlike the eye cream this has a very noticeable fragrance.  I do not like fragrance added to my facial products & do not care for the perfume smell.  What I like is this goes on very smooth, it absorbs quickly & is not the least bit greasy.  My skin feels moisturized unlike other products I've used that have made my skin greasy, dry or oddly a combination of the two.  Overall it's a nice lotion but there are other brands I like better.

"This is an okay cat food if you are wanting something that doesn't feature corn as the first ingredient & is free from dyes.  Personally I find the price point rather high when considering the ingredients.  Meat is first immediately followed by corn & while we humans like to focus on muscle meat being prime for our kitties, a cats natural diet does include more than muscle meat.  Just watch them hunt.  They will devour nearly the entire body.  Some may leave behind wings or heads, some eat it all.  Those are ""by products"".  Now I'm not saying that poultry litter scooped up off of some filthy CFO is okay in pet food, just pointing out that the extra stuff is actually good for a cat if it's acquired naturally.For my crazy cat household, the outdoor kitties get the less expensive kibble because they are hunters & do not have the same needs as the indoor kitties.  For the barn cats I typically get them WHISKAS MEATY SELECTIONS Chicken and Turkey Flavors Dry Cat Food.  It's not the best but meat is the first ingredient, it is free from dyes & is much more reasonably priced than this brand.  For the house cats I typically get Hill's Ideal Balance Grain Free Natural Chicken and Potato Recipe Adult Cat Dry Food.  I also feed the indoor kitties canned food.  The Nutro Company 24 Count Food Variety Chunky Loaf  Pack for Cats is one of my absolute favorite canned foods.What do the cats think of Pro Plan Savor Shredded Blend?  They don't like it.  They eat it but grudgingly.  They will sit by the bowl & stare at me clearly hoping I will put something else into their bowl.  They like Whiskas Meaty Selections better & love Ideal Balance the best.  While this is an okay cat food, it's not one I'm likely to buy in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GB89TEBVMFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T2BHUA#wasThisHelpful","R27GB89TEBVMFG","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a lot of gluten free flour mixes over the years (organic & not).  Out of all of them my go to choice has been Pamela's Products Gluten Free Artisan Flour Blend.  It works well enough.  I never thought it was fabulous, but I was getting by.  When the opportunity arose to try out bona dea's gluten free all purpose flour, I jumped at the chance & I'm glad I did.  This brand uses organic ingredients (not all are organic) & is Non GMO verified.  Pamela's Artisan Flour by comparison has no organic ingredients & is not non GMO verified.  Pamela's is cheaper, but in this case & many others, you get what you pay for.  I find bona dea is the better flour.  I made my back up brownie recipe for when I'm out of baking chocolate & it turned out great!  Nice chewy edges, not a crumbly mess that I get with the other brand.  I can't wait to try out my all time favorite brownie recipe once my baking chocolate arrives via Subscribe & Save!  I'm also curious to see how well this performs as pie crust.The one thing I don't like is the lack of recipes.  I guess I've been spoiled by Pamela's products as all of their various mixes contain lots of recipes all over the bags.  There isn't a single recipe included on the bag of bona dea.  You have to go the their website.  The website needs some work & is not fun to negotiate.  The heading bar is so big it takes up nearly half the page so it makes viewing the recipes a real pain.  If I was rating the website & not the product it would get one star.  Thankfully you shouldn't need their recipes as the claim is this can be used as you normally would in place of regular flour.  So far, that has been the case for me.  I will be back to update my review as needed.Overall I am very pleased with this flour.UPDATE 9-25-15My baking chocolate arrived & I made my favorite brownie recipe with this flour.

I've done it many times but keep in mind that while they are still tasty they are never as good as they are with butter.  Another option is to use shortening but personally I don't think it tastes very good.  If you are allergic to eggs try a different breed such as guinea, duck or turkey.  You might find you can eat them if you go with another type rather than the most commonly used chicken egg.

At first I wasn't sure why my hair was so fantastic.  It actually took me a few years until the light bulb went off & I realized my amazing hair started after taking collagen.  Prior my very long pin straight hair would get terrible split ends despite my constant visits to the salon.  Now my hair is to my butt, I have it trimmed once a year.  You heard that, once a year, to my butt & no split ends!  Trying to find split ends is like looking for a needle in a hay stack.  Collagen works!  Add to that each year I get older (obviously), yet my hair is glorious & I'm always getting compliments on my locks.With this said, I have to say that if you want to take Seeds Of Beauty (stupid name), go for it.  I'm sure it will work.  The problem I have with Seeds of Beauty is it's unnecessary, tastes awful, contains fructose, & costs 4 times more than the brand I mentioned above in the link.  I typically take around 3 tsp. a day or more of Great Lakes.  My preferred choice is to add one tsp. to each cup of tea.  It instantly dissolves & has no taste.  I sometimes add it to my milk kefir & yogurt as well.  I'm not knocking Seeds of Beauty, I just don't think it's necessary.  Personally I think Great Lakes Collagen is the better deal.  For the record I took one pkt. of Seeds of Beauty for 21 days (one box provides 21 days or 3 weeks of product) in addition to my usual amount of Great Lakes Collagen.  I have noticed no new improvements nor did I expect to, but as already mentioned I do firmly believe in the power of Collagen.  However you want it, get it - it's worth it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QAZI30PS5SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KZGVB2#wasThisHelpful","R32QAZI30PS5SP","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The amazon product page didn't show the full details on this bottle, but from what information I could gather it seemed like a pretty good supplement.  My husband has crazy hours so I was thinking this supplement would be great for him when he is recovering from his over nights & needs to get back into a more normal wake/sleep schedule.  His schedule along with a crazy cat family, means none of us ever really gets uninterrupted sleep.I decided to take one capsule (instructions say to take two) before bed.  Imagine my utter shock & dismay when I first opened the bottle to see electric blue capsules inside this bottle of ""natural"" rest.  I did a double take & then a closer look at the ingredients on the bottle.  Sure enough it contains toxic FD&C Blue #1 & Titanium Dioxide.  Thankfully I have my own plain empty gelatin capsules.  I dumped the contents out of one electric blue capsule onto a piece of paper & then dumped the contents into one of my clear empty gelatin capsules.  Only then did I take the supplement.  The now empty toxic blue capsule went into the trash where it belongs.So how does it work?  It worked great.  I was out for the night until the alarm went off.  I woke up to a dead mouse & never heard a thing (the kitties make a racket when they catch critters so this is a huge testament to the ability of this product to help one sleep).  On the down side I have been groggy all day which is not typical for me.  I can only assume this is a side effect of taking Natural Rest.  My husband will be taking this tonight to reset his clock after this weeks shift of overnights.  I'll be back to post an update if there is anything relevant to report - good or bad.Supplement Facts:Serving Size: 2 capsulesServings Per Container: 30Vitamin B-12 (Cyanocobalamin) 50 mcg  %DV: 833Calcium (Calcium Carbonate) 25 mg %DV: 2.5Magnesium (Oxide) 75 mg %DV: 19Zinc (Zinc Oxide) 25 mg %DV: 167Proprietary Blend 403 mg:  Ashwaganda powder, hops flower powder, lavender powder, valerian root powder, melatoninOther Ingredients:  Gelatin, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Rice Flour, Magnesium Stearate, FD&C Blue #1 & Titanium Dioxide.0 stars for the bad ingredients.  5 stars for effectiveness.  =  3 stars total.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33ZCKLLOI1A8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DULBB8Q#wasThisHelpful","R33ZCKLLOI1A8O","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first two things I noticed when applying this eye cream were: The cream felt velvety smooth & that it had a bite to it.  The bite, or burn if you will was not severe but was very unexpected.  It went away almost as fast as it came on.  Aside from that oddity I have experienced no negative side effects.  For about two weeks I only used this on one of my eyes to see if there was a difference.  When I became convinced that I was in fact seeing a very very slight improvement; plumper fuller looking skin around my aging eye, I decided to start using it on both eyes.  Again, on the other eye at the first application I experienced the burning, but again it went away within mere moments.This eye cream feels absolutely wonderful in comparison to my other brand which went on very ""wet"" aka watery & thin.  My highly sensitive skin while prone to breaking out is also prone to dryness.  This makes things pretty frustrating, but when it comes to the thin delicate skin around my eyes, the more moisturizing the better.I expect this will last a very long time, as only the teeniest amount is needed, making the price seem more realistic.  I'm thinking this should easily last me a year or longer.  I will be sure to update my review if I feel there is anything relevant to report - good or bad.  As it things stand now I'm very happy with this eye cream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOFYQ12JXVU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038CS02W#wasThisHelpful","R2UOFYQ12JXVU2","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like very sweet chocolate you will probably love this milk chocolate.  After reading some of the negative reviews I was concerned it would taste like that fake chocolate that doesn't even have chocolate in the ingredients or on the plus side it would taste like white chocolate which my sugar crazed self is addicted to.  Without having the ingredients provided I really had no idea what I was in store for.  So my chocolate bar arrived.  It was very soft due to the heat, but thankfully not ruined.  I put it in the freezer for a few minutes, pulled it out & took a bite.  My taste buds sang the sugar song as the smooth chocolate melted in my mouth.  Needless to say the bar is gone.  Good thing they didn't send me a case of 16.  Personally this isn't something I would buy due to my lack of control & the possibility of wheat contamination.I've included pictures of the back of the packaging so that you can see what's what since it isn't provided as of this review.

"During the winter my home is very dry due to having a wood stove as my only source of heat.  I keep a cast iron water kettle on the stove, adding cinnamon sticks as well as using a little aromatherapy unit in the upper level of my home: AromaFresh Ripple Handmade Ceramic Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser.  I like to add clove essential oil to the aromatherapy unit to compliment the cinnamon simmering on the stove.  Despite having these two items in place (and even occasionally cooking on the stove as well as heating water for tea & coffee) my home is still overly dry.  I decided to try out the Vicks humidifier in hopes it would solve this problem.  The filter & essential oil pads were a plus I was really looking forward to as well.Now that I've been using the unit I have to say it is even better than I'd hoped.  Unlike my ancient humidifier that I got rid of in frustration, it doesn't soak the area around it & the mist is invisible.  It feels like cool air, not wet at all.  On high the fan runs produces white noise.  I wake up very easily & as a result have to use ear plugs in order to get a good nights rest.  The problem with the ear plugs is eventually they cause eczema in my ears & I have to take a break from them.  Having this unit running provides not only the much needed humidity but also the soothing white noise to help me sleep.  Granted it's not as effective as ear plugs, but it is very helpful.  On low the unit hardly makes a sound & is not useful if white noise is desired, but if you want it running quiet it's the perfect setting.  Overall I am very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL28IRKWU3C3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410YUH8#wasThisHelpful","RL28IRKWU3C3Z","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been taking this for the past month & have notice no improvement to the health of my eyes.  About five years ago when I was stressed out & moving to another state, I discovered the little veins in one of my eyes burst & had a white bulge.  This discovery was when we finally arrived at our new home after driving in winter conditions for over 8 hours & it was about one in the morning.  Ever since then, I have had oddities with my eyes & this year started getting floaters.  I already eat about 1 lb of spinach a week, eat wild sockeye salmon two to four times a week, & I eat organic.  I am frustrated by the health of my eyes & disappointed that this product has not been helpful.  To be fair I have only consumed one months worth & have half the bottle to go.  That's why I gave it a three star review.

"I've passed on this brand of cat food so many times when at the store & now that I've had the opportunity to try it out I wish I hadn't selected other brands.  The size of the kibble is very small, small enough for kittens which is a huge plus in my multiple cat/kitten crazy cat lady household.  With my kitties, smaller kibble also means less waste.  With the larger kibble little bits crumble as they chew & fall into the bowl & onto floor.  They refuse to eat these bits creating a lot of waste.  This is not an issue with smaller kibble.  My most fussy cat loves the food which is another plus.  Overall I think this is a fantastic grain free dry food.

"Overall this is an okay thermometer.  It performs as advertised but you must have your device on hand otherwise the thermometer is worthless.  It (the thermometer) doesn't have any readings on it at all.  The big blank thing that says ""Vicks"" in the picture, that's what it looks like, no digital read-outs etc.  Also the cover mine came with to protect the probe when not in use literally didn't stay on.  It just fell off.  Absolutely 100% useless.  I don't understand how they didn't notice this obvious flaw.  I threw the cover away as it serves no purpose if I can't get it to stay on.  If you want to keep track of your families temps (I use this for my goats, it's great.), then you should be pretty happy with it.  If you just want something you can read in a hurry & don't need or want to keep track via technology, then a cheaper fast digital thermometer is the way to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GVVPG45W2KDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01410Z22U#wasThisHelpful","R2GVVPG45W2KDS","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't too sure how the dogs would react to this type of food (I normally feed them grain free kibble).  At first it was odd to be adding water to a powdered mix & then feeding it to the dogs rather than dumping kibble into bowls.  In the end it proved to be worth it.  The results were fantastic.  The dogs dug right in.  No gas, vomiting or any other nasty side effects resulting from such a huge change in food.  Overall I & my dogs are thrilled with this food.

"I'm so frustrated with this litter.  Every time I add fresh litter to the box, I dump out the old, wash & dry the box, then add the new litter.  I added this litter to a small litter box that the kittens use.  Now the box sits untouched.  I have been cleaning up urine & feces from all over the house spraying Bi-O-Kleen pretty much on every surface of the floor.  Prior to this I was using Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter with no issues.  There was the occasional accident outside of the box as the kittens learned where to go but 90% of the time they were using it regularly, not untouched like it is now.  When I say untouched, I mean exactly that, the box is not used at all thanks to this litter.  I have a total of three cat boxes in my home.  Two are too big for the kittens to use, the adult cats are still using the bigger litter boxes which both contain Precious Cat, NOT Cats Pride.  None of the animals will use the box containing Cats Pride.To make matters worse, the litter doesn't clump!  All you can do is sift out the solid waste.  The urine clumps disintegrate the moment you scoop them.  It's awful!*Update*  Was One Star, Changed To Two StarsAfter a lot of effort I was finally able to get the kittens to use the box.  The litter tracks a lot so along with that & the initial refusal to use the box, I'm not thrilled with this litter at all.

If you are looking for a great cat litter I highly recommend Precious Cat (linked to above) or Advance High Performance Scented Lightweight Multi-Cat Litter (note for some reason the price doubled for this on Amazon, not sure why, hopefully it goes back down).  If you have a problem with your cat using the box in general I highly recommend Precious Cat Cat Attract Problem Cat Training Litter  I used it a few years ago with 100% success.

"The Hunted continues where The Living left off.  The Living's ending was more like stopping the book mid chapter so The Hunted thankfully finishes the story.  Really this should have been one book.  Shy is now on land & as the title says, being hunted.  There are a lot of unbelievable circumstances & too many coincidences to make this a great book, but despite this it is a very entertaining read.  Shy & his companions find themselves on a very dangerous & difficult journey.  Along the way Shy learns a few things about himself.  Most of Shy's stupid decisions are stopped by something (much to his benefit) although at some point there is a huge drama scene with his companions.  This was over the top & the end results were a predictable.  It is possible that another book could be written regarding Shy's journey but it doesn't seem likely.  For the most part the books stick with somewhat realistic events as in ""it could happen"" except for one point that was completely out of character with the book having a wacky supernatural feel.  Don't get me wrong, I like plenty of supernatural books, but here it was nonsensical.  I was shaking my heading thinking the good ol', ""What the...""

"This novel is a heck of a crazy ride.  Told from several points of view, it all starts to come together in one very bizarre tale of horror & suffering that has lasted for centuries.  The main character Galvan aka ""The Righteous Messenger"" must deliver a beating heart into the hands of evil.  All sorts of odd things happen along the way, an army of zombie virgins, demons, bikers, good cops, bad cops, teenage kids in the crossfire, cults, &  more.  In the end, the fate of the world depends on the decisions Galvan makes while on his wild run across the desert to his final destination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FW4IP6VK1MXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006219965X#wasThisHelpful","R3FW4IP6VK1MXV","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice lotion that goes on very soft, smooth & non greasy.  It doesn't tug at the skin or dry before it can be properly massaged in, nor does it take too long to dry or leave any sticky or greasy residue.  It absorbs well & is wonderfully soothing to the skin.Even though there doesn't appear to be any added fragrance, it does have a strong rose perfume smell thanks to the essential oils.  The smell dissipates rather quickly so it isn't a problem.The packaging is odd.  I can't figure out if I like it or not.  It is square shaped & sits very nicely, but requires two hands to open & close.  Once open it is easy to use thanks to it's wide, low & stable stance.  In the product picture you are actually viewing the package (can't call it a bottle or tube because it's not) on it's side.I cannot make up my mind if I like Spotty Tots better than Weleda Baby White Mallow Cream.  They are both excellent all natural baby creams that are wonderful for delicate skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q3GFN7EH9MA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPY6V1W#wasThisHelpful","R2Q3GFN7EH9MA3","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a super fast paced horror slasher novel that leaves you eagerly turning the pages all the way to the end.  The only real downside was how often the heroine seemed to be hitting her head (doesn't she have the sense to put her hands out when she is falling?) & gulping in lungfuls of water (seriously anyone gulping in that much water into their lungs that often would have either choked to death or at the very least not been able to continue on as they did).  Despite these annoying occurrences I quite thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  I found the characters & their actions pretty realistic.  For those who've never had friends like this, it might seem over the top & unbelievable, but for others, they will be able to relate to not only the conflicting emotions, but also the decisions that are not always intelligently made.  Overall a very entertaining read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPA4W27OTRFMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147241#wasThisHelpful","RPA4W27OTRFMP","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rarely bother with cat treats because most are junk food & the cats don't seem overly enthusiastic about most of the treats I've bought on a whim.  They've always preferred their regular grain free kibble over any of the treats I've brought home.  Therefore these treats are a pleasant surprise.  Every one of my lovely bundles of purr love them.

"This is a long entertaining novel but the entire premise hinges on a trained killers failure.  The failure in light of the assassins normally robot like (aka unfeeling) killing precision didn't fit, but if the assassin had killed like normal, the rest of the story simply couldn't happen.  This was a real fault in the novel for me.  It is highly entertaining, sometimes totally & ridiculously unbelievable but still a fun read.  Imagine traveling back in time (but not really), visiting another world a whole heck of a lot like Earth in order to complete a mission & make it back to your own time/world before you forget everything.  Also imagine that this is our future so a lot of the technology is pretty cool & ""out there"".  Zero World definitely fits the bill as a Sci-Fi thriller.  The end is left wide open for a sequel.  It doesn't leave the reader hanging with an abrupt ending but it was a bit frustrating to realize that the remaining pages were for a novella based on The Darwin Elevator rather than a continuation of Zero World.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FOV2KOSA62UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391267#wasThisHelpful","R2FOV2KOSA62UM","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the convince & ease of use of this machine but I am extremely disappointed in the very limited variety of K-Cups the 2.0 & later will accept.  Keurig made it so inconvenient that their own older style K-Cups will not work in this machine.  Thankfully there is a way around their desire to monopolize the K-Cup industry.  First, if you have some K-Cups that are 2.0 compliant, save the lid & put it over your non compliant K-Cup & then you can use your non approved K-Cup.  You can also buy special stickers (I haven't tried this).  Last you can order a re-usable brewer cup to brew your own loose coffees & teas.  I ordered the Keurig Reuseable Kup for 2.0 & 1.0 Brewers & can happily tell you that it works perfectly.  I love it!Once you get past the K-Cup situation, the Keurig really is fantastic for it's convenience, ease of use, & space saving abilities.  The touch screen is very sensitive, even with wet fingers.  I love having one machine for coffee, tea & cocoa.  This means no more separate machines to satisfy everyone's tastes.  This frees up precious counter space in my teeny tiny kitchen, so this is a big deal in my household.  You can even purchase K-cup Storage 2 Drawers Holder for Keurig K-cup Coffee Pods that the brewer sits on, saving even more space.Overall (aside from the proprietary nonsense with the cups) the whole family loves this machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D895A6M6O7CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWEAXPY#wasThisHelpful","R2D895A6M6O7CI","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to try this for when I'm at the farmers market without any help & as a result cannot leave my booth to get to the bathroom during my monthly & also so that I can actually sleep through the night rather than have to get up within 4 hours replace an overfilled sanitary product.  Even though they are listed as a size small (and don't come any size smaller), they are still a bit too big for my petite frame.  The waist is rather high, so a long shirt is a must.  I find they are not very comfortable but it is either that or risk embarrassing myself when I have an accident & as already mentioned cannot get to the bathroom to remedy the situation.  I usually wear a nice long, loose & flowing gypsy skirt on the days I have to wear this bit of uncomfortable back up as I feel it is the best way to hide the fact that I'm wearing a diaper.

"Despite having a list of amazing figures in history like Tesla, Thomas Edison, Goodrich, Earhart & more this novel fell flat.  None of the characters are well developed.  For the most part the book was rather boring & unbelievable.  The author failed miserably in creating characters I could care about.  Bad guy or good guy so what?  They were totally flat & one dimensional.  So much could have been done to make this into a great book.  All the elements are there, but alas it's a dud.  Mary's Jujutsu skills reminded me of 'Pride Prejuduce & Zombies' but rather than find her unconventional ability interesting, all it did was point out how poor a job the author did with the character when I reflected on PP&Z which I found hilarious & highly entertaining.While there are no paranormal aspects to this novel, I recommended the Souless series by Gail Carriger if you enjoy witty unconventional Victorian women.I am thrilled to be finally done slogging through 'Second Street Station'.

"I was thrilled to see that Traditional Medicinals made a few of their awesome teas for the Keurig.  I read the questions from customers asking if these fit the newer 2.0 model & the response was, ""Yes.""  I want to let others know that this is not true.  Unfortunately I learned about Keurig's tactics after getting my 250 model.  Thankfully there is a way around Keurig's greedy BS.  You have to save the lid from a Keurig approved K-cup.  Put it directly on top of the non approved K-cup & then you can enjoy your brew.  I ordered a Keurig Reuseable Kup for 2.0 and 1.0 Brewers that is supposed to let you brew your own without needing any K-cups but it hasn't arrived yet.  Hopefully it works.  Personally I only consume organic & as a result the Keurig approved organic options are extremely limited.  My opinion of Keurig is not very high no matter how nice the machine is now that I have to jump through hoops just to enjoy my favorite organics.Regarding the Dandelion Root tea, it is one of my favorites.  It can make you poo so don't over do it.  It makes for an excellent herbal caffeine free coffee alternative.  The flavor is strong & bitter.  I like to dress it up with honey & MCT oil (aka Bullet Proof), coconut milk or cream.  If you use an oil you will need to use a blender to emulsify the oil otherwise it will float on top which is not pleasant.  You can even add cocoa powder to it (with or without the fat & honey) for an extra rich treat.It is my understanding that for dandelion root to truly be able to do it's job as a healthful bitter herb, you shouldn't sweeten it or add anything to it as you need to taste the bitter for your body to respond in kind.  I have drank it this way & find it is very unpleasant.  If you can tolerate it or like drinking your coffee &/or tea black, you will probably love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RV0VRW94RRQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LEQ66LG#wasThisHelpful","R3RV0VRW94RRQM","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are plump & sticky; similar to raisins.  The flavor & texture is much better than the organic goji berries I've had in the past.  I typically eat them in trail mix or as a dessert with dark chocolate.  These arrived vacuum sealed so they were all stuck together in one big mass.  The taste is slightly sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  They are good alone as well as added to loose leaf tea (brew as usual).  If you add them to yogurt the night before, they will plump up a bit making them even softer as well as adding some flavor variety to the yogurt.

Admittedly they are nowhere near as beautiful as my old curtains once were, but they do look much prettier than my vintage curtains thanks to how crisp & brilliantly white they are in comparison to the old curtains which became dingy & suffered much abuse by the animals.

The cooler managed to keep the bottle from getting hot, but the liquid was only slightly cool.  Note this was kept out of direct sunlight the entire day.  The only way I believe this makes for safe transport of any perishable liquids is to use it for under 3 hours.  Two hours is probably better.

I don't have concrete or asphalt, just farmland, even so the ball  bounces rather well on the cut pasture grass & dirt much to the delight of my dogs.  They run around with it in their mouths, drop it, it bounces, they doggy pounce it, kick it, it rolls away, they chase after it.  On & on goes the fun.

Sam's challenges were much more real this time around & her relationship with Nick seemed a lot more realistic as well.

"This is a great little book for beginners or for those who simply want to add a full color herb book to their collection.  The bare basics are covered but I did find it annoying that the author introduced recipes utilizing herbs she doesn't discuss.  So if you want to learn about many of the herbs in her recipes, you will want to refer to another book.  What I like about the book is it's simplicity & full color photographs.  The book only covers 20 herbs so it is easy to do a quick search for a refresher on the basics.  Each section is very short so it really keeps things simple without adding too much information for a beginner to absorb.While I like this book & am glad to have it in my collection, I strongly recommend that if you are seriously interested in herbs, you get books that are a bit more informative than this one.  I highly recommend Rosemary Gladstar's Medicinal Herbs: A Beginner's Guide: 33 Healing Herbs to Know, Grow, and Use, Rosemary Gladstar's Herbal Recipes for Vibrant Health: 175 Teas, Tonics, Oils, Salves, Tinctures, and Other Natural Remedies for the Entire Family, & The Complete Herbal Tutor: The ideal companion for study and practice.  I own all three of these books as well as some others & I have to say they are worth every penny.Bottom line this is a lovely book suitable for anyone interesting in getting their toes wet in herbalism or anyone wanting to add another book to their growing collection.  As the author states, ""I recommend finding one or two new plants each year.  Find them, sit with them, and observe them... Use them.  Make them into every kind of preparation....Cook with them, make them into salve, tincture, tea,... Once you know them, they will be a part of your herbal repertoire forever.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1XPNYZ0LN4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592336507#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1XPNYZ0LN4F","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cats are all nuts about this cat food.  I was able to try out all three flavors & have to say they were all received with gusto.  My crazy sauce loving cat licks up all the sauce she can, leaving the chunks for my other cat to gobble up.  I'm very happy to report that there is no guar gum or carrageenan in this food as it typically is in other canned foods.  This is in fact the first quality canned food I've come across that doesn't contain one or the other, including the certified organic brands.  What I don't like is the addition of caramel color.  If you are listening Hills, lets get the coloring out of the food too!Other grain free canned foods I've recently tried that the cats love are Nutro Breakfast Scrambles Tuna & Egg (be warned this stuff stinks! But it isn't saucy so my sauce head cat has to actually eat the food) & Purina Pro Plan True Nature (not as saucy as Crafted so, again the sauce head eats more food).

"This is a really cute toy with an adorable little yellow faux fur chick with a yellow feather tail that reminds me of a Polish chick (the breed of chicken with the adorable top hat).  The plastic ball is much bigger than I had expected at about 4"".  It is supposed to contain catnip, but it smelled like mint to me (by the next day, the smell was gone).  After pulling the tab to activate the bird, I put it on the floor for my cats.  My younger & more playful cat was both curious & slightly afraid, but she did start carefully poking her paw through the cage to tap at the little moving bird head.  The ball wasn't rolling.  I attributed that to the long materials tag sticking out of the birds bum.  I tugged on the tag but it wouldn't budge so I maneuvered scissors into the cage & cut it off.  As I was placing it back onto the floor a little plastic piece hit the floor.  It was part of the perch the bird is on.  Either I broke it or it was broken when it arrived.  I super glued it back together & let it dry overnight.After reintroducing it to the cats, it doesn't get the amount of play that it should.  They only found it interesting for a few minutes.  Because it makes noise (the mechanical noise is surprising loud plus it gives a few chirps) only when activated, I'll know if they are playing with it.  I haven't heard a thing for days.  I'm pretty disappointed the cats aren't interested in it as it seems like it should be a good time.*Update* 10-18-15Was 3 StarsWith new kittens in the house again, this toy became an instant hit.  All day & night I would hear this toy being played with whene the kittens were awake.  They absolutely love it.  The older cats still show no interest, but for kittens & young cats it is awesome!

"Compared to the first book in the series, Fatal Justice was a little flat & not nearly as exciting.  The relationship between Sam & Nick didn't feel real.  Nick was too perfect & Sam was an unbearable bitch.  All I could think was how can any man put up with with a woman with such a bad attitude with a genuine smile on his face & somehow manage to say the perfect thing to make it all better?  It's fantasy land to the extreme.  Despite this, the story is entertaining in a beach read type of way.  It's not something I'd ever purchase, but it's worth checking out from the library for a mild diversion.  Hopefully Force manages to recapture what made the first book so good in her third book.  Fingers crossed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQ00SJ70CXN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037300222X#wasThisHelpful","R1TQ00SJ70CXN4","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really fun way to send off a less than ho hum typical greeting card.  In order to use you need to pull of the thin film that has the saying ""Live well.  Laugh Hard.  Love Big!""  Underneath the film is a blank chalkboard where you can write whatever you want.  It is easy to write on with included chalk pencil & equally as easy to erase after writing on it.Overall I was really impressed until I went to peel off the thin film & the mini chalkboard came right off the card & fell on my lap.  There are a mere two little thin strips of double sided tape that keep the board attached to the card.  I pressed the board back onto the card forcefully & it seems to be holding.  The board itself is made of wood so it could be removed & used for a kid or adult to play with without having to deal with the card if that's what you want to do or display it in some way.Note:  If you plan to mail this to someone, you will need to pack it in a padded envelope with extra postage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K3RZJUHHFQHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPEAV9W#wasThisHelpful","R1K3RZJUHHFQHB","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my eye on the kraft Avery shipping labels for a while now for my small family farm business.  Due to the much higher cost then just printing out on regular printer paper & taping the label to the pkg. I never ordered them.  When the opportunity came to try these white Avery labels, I jumped on it.  The box they come in is pretty big & rather heavy.  The labels are two to a sheet & take up the entire 8 x 10 space.  This is great if your printer is off or you want to make the label bigger, add your own business logo etc.  I must admit the end result is much more professional looking than my cut & tape method.  It is also much quicker, just peel & stick.  The labels are thin; similar to paper, so they don't block out images for when you chose to re-use a shipping box or envelope.  They perform exactly as advertised, they do not jam in any of my printers nor does the ink smudge.  Overall I'm very pleased with the results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BD2LQQYN8E7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIYVHIW#wasThisHelpful","R2BD2LQQYN8E7Z","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I run a organic farm & despite wearing a hat & tinted moisturizer with SPF 15, I still show signs of sun damage & of course aging (can't really escape that one).  I have been using this product for a little over a month & so far have experienced positive results.  I find one pump is more than enough product to lightly cover my entire face.  I apply eye cream first, then this serum, then my tinted moisturizer with SPF 15.  Normally I apply a bronzing powder & blush over the moisturizer because if I don't my face looks shiny.  Using this serum, even with over a week of highs in the upper 80's / lower 90's & working outdoors, my skin remains dry & smooth.  I have never experienced anything like it.  If this was the winter, I doubt I'd be able to use a serum such as this.In the evening after washing my face I again apply my eye cream, then this serum & then pure organic argan oil.  In the morning my skin is not greasy, it is smooth & dry.  Once I went to bed & forgot to apply the argan oil.  My skin burned a little & felt very tight.  When I woke up the next morning I applied a little argan oil.  Aside from that I have nothing negative to report.I was very concerned that it would cause my skin to burn & turn red (called blushing in the instructions).  This has not happened, nor has my skin flaked.  I think my skin looks a little brighter & even toned, but considering the short amount of time I've been using this, I could just be seeing what I want to see (sorry but I tend to be pretty skeptical of products like this).I anticipate this bottle will last a long time.  I'm very curious to see what the end results are after long time use.  I will return to post any relevant updates should they arise.  Overall, I think this is worth trying if you can afford it, but I'm not too sure this is something you would want to use in the winter unless you have excessively oily skin.UPDATE 7-15-15 (was 5 stars at time of original review):This lasted a little over 2 months.  I do not feel that the results are worth the price.  I think it improved very very minor marks but not the more noticeable marks.  I do think it improved my skin (hence not rating it any lower than 4 stars) but I don't feel it delivered the kind of results it promised.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3BLELODID3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRG4BSE#wasThisHelpful","R1H3BLELODID3S","A1RLP0R1N8H8C4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RLP0R1N8H8C4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Zensah Peek Running Socks is the most wonderful socks I've come across for workouts as well as hiking. When I go on a shorter hike during hot weather I like wearing low cut hiking shoes rather than boots. The socks wick moisture away from feet to keep them much more comfortable and cut down on blisters and rubbing. The seamless toe it a real plus because it's more comfortable and won't rub the edges of your toes.They keep your feet from sliding around in your shoes like some socks do when you're working out, jogging, or hiking. They keep my feet feeling good so I can be less focused on my feet and more focused on the activity I'm involved in at the time.

It's written with such a smooth, lyrical, flow that it simply carries you effortlessly from page to page.There's a lot to learn about the injustice he experienced, the trouble he found himself in, and the changes in him that catapulted him to be one of the most influential leaders in the Afro-American Community in the 1960's.For a YA book, it carries a powerful message.

"These are so lovely and I really love how they look on me. Yes, they do pinch your upper ear but I remedied that by cutting a little moleskin and put it on the part that touches the back of your ear and cut a little strip to put over the part that touches the front of the ear placing it vertically. I think it's the thin front edge of the ear clip that digs into the ear. I'm a hiker so I've always got moleskin around for blisters on my feet, also good when new shoes give you blisters.These ear cuffs are a richer, yellow gold color than the photos on this page show. The little crystals add just the right amount of sparkly bling to each wing. You'll see that they do look MUCH nicer when you actually have them. They make me feel angelic as if I'm wearing angel wings; and would love it if they invited angels to come and whisper good things to me. Not sure they'll really be inviting angels to stop by but it's a nice thought.Wearing these ear cuffs with dressy casual works as well as with evening wear.

"""The Silver Swan"" by Elena Delbanco was a disappointment. This story could have been so much more. On one hand, much of the story is very well written with great characters. On the other hand, much of the dialogue and scenes are shallow and not up to the quality of the characters or the writing in other parts of the book.This is a book I wish I had passed on.

"""The Road to Character"" by David Brooks provides important food for thought. I like his ideas on humility, something that we see less and less of. I see humility as a strength while I know others who view it as a weakness. Following this road to character is not an easy one and one that requires constant monitoring of yourself.With so much brashness and flaunting of self these days it's too easy to lose track of our inner self. Too easy to lose track of what it means to have character and poise and grace. This book gives us not only a reminder of the important aspects of who we are but a road to follow in order to discover or rediscover our character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R351FGE5OQA7OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081299325X#wasThisHelpful","R351FGE5OQA7OE","A2PD27UKAD3Q00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PD27UKAD3Q00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A Real Guide to Really Getting It Together Once and for All: (Really)"" by Ashley Rickards is a great book for gals in their late teens to young adult. But, there is a little something in there for ladies of all ages. A great book to buy for a daughter, niece, or granddaughter that you can spend some time reading when she's not home!

Tips on hair, make-up, entertaining, decorating, relationships of all types, you name it. It's easy to read and easy to follow. No complicated examples with impossible directions for how to do nearly impossible things without a staff of beauticians, designers, decorators, blah blah blah.I really enjoy having this book and I'm of the older lady persuasion.

"""The Bone Tree (Penn Cage)"" by Greg Iles didn't hold up for me. I found it tedious and a bit trendy with all the Civil Rights and JFK stuff. There seems to be a lot of those topics being tied into TV, movies, and books these days. So much it's almost as convenient taking sure fire emotional triggers from the 60's is the updated version of throwing in a couple Nazis in a WWII era film to get a rise out of the audience whether it fits into or is necessary to the story. Not to mention the JFK theory didn't fly with me in the least. Nor did the chat with Castro.I enjoyed ""Natchez Burning"" and ""Spandau Phoenix"" immensely. ""The Bone Tree"" just didn't hold up to those other books by Iles.If a book has as many pages as this book has I don't mind if the book is a good one. In fact, a good book is a great read no matter how long it is. But a book that isn't to my liking is seriously long no matter how short it is.

"This is an exceptional mini tablet that really took me by surprise. I love how portable it is. It fits in my purse or backpack with no problem.

"Brightech's LightView PRO SuperBright Magnifier Floor Lamp with 60 LED's is the perfect lamp for reading when you have trouble with smaller print, for hobbies like stamp collecting or model building, or over a table for doing detailed artwork.

And it's also great when I need to make out super fine print when my aging eyes just aren't seeing it like they used to.The light is a bright, full spectrum light that allows you to see true color. So the colors I see in my art in my studio is the same colors I see in my art when I take it outside and view it in sunlight.Whether you want to work on art or read the next best seller on your ""To Read"" list, closely examine the new stamps you've purchased at auction or actually read the fine print in that contract, this is the lamp you've got to have!And it saves on the amount of money it costs to have a light on.

"""My Paris Dream: An Education in Style, Slang, and Seduction in the Great City on the Seine"" by Kate Betts is a terrific memoir about the authors escapades in Paris and its fashion industry. It gives great incite into an Australian doing her best to make a life in the City of Lights, international center of high fashion, art, culture, etc. etc. etc. She does a great job of translating the behavior, style, slang, and so forth.It's an eye opening book about the people of Paris as well as a very enjoyable read. I dream of going to Paris and eat up almost any book or movie from or about Paris. If I can't be there, I need everything I can get my hands on and brain into to feed the dream. This book did not disappoint.A perfect read for anyone who dreams of Paris whether you've been there or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYYY87HACGTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679644423#wasThisHelpful","R2FYYY87HACGTW","A2PD27UKAD3Q00","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PD27UKAD3Q00?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful product that is very well made.  Each section is made of a slightly different fabric and various pieces are crinkly (such as one leg, one ear, the antlers, etc.).  It's a good size too - big enough for a baby to roll around on but small enough to fold up and bring somewhere.As a mom of a ton of kids though, I'd be hesitant to give this as a gift because it's not terribly practical.  If you're using it for travel then it's really geared toward parents who don't mind schlepping a ton of stuff around.  I think a more seasoned parent would probably pack a blanket and taggie  (such as this one click here) instead.  This mat really is not quite a rug and not quite a blanket, so truly it's only purpose would be as a play mat.  If that's what you're looking for, this is a great choice.  As a mom of a bunch of kids though, personally I tend to gravitate towards the things that are more practical.Also as others have pointed out, it's very, very pink.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFJ8853B78U8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V408WVE#wasThisHelpful","R1KFJ8853B78U8","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book changed my life.  Her examples of idolatry as Christians currently experience it in our modern world were some of the deepest thoughts I've ever read.  She assumes you're a mature Christian struggling to live life with the passion you once had.  Her examples of idolatry include things like your to do list, your kids' accomplishments, your schedule and anything else that stresses you out.  The way that she encourages you to identify ways that God is not first are extremely helpful.  I can't praise this book enough.  I think I easily highlighted about 50% of it.

"I really enjoyed this study and got a ton out of it.  I did it alone and while I think a group would have been great, it was pretty awesome as a solo study as well.  I thought it was very well written, thought provoking, and looking at topics that aren't frequented in Christian circles.  I specifically thought that her exploration of idolatry went really well with another book I'm reading called Because He Loves Me.There were a few things she could have done differently that would have really set this book apart.  One is that she doesn't go very deep at all with her personal examples, and I would have loved to learn more about her personally.  I think that a Bible teacher does well to share their own struggles and she really doesn't.There were also a few times (thought not many) that she overextends an application.  For example, she talks about getting a group together and anointing each other.  Umm, what?Practically there were about 90% of the Bible references included in the text and you had to look up the rest.  I have little kids and I would have LOVED it if they were all included.  I know how to use my Bible and practically it's just easier when it's all right there.Those were all minor things though.  I feel so blessed to have done this study.  Her thoughts on focusing on the source of our provision, idolatry, self care and many other topics were dead on and thought provoking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATWU2XHD4CKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426778422#wasThisHelpful","R2ATWU2XHD4CKD","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are even better than I expected.  They are front lined, as others have mentioned, which is sort of unnecessary.  The bottom line is that kids can wear them alone.  My daughter is tall and thin and these fit her perfectly - they were a touch loose, longer than I expected, and easy to cinch around the waist.  I was glad that they weren't skin tight and that they were long.  They're actually pretty modest.  She's really pleased with them and finds them comfortable - which she's pretty picky about.  I would definitely order these again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWBURVLYF9PG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2BX9Y2#wasThisHelpful","R1MWBURVLYF9PG","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this aloud to my 9 and 6 year old and found it extremely confusing.  Maybe I'm slow on the uptake but it look me a while to figure out that the ""furless"" were humans and that ""deathways"" were roads, etc.  My kids kept asking me to explain the book and I wasn't sure what they were talking about.  The story is very dark and sad - Isla's family disappears almost immediately (with a lot of talk about fur and blood) and basically all she talks about the rest of the book is how depressed and upset she is about it.  I personally even found it a little disturbing.For kids into dark fantasy this will hit a sweet spot, but for kids used to lighter books I would avoid this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXION5BCA575/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545690811#wasThisHelpful","R2KXION5BCA575","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is clearly intended for early readers and not meant to be anything deep or meaningful.  I started out thinking the sisters would have a great relationship because the first part of the book doesn't elevate Beatrix (the one with magic) in any way.  I thought it would be interesting to explore that.  Instead, Beatrix ends up being pretty obnoxious and harassing Olive with her magic, which results in Olive retaliating with a prank which goes awry and they have to work together (without adults) to solve the problem.Again, there's no moral here and the witch part is not deep either, so easy to gloss over for those who may find it more objectionable.  She has magic because she was born at midnight on a full moon, not for any deep reason.  I actually appreciated that because I don't mind magic as a playful concept but prefer to avoid it otherwise.My kids found it entertaining but it's not something they revisit a lot.  Overall it's a cute story with no moral lesson and good for reading practice.  As long as that's what you're expecting it's worth the read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRSWS3NM4NLRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545814804#wasThisHelpful","RRSWS3NM4NLRX","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice kit with liquid watercolors that are fun to mix, as opposed to the cheap kind you can't mix, but it didn't entertain my artistic 9 year old for very long.  She painted two of the pictures and never finished the third, and the results weren't very impressive.  I also didn't think she actually learned anything using the kit, which was my hope since she seems interested in watercolors.  The pamphlet it comes with is not very instructional.

"This is an incredibly well designed game with excellent components and really good replay because the puzzle is constantly changing.  Every time you put out the six cards you have different rules to follow.  I love that it was time limited so that it can't drag on forever.  My kids, ages 9 and 6, were able to pick up on it pretty quickly and enjoyed playing it also.  So I would say definitely 4 stars for people looking for a logic game, especially because you can play it with more than one person (unlike other logic games we own).If you don't love logic games, like me, you may not really enjoy this.  Also if you're like me and are married to an engineer you may not win - ever.  That sort of ruins the experience for me personally.  It's not how I think and makes me feel stupid so I didn't enjoy this personally, but it is well designed and I'd recommend it for the genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9WKCBUO5VPDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY3U8#wasThisHelpful","R9WKCBUO5VPDU","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this game.  It's a nice placement game where you're trying to control islands by placing bridges (small rectangular pieces) between the islands.  If you have a majority of the bridges in place then you control that island and place a circle on it.  Whoever controls the most at the end wins.  The theme isn't strong so it's really more of an abstract.If you're glancing quickly then the cover is a little deceiving.  There's nothing hand related about the game and the board is literally a bunch of islands on it that look nothing like a hand.  I do wish that rather than going the magical route they would have gone the geographical route and maybe also made the game into a geography game.  It would have worked really well that way.Even so my husband and I enjoyed playing it together.  I don't think it has extensive replay abilities for adults since you're limited by the cards and therefore limited in strategy.  Once you've figured out the best strategy then it wouldn't be that interesting to play.  Even still, for kids and the non-serious gamer this is a well designed game that makes for a fun experience if you don't want to think too hard.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHJIBM1NB5DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","RAHJIBM1NB5DL","A2QCE7L6GRE3MT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QCE7L6GRE3MT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is just what I needed! I've been just putting the cork back on my wine, but it never really tasted the same after 1st open. Now I've been testing out this Rabbit preserver and my wine definitely tests much better compared to shoving the cork back. I found it easy to use, well made and not to many bells and whistles to store. Definitely will be my go-to gift for wine lovers.

"I'm a sucker for a good steam mop and am always looking for the perfect one with TONS of steam and a deep clean. This one was easy to assemble, just a moment or two. Theres one tank with two places to fill it. The solution is one spot and water in the other. I personally like cleaning with white vinegar, so once I've finished the solution I'll switch over to that. As for cleaning with it, I love the shape of the bottom and it has a nice swivel to it to reach corners. The big con I found is that it's verging on painful to hold down the steam trigger the entire time. I'm only 34 so it's nothing like old age making this aggravating.  I'd like it better if it had the options for bursts of steam or to lock it for continuous steam. I found the streamsteam button on the bottom, but then it switched it to steam only. I do like the idea of the grout brush, but I don't currently have any grout, only hardwood and vinyl tile. I suppose it could come in handy if I had a dried on spill though. Over all I do like this steamer but have found my favorite is still this black and decker one: http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-BDH1850SM-Steam-Mop/dp/B00B92CN5S/ref=cm_cr-mr-title","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1187D65CTPQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVNT2FI#wasThisHelpful","R1187D65CTPQV","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't used eyeliner in awhile just out of pure laziness, but when I saw this I figured it's time to revisit. Jillian Dempsey is known as being a really great makeup artist, so I was curious what she could do creating her own line. I loved that one end was eyeliner and the other was a smudger. I got the rich brown and it worked perfectly for me. It is indeed a ""rich"" brown - warm and chocolatey. It was easy to smudge and manipulate which I appreciated. No tugging and smooth application. I'd try this in black as well.

"Updated 10/15:I've had this blanket for exactly a year when the controller stopped working. It flashes ""F"" and doesn't heat anymore. I've contacted sunbeam by email and besides being sluggish with their replies, they want me to pay to send it to them to be fixed or replaced. For something under a 5 year warranty, I expect them to take care of all costs. Avoid sunbeam products. They never seem to last long.ORIGINAL review: I had a heated blanket I loved using on the couch that recently went kaput. I've been holding off on getting a new one but now that I'm freezing here in New England, it was time. I've been a heated blanket lover since they put flying unicorns on them(in the 80s. so awesome.) but now, a microplush in a sophisticated walnut will do just fine. This one gets super hot which makes me very happy. I now realize I also need a new one for my bed, which gets mediocre warm.

"I find Juice beauty to be hit or miss, which can be frustrating. Like most, I'd much prefer to use an organic natural product, but unfortunately this didn't do much for me. I have hormonal breakouts and my skin has been changing as I get older(I'm 34) so I've gotten more careful about what I use. This didn't sink in like a serum like I expected.

"I eat well,except for my annoying sweet tooth, exercise every day(weather permitting) and hit the gym a few times a week. I mainly wanted a protein powder because I get too busy for breakfast or lunch most days and this is fast and easy for me. I've been through many different protein powders but can never find just what I want. A lot of the times I thought I could deal with certain aspects but over time just grew to hate them. The one that specifically comes to mind that I really didn't like was the sunwarrior warrior blend protein vanilla. Too gritty and too much of a weird aftertaste.I wasn't too hopeful when I decided to try this, but it fit what I always look for(specifically a lack of biotin) so I thought I'd give it a shot. I blended 20grams of this powder with 10 oz of Tazo pumpkin latte and maybe 3 oz of coconut milk in my ninja. Its surprisingly delicious! I think I might also try it warmed up, it's almost like a yummy regular pumpkin latte. It seems almost impossible to find a sugar free protein that doesn't taste like crap but this one is listed as no sugar added and just has some stevia. It doesn't taste overly sweet but was just the perfect sweet level for me. No gross aftertaste either. I'd definitely try the chocolate flavor of this protein.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYP659LXCVUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYRXIIS#wasThisHelpful","R3LYP659LXCVUO","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I was a kid, I thought a giant box from an appliance was AWESOME. I loved creating cool things from my imagination and especially coloring on it. I thought this would be a really fun gift for 2 little kids. Not only can you color to your hearts content but it's also a cool house you can go inside of!. Easy to set up and pretty sturdy. The only thing I'd do would be to swap out for some better markers, maybe using the tried and true crayola washables. I didn't really see the need for the double tips of these markers, caps were lost in an instant.

"I bought my first house 2 years ago, which means there is always a new project to tackle. Tools galore are necessary, and figuring out where to store them can be a hassle due to the size of some! I thought this would be a great multi purpose tool to have, and boy is it ever! It's well made, very substantial feel to it. I love that it's fairly small and easy to tuck away, big fan of the box it came with to keep it all together. So far it's been a dream to use and easy to figure out. I would definitely get this for some other people in my family who love tools because it will become a staple in the arsenal.

I was looking forward to trying this and thought it would help me get out the door. Pros: It definitely gave me a boost so I didn't feel as sluggish. I felt more of a kick in the pants so I also did more at the gym instead of thinking ""oh, I'll do that next time"".Neutral: the taste is just meh. It's not amazing but it's not horrific.

"I got this to try out this new zoodle situation (zucchini noodles) that I've been reading about. I've already been eating spaghetti squash as ""pasta"" with marinara sauce, so I thought the zucchini would be fun to try. I read about a few different spiral veggie items, and at first ordered the vegetti, which fell apart the moment I tried to use it. Talk about annoyed! I almost gave up entirely, but thought I'd try a spiral cutter that's a little more hefty, but not too expensive. The design of this is pretty good, I like the suction cup feet. The only issue I had was it doesn't work on carrots. I got some super big ones, but they were just too slim to spiral them on this slicer. The zucchini was easy to slice right up and did make the perfect fake pasta. I ate it right up and it was delicious! Very easy to rinse and clean off. This is not a super heavy duty plastic, its fairly light. But it got the job done and so far I like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUUT5HTB9BOBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICZR2II#wasThisHelpful","RUUT5HTB9BOBX","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had 2 other grill covers that were in shambles within a season, so we'll see how this holds up. So far, I love the rip cords at the bottom to pull it in so the cover doesn't get stuck on the wheel when I'm moving the grill. That's how my last one ripped. While this seems very light weight, the material appears to be very durable. Being lighter means it's easier to get on and off for grilling also, which I like.

"UPDATE July '15: After getting ignored a year or so ago with customer service I randomly got an email from a woman wanting to ""improve"" their customer service. This was at the same time my shine all of a sudden REFUSED to sync with the iphone app.  I was in talks with another customer service guy at the same time as this woman emailed me - he also stopped responding when he couldn't find a resolution. Anyway long story short, she sent me a new shine. She was really just trying to get me to say I liked this again on my amazon review, but it's still the same. Inaccurate tracking. I thought maybe having a newer one it would have improved? nope. I walk a very specific route most days and know the milage. No matter what I do or change on the app or where I wear the shine it's always wrong, but at least 3/4 of a mile if not more. I still wouldn't recommend anyone to buy a Misfit shineUPDATED review:First of all, as you may see in the comments of people who gave the shine a 1 or 2 star review, they said ""contact us! we'll make it right!"". I emailed the guy and he was quick to respond initially. He said he was forwarding to his tech team(or something along those lines) and they would get in touch with me soon. That was over a month ago. With that same email, he told me a bunch of things that should fix the problems I was having that I'd already tried. I told him I'd tried those and I never heard from him again. Then, the band broke. I emailed him a photo of the broken band and asked for a replacement. No response. They're pretending like they have great customer service, but unfortunately, they're all talk.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I go hiking with my dogs whenever the weather is nice and also hit the gym 2-3 times a week, so I thought this would be cool for motivation and to track my improvements. I also have a really hard time getting a good night's sleep, so I wanted to see what was happening there as well. A big update that deserves a mention: the shine app now syncs with the my fitness pal app and Lose it! app. I know that was a big con for many and I think its a very recent update.  The shine doesn't seem as accurate as I was hoping for. Just putting the battery in and syncing it to my iphone 5s, it told me I'd gone 56 steps when I hadn't even gotten up and crossed a room. Hopefully this is just because you tend to move it more as you get it set up, and isn't indicative of normal use/overtracking. I also had a really hard time putting the battery in. They include a tool for you to pop the back off, but that tool is also very good at scraping the shine. My 'jet' black shine now has little silver scrapes from where I struggled with getting the backing off. It was a pain in the neck and I'm not happy I already marked up my new toy. Now that I know how the paint scrapes, I would definitely have gotten the silver one instead of the black. Otherwise, I do like that it takes CR2 batteries instead of needing to be charged, big plus.Experience so far wearing it in different locations:Ankle: I started using it on my ankle in the wrist strap on my hikes and at the gym to see if that is what most accurately tracks movement. I've tested it against a pedometer I've worn that I know is very accurate(we actually spent a lot of time counting steps in the past and checking to see if the pedometer was correct). The shine tracked almost 400 more steps on a long hike then my bare bones pedometer did. A bit over ambitious in the count.In my pocket: I found this to be as effective as on my ankle for the most part. It does still overtrack when I'm hiking by a few hundred steps, and at the gym it tracks less than my treadmill useage. I would think a treadmill is pretty seriously accurate when it says you've done 2 miles but the shine says I only did 1.7Wrist: I tested it at the gym wearing it in the band doing a mile and 1/2 on the treadmill. The shine only tracked that I did about .6 of a mile which made me crazy, as I should have hit my daily goal with that 1.5. I think it tracks walking only when you're swinging your arms, the times I was holding onto the heart rate monitor on the treadmill it didn't count. Also, when sleeping I wake up and I've already tracked over 200-300 steps? This is not a fluke, it's every morning. I must be a crazy multi-tasker, walking in my sleep. I assume it's tracking my arm movement, but that shouldn't count as steps when it's also showing that's when I was asleep. Next I'm going to try keeping it in my pocket or attached to my waistband, but overall the experience at the gym and tracking steps in my sleep has me on the verge of returning it. I can understand a blip here and there of a few steps, but hundreds is not ok.It did track the time I went to sleep(wearing it on my wrist) and woke up to the minute, so that's on point. Sadly, within my 9 hour goal, it says I usually only have between 2 and 1/2 to 3 hrs and 45 minutes of restful sleep. Yikes!The app is ok, but it's not stellar, though it does seem to update pretty often. The sad thing is, even though I always do the update, I don't actually notice any differences in the app. I've found syncing to be temperamental, it usually take anywhere from 3-5 tries to get it to sync. Sometimes it recognizes the shine sitting in the circle on the screen, but most of the time it says ""syncing failed"". I would like more details in the sleep cycle part of the app as well, without buying that beddit thing. Honestly, this is just a fancy motivational tool because my 5 dollar dinky pedometer is more accurate than the shine. I'm going to keep using the shine and update my review as time goes on, but so far I'm a little underwhelmed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPMS35SBT5B15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9N3I7O#wasThisHelpful","RPMS35SBT5B15","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These monitors are amazing! I usually lean towards using really good headphones to pick up every nuance and really LISTEN to music, but these gave a similar fun experience for me, I really heard all the instruments in some of my favorites. We have another set of very high end monitors and these are comparable, but for a lot less. They provide a deep low end with a lot of warmth to the overall sound, which I would think is attributed to the all wood cabinet. Easy to set up and I like that the headphone jack is in front to plug in my iphone. All the connecting cables needed get started immediately are in the box. They all had a good amount of length as well, I hate when wires are too short.These would be a welcome addition to any home and doesn't need to be reserved for audiophiles, since the price makes them great for anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TCSZMA7ACPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVEIY4O#wasThisHelpful","R39TCSZMA7ACPR","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've previously tried the Remington IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal Systemand didn't really get any results. When I saw this, I considered that there might be something a little more up-to-date technology wise that would make it work better, so I figured I'd give it a go.This one is a lot more compact, as the remington was attached to a larger piece via a cable. That made it harder to store, especially if you have limited space, so I really liked that bout the Philips model. This is just the body with a wire for power. I was impressed that it doesn't need any bulb replacements, as I've heard those can be very pricey. On the whole though, this one doesn't feel like it's really doing as much as the Remington did. On 5, the Remington would sting a bit, just like a rubberband snap. This one doesn't hurt at all. It seems to produce the same amount of light, but with less intensity. The Remington also felt like it had to gather juice in between, but this will just go one after the other if you hit the button. This one also has less bells and whistles. In order to start the Remington, you had to press your finger to to it to get it started, then it would beep before shooting at your skin. This one doesn't do any of those things. For the same price bracket, they're almost the same machine, though I really don't think either of these is worth more than 100 bucks. I suppose only time will tell.On top of that, you cannot use it on tanned skin(or any skin tone more than a fair-to-medium with dark hair). I'll have to wait for winter to get a more overall feel and review of this, since I can only use it on places right now that don't see the sun.

"I had bought a fragrance sampler as a gift last year from a high end beauty store, which was awesome. It gave my boyfriend the opportunity to try out about 15 different men's fragrances, so that we could determine which one works with his body chemistry and was pleasing to both of our noses together. It actually turned out to be a pretty awesome gift and was a lot of fun. That particular gift set came with a voucher for a full size one of his choice, and in the end we had trouble deciding. This John Varvatos was our second choice, so I made sure to add it to my amazon list as a future gift.This not only smells amazing, the price buying for the 4.2 oz direct from amazon(I wouldn't buy from a 3rd party seller, personally) was unbeatable! It was the same bottle and box as I saw in the store. Buying this at Sephora or Ulta, it's about $75 bucks, so I was a huge fan of the price here. I would say this fragrance would span a variety of ages. We're in our early 30s, and it really suits him well. It's woodsy and rich, a bit mysterious. The notes are Ashwood, Tonka Beans, Santolina, Madras Wood, Quince Paste, Oak Moss, Silver Absinthe, White Lavender, Marine Fennel, Cubeb Peppers, Tobacco Leaf, Juniper Berries, Jasmine, Orris Root, Patchouli, Fir Balsam & Suede. A really delicious, masculine scent.  He alternates between this and a more aquatic fragrance depending on his mood. This is definitely my favorite of the two he uses.

"For me this was more 50 shades of grey with a teeny splash of The Night Circus. All I kept thinking was ""softcore circus"".... It has some magical elements, but on the whole was a bit too much erotica. When I ordered it after reading the synopsis, I didn't realize this would fall under the erotica category at all and not only that, but it's book six in a series. I thought it was straight up fiction/romance, especially by the synopsis - which in the end I think was very misleading. If you're aware of what you're getting into and looking for some kink, you'll probably like this. Jackson is very adept at painting a rich, vivid picture of every scene with her words. The characters are interesting but overall it's very shallow. I didn't get any real passion or heart out of it. I wouldn't continue on with anything else in the series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UO008XEDYT5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480474274#wasThisHelpful","R3UO008XEDYT5Q","A1DQHS7MOVYYYA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DQHS7MOVYYYA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This beautiful book is a testament to one of the most iconic fashion photographers of the last century - Horst P. Horst (real name Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann). Horst's style, characterized by elegant poses and dramatic lighting, established him at the forefront of fashion photography as well as master portraitist.Chapters are arranged by the various types of photography he did with a brief introduction followed by luscious examples of his work, both in black-and-white and color. The first section covers his career in Paris where he photographed couture 30s fashion for French and British Vogue (his famous photograph ""The Mainbocher Corset"" is just one example).  ""Stage and Screen"" features portraits of Hollywood legends such as Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Vivien Leigh and Gene Tierney. ""Fashion in Colour"" discusses his quick adaptation to the increasing popularity of color photography. ""Male Nudes"" shows how his dramatic use of lighting influenced later photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe and Bruce Weber. ""Nature"" explores his work with still lifes and flora. And finally, ""Interiors"" discusses his work as a photographer for ""House and Garden"" magazine. This chapter features an introduction by Valentine Lawson, Horst's longtime partner and includes photos of their popular home in the Hamptons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ID7IB128XAQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847844552#wasThisHelpful","R1ID7IB128XAQE","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This looks to be a sturdy and well-designed multi-tasking crock pot. (I have only used it once and will update my review as I experiment with it more). Unlike your traditional crock pot, for slow cooking purposes only, the Black & Decker Multi Cooker gives you the ability to sear meats and vegetables, saute and bake. The removable ceramic pot hold 6.5 quarts. The pot is a bit shallow which leads me to believe that a large chicken or pot roast might have trouble fitting. The pot is wide though (overall, the cooker is quite large and will take up a bit of real estate in your cabinet or counter). There are heating elements along the sides (for slow-cooking) of the pot as well as the bottom (for searing). I made chili and it was perfect (on the slow setting, it was ready within 4 hours). One point off for the absence of a timer and no auto shut-off. The instruction brochure that comes with it has good directions and advice.

"Overall, this is an adequate biography of Stevie Nicks even though the author's sources all come from magazine articles, interviews, YouTube videos and other books. Still, the research level is impressive. The book does a good job of capturing her enigmatic persona, covering her turbulent on-again, off-again years with Fleetwood Mac, relationships with Lindsey, Joe Walsh, Rupert Hine (and others), and her songwriting process. Most interesting are insights into the inspiration behind some of her songs.The biggest complaint I have about the book is the author's writing style. Her parenthetical comments which attempt to bring the reader into her personal realm is annoying as is the bulleted lists at the beginning and ending of each chapter (""Things Stevie learns in this chapter"", etc.).

Melissa admits that she was approached by the editor after her mother's funeral (how tactless is that??) about getting a book out by Mother's Day. There are some interesting tidbits here for anyone curious about how the rich and famous live. The details of flying, living in hotels, room service and what Joan carried in her bag (as well as places she hid money!) were fascinating to me. I was also amused to know that she was a big fan of true-crime shows like ""Forensic Files"".  It is details like what she had on her DVR list at the time of her death that make the book a fun read.

"The Belkin Air Sleeve offers good protection for your laptop computer. The stiff eggshell construction feels very sturdy. I am using it for my Asus 13"" Zenbook (the sleeve is actually fitted for a 14"" laptop). A few disadvantages - there is no storage area for a mouse or cords. The description states that it is easy to work with your computer right inside the case. There are a few problems with that however. While it is possible, since the laptop sits in a recessed area, if you have a flash drive inserted on the side of the computer, it will not rest in the case but stick out over the side (the same problem if you have cables attached).

This is Rendell's third Inspector Wexford novel (following From Doon With Death and Sins of the Fathers). It is easy to see the evolution of her writing style and in this book, she really seems to be coming into her own and developing her signature style. The book is taut, vivid and full of surprises at the end. Rendell's attention to detail is very evident here - her descriptions of English streets, interiors, landscaping, etc. are top notch.

"I first heard about this book while watching a Dick Cavett interview with Bette Davis. He asked her which book she thought had the most accurate portrayal of Hollywood and she said it was this one. It is a portrayal of a narcissistic , ruthless heel named Sammy Glick, who rapidly rises from office boy to studio head, destroying careers, lives and backstabbing everyone he comes in contact with along the way. The story is told through the eyes of Manheim, a fellow co-worker, who witnesses Glick's callous determination as he goes up the ladder.The book was written in 1941 but holds up quite well and does not feel dated. (There are some derogatory terms used for gays, Jews and foreigners that you will have to overlook.) The writing is smart and witty and the novel moves along at a rapid pace. The narrator's snide thoughts and comments directed at Glick are, at times, quite humorous. It is an unforgettable portrait of the vicious nature of the Hollywood machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XQT3C5C9KZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679734228#wasThisHelpful","R26XQT3C5C9KZ8","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The latest novel by Elizabeth George is a dense doorstop of a book that follows Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his colleague Sergeant Barbara Havers as they investigate two separate but related murders. The case is essentially worked by Havers, who is trying to prove herself after being reprimanded because of events that happened in a previous novel. (Since I did not read that book, I wasnt sure what it involved but the issue isnt dwelled on that much.) Similarly, events regarding the death of Lynleys wife, is also alluded to from previous books.The case brings the participants into the orbit of a highly dysfunctional family with numerous skeletons in their closets.  Of course, each one could have a legitimate reason for committing the crimes and the end result is satisfying but somewhat anticlimactic.George is a good, and at times, compelling writer but she cant seem to focus on restraint. She is great at evoking the British atmosphere and for developing full-bodied characters. That said, at almost 600 pages, the novel is too long -  even with excellent character development, the book could have been a taut and pleasurable read at half this length.  About halfway through this, I was ready for it to end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHZ5PRN9SIMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954333#wasThisHelpful","R2MHZ5PRN9SIMW","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am an avid gardener and unfortunately highly allergic to poison ivy. I have battled it all my life and have learned to identify it and try to stay away when I can. Ortho Max works to kill it as well as a number of nuisance vines and shrubs. Large and established plants sometimes need to be sprayed twice to make sure you have killed it entirely. This product should be used with care and caution because it is non-selective, meaning that it will kill anything else it comes in contact with. If you are spraying in a garden, try to spray on a windless day. If poison ivy is growing near desirable plants, I find it is best to not use the spray nozzle and just drip the solution over the plant to avoid having it come in contact with other plants. It usually takes a few days to kill the entire vine but you will immediately notice a wilting plant the following day. It is also important to apply this on a warm day (at least 60 degrees). I have used Ortho Max to kill poison ivy, Virginia creeper, briars and trumpet vine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8DWZG2S28YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSMWEO#wasThisHelpful","RS8DWZG2S28YM","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: After less than a year of use, the phone has an issue with rebooting (sometimes numerous times) and ""optimizing apps"" which takes a while. The phone will often go dead and the battery much be taken out and put back in to get power. At this point, it has become a daily issue. Very frustrating!  Also, the battery is exhausted much faster. I have found that disconnecting the data manager and wi-fi helps but for just texting and phone use, I would not pay this much.Original review:I have only been using this phone for a few weeks now (and for photos and Internet only, have not signed up for a phone plan yet) but so far, I really love it. It is comfortable to hold, quiet and light. The screen is bright and sharp. Battery power (3,000 mAh) lasts at least 3 days for me with light Internet use. It takes about 4 hours to totally recharge the battery. The battery is also removable. The phone feels pretty durable (the leather back is nice) but I did order a case for it as well as a screen protector.There are a few quirks that I haven't worked out yet but that is probably due to my lack of tehnical know-how. A few apps that I installed do not appear on any of the screens and the idle time-out feature is a bit annoying. The Instagram app does not work properly and freezes up (why I do not know). Aside from those few apps, all the others work fine.It has an impressive voice recognition feature. Composing e-mails or social media posts with the voice feature was surprisingly accurate and far better than my old phone.The thing I love the most is the camera which is the best I have seen on a smart phone. Resolution is impressive. Photos are vibrant, crisp and amazing in low light. I took a phote at night in my living room with only dim lamp light and the photo was outstanding. The rear camera, for regular picture-taking is 16MP while the front, for selfies, is 8MP. The Gallery features allow you to tweak your photos (similar to Instagram) and have a handy icon to share photos via various social media outlets.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2URWDMX2VNREF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMGSDRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2URWDMX2VNREF","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thoroughly enjoyed this biography of Rudolph Valentino. I have read hundreds of film-star biographies but I did not know much about Valentino. The author's research is quite detailed, with reference notes and a bibliography. The attention to detail is quite thorough, tracing Valentino's childhood, his early years in New York City working as a ""taxi dancer"", his short-lived first marriage and his second marriage to Natacha Rambova. His films, dealings with Famous-Players Lasky and the nation's reaction to him are well covered. The author's writing style is entertaining. The photos that are included (in 3 sections) are well-chosen and adequately represent the book's content (major people in his life can usually be found in a photo).

"I am currently reading a biography of Valentino and I am also watching his films for the first time. This was a pleasant surprise. For a very early silent film (1922), it is lengthy at 1:40 but it never drags and moves along at a brisk pace. Valentino is wonderful here (you will have to overlook the silly hairstyle). I actually thought his performance here was better than ""The Sheik"".) Nita Naldi is good as the man-killer Dona Sol, despite some hammy expressions in her first scene. A beautiful musical score enhances the film.

"So far we love this unit. Our kitchen gets very hot when we are cooking and instead of using a fan, we tried the portable air conditioner. First of all, there is not a window in our kitchen that can be raised so we had to position it in the adjacent dining room. It was be nice if the hose were longer but at about 5' in length, it reached to about one foot from the kitchen doorway. The setup was very easy - a panel fits inside the window ledge and a sliding portion of the panel has a hole where the hose is attached. The unit is heavy but rolls easily. It i did not take long before we could really tell a difference in the temperature in the kitchen. In fact, we had to turn it off when it got too cold.

"This cleaner is advertised for wood, concrete, and siding. I tried it on a variety of surfaces - a flagstone floored covered porch, brick steps and a set of concrete steps and aluminum siding. For the stone surfaces, it seemed to work best on the flagstone porch. This gets very dusty and the dust grime has reappeared rather quickly when using other products. The porch looked good after using this product. The concrete and brick steps were less impressive. They both had areas of algae growing on them and the cleaner did not remove it. The steps looked a bit better after cleaning but the concrete did not whiten up like the photo in the ad illustrates. I used the cleaner as the instructions stated - I allowed the solution to sit for 10 minutes and then scrubbed the surface with an old broom before rinsing it off. The aluminum siding cleaning was good although an entire bottle of this is not enough to clean a two-story house (500 square foot is the area it covers and that is not a lot).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R52TLBAHCJ7SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3ZO2YS#wasThisHelpful","R52TLBAHCJ7SC","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rendell's second Wexford novel may appear a bit dated but it is easy to see the great writer that she was becoming. This book (released as ""A New Lease of Death"" in the U.S.) is taut, excellently plotted, fully characterized and full of descriptive settings. Wexford lovers may be surprised to find that he really plays a minor part in this book. A pastor by the name of Henry Archery wants to clear the name of the guilty party in Wexford's first case. Archery's daughter is engaged to his son and heaven forbid, there can't be any bad blood being introduced into the family. Archery second-guesses Wexford's work on the case and attempts to find out what really happened. Thus the bulk of the book follows the arrogant Archery and his equally smarmy son as they attempt to clear the name of the fiance. Inspector Burden also plays a significant part here, even more so than Wexford. Wexford is described as a bit gruff and uncouth in this novel, a few characterizations she toned down for him in subsequent books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WV8XZT4FXZVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345342534#wasThisHelpful","R1WV8XZT4FXZVV","A1DRM3JV6T5O6P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DRM3JV6T5O6P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Art curator Justin Paton is the host of this 12-episode New Zealand based series that takes viewers to museums and artists studios to provide a fresh perspective on understanding art. Each episode explores a specific theme (landscapes, faces, etc.). A brief overview and history of the subject is discussed and then artists are profiled and interviewed about their motivations and how they get their artworks accomplished. A 60-minute documentary titled What is Beauty? discusses ten factors that make a work of art beautiful.The series is infused with techno-beat music and frenetic editing, probably an effort to appeal to younger students. This aspect isn't as annoying as the constant shots of the host walking around. It seems like 90% of the show has Paton walking down a street, walking into a museum, walking across a field, etc. etc. It became so amusing that every time a scene was finished, I would be thinking ""Cue to host walking"".

"I am relieved that I received this as a product to review because I would have been very upset had I paid $190 for it.CONS:Assembly - Unless you are detail oriented and good at putting things together, I highly advise finding someone who is (you will need extra help anyway in order to hold together some of the pieces while the other attaches them). There are various screws, nails, etc., some of which are not easily identifiable when compared to the instructions. The instructions provide illustrations only. A friend who is better at this kind of thing than I am helped. It took us 3 hours total with several mishaps along the way. The bottom front panel is especially tricky. It took us 3 times to get it on correctly. You will need a hammer, Phillips-head screwdriver and flat-heat screwdriver. A tape measure is also recommended to check to make sure it is squared before the last step.Quality - not good. This is basically soft presswood that needs to be handled with extreme care to avoid damage. The ""headless"" screws that are to be hammered in are very soft. We broke two of them off by just lightly tapping with the hammer.Alignment of drawers - spotty. Despite being careful (and aside from the screaming and cursing), we followed the directions exactly and corrected errors along the way. Despite this, the drawers do not fit well. The ones in the middle must be slightly lifted to fit in properly (without hitting the drawer underneath it). (They do, however, move in and out rather smoothly).Strength is questionable. The instructions tell you to anchor the back of the dresser to the wall and even show you how to do it. This is the only step we skipped because we are only using it to hold light fabrics. (Anyway, having to put a bolt into your wall sounds extreme).PROS:Packaging was good - the pieces arrived in great condition with adequate protection.In looks, this dresser is pretty attractive. The sides and top are a dove gray and the drawers are white.

"Set during mid-late 1500s France during the violent Wars of Religion between the Catholics and Protestants, this biography details the volatile lives of Catherine de Medici and her daughter Maguerite de Valois. Elements of intrigue, sibling rivalries, backstabbing, infidelities, assassinations, religious fanaticism and more are all here in a readable and engrossing narrative.Catherine de Medici was a fascinating woman with motivations that are somewhat difficult to pinpoint. As the wife of King Henry II, she was pretty much cast aside by him and merely used as an heir producer (she bore him ten children). Henrys affections were directed toward his mistress, an older woman named Diane de Poitiers, another character that plays prominently in the book. Upon Henrys death however, Catherine changes from a sympathetic character to a more ruthless one, as she pursues an agenda to see all of her sons attain the throne.Catherines youngest daughter, Maurgerite, is thrust into a loveless marriage by her mother in a ploy to settle religious hostilities. The plan backfires, however, and days following the wedding, the bloody St. Bartholomews Day Massacre (more than likely instigated by Catherine) kills thousands.The author manages to detail the non-stop and confusing political machinations with ease (not an easy task when most of the men in the book are named Henry!). She takes care to explain her reasoning behind events that are not fully documented and compares her notes with other scholars on particular points. She does not practice the annoying habit of creating imaginary dialog between her subjects. The book has an extensive bibliography (for the most part, Marguerites story derives from her own memoirs).I must confess that I have not read many historical biographies but this one greatly peaked my interest and will motivate me to read more.

"This is a book that I might have missed if it were not provided to me for purposes of a review. I went into it without even glancing at the summary because I was ready to be surprised. I am glad I had the chance to spend some time with such a wonderful story. There is so much going on and it does feel very true-to-life in the way it is presented. There is a bit of mystery and intrigue, but above all, there are interesting characters and a well-told story that is not quite a whodunnit, but more of a ""what is really going on"" sort of tale. While I did find the ""romance scenes"" somewhat blocky and awkward, I am not entirely sure that was not by design.

"I have only myself to blame. I am a huge fan of DotD. It is the movie that put me on the path to the career I am on currently (zombie author). It is easy to see the movie as you read or listen to the audio version of this adaptation. There are a couple of instances where a sliver of something is added to give you perhaps a new insight, but for the most part, this is the movie redone.Just about anybody could have sat in front of their DVD player and written this scene-for-scene adaptation and then threw in the possible thoughts of Steve, Roger, Fran and Peter. This did make Peter seem less likable than in the movie. Also, Steve comes across as a bit of a wimp and Fran sort of toughens up and adopts a hard shell. Not sure if I agree with those choices in the narrative. Anyway, if you are a mega-fan, you will probably add this just to have it, but don't expect much that you don;t already know from watching the movie all those times.It was still a nice gift from somebody who knew I love zombies, and this movie in particular.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7UM09ND8V01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WWAA#wasThisHelpful","R3B7UM09ND8V01","A3UKLX2A9T589C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UKLX2A9T589C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this item for an upcoming trip to NY. I have two kids, a 3 yr old, and one that will be 11 months when we will be in NYC. We didn't want to have strollers because it can be a headache navigating through the subway, stairs and just going through the city. The maximum weight is perfect for my 3 yr old because she's under 36 lbs. It's a lot higher than the Baby Bjorn and way more comfortable! With the Baby Bjorn I definitely feel the weight on my shoulders. It's not a big deal for me since I'm bigger and work out, but my wife is 5'2 and weighs 100 lbs. When she has/had our little ones in the carrier, it gave her back pains and forced me to give her back and shoulder rubs. But with the Mo+m, all the weight is distributed and nothing on the shoulders. Even with my 3 yr old on my back, I didn't feel anything. I was able to put my 3 yr old in the back and use my Baby Bjorn for forward facing. It can truly say that it's a much better feeling than the Baby Bjorn. I would definitely recommend this for any parent and suggest this over any other carrier. It is also much more affordable. Plus if you're like me, I love having the functionality of having pockets. You can throw some wipes and a couple of diapers in the front pocket for emergency purposes!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26R789C4T9FOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD5O26K#wasThisHelpful","R26R789C4T9FOH","A1AUPIH2GFSQBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AUPIH2GFSQBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Amazon Echo for a month now and I think it's a great product to have in the house. It has a certain wow factor when you are entertaining guests. Though it lacks in certain areas, there is such a huge room for improvement! I mean that in a good way. There are so many possibilities with the Echo. With the recent flooding in Texas, it was great to be able to get weather and traffic updates right before I leave to work. Checking the score on the Warriors vs Cavs game was handy. Sometimes I don't want to have to pull out my phone or iPad just to get information. This is what the future looks like. Being able to just use your voice to get information. Now I do wonder on how much the Echo listens in on.Even my kids enjoy the Echo. My 3 year old thinks she is my friend and she has a wealth of information. I love the playlist and song search feature. If entertaining guests, you no longer have to have the radio on or have the TV on to stream music. It was annoying to have your phone stream your music to a bluetooth speaker. The speaker on the Echo is amazing and clear. The sound quality is almost perfect.Setup was a breeze. Everything paired quickly and I had 0 wifi connectivity issues.Areas for improvement:I would like to be able to add additional locations for traffic information. Currently you are only able to have one location.A long shot but integration with Nest or Dropcam and MyQ garage door openers. Though they are owned by different companies, it would be nice to have the Echo control the Nest or Dropcam and MyQ. Actually anything that is automated and controlled by a smartphone or tablet you should be able to integrate.These are the few things I would like to see in the next update. At least the first one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R77LYFPUS30HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R77LYFPUS30HA","A1AUPIH2GFSQBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AUPIH2GFSQBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had plenty of projectors before but this by far is one of the most impressive. I've never heard of BenQ but after reading all the positive reviews I had to check it out. For less than $1000 you get an amazing 3D projector that can be installed pretty much anywhere. I put this in my media room projecting onto a 120"" screen. It is approximately 7ft away from the screen and the picture quality is amazing! Extremely easy to setup and the eco functions are pretty good. I did not see any light or hear any loud noises. It's a definite must have if you want a quality projector at an amazing price. I do wish that this projector was more common so I can use a universal remote with it.

"I recently purchased the Sonic Wave Ultra Sonic Cleaner to clean my fiance's engagement ring and it worked... worked really really well. The diamond came out sparkling and the setting was bling bling also! I didn't use the jewelry cleaning solution, but instead I used some dish washing liquid and oxy clean. I'm going to use the jewelry solution today. After we cleaned the engagement ring, I decided to throw in a whole bunch of other rings.

"I first received this item last year before Xmas and I enjoyed it very much. During the time I've used it, I felt that it was giving me everything my dentist wanted. I like the UV Sanitizer and this is great for travel. The down fall of this product is really up in the air. Before I had this item for a year, it broke. I do a lot of traveling, and the item being damaged could be blamed on the careless acts of the TSA. Who knows, but when I arrived home that night I went to brush my teeth and noticed that the power on the toothbrush was very low. Being tired and not thinking, I figured that it was maybe because the battery was not charged. The next morning I still noticed that it was very weak. I let it charge again and that night I saw that it was fully charged. I ended up taking the toothbrush apart and noticed that the motor had been damaged. This could be just a flaw in this particular toothbrush, or it could be the TSA for smashing my bag and damaging the motor. Who knows at this point.

"If I could give a NEGATIVE rating I would! I'm not sure what the ""Advanced"" means, but for sure it has nothing to do with this phone. This phone is probably the worst cordless phone ever made. Half the time I have to keep registering the handset. It does have decent sound quality, but that's if and when it actually works. It looks nice and flashy but if GE had spent a little more money on the technology, that would've been nice. The developers really dropped the ball on this one. No wonder GE is taking such a massive hit. Also another annoying thing about this phone is that it has no custom functions. The phone book is horrible. I might as well just punch the numbers in. There is no search function! If you plan to purchase this phone, don't bother! Just email me and I'll give mine to you.

"These have been a lifesaver for my daughter and me. I now am at the point where I put a few drops in every bottle. Here's how this works:Active Ingredient:- Simethicone is an anti-foaming agent. It prevents lots of little bubbles (foam) and instead causes the bubbles to join together in a larger bubble. Large bubbles are easier to burp out or pass- Simethicone acts in the stomach directly - it doesn't work by way of the bloodstream, making it much safer with respect to side effects, overdose, etcHow to Use- Feed the dose directly into baby's mouth after eating, or add a few drops to a bottle itself- IMORTANT: After administering, safely BOUNCE the baby to help the little air bubbles join together and rise to the top. I find this works MUCH BETTER than patting the back. After I administer these drops, a few good bounces gets the burp out without fail, and my daughter all in smiles. Get bounced not only works better, it's more enjoyable than getting pat on the back.Anyway - that's my advice. Offer liberally and then BOUNCE the baby. They really, really work.Taste wise, these are ok. Sweet. My daughter will take them contentedly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VNL7A6AKRVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5UOWEA#wasThisHelpful","R9VNL7A6AKRVC","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:22 MinsMy child loves it!! I have a 12 month old teething daughter and this is just PERFECT for her.When I first received it, it was cleanly packaged in an easy-to-open plastic package exactly as pictured. Immediately I attached my little girl's favorite pacifier to it and clipped it on her shirt. The clip is very neat as well. Easy to open and close and i don't have to worry about accidentally pinching her or anything like I had to with her old pacifier clip. The buttons in it are very sturdy and strong as well. I don't believe they will ever pop open no matter how hard she pulls and swings it around. Her old one had velcro to put the pacifier on and she would easily take the pacifier off the clip. This one I don't believe she will be able to do that with the button it has.As soon as I clipped it on her she began inspecting it as she does everything. Then she looked up at me with a big smile and inserting the rubber beads into her mouth and began chewing on them. I think she is very pleased with her new toy.The rubber beads are perfect for a teething baby. They are hard so even a child with teeth already could not chew off any of the rubber. But they are soft enough to where it would not hurt the child's gums either. They are non-toxic which is big to me. Sometimes you have to worry about toys having toxic paint or anything and for this it is not the case. It is very safe.My little girl and I both adore this pacifier clip. The shipment was super fast! Received it in a couple days of ordering. I was very pleased with my purchase.Note: I received this item for a discount price in exchange for my honest review.

"I could not believe the size of the roller on this pizza cutter when I first opened it. It is much bigger than the one's I already have. And the handle is really nice. It has a really comfortable grip on the sides and back and is easy to hold while cutting. I use it for cutting up pancakes, waffles, pizza, sandwiches, anything. And since the blade is larger you can use it for lots of other things besides just pizza. I love it! The blade is good and sharp and doesn't wobble when cutting. It is also very easy to clean and can even be put in the dishwasher. It has a nice finger guard that protects your fingers and hand from slipping onto the blade but it is positioned to where it is not in your way when you are using it. This is definitely my favorite cutter ever! Having the server is just an added bonus!

"I absolutely love this teething necklace. I have three kids, and I sooooo wish I had these back then. Kids always want to chew on your necklaces. I am just thrilled that The color of this necklace is so pretty in person. It's a fun and vibrant color. This necklace is made from silicone. It is BPA free. Silicone is so soft and resilient. It has a safety clasp on it. It will screw on. You won't have to worry about your little one grabbing this off of you. Their little fingers can easily grasp onto this necklace, and it's safe for them to chew on. The silicone beads really feel great on their gums too. Now you can still wear jewelry while being a mom. The best part is that they can't drop or throw their teething ring, because it's around your neck. I hated being out and about, and they would throw their toy on the ground. I really wish I had one of these back then. It would have saved a lot of tears with my kids because I couldn't give them their dirty toy back. I feel really comfortable in recommending this product.

"I used mine for the first time tonight, and love it. I can't wait to use it all the time for cooking - and we cook a LOT. Slice the onion in half, lay the flat side down on the board, and insert the prongs into the onion, ideally right in the middle - slice either parallel or into the prongs for thin slices. It's especially handy for that last inch or so and you want your whole onion thinly sliced! If you insert the prongs into the middle, you can slice (parallel) first on one side then on the other, and you can have the slices paper-thin. If you want diced onions, this gadget is a huge help too. Again, cut in half, lay the onion flat side down, slice using the prongs as guides, keep the holder in place, then slice parallel to the prongs for thin diced onions. Simple.

If you push the button it actually lights up and makes a washing sound that rings when the ""cycle"" is over. My girls have only had this for a day and already I know they have a new favorite toy. For its price, you just can't beat it. Overall it's a great toy and I would recommend it to anyone considering buying one. **I received this  product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"Finally, an inexpensive 4 amp car charger from a brand that I find reliable. My husband has a Samsung Galaxy S4, and I have an iPhone 5, so this 4amp charger not only works great for us now, it's also future-proofed for when I get a bigger phone that requires a bigger charger. It also works great for charging the tablets on the go. The blue LEDs is fairly dim, which is great because most devices come with astonishingly bright indicator lights. The construction is a bit plasticity, but still solid. It's not quite as nice as my Belkin 1-port charger, but it is significantly less expensive than Belkin's dual-port charger.

"I ordered this girdle for my sister-in-law who is due any day now.I had one of my own just over a year ago but gave it to a friend of mine. I must say it worked miracles for me.

It is really comfortable and adjustable so as you get smaller, it fits with ease. It is breathable and comfortable and will fit pretty much any women. Make sure you look at the sizing chart.

"The unit was stable on the countertop and the handle is well made. The whole fry cutter is very sturdy built! It also has easy cleanup, which is a big plus for me! If there is a con to the fry cutter, it's that it isn't elevated enough to fit a bowl under it. But, with the time it saves on slicing I didn't mind slicing into a saucer and then adding it to a bowl. I honestly didn't know what I was missing until I got it. It cuts your kitchen prep time and makes your food look like it was cut by a professional! It has my total recommendation!

"Purchased this because I could not depend on any of my graters to zest fruit. One worked occasionally. My box grater could remove the zest, but the zest remained stuck in between the grates. So, not only did I not have any zest to use, but now I had an additional chore to clean the grater. This zester works beautifully, removing only the zest, none of the white part of the fruit. It is easy to slide the zest off of the micro plane. In short, my only regret is that I did not purchase this sooner.

"These are a lifesaver! My younger daughter has an awful reaction to mosquito bites. She gets huge welts that are itchy and painful (as seen in the picture below). We usually have to thoroughly coat her in bug spray before she can go outside. It's expensive, it stinks and she hates it, but if we don't she ends up miserable anyways. A friend had told me about these types of bracelets, so when I was offered the chance to buy them at a discounted price in exchange for a review I jumped at the chance. The bracelets work wonderfully. We've been using them for a couple of weeks now and even though we've spent plenty of time outside I haven't seen a single bite on her. She's a happy kid because she thinks the bracelets are fun. She loves the variety of colors. I love that they keep her from being a mosquito meal and they last a long time. The package says 250 hours. We haven't used one that long yet, but we've been using the same one for about two weeks and it's still effective! We actually put them on her ankles because she has tiny wrists and it kept slipping off, but they work great on the ankle too! I'm thankful that we're done with bug spray. These are so much easier and better all around!

"First of all this smells absolutely AMAZING! I wouldn't mind my house smelling like this... lol The capsules themselves are large enough to hold onto the good smelling scent for a good amount of time, but at the same time they will fit into any shoe. I have daughters that are very active, and with that they have smelly sweaty stinky feel. I used these capsules as a resort to not having to replace shoes so often because of the stench and I must say this was incredible. I put them in when she got home from school and the next day she put them on and they smelled amazing. Not only do they smell great but they clean and sterilize them as well.

"My seven year old daughter rushed to my computer as soon as the Amazon box arrived. She was not disappointed as she was easily able to put the CD in my I-Mac herself and click on the icon to start the adventure. It held her interest for an hour as she moved through the exercises guided by the Disney characters. When I wanted to work at my desk our daughters simply moved to her dad's PC and with a little help was able to install the typing tutor at Dad's desk as well. The typing exercises and games are perfect for a young child and my son is not even aware that she was learning to type. We have had the CD for 3 days now and my daughter sits at the keyboard with her hands in the correct position and is able to type simple works without even looking at the keyboard. She has learned all on her own with no help from us. For my daughter it is essential that she learn to type as soon as possible. Soon she will be able to use a keyboard with a word processing program in school but she must first learn to type. I highly recommend this software. I rated it a 5.

"This product is a USB 3 Port Car Charger that is suitable for charging a wide range of small to medium sized devices that support USB charging. Inside the box you get the Omaker 5V / 6.6A USB 3 Port Car Charger only.Received for review this product is made of very high quality material that is fit for purpose. It's well built, elegant and stylish. The thinner section that fits into your car cigarette charger port is made of gloss black plastic whilst the wider port area is made of a material that resembles silver and enhances its overall look significantly.With 3 different ports to choose from (2.1A, 2.1A, 2.4A) there is ample room for all the devices that you have in the car (1-5 people). The distance between each port is adequate for most devices. It's relatively small size (about the size of your thumb in length and width) enables it to be placed directly into your car USB connection port without impeding on your driving abilities.After I connected the product to the car charging port a blue LED light appeared on the device which indicated that the product was active and was waiting for the first device.After I tested a number of different devices that we have in our home on the productin a number of different varying combinations (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, Galaxy S2/S3/S4, iPad Mini, iPad2, iPad3 and Galaxy Note 3) I found that charging was initiated as quickly as it does when plugged directly into the mains. With the car engine and CD player running at full blast, the devices were charged at an impressive speed that was quicker than I have seen with similar products.When I pulled up directly outside my house in order to connect via WiFi, I used the devices for a number of different battery draining tasks such as playing 3 HD YouTube videos at the same time at a high volume and it did not affect the charging process. After charging all the devices for a lengthy time there was no overheating or interruption in the charging process.Verdict:Very Powerful Car Port USB Charger.Sample provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEJ0ZQMRXPAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011FC7KCW#wasThisHelpful","R1FEJ0ZQMRXPAO","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many years ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I dreamt of exciting creative baggage tags and how they would brighten everyone's world by just gazing at them. THESE ARE THOSE TAGS I DREAMT ABOUT come to life on this planet we call EARTH. For many years I worked for an international airline and day in and day out all I saw was boring, uncreative but purposeful bag tags. If I had seen these Shacke tags coming down the line, I would have jumped for joy just to experience the uniqueness and individuality of each soul coming through.... Shouldn't we all express ourselves in our best artistic nature? Shouldn't we let our spirit brighten the world? I say, YES !These tags remind me of energy codes with each and every dot giving us new information and reflecting the stars in the sky. They are so festive and uplifting and just looking at them makes me smile. These are by far the best designed bag tags I have ever experienced...whoever designed these must have special spark of light and a happy disposition.These tags are gorgeous ! The design is raised on the sturdy plastic tags and each one is so eye catching, it just pops ! With any color suitcase, these will be seen sliding down the baggage belt shoot and making a statement all their own. I'm hopelessly in love with these tags and will recommend them to everyone. I'll also keep these in mind as a gift for the many travelers I know and love. I can't imagine a nicer present for those who like to travel the world and experience the Universe. These are also priced extremely well for the excellent quality and leather straps.Excellent all around.....Hope to see you all sporting these tags when you come to visit me in my corner of the Milky Way....Sample provided.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXX6R8YV38IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIC7PVC#wasThisHelpful","R2AXX6R8YV38IY","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star). The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.As for the lashes~ I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect! I had to cut away the excess on the ends (which keep them in place in the box) and to hide the part that attaches to my eyelid, I just brushed some eyeshadow over it like it was a liner, and ta-dah! They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used. My husband loves 'em, but isn't sure about the thick set I have. Personally, I'm excited to try them but I'm waiting for a special occasion. I also wish that they came with adhesive glue.Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate.

"Oh my! I tried going got Ulta and Sephora both and no one there knew what I was talking about when I asked if they had any of the metallic tattoos. What's up with that? Anyway, I bought one pack of these and was able to split the whole pack between for both my daughters for part of their birthday gift. There are so many in this set that one for each would have been too many. On some of the pages, I cut down the middle depending on what was on the page. I was able to give each of them a complete set of necklaces, bracelets, along with all the other feathers and other miscellaneous. I must say that their friends were a little jealous over them! The girls were ecstatic! While only 7 and 4, I can see that they are quickly getting out of the age of cutesy type of things like most of the tattoos for girls were. One of my daughters was wearing one the other day and it looked great.

"I love this and so does my kids. I can upload my favorite music to it and since its 16 GB it can hold a lot of my songs. It already has two preloaded songs on it. I like to rock out to my favorite tunes while I'm outside, taking a walk or going on a long road trip (me not driving of course). I can add my favorite books to it also - it comes with one book by Mark Twain already on it. My daughter is already on chapter three of this book - guess she must be curious what it is about. She loves to read though. You have a voice recorder too - I haven't played around with it though. The game selection seems good too it's already three songs preloaded on it. My favorite of those is the old school game of snake. My kids were amazed by this game. I'm like haha yall have no idea how many hours I use to sit and play this game. Then you have a place for videos and photos - some are preloaded so that's kind of neat but can't wait to add my own. I also love that it comes with a radio and it picks up nicely without any static what so ever on the stations I've listened to. It's like super clear sound pretty much perfect. I can turn up volume and it gets fairly loud.

"My daughters had already seen the movie, ""Brave"". So, they really enjoyed this game. It was a little harder for the 4 year old; but, her 7 year-old sister showed her the way. We bought leapster explorer for the 8 year-old granddaughter 2 years ago at Christmas. Every time she gets a quarterly report card which shows she's paying attention to her teacher and doing her best, she get's to pick out a game for her leapster! She's getting straight A's and good conduct! We decided to get our 4 year old daughter this same gift for a Christmas present. If she listens to her teacher and tries hard, she will get a game each quarter too! It's not about straight A's; but, doing the best you can do. This means doing your homework and listening to the teacher. So far, they are both doing great and they really enjoy the games. These games also teach them spelling, math, puzzles, reading, figuring out problems, and other school lessons.

"1. This product is NOT water-PROOF, nor does it ever claim to be. It is water RESISTANT. This means that if water gets into the tiny speaker holes on the back, into the tiny microphone hole on the front, or (God forbid) into the power port on the bottom, it will likely damage the electronics inside.Nearly all of the negative reviews of this product state that after one or two uses, they heard a loud screeching sound until the battery died and then they could never use it again. This is a direct result of their misuse of the product by either submersing the product in water or by allowing lots of water to flow over it. They are causing water to enter the holes in the product and thereby damaging the electronics inside.How do we avoid this? Place the speaker in a location where it is unlikely to have ANY water touch it. In the case of a shower, this will be under the shower head but on the same wall as the shower head. In a bath, it can be pretty much anywhere on the wall (not in the tub). Water should touch the speaker as infrequently as possible. In addition, run the fan or leave the door open to avoid large amounts of steam from collecting. Otherwise, condensation may form inside the speaker which would then collect into drops and damage the electronics. When touching the buttons on the speaker with wet hands, do NOT touch the microphone hole or any area directly above the hole, since water could collect on the speaker and then dribble into the hole. If you follow these simple, basic, seemingly obvious instructions, your speaker will not have this problem.2. The speaker has its own volume control, independent from the volume of the source. For example, if you are using a cell phone and your phone's media volume is set to 10%, the speaker will not get very loud even if you hold the >> button down and turn the speaker's volume up all the way. You need to set your phone's volume (or whatever your source is) to 100%, then use the volume controls on the speaker to adjust its volume.I received this item in exchange for a review.Overall, I really like the speaker. It has a great design, stays put in the shower, and is nice and loud while still being decent quality. Both my girlfriend (who I bought it for) and I really like it. I'm sure you will like it too as long as you avoid the pitfalls stated above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UBG9VRXQ0KB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHV6TIE#wasThisHelpful","R2UBG9VRXQ0KB8","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"recently got a puppy so I did my research into how to properly train my puppy.The whistle came in in cellophane wrapping so it was easy enough to get to the whistle. It is also made of stainless steel so its durable. I had read that using the whistle would help train the dog. Now this whistle has a round piece at the bottom so you could change the tone according to the reaction to your dog. You whistle until you find the tone that your dog responds to. Very simple and easy to use.Now using a whistle to train your new puppy will require dedication, patience and time. I try to be consistent in my training.

"This is the best LSAT book on the market. Period. I've never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but I felt strongly enough about this book, and the LSAT, to write a review here.Let me say a bit by way of background: I took the LSAT for the 2012/2013 application cycle. Like most people, I took a full-length practice LSAT, without any preparation, a few months before the scheduled exam to see how much studying I had to do to get into the 170+ range. My initial score was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.After coming to terms with the fact that I was going to have to really prepare for the exam, I evaluated my options. I didn't want to take an LSAT class. They're expensive, inconveniently located, and generally just regurgitate what's in the practice book they use. Still, since the LSAT is such an important factor in law school admissions, it seemed like skipping the class and studying on my own was too big of a risk, whatever the price. I ended up going with Manhattan LSAT, which had better reviews than Kaplan, Blueprint, and Testmasters (the other companies with courses in my area). By sheer luck, Mike Kim (the author of The LSAT Trainer) happened to be teaching my class.While ultimately I was right about the class--it was pricy, across town, and more or less a review of the material in the Manhattan LSAT books--Mike himself was phenomenal. I began going to class early and staying late so that I could pick his brain about the exam. While I was satisfied with the Manhattan materials (of which Mike was one of the main authors, I later learned), the most useful bits of information I collected came from Mike's uncanny understanding of the LSAT's structural aims. All of that information (and way more) is now beautifully organized in this book.As you'll see when you look at the Trainer, Mike understands the LSAT like a mechanic understands an engine. He has truly mastered it; and he has used that mastery to dissect the exam into its most fundamental parts. That's what this book is. It's an anatomy of the LSAT--a step-by-step tutorial that helps you see the LSAT in the way 170+ scorers do.There are a lot of LSAT materials out there. I've looked at many of them. Some are pretty good. Most are mediocre. A few are awful, and could cause you to develop habits that actually lower your LSAT score.Mike's approach in the Trainer is in a different league altogether. Here are just a few of the reasons why I say that:1. Simplicity. The Trainer simplifies the LSAT in a way that no other book I've seen does. For instance, one of the biggest problems I had when I was taking practice tests was deciding in the heat of the moment how to categorize the logic game I was facing. This is because I had learned to strictly categorize game types, as essentially all test-prep companies teach you to do. But, as the Trainer explains, this is the wrong way to look at the games section. All logic games are really just variations on a few basic conceptual ingredients. Once you identify those ingredients, and see how they interact with each other, you can go into just about any game feeling like you know how to handle it--because you do. Having this level of comfort and confidence on test day is priceless. And the point extends beyond logic games. The Trainer is consistently concerned with simplifying the exam. This is apparent, for instance, in the reading comp section, which teaches you to read for structure. I totally agree with this approach, and think that it's another nice illustration of the book's general theme, which is that you need to have a deep understanding of what LSAC is trying to test in each section if you want to consistently get high scores. (For you newbies out there, LSAC is the organization that writes the LSAT. You'll know them intimately soon.)2. Clarity. I have a few friends who are amazing test takers. (One of them got a 175 the first time he took the LSAT, after studying for only a couple of days. Naturally, I hate him.) However, it didn't really help me to talk to them about their approaches, because the ability to get a great score doesn't entail that you can explain (or even understand) how you're doing it. Mike can do both. Question types and conceptual approaches to them are explained in detail at the outset of the early chapters, and the writing that develops those ideas in later chapters is consistently clear and concise. Reading the Trainer is like being tutored privately by a top scorer who at the same time understands what it feels like to struggle with the exam. It predicts your questions and concerns, and addresses them in plain language as they arise.3. Comprehensiveness. Perhaps one of the best things about this book is that there's nothing that you need to know about the LSAT that's not in it. (But note: you DO have to purchase LSATs that aren't in it. However, this is a matter of practice, not strategy. And it's exactly what you ought to be doing anyway, as I explain in point 6, below.) From the most basic facts about the number of sections on the actual LSAT, to statistical information about how often each question type has appeared on past exams, to specific (but important) information about how you should time your sections--it's all there. I can't exaggerate how important it is to me not to worry that I'm missing something because my materials don't cover it. I want to buy one book and then turn all of my attention studying, without any nagging questions about what I'm not being told. That you can do that with the Trainer is unique and refreshing.4. Formatting/Length. This probably seems like a funny thing to list, but I think you'll see what I'm talking about when you see the book. The layout is exceptional. First, there is a TON of information on every page. This book does in 600 pages what other company's materials do in about 1200 pages, split across three (or more!) books (with a felonious price tag for each one). Second, despite the massive volume of information, the pages aren't cluttered. For anyone who's ever tried to typeset anything, you'll appreciate what a difficult task this is. This book was obviously designed with painstaking care. Third, the organization of the information is purposeful and effective. It has numerous charts and tables that help you catalog the information in your mind. (See, e.g., the table of common notations on p.206, and the constellation of questions on p.220.) Finally, just about every page is arranged differently, and the book and its contents are attractive. This might sound silly, but for me it's super important. If you use the book properly (as you should), then you'll be spending a lot of time with it. If the book isn't pleasant to look at, then it's going to take extra motivation to look at it after a long day of school or work. You don't want that.5. Intended Audience. One problem I had with many of the LSAT materials I looked at was that they seemed to target people looking to land in the 155 - 165 range. (Some companies, for instance, instruct test takers to try to complete only 3 of the 4 logic games.) For people who are aiming for a mid-160 score, maybe that's fine. But a sub-170 wasn't going to get me into the schools I was aiming for. Honestly, I don't know why these companies do this. Presumably they think that a large portion of the LSAT consumer market simply can't achieve a 170+, and believe that the methods 170+ test takers use aren't compatible with the optimal strategies for a mid-160 score. But this is wrong. As I think the Trainer brings out nicely, the way to master the LSAT is to come to see what the exam writers are really trying to test with each question--to deconstruct the LSAT into its most fundamental parts--and then to develop the skills necessary to meet the challenges each question poses. This book shows you how to do that, whatever your starting point. Will everyone be able to achieve a 170+? No. If they could, then LSAC wouldn't be doing a very good job of separating people out by their analytical abilities. But that doesn't mean that you should perform sub-optimally, given your abilities and work ethic, simply because your test prep materials think that you can't handle the real juice. You should try to get the very highest score you can. The tools that are best for 170+ scorers are also best for 160+ scorers. If you spend the time and do the work, you can meet your goals. This book agrees.6. Real LSATs. The Trainer is built around real LSATs. Whatever materials you end up using, DO NOT use materials that use fake LSAT questions. The Trainer explains why, and I totally agree. It's fine if a company illustrates a point with a non-LSAT question, but when you're practicing, you should always use real questions from old LSAT exams. To get a high score, you have to understand the subtleties of LSAC's questions. There's a common thread that runs between them, and seeing the thread is the key to success. Practicing with made-up LSAT questions is like learning to play basketball with a ball that's not quite the right size, or taking Spanish lessons from someone who speaks a slightly different dialect. It's a recipe for disaster. You shouldn't do it, and the Trainer gets that.7. Price. I regretted paying almost $1000 to take my LSAT course. (I also felt a little slimy about the fact that I was taking advantage of a resource that many people that I was competing against couldn't afford.) It all worked out in the end, but LSAT classes, at least from my experience, exist more to reassure students that they're not missing something than to provide useful information that's not in the study materials. I would have been better off skipping class and spending more time studying on my own. That said, there are likely some people who get a lot out of classes. But I think that this is probably limited to people who lack the time or discipline to study on their own. The Trainer's study schedules are smart and realistic. If you can stick to them, and you don't cut corners, then you'll be an LSAT machine by the time you finish this book. There is simply no reason to shell out for a class when you can pay $50 for this book, which is better than any of the other materials out there anyway--again, so long as you can stick to the regime on your own, and don't need someone to answer to.8. Inspiration. Maybe this sounds strange, but I was surprised by how impressed I became with the LSAT as I studied for it. I always hated standardized tests--I thought that they were all just collections of questions that were, at best, loosely related to certain analytical skills we all have. The Trainer changed my mind about that, at least for the LSAT. In the same way that a class on engineering will cause you to stare at the Golden Gate Bridge, in awe that a group of people actually built it, the Trainer highlights the LSAT's simple elegance. It really does test the skills you will use in law school, and it does that exceptionally well. The Trainer is always deeply respectful of the LSAT--of how hard it is and what it takes to meet its challenges. I admire that.If this review sounds like a total rave, that's because it is. I think that the Trainer is to LSAT prep what the Macbook Pro is to laptops. It's the best there is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RQU346CZ9MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991299221#wasThisHelpful","R27RQU346CZ9MM","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This idea combined with the suggestion of a faster metabolism sounds like a dream come true.So, who is Haylie Pomroy and why should we listen to her?

She tells us to eat a healthy breakfast within 45 minutes of waking to rev up our metabolism (the book says 30 minutes).

"Bunions have made doing any kind of exercise without shoes on (or without those prescription insoles) mostly impossible because of balance issues. I don't have too much pain from my bunions, thank god, but they have made doing some activities pretty difficult, especially yoga, which has been the only form of exercise that I've ever enjoyed. Since I have limited mobility in my big toe, I can't use it to balance like most people can, and this became a problem when I did yoga because I would just keep on falling over, and doing balancing positions seemed to make the bunion worse because it meant more time was spent in the misaligned position. This is where the Bunion Aid comes in. I started wearing it to classes, and it has made the biggest difference! I can balance, I don't have to constantly re-position my toes, and the hinge offers enough rotation to do most positions comfortably. It does get pretty sweaty, but the cloth parts are pretty small so washing is not an issue.As the title suggests, there is a false claim, in my opinion - the one regarding wearing it inside your shoes. Unless you are wearing massive shoes that are 3 sizes too big and too wide for you, you will not fit this contraption inside your shoes in any comfortable way. This is especially the case if you are only wearing one, because then the other foot would feel uncomfortable because you'd be wearing too-big shoes (which would be fine for the foot with the splint, but way too big for the other foot).This is a minor issue for me, and the BunionAid has helped me out so much and has improved my overall comfort in such a significant way that the inability to wear it inside my shoes just seems so insignificant in comparison, which is why I am not taking a star off for it.I recevied this item in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T14Q24MBH3TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W301OEG#wasThisHelpful","R3T14Q24MBH3TF","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The following review is provided by both my wife AND myself. Trust me, at this point in my life I have no further ""beauty issues""....It is also a short but sweet review for ME anyway as this is a very limited use device in my opinion. And my wife and I both come at this review from a somewhat unorthodox and different perspective. Scar Tissue. OK, this is for beauty & ""rejuvenation"". Say what you will but essentially we all will find our own particular use for it. The review below is addressing the common purpose this was designed for but also from the standpoint of use from Cancer survivors....It is too soon to know if any benefit will be gained for THAT purpose but will update as time passes. This was the preface to the review. Now from my wife who has very large scars on her face, forehead up through the upper scalp area. HER ""scar tissue"" is mostly referring to a physical scar, one you SEE on the skin when looking at it it. This is the predominate area that she address it for her scar tissue. She LOVES use of it all over her remaining facial area from the standpoint it makes her feel so relaxed and pampered. You know, that ICKY Girlie stuff...HER words below:5 starsThis massager is great, my face feels so soft and relaxed. It requires 2 AA batteries and works fine with rechargeable's. The directions are very easy to follow as to what head to use for each treatment including picture of head to match with directions. It felt wonderful to use and made my skin feel so soft and clean. In particular, I'm working to smooth out scar tissue on my forehead and it seems to be working. Great product and I look forward to each use of it. The brushes are amazingly soft and enjoyable to use.----------------------------------------------------------------------------MY words below:5 starsI have had several HUNDRED staples removed from my throat, my entire spine and in both vertical and horizontal directions. I look very much like many of the jigsaw puzzles reviewed by my fellow reviewer Joseph Dewey reviews (check his review of this very item here as well- he does a GREAT demonstration!) that has gotten my wife hooked on jigsaw puzzles:-) I don't need to be beautiful, too late! But I am trying very much to survive the many surgeries I just completed with more on the horizons if I can regain enough strength to survive those surgeries. At this point, I am too weak after 6 spinal fusions and a Mastectomy in just 5 months (yes I AM male but it happens to us too) and the loss of 60 pounds of muscle....Now the scar tissue I want to work on is across my entire back and up my entire back. In MY case, not to try to eliminate the physical scar you see, NOTHING will or could ever erase the deep scars I have. But MY scar tissue is one 2 plastic surgeons have even helped remove for me surgically by opening me up and literally grinding them out. If you run your fingers across my back, anywhere over several FEET of visible scars you will feel jagged, reef like material. THAT is my scar tissue (very long story, no point in telling it here). The problem with my scar tissue its it feels like a serrated knife trying to SAW its way OUT of my back through my skin. THIS is what I want to use this item for. I am attempting to break down this tissue to be absorbed within my body for pain relief. Between using assorted pain rubs bought here at Amazon, along with this, I hope to little by little ""possibly"" break down some of this massive amount of internal scar tissue. Too soon for me to know if I will achieve any measure of success. Time will tell. So for me, the only item on this (by item I mean the attachment) I use is the ""Rolling massager: To make better blood circumstances from skin aging"" as it is described with poor Chinese translation in the included manual.----------------------------------------------------------------------------End of MY part of the review. This item for only around $10.00 delivered at the time of my review is so well worth the investment. If it succeeds or not at reducing MY type of internal scar tissue, or my wife's external type scar tissue is really not of huge importance. It is a device that offers ME a degree of hope, it makes my wife feel pampered. An SHE IS BEAUTIFUL so I'd like to see her stay that way. For all that women have to endure in there day to day lives under the best of circumstances, I love to find a product like this that can give them at least a few minutes of 'ME"" time. Time to take a breath, relax, feel pampered. For just a few dollars? How can you not try this?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BOB3718LZUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVD8LY0#wasThisHelpful","R4BOB3718LZUJ","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a small army of toys and other fun adult items because I like to try different things, mix things up a bit, look at new things on the market, etc. It's fun and informative and it keeps me well-versed in what products are out there. It gives me a good grasp on how to evaluate toys and determine usefulness, not just for myself and my partner, but to make recommendations to others who know I have specific knowledge in this field and look to me to help them. When this vibrator came up as part of a promotion, I was really eager to get it and evaluate it and I received it at a discount in exchange for a genuine critique.In the range of Beginner to Experienced, this is definitely on the low-cost side of an upper-end Beginner, lower-end Intermediate. The design is fun and funky with several creative ways to use it (this is a good toy to use imaginatively) although the intention of design hits both a vaginal G-spot and provides external stimulation. It takes two AAA batteries and the vibration has an adjustable range of strength although the lowest setting is fairly strong also. It's easy to clean and small enough to store fairly discretely.That said, in view that this is definitely an ideal product for those on the cusp of Intermediate, there are a few things of which to be aware: this is NOT a silent toy. If you live alone (or with your partner, or open-minded people, or people who just don't care, etc), it's not a problem. But for those who live in spaces where you don't want others in residence to know what you're doing, this isn't going to be your best option. The packaging also left something to be desired. Unlike the picture of the product, this was not in a molded plastic case. It was in a sealed bag and mailed in a bubble envelop, thus anyone who picked it up knew EXACTLY what it was, which is not discrete packaging at all. Fortunately, I am not embarrassed by anyone knowing what I get in the mail, but others might be and I have contacted the seller about it and hopefully that will get resolved on future parcels. Also, the fact that it came in a plastic bag and not in a molded plastic product case means that it did not come with any literature on materials, on cleaning or care, etc. If you're on the cusp of Intermediate, this is still invaluable information to have (especially if you have an allergy)!My final evaluation is that this is great for someone who has started out in the world of physical gratification but who still has a lot of experimenting to do. Thus, you don't want to spend a lot of money on a toy until you know it's The One You Love. It's cost effective, clean, easy to use, I would just recommend having a good grasp on toy materials and toy care. I would also recommend this for anyone who likes to have a traveling selection, not high end so if it gets lost in the luggage it's okay, but small enough for packing and powerful enough to help you at the end of a hard day.I received this in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JWYIJ5NQL5RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01092SYD8#wasThisHelpful","R1JWYIJ5NQL5RJ","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third expandable hose. The best thing about these hoses are how easy they are to work with. They are light and when they have no water they are much shorter and easier to store (it stretches to about 50 feet and retracts to 17 feet for storage). The worst thing about them is that they are fairly fragile and don't last a long time. They easily burst and develop leaks.Ohuhu hose has brass rather than plastic connectors. This is better than my previous hoses which used all plastic connectors that leaked more. It uses standard male/female connectors, one of the old hoses used some sort of quick connect system which I did not like. The package includes a spray nozzle with 8 pattern.From my experience I learned a few tricks that help me keep these hoses working longer.I take the following precautions:1. When I use the hose I do not put the water pressure all the way up, I open the faucet at about half force (my water pressure is quite strong).2. When I store the hose, I store it in the shade under the deck3. I make sure there it has no pressure on any part of the hose, I store laying loose in a plastic tab, it is not hung4. Before storing it I drain it completely5. When I use it I make sure I don't step on it and it does not tangle on anything. I lay it out straight toward the area that I need to water.6. To make better connections I use teflon tape on every connection.Yeah, it is a lot of extra care but I really like that it is so light which makes it easier on my bad back.This hose is provided for a review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYSR5APWOOIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7LRYYW#wasThisHelpful","R2HYSR5APWOOIP","A25LAMR9A7XXZ3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25LAMR9A7XXZ3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am completely in love with these labels. The day I got them I immediately opened them and began finding places I could stick them and label things. I used some to label drawers of snacks and some to label breakfast foods in my freezer. I was very impressed that they have stayed sticking good even after a few days in the freezer. They aren't falling off at all. Now my kids don't have to pull out all the containers to find what they want to eat. I've even make a few labels with our names on them. Sometimes the kids have a jug of juice of something that was purchased specifically for them, and now they can label it! I also like that the marker dries nicely so it doesn't rub off if you touch the label once it's dry. It easily cleans off with a wet napkin for re-use too. (I will note that I did cut a few labels in half for my freezer containers.) So they are super versatile for any size needs.

"I teach yoga to my friends and family and ordered five of these straps. I would definitely recommend these because they are affordable and non-slip, with a good tight weave and a generous length. Importantly, the D-ring does not slip, tighten the loop, and cuff off circulation to your foot when you are in a pose. In fact, I have done PNF stretches using these straps (where you push against it for several seconds) and the D-ring has stayed exactly where I adjusted it. This is definitely something I look for in a strap, because I have paid double in the past for straps that were both shorter and prone to slipping D-rings.

"I have several sets of weights but they can be a pain in the butt to be honest lol. I would much rather use resistance bands but I didn't like the ones that I had.They were long and had big handles. Which was nice in some circumstances and a hindrance at other times. So I was pretty happy to say the least when I was accepted to try these free in return for an honest product review. I received them really quickly after placing the order. They came with a cute little drawstring bag to keep them together. I was glad there were 4 different resistances. I have used all 4 to target different areas based on my strength. I have been using them for a little while now and I notice a difference.

Let dry and then I wiped the wall again with windex and also cleaned off the round suction part of the toy organizer. After it dries off, stick the organizer and press hard a couple times and thats it. It stays on really well.

" 8:05 MinsIt is easy to install & use.  It was pretty quick to install any of 3 ways -- base with latch/ISOPOS, base with seat-belt, carrier-only with seat-belt.  The handle feels comfortable, rubber grip, and can be easily moved and locked into 4 positions.  It effortlessly releases and attaches back to the base with a single release handle.  It has variable harness positions as the infant grows and a single pull strap to tighten down the harness.  And the cover can be easily extended or pushed back.  The extra cushion for the smaller infants can be removed as it grows.  You can remove and hand-wash the cover and the insert.  It seemed flexible, sturdy, and easy to use.  We are happy with ours.It was pretty quick to install any of 3 ways - (1) base with latch / ISOPOS system, (2) base with seat-belt, or (3) carrier-only with seat-belt.  Plus it gives you instructions everywhere with pictures that were easy to follow.  The instruction book itself was pretty good, and even has a spot on the carrier itself to store the book if you ever need it.  Then without the book there are instruction stickers on the carrier itself and in two places on the base.  So you or anyone should be able to install it into any situation.  It only installs rear facing.  Do consult your car's manual too so you know for sure how your seat-belts work and what it recommends for car seat installation, as well as the car seat's manual.It is hard to think of something missing.  It is only for infants up to 35lbs and 32"" tall, so it is designed specifically for infants, so you'll need another car seat once they outgrow it.  Color/style depends on your preference.  The cushions are only hand-washable, but that is better than some that you can only wipe down, and I'm not sure any are machine washable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GM6MPN8BPE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP8A85G#wasThisHelpful","R12GM6MPN8BPE2","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reliable brand, fast, and plenty of room for HD video and pictures.  I record a HD video in my Sony HD Camcorders and already have several SanDisk SDHC Extreme cards (a few 16GB and a 32GB) that I have been very happy with.  High end device manuals will list the write rate (in MB/s) for different resolution choices.  It should also identify a minimum SD card speed, often ""Class 10"" or ""UHS-I"" (both of which this more than supports), which guarantee minimums like 10 MB/s for ""class 10"".  But you will notice your device may be attempting to write much faster than that for higher resolutions.  The device is supposed to manage, but it could mean slower times between shots or dropped frames or resolution scaling depending on how it manages a slower card than its write rate.  This card's 40MB/s write (which is ""up to"" not guaranteed rate) should mean it can handle your video or photos effortlessly.  I have never had a problem with video quality or delays using SanDisk Extreme cards.  The ""Extreme"" is actually not their top tier, which is the ""Extreme Pro"", but this should be great for most people.  Just check your manual to know your write rates.  I am very happy with mine.It is an SDXC (XC = extreme capacity) which isn't necessarily compatible with everything that accepts SDHC (HC = high capacity), although it might work fine.  Just beware if your older device doesn't mention SDXC support, it may not support the size.  Although my camcorder's manual only listed SDHC, it recognized, formatted, and used this SDXC card just fine.Size-wise, it is great for HD video.  At my usual HD resolution, I could record 3.5 hours or so on 16GB, so I just had a few 16GB cards.  But this 64GB card can record over 15 hours, which seems luxurious compared to using 16GB cards.  Of course higher resolutions and newer devices (4K resolutions) will make this seem smaller like how my 16GB card feels today.  But honestly, I'm happy with even the 16GB card, and they are so small you can carry extras with you.  But with 64GB I can just forget about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNA3C840630J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBFPT3A#wasThisHelpful","R2BNA3C840630J","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:46 MinsIt worked easily on my iPhone 5S, but failed to configure on my Android Galaxy Note 3 (which doesn't seem to be reported by anyone else).  It is quite easy to configure.  Once you download the NEO app by Ankuoo it will walk you through it as well.  Once configured, it does what you expect.  You can remotely turn it on and off, configure a countdown timer, scheduled timer, or security timer.  My interest was in remote control on/off to turn on a light in a dark house when we arrive home after dark, and to easily configure a security timer more easily than the old style manual timers.  It claims 15A 1800W support, which is about the max you would do on a normal home circuit.The biggest drawback was that it failed to configure on my Android Galaxy Note 3.  I contacted Ankuoo by email support and they were very friendly, responded the next day, and continued to follow up with me. They said they specifically tested with a Galaxy Note 3 too.  I don't see other reports of configuration failures, so maybe this isn't a common issue.  Just try it within the return policy period.  Second, there was a minor bug that caused 3 instances of the same switch to appear in the app, but was easily fixed by completely closing the app and re-opening.  Otherwise just make sure it matches your decor if it is going to be visible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUWE0R30BIJ8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0O7DGA#wasThisHelpful","RUWE0R30BIJ8G","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:56 MinsIt is a decent home phone system with the standard set of features you expect in this price range, some advantages, and a few disadvantages.  The buttons are the rubber squishy feel (which is a matter of opinion).  It has rather good button placement (also a matter of opinion).

" 9:58 MinsThis is a great, economical, high performing printer.  It is noticeably improved from the previous model, the Epson WP-4530 / WP-4540.  I owned and loved the WP-4540 as my primary printer.  This WF-4630/WF-4640 improves upon the 4530/4540 by: (1) A noticeably better color touch screen that is more colorful, more responsive, better audio cues.  (2) Has more options and features.  (3) Scans faster at higher resolution levels.  It continues the benefits of fast printing, duplex (2-sided) printing, fast scanning, duplex (2-sided) scanning, easy setup and software, great wireless, economical printing with large capacity 786 & 786XL ink cartridge support, great print quality, and just being a power house.  This seems to be a decent upgrade.The only difference in the WF-4640 vs WF-4630 is whether or not it comes with an optional second paper tray to place under the unit that is the same otherwise.  I have the WP-4540 that has the extra tray, and decided not to use it because it made the printer larger and I just didn't need the capacity before reloading in my home office.  I use duplex printing and scanning a lot on the previous model (WP-4540).  I love that it just mounts the USB port as a remote drive, so I just leave a USB key plugged in and copy the files from my PC.  Scanning directly to PC (on the old model at least) was significantly slower and didn't offer many of the options for some reason.  After a short while, scanning would sometimes pull in too many pages at a time, so I just feed them one at a time when I hear the audible click when the existing page is pulled in far enough.  Two sided scanning works sell, but if too many pages pile up in the output, it can suck some previous pages back in from the output tray as it pulls the current page back for a second pass or to flip it.The only concern I have is whether or not the 4630/4640 fixes the common internal defect that plagued the 4530/4540.  After a year, many 4530/4540s would leak yellow ink in a single line down the center of the page until exhausted, ruining output for a while, until you ended up with a high quality black & white printer.  Mine was affected by that, but Epson replaced mine free of charge after the warranty expired.  My WP-4540 still has some banding on color output sometimes.  I am just hoping the 4630/4640 has rooted out the problem.  Btw, my Epson Workforce 840 that I infrequently print to has never had a problem.  Only time will tell.  But everything else about it shows me that they improved a number of things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37S0LBVZA0WKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVHL5CO#wasThisHelpful","R37S0LBVZA0WKA","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:58 MinsThis shredder gives you more in basic shred capability than smaller, cheaper under the desk shredders.  It is surprisingly movable, more than any shredder I own, with (1) rollers (that roll easily on hard surfaces), (2) handles that make it easy enough to carry (not all larger shredders do), and (3) doesn't weigh too much to carry.  Its power cord is nicely oriented downward out the back so it can easily hug the wall.  The 7-gallon bin is much larger than under the desk models, easily opens and closes, supports a bag, and has a bag catch to help with holding the bag tightly.  Its slot is oriented so that you need to push paper in from the front, not straight down, which is actually a bit more natural to hit it straight on.  It has 3 buttons, on/off, force forward or reverse, and automatically runs as paper is inserted.  Overall it has a lot to like if compared to smaller, cheaper alternatives.Drawbacks are: (1) The manual says never to insert envelopes with windows (of which I get plenty of such in junk mail).  (2) It feels a bit basic, plastic feel, and not as refined as some (especially compared to significantly more expensive shredders), most notably with the buttons.  (3) It still audibly stresses a bit as you pack more in it (like most shredders of its caliber).  (4) It doesn't automatically turn off like some energy efficient models (but it is easy enough to use the big button).  (5) It is not 100% jam-proof, so don't expect miracles, but it has jam prevention features that should help.  (6) The bin isn't as big as you might think looking at the front door because the door extends a bit higher than the bin itself.  These are not really flaws in its design, just what to expect at its tier.  It is still 1/3 the price of more expensive tiers that may offer more refinement.I own and love my Fellowes 125Ci at the next tier, but that is in another league and price point.  This strikes a balance in the middle.  It seems much better than my old Royal Confetti Cut under-the-desk shredder that it will replace in another room.  Remember to oil your shredder routinely (once a month or every time you empty the bin).  I use Fellowes Shredder Oil (35250) that came with my Fellowes shredder.  The AmazonBasics shredder didn't come with oil or bags out of the box, but it says you can use shredder oil or just vegetable oil.Remember to oil your shredder.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7L2T1JW5A43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXLGESY#wasThisHelpful","R1G7L2T1JW5A43","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:00 MinsIf you like Sequence, you will probably like this game.  It is fun, plays fairly quickly so you can play several times rather than one marathon game.  It has some strategy (defensive and offensive) so it isn't just random and can keep you engaged and thinking a little bit.  But it isn't really a strategy game.  It has a good amount of luck.  So it never feels like the same person always wins and isn't very serious.  Game length are fairly short, so you can easily play several rounds, so it seems like everyone has a chance.  If one person draws a bunch of pairs, it can be over pretty quickly.  Other times by luck and defensive strategies it can take a little longer.The instructions are very nice, large, colorful with good examples, so it is much easier to read than the usual back of the cardboard box.  It actually suggests a number of optional rules, but you can easily come up with more on your own too.  So the game is very flexible.  For example, you can decide that only the top color on a stack counts, so you can block more often and make games run longer.  I think it is nice that there is more ways you can play it so you can change it up if it gets stale.You basically draw 5 cards, and make one play per turn.  Playing a single card can place a piece on one of two spaces for that card value and color.  Pair, triples, or more of the same value will let you play 2,3, or more pieces on any space.  Runs (sequences of 2 or more in same suit) can remove the number of pieces as cards played.  You just need to build a snake across the board in either direction using horizontal and vertical connections (diagonal doesn't count).  You can play on top of others, but level doesn't matter (at least not by standard rules).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3ZYPLS3HZGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFJWMV4#wasThisHelpful","R3E3ZYPLS3HZGV","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:05 MinsIt is easy to install & use.  It was pretty quick to install any of 3 ways -- base with latch/ISOPOS, base with seat-belt, carrier-only with seat-belt.  The handle feels comfortable, rubber grip, and can be easily moved and locked into 4 positions.  It effortlessly releases and attaches back to the base with a single release handle.  It has variable harness positions as the infant grows and a single pull strap to tighten down the harness.  And the cover can be easily extended or pushed back.  The extra cushion for the smaller infants can be removed as it grows.  You can remove and hand-wash the cover and the insert.  It seemed flexible, sturdy, and easy to use.  We are happy with ours.It was pretty quick to install any of 3 ways - (1) base with latch / ISOPOS system, (2) base with seat-belt, or (3) carrier-only with seat-belt.  Plus it gives you instructions everywhere with pictures that were easy to follow.  The instruction book itself was pretty good, and even has a spot on the carrier itself to store the book if you ever need it.  Then without the book there are instruction stickers on the carrier itself and in two places on the base.  So you or anyone should be able to install it into any situation.  It only installs rear facing.  Do consult your car's manual too so you know for sure how your seat-belts work and what it recommends for car seat installation, as well as the car seat's manual.It is hard to think of something missing.  It is only for infants up to 35lbs and 32"" tall, so it is designed specifically for infants, so you'll need another car seat once they outgrow it.  Color/style depends on your preference.  The cushions are only hand-washable, but that is better than some that you can only wipe down, and I'm not sure any are machine washable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7B0TALEZC1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBLCYH4#wasThisHelpful","RX7B0TALEZC1F","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:53 MinsThis is a stellar large shredder that eats everything you can fit into the opening faster than you can shove more in.  Whether it is 1 page or a stack, it sounds effortless while other shredders whine and slow.  It shreds faster than I can pick up and fit another stack into the opening.  The opening is actually a great design.  It can take nearly anything you can fit in, but it will show you green/yellow/red indicators as feedback about the load before it automatically stops and reverses if too much.  But it takes real effort to overload it because it is hard to fit more than it can handle without carefully aligning and inserting a thicker stack.  I love being able to throw unopened envelopes into it.  I really like the auto on/off energy efficiency so that I never have to turn it on or off again, it is always ready, wakes up instantly, and goes to sleep on its own.  It is narrow so it fits more snugly too.  It holds a good amount before you have to compress it or empty it.  It comes with oil and bags (just oil it every time you empty it).Minor Drawbacks: (1) It is noisier than implied by the description ""ultra-quiet"".  I really thought it would be very quiet.  It isn't silent.  Someone in the next room can definitely hear it is running, especially on wood floors.  Compared to my previous small shredder, it sounds similar, or slightly better due to no stressing sounds.  But I might not shred while someone is on the phone in the room out of politeness.  (2) You can't fit many envelopes width-wise if you want to avoid fractional readable text appearing on the shreds, but you can just pull out the contents and drop them together.  (3) It does mound up inside under the opening like any shredder, but its size gives it a lot of room before it reaches the top.  (4) I went through 3 damaged units before settling on my 4th.The first 3 units I received all had cracks in the plastic molding, one dented in on the back near the rear handle and power port.  I recommend opening from the bottom and sliding off the box in a way that it would be easy to piece back together to ship back if you find a problem.  Amazon was superb, quickly sending 3 in sequence until temporarily pulling the item to inspect inventory, finding no problem, and a week or two later called to send me my 4th.  My 4th actually had a loose plastic screw that doesn't seem to belong to anything.  But it works great, so I'm happy with it.  Just inspect and exchange within the return period if you have a problem like mine.  I am still happy I bought mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2AP5SEGFOR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PKUUGI#wasThisHelpful","R1C2AP5SEGFOR7","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:29 MinsIt is the easiest way to cut armored / shielded cable in 10 seconds.  With the quick-release lever, just adjust the nut once for the size of your cable, then just insert the cable, hold the clamp, squeeze and turn the arm a few times until you feel it spin free, release, and just twist off the armor (as shown towards the end of my video).  It cuts only deep enough to cut the armor without cutting the wires within.  Although it doesn't hurt to tug on the wires and peek to make sure they are fine, but after repeated use I found they were always perfect.  You can try to cut by hand using wire snips (horrible) or by hacksaw (makes me uneasy to risk nicking a wire), but having the right tool like this make it like cutting butter.  I would buy this over and over again for cutting shielded cable.  It save me so much time and effort.We did a lot of cutting with this for a home improvement project on my own home, as I am an avid handyman in my own home.  Actually my wife did most of the cutting with this one.  We made a lot of cuts, and this made it easy and fast.  I first tried to use wire snips like I do with normal electrical wire, and I spent an hour making slow, painful progress before giving up figuring there had to be another way.  I don't trust the depth control by manually cutting with a hack saw.  Having so many cuts ahead of us, we searched for and found this tool.  And wow are we happy.  I cannot attest to whether it will hold up to a pro using it every hour of every day, but for doing a lot of cutting for electrical work (outlets & lighting) that I was doing in my garage, it was perfect.The cutting blade rides the edge of the slot that it sticks through on mine.  At first it seems to be a problem, but that is because there is a bunch of wax on the wheel or in the assembly that doesn't fit between the edge when you push it through at first, and seems like you are grinding the edge.  But it easily works itself off, doesn't really even hinder the first cut you do, and by the end it is spinning freely without a problem at all.  Even if it were to be a problem, I would happily just buy another because it saved us so much time and effort.The RS-101A has the quick release lever instead of only a nut that you have to re-tighten and loosen each time, which is great for cutting the same size cable over and over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFSXSR6TT42F5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GF31GE#wasThisHelpful","RFSXSR6TT42F5","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:50 MinsAt first I thought this was decent light-weight drill that was up to the job.  I got this as a gift and am very happy with it as a second drill to augment my existing 8-year old Ryobi ONE Plus drill (that I recently dropped and bent).  There is a lot to like.  It seems plenty of power (at first), it is smaller, lighter, has a light, and is easier to use when it comes to weight, size, & light.  I especially like the light, which is quite useful when drilling / screwing in corners and out of the way places without great lighting.  It fits into more spaces than my old drill, which is useful in cramped spaces that the other drill might not even fit.  The charger is very small too, which means you could fit the whole thing in a drawer or small space.  Overall, is a light duty drill for light work, or small spaces.It is missing some conveniences, that kept it from being my one and only primary drill when I first bought it.  (1) It doesn't have a magnetic strip for holding loose items.  It has been so convenient with my Ryobi to have screws & drill bits stuck right on the base of the drill.  (2) The screwdriver is not magnetic to hold a screw on.  This is a huge deal, but easily replaced by just using any screwdriver insert that is magnetic.  It is so convenient on my Ryobi to place a screw on it without having to hold the screw with a second hand.  But the magnetic part is not actually the drill itself, so you should be able to buy one.  (3) It comes with only one battery.  It is very convenient to have two so you never have to stop your work.  You can buy them separately, but they aren't cheap.  (4) The screw direction in/out arrows are hard to see at a glance.  It is much nicer when the arrow is plain and clear right on the button. (5) It doesn't come with a case, so you may have to find a box to put it in if not going in a drawer.  (6) The trigger sensitivity seems a little faster than I would prefer to really control the speed.  It just doesn't seem as natural to vary the speed as it did with my Ryobi that seemed to have more degrees of freedom in acceleration.I do a lot of handy work and home projects around my own house, and I absolutely loved my Ryobi ONE Plus I bought 8 years ago.  I was happy with this drill as a second drill.  It is great for when my Ryobi will not fit or runs out of battery.  If you are an avid handyman around your house, you might really miss some of the features I mentioned if this were your only drill.  But if you just need a drill for occasional light work, this one should be fine.  I could recommend it for light use.  But more real power and conveniences would be better for extended heavy use.UPDATE: This is really a light-duty drill.  I recently did a lot of work in my garage, and this drill did not perform.  It couldn't drill through wood studs that I would normally easily do with my Ryobi.  It just wouldn't drill wood sometimes.  Furthermore, the trigger is too sensitive for my preference with screws.  I feel much more control on my other drills than I have with this.  It ramps up its speed too quickly and feels like it has less control.

(2) The screwdriver is not magnetic to hold a screw on.  This is a huge deal, but easily replaced by just using any screwdriver insert that is magnetic.  It is so convenient on my Ryobi to place a screw on it without having to hold the screw with a second hand.  But the magnetic part is not actually the drill itself, so you should be able to buy one.  (3) It comes with only one battery.  It is very convenient to have two so you never have to stop your work.  You can buy them separately, but they aren't cheap.  (4) The screw direction in/out arrows are hard to see at a glance.  It is much nicer when the arrow is plain and clear right on the button. (5) It doesn't come with a case, so you may have to find a box to put it in if not going in a drawer.  (6) The trigger sensitivity seems a little faster than I would prefer to really control the speed.

" 8:50 MinsAt first I thought this was decent light-weight drill that was up to the job.  I got this as a gift and am very happy with it as a second drill to augment my existing 8-year old Ryobi ONE Plus drill (that I recently dropped and bent).  There is a lot to like.  It seems plenty of power (at first), it is smaller, lighter, has a light, and is easier to use when it comes to weight, size, & light.  I especially like the light, which is quite useful when drilling / screwing in corners and out of the way places without great lighting.  It fits into more spaces than my old drill, which is useful in cramped spaces that the other drill might not even fit.  The charger is very small too, which means you could fit the whole thing in a drawer or small space.

" 2:13 MinsI am very happy with my Kleenex Ultra 8-pack, which is the Kleenex you expect, convenient, and better than standard Kleenex.  Kleenex Ultra is nicer than Kleenex standard, which seems thicker, sturdier, and softer (but less absorbent if used for minor spills).  I just put this on subscription every 2 months, is usually a good value, and very convenient to keep stocked.  You get a variety of colors, which vary by shipment, and you might get multiple of the same design in a box.  I have received 3 orders of this now, and am very happy.The main drawback is that you cannot pick your colors.  You get a random selection, which is usually just fine.  But there may be colors you dislike.  You might end up with multiple of your least favorite design in a box.  I once got several boxes where the sheets were not fully cut and would pull multiple and had to tear them, which I figure could happen at the store as well.  I once noticed a slight funky smell when using a few boxes, which I am rather sensitive to, but it isn't always the case as I haven't noticed it recently.Overall, it is Kleenex Ultra, the same as you would find at the store (as far as I can tell), in a convenient box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CILARWB5MZ05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YD8232#wasThisHelpful","R2CILARWB5MZ05","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:16 MinsThis is a perfect switch.  I own many of both the 3-prong grounded 52149 and the 2-prong 5365 (both shown in video), and I love them.  I bought a number of these to deal with vampire electronics that draw power even when off, such as my laptop power brick, old speakers, xbox, and a rarely used satellite receiver.  I also use them to easily toggle lights on/off from the same location.  The construction feels great, holds sufficiently tight but not too tight, is easy to tell when is on or off by a noticeable lever, has a good solid click on/off that I like, and are clean looking white.Just pay attention to the orientation of your plug to make sure the switch will be on the side you want.  Honestly, either way works for me, but it is more convenient when the switches face outward or upward.  As long as the ground is on the bottom, you are fine.  For a flat surface, like on a power strip, then you need to pay more close attention so that the ground is oriented away from you.  But even so, I have some reversed and don't mind reaching around to toggle them.  But it might matter to you.  Also they are white and large enough to be noticeable if you were trying to hide them.I actually like it more than my Belkin Power Conserve grounded switch because I can have several of these on the same power strip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R393QKY9X97IYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DNGAZ6#wasThisHelpful","R393QKY9X97IYO","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a remarkable camera.  I was very impressed by its features, ease of use, and quality.  Its image stabilization is superb, great easy to use LCD, easy intuitive buttons, and surprisingly impressive projector.  Sony camcorders are remarkable, and significantly better than smart phone video.  The image stabilization, wide angle lens that catches so much more without backing away, ease of use, handling all kinds of lighting, and accurate capture of what you see with your naked eye keep me thoroughly impressed.  Specifically the HDR-PJ810 improves on an already stellar situation.  It just seems like an impressive piece of elegant machinery.  It is impressive to see the stabilization at work, or the projector work so well.  The projector is brighter and more useful than I expected, and automatically adapts to the angle on the wall to attempt to make it most square and viewable.  It is impressive to see it recognize and adjust.I own 3 Sony camcorders now: (1) CM160 after thoroughly researching and purchasing my first, which I love to this day and still take it as my preferred camera on vacations and to theme parks, (2) CX580, & (3) this HDR-PJ810.  Starting from the awesome quality, light & compact CX160, the CX580 wasn't a noticeable improvement upon the CX160.  But now this HDR-PJ810 really impressed me out of the box.  It seemed more refined, responsive, more full featured, wonderful stabilization, supports wireless/NFC transfers, dual format recording, and a surprisingly good projector.The drawbacks are its size and weight compared to my CX580 and CX160.  It doesn't fit in the standard small camcorder cases, only by a bit, but too much that you can't cram it in if you tried.  I prefer to take a tiny case on vacation and to theme parks and nearly forget it is even with me.  This is also heavier by enough to be noticeable.  When holding for long periods, you will get tired with even the smallest cameras, so it could be a factor if you use for long periods without a tri-pod.  But it is still nothing in size or weight compared to what people are buying in expensive SLRs.  Instead, you get a lot more features for the added weight & size.  Regardless, this is easy to recommend if leaving the standard small camcorder case isn't an issue.Recommended: Sony BC-TRV travel charger (see my video review), extra FV50 battery (when you want to pack light), & FV70 battery (when you want one charge to last longer).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEAXAUEJVL5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNJWV1W#wasThisHelpful","RTEAXAUEJVL5A","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 10:00 MinsI was really impressed with how light this was.  Out of the box it felt like a feather, then you wrap the cord which seems like half the weight.  Going up and down stairs will be a dream with this one, with one hand.  I was also very impressed by the warranty and 5 free tune-ups (according to the paperwork).  I can easily forgive the lack of attachments for the simplification of such a lightweight swiveling vacuum.  The carry handle is a nice touch.  Buttons on the handles are nice (as long as they work).  It is louder than I expected, but no louder than my old Kenmore upright.  I like that it works on all floors without frequent adjustments.  The swivel feature helps you reach edges, corners, and around things without moving your feet as much.  It easily stands without being tipping, easily releases for use, and can lay flat (in use or for storage).  It is a lot easier to store than my canister, and easier than my Kenmore upright.  I also liked the cord clip that helps hold the cord out of your way.  I was very impressed out of the box, and after some use, I still think it is quite good.Its drawbacks are: (1) It is noisier than you might think, but it makes no claim of being ultra-quiet.  (2) The light on the front is weak, so it isn't a headlight for going into dark closets.  (3) It isn't as wide as some uprights, so it may take slightly more passes, but that can be a pro too to fit into smaller spaces as I found with my equally sized canister vacuum.  (4) No attachments (but I completely forgive this for the design benefits it enables).Mine came with a defect with its power buttons.  It turned on the first time, but immediately stopped working.  I had to pull the plug to turn it off, and then couldn't turn it on anymore.  The power buttons are entirely wireless, backed by a battery.  My battery compartment seems to have a defect where the battery doesn't stay in place, connected to both terminals.  Moving it with my finger a little got it to make sufficient connections to continue working for now.  That was a disappointment.  Otherwise I was pretty impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMVCD584HJ14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SSTYRO#wasThisHelpful","R1GMVCD584HJ14","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:55 MinsThis is a simple, big, durable flashlight.  If you want a big, heavy, flashlight that should last longer on one set of batteries and be more durable than most, then this is a good bet.  It offers decent light output, better than cheap alternatives, with a high and low setting, and a bright center surrounded by a fairly clean even flood.  There are smaller, lighter, equally bright alternatives out there, but in the space targeted for this size and use, it is decent.  Personally, I prefer my much smaller, lighter high powered Coast flashlights.  But you just have to decide on whether larger or smaller it better for you.  There are many garage or trunk applications that this is suited for.Its drawbacks are its (1) size, (2) weight, and (3) single focus beam compared to some alternatives.  Its top benefits are (1) longer lasting on a single set of D batteries, (2) durability, (3) you aren't going to lose it.  It is so much bigger and heavier than my equally powered Coast HP2, HP5, & HP6 flashlights.  You cannot throw it in your pocket or on your belt.  I often throw a Coast flashlight in my pocket and use it off and on throughout handyman jobs around the house.  I also prefer the option for a clean even flood, which is my default until I need to focus on something small.  I find the bright center distracting when an even flood is better, such as searching for something in the dark, or lighting your path.  But the batteries on my others dim over time, which you solve by just having more batteries on hand.  But if it is in the trunk of you car or in the garage, you might prefer longer lasting so that it is always ready.So it is loads better than incandescent flashlights of similar size in the past, and better than some cheap alternatives.  But the size & weight are significant drawbacks.  But according to a picture on the box, it is so durable you could use it as a tire stop for your car :).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEQ9N1X4G3ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3G8602#wasThisHelpful","RAEQ9N1X4G3ZD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:32 MinsI have used this dispenser for 17-18 years, and I absolutely love it.  I found one 17-18 years ago, I found it so easy to use, and I kept it ever since.  I used it at a job, used it for 3 moves, and still use it to pack any box that I need to ship.  My wife loves it too.  We recently moved, and had more stuff than ever, and constructing and sealing boxes was trivial with this.  Sharing just one, we would have to go find who had it last when we needed it, so I just got a second one.  The 17+ year old one is still as good as ever.  The only servicing I ever had to do was to trivially pinch gunk off the cutter maybe 3 times in 17 years.  Compared to no-dispenser and most other dispensers that I have tried, this is a dream.It is easy to pop on and off rolls of tape, and they will never fall off.  You run the tape out sticky-side up, unlike the little scotch tape dispensers for your desk.  It has prongs that hold the tape out so it is always ready and never gets stuck back on the roll.  The cutter works very well, and doesn't get as gunked up with the sticky side facing away from the cutter.  It is easy to hold with the plastic through the hole.  It has a hand brake on top that you really don't even think about but works to control the rate you dispense as you naturally squeeze when you hold it.  It is very easy to attach the tape to start, just pull to the end of the strip, and push down on the cutter (as shown in the video).  It is also small and compact so it easily stores on a shelf in the office without taking much space.  I honestly can't think of anything wrong with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYIDYDVC5O20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JCA280#wasThisHelpful","R2PYIDYDVC5O20","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:53 MinsIt is a decent 6 foot micro USB cable.  The connectors holds on pretty well, tighter than my existing cable, but not overly tightly either.  I've had some cables that held too tightly that seemed to require too much force to remove, but this strikes a good balance.  The cable is a little thicker than some, which might help protect the cable when strung out 6 feet.  The plastic connectors are a bit bulky.  The underlying metal connectors themselves seemed identical to any others that I have had, except about the tightness which I think it strikes a good balance.  The cable overall seems like a decent cable that does the job, but doesn't seem special or supple like some premium cables if you wanted it to feel elegant.The plastic grip at the connectors is slightly bulky compared to some other cables.  The plastic on the micro connector is as thick as my Nokia Lumia 910.  On both ends, the plastic grip is overall larger (longer and ticker) than the cable that came with my phone.  It might be a positive for some if you wanted more to grip onto.  For others, it just makes the cable feel a bit less elegant than some cables.But make sure you actually need a micro USB 2.0.  It is very close in size to mini USB 2.0.  Micro USB 3.0 is not the same connector as micro USB 2.0.  I compare and show the ports & connectors in the video if you are unsure.  But at the time of this review, most non-Apple smart phones seem to use micro USB 2.0.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5T3SNU6M0A8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XOK1SU#wasThisHelpful","R2M5T3SNU6M0A8","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:49 MinsThey are identical replacement blades & foil for the Remington FR-730, recommended every 6 months.  If you just need to replace worn out blades & foil, then this does it.  At first I loved my Remington FR-730 which seemed effortless compared to my previous worn out rotary.  In time as the blades dulled it took more and more work on the same area and pressing harder.  You aren't supposed to press hard.  So replacing the blades should restore the cutting performance.  In reality it didn't restore to my original effortless impression, but it was noticeably better, and I didn't have to press hard anymore.  Especially on short hair (like upper lip) it catches it with fewer passes and lighter touch than the dull blades.  But I do still have to cover the same area more than I recall in my first impression, just not quite as much.  I do believe they are the identical replacements, and I expect it probably does technically restore it to nearly new condition, but your shaving behavior with dull blades might continue to hold influence in your daily routine.As a package, it is just a small box with 1 bubble wrap bag of 3 pieces, slightly separated to not damage each other.  There are no instructions, but the box says to see the website for instructions.  At the time of my purchase, the website had no such instructions on either the part or even the shaver anymore.  But it is really easy to do.  You just pull up on the blades and they come right off.  I just didn't want to break it by assuming to pull.  I show in the video exactly how to do it if you need to see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26J6YO7WKARKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E81JS1E#wasThisHelpful","R26J6YO7WKARKC","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially an upgraded Harmony Touch, with RF control, and tweaks.  For the remote itself and software, please see my video review of the Touch.  The Ultimate has all the pros & cons of the Touch, but adds some nice features that are only positive over the Touch.  But the touch-screen oriented remote itself is still the biggest point of debate depending on your preference.  Like the Touch, the bottom line is that if you are a physical remote power user -- hold the remote one-handed & frequently use press physical buttons without looking, it is nowhere near as easy as the One or 900 were, so I say 3-star.  But if you prefer touch screens and don't mind two-handing it to play/pause/forward/back, I'd say 5-star.  The Harmony Smart Control is an interesting alternative with RF and usable physical buttons.  Compared to the Touch, you have to like RF enhancements and tweaks.  For me, I'm torn between the Smart Control and Ultimate as two polar choices about what to do about the touch screen, integrate or use your existing.  Aside from one-handed use preferences, there is a lot to like about the Ultimate.I have the One (discontinued), 900 (discontinued), Simple Control, Touch, & (this) Ultimate.  See my Touch video review for a contrast to the One & 900 which when one-handed buttons were ergonomically perfect.  The new line of remotes have their advantages over the One & 900, including much better online software, easy on-remote configuration without having to connect to a PC, and a much bigger main IR blaster.  For the Ultimate, you can still optionally use IR from the remote depending on device, they improved the RF to IR, no line-of-sight for IR needed, and the return of lots of configurable choices.  Drawbacks are: (1) Limited one-handed physical button usage (same as Touch).  (2?) Compared to the 900, you still have mini-IR blasters and can buy precision IR cables, but I haven't seen the ability (yet) to pair additional main blasters like you can for the 900.  So for my existing 900 setup with 2 main blasters and 4 mini-IR, I would have to reposition my devices to share the fewer blasters, or just rely on IR from the remote to cover the ones.  They didn't advertise the 900's ability to pair additional main blasters, so perhaps it is the same for Ultimate if you were to try another.For reliable operation, you want a straight line of sight from the IR emitters to the IR receiver on each device.  And you might have to tinker with some devices that are finicky such as by altering power on wait timing before more commands like changing input.  If you have trouble, it is most likely a line-of-sight issue (relying on bouncing signals) or device delays.  My TV starts missing commands after we dust and move the emitter without realizing it, and the default power-on timing for my TV causes it to miss the input change by default, so it needs to wait longer after power-on or add a button command to set input again at end.Related Reviews:Touch (video): http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5EF6N8ZEFLY/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permSimple Control: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDLD0ITMONOU/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permOne (video): http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9NV6NMTOWVK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm900 (video): http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPJD72HKV7HC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCRQA9JESHGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RY1G#wasThisHelpful","R3GCRQA9JESHGQ","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simpler is better in this case, if you like the idea of still having a physical remote, and an option for touch screen for advanced control.  Rather than integrating its own inferior touch screen, it just uses your existing stellar touch screen (phone or tablet).  That leaves the remote with just physical buttons without having to fit a touch screen that affects button layout, weight, battery, and natural button to thumb alignment while holding it.  If you have your phone or tablet always next to you while watching TV anyway, you might as well leverage it.  The Touch and Ultimate integrate a touch screen on the remote, and if you like using physical buttons, it significantly reduces ergonomic use of the buttons you use frequently at the top (see my Touch video review).  For those like me who really want to use physical buttons with one hand, the Simple Control is much better.  For those who like touch screens for everything, this utilizes a superior touch screen that you already have.  It simply marries the back-end pieces you need to translate to IR signals your equipment understands.I have the One (discontinued), 900 (discontinued), (this) Simple Control, Touch, & Ultimate.  See my Touch video review for a contrast to the One & 900 which when one-handed buttons were ergonomically perfect.  The new line of remotes have their advantages over the One & 900, including much better online software, easy on-remote configuration without having to connect to a PC, and a much bigger main IR blaster.  For the Smart Control, you don't have to charge the remote weekly (just replace battery yearly or so), you get a usable one-handed remote (although not as supreme as One/900), no line-of-sight for IR needed, and buttons are usable one-handed.  Drawbacks are: (1) No optional IR so you must ensure you line up IR blasters to every device. (2) Only one mini-IR repeater provided, so all your devices much have line of sight to the huge main blaster or the one mini repeater.  It does have one repeater port available so you can buy 1 more mini-IR or precision cables.  With my existing 900 setup of 2 main blasters and 4 mini-IRs, I have to reconfigure to reach anything without an option for IR from the remote itself.  But this main blaster is huge and should work for the majority of people.For reliable operation, you want a straight line of sight from the IR emitters to the IR receiver on each device.  And you might have to tinker with some devices that are finicky such as by altering power on wait timing before more commands like changing input.

My TV starts missing commands after we dust and move the emitter without realizing it, and the default power-on timing for my TV causes it to miss the input change by default, so it needs to wait longer after power-on or add a button command to set input again at end.Related Video Reviews:Touch: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5EF6N8ZEFLY/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permOne: http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9NV6NMTOWVK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm900: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPJD72HKV7HC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDLD0ITMONOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ5RYI4#wasThisHelpful","R3TDLD0ITMONOU","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 10:00 MinsI was really impressed with how light this was.  Out of the box it felt like a feather, then you wrap the cord which seems like half the weight.  Going up and down stairs will be a dream with this one, with one hand.  I was also very impressed by the warranty and 5 free tune-ups (according to the paperwork).  I can easily forgive the lack of attachments for the simplification of such a lightweight swiveling vacuum.  The carry handle is a nice touch.  Buttons on the handles are nice (as long as they work).  It is louder than I expected, but no louder than my old Kenmore upright.  I like that it works on all floors without frequent adjustments.  The swivel feature helps you reach edges, corners, and around things without moving your feet as much.  It easily stands without being tipping, easily releases for use, and can lay flat (in use or for storage).  It is a lot easier to store than my canister, and easier than my Kenmore upright.  I also liked the cord clip that helps hold the cord out of your way.  I was very impressed out of the box, and after some use, I still think it is quite good.Its drawbacks are: (1) It is noisier than you might think, but it makes no claim of being ultra-quiet.  (2) The light on the front is weak, so it isn't a headlight for going into dark closets.  (3) It isn't as wide as some uprights, so it may take slightly more passes, but that can be a pro too to fit into smaller spaces as I found with my equally sized canister vacuum.  (4) No attachments (but I completely forgive this for the design benefits it enables).Mine came with a defect with its power buttons.  It turned on the first time, but immediately stopped working.  I had to pull the plug to turn it off, and then couldn't turn it on anymore.  The power buttons are entirely wireless, backed by a battery.  My battery compartment seems to have a defect where the battery doesn't stay in place, connected to both terminals.  Moving it with my finger a little got it to make sufficient connections to continue working for now.  That was a disappointment.  Otherwise I was pretty impressed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNIG212ZJH1MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KHV0WC#wasThisHelpful","RNIG212ZJH1MH","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:34 MinsIt is an assortment of supposedly common washers for faucet repair.  It makes it very convenient to just grab a pack, and figure any washers you need are likely in there.  It saves you time from waiting to identify exactly the washers you need and time hunting around to find exact replacements, and depending on how many you need it might or might not be cheaper.  For sheer convenience, it is nice to have a pack that should have all the usual washers related to faucet repair.  But of course all that really matters is whether it actually has the washers you actually need.  It did have exactly the washers I needed.I was replacing an old faucet with a new one.  Generally you should replace existing washers to ensure no leaks.  My existing shutoffs had washers.  They looked okay at first, but upon further inspection the hot supply washer was falling apart.  To play it safe I just replaced both.I had a tiny bit of leakage at first.  But I think that is more my line and nut than the washer.

" 8:37 MinsThis faucet is very functional and looks great.  The combined hose sprayer and main faucet works great.  It is really easy to just grab and spray around and slip back.  It has 3 easy controls - stream (default), shower, and pause.  The stream mode doesn't seem as powerful as my old faucet, but doesn't seem like a bad thing, but might take longer to fill a sink.  It seems more aerated with less actual water volume.  It always reverts back to stream when you turn off or pause.  The shower mode is wide and full bodied which is noticeably better than my old faucet so it makes for quick rinsing (better than stream).  It stays on with one press until you turn off or pause.  The pause mode is great (hold to pause) so you can quickly stop the water for a short bit, such as while you pull out the hose and move to fill a pan to the side of the sink without spraying the counter.  I especially like the way the handle operates.  You can easily turn on/off and warm/cold with very good fluid control over granularity and you can do it with the side of your hand or arm if your hands are dirty and you don't want to contaminate the handle.  Lastly the soap dispenser works well and you can fill it from the top so you don't have to unscrew the reservoir to fill in the future.  Overall I am very happy with it.Installation is really easy.  But it doesn't come with universal adapters to fit just any existing shutoff.  So if your existing shutoffs do not take a 3/8 inch threaded connector, you will need to find an adapter to convert to fit or replace your shutoffs.  I spent most of my time shopping for the right adapter to convert from this 3/8 inch threaded connector to my existing 1/2 inch threaded shutoff.  I ended up buying the Watts LFA124 3/8 to 1/2 adapter and Danco 80817 replacement washers.  Also you will have to clean up around the holes after removing your existing faucet, which can take some time.  For me a bathroom cleaning block (a stone) make extremely quick work of removing old hard water deposits & grime.  The back of the box says you need plumbers putty, but the instructions never have you use it.  It comes with a gasket that seems to make a good seal without the need for plumbers putty (or clear silicon caulk) to seal around the holes.  If it weren't for not fitting my shutoff, installation would have seemed trivial.It does fit 1,2,3, or 4 hole designs, depending on whether you use the 3-hole base plate or use as a single post, and whether you use the soap dispenser.  Some people report the need to use the base plate for added stability if the sink isn't sturdy on its own.  My porcelain sink didn't need it.  However, note that the handle will still extend out to the side over a hole, so you cannot literally have existing things in both holes on either side.  But you can install the handle in either direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z23A66KN4O22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SR7T0M#wasThisHelpful","R2Z23A66KN4O22","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:03 MinsI couldn't be happier with this.  It is extremely easy to use.  You just turn it on, it immediately tells you to go to your phone settings for Bluetooth, and select it, and then it just remembers.  The buttons easily work as you would expect, and the visual display for things like power, bluetooth connection work well.  Just remember to hold for 2 seconds for power or to re-pair bluetooth because it saves you from accidentally touching them.  Most importantly, I think it sounds great from both ends.  Listing from the Jabra end sounded as good as any speakerphone that I've ever used.  Listening from the other end (talking to someone else using the Jabra speakerphone) couldn't even tell they were on speakerphone.  I thought it actually sounded better in person than it comes across in the video.  The case is a nice touch to help tote it too.  I never got any echo at all from either end.  I really couldn't be happier.I can hardly find anything not to like.  I don't understand the battery level status when I press the battery button.  And I might have preferred if the USB cable end had a notched area in the bottom plastic to hold it rather than just squeezing it slightly in the gap.  But really, that's it.  This is a no-brainer recommendation for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWF5R8ALGQFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUO5RI#wasThisHelpful","R3FWF5R8ALGQFD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Microsoft office is still the best overall office suite out there.  It is always stable and reliable.  If you have used other office suites at length, you probably know what I mean.  Among Microsoft Office releases, 2013 is largely similar to 2010, but tweaks the UI to be more tablet oriented, UI color style simplified (for better or worse), & more sky drive enablement (probably for more interoperability with Office 365).  With this retail license, you can install on one system at a time, but can transfer if you buy a new computer (every 90 days) or if there is a failure.  Office 365 on the other hand is a yearly fee but lets you install onto up to 5 PCs at the same time aside from online ""on-demand"" remote access.  Overall it is still the #1 leader, it is robust and reliable, and perhaps the most competent overall office suite out there.The UI has changed slightly to be more tablet friendly.  It works fine for mouse users, but mouse uses are likely to find the style a little less elegant.  This means start up, choices, and menus seem more boxy for swiping and selecting with your finger.  This is most noticeable on the start-up for Word when you can select types of new documents.  The color pallet is the biggest non-functional difference that makes for a more simplistic feeling monotone display.  Perhaps it is supposed to look better on a tablet this way.  But if upgrading from 2010 on mouse-based PC, you are likely to think it lost the color and texture and find it harder on your eyes.  The default all-white layout is harder on my eyes.  It is the #1 reason that if only upgrading from 2010 on a normal mouse-based PC that I'd stick with 2010.  But remember this is just visual style. The underlying functionality is still the same as ever.  Although the color pallet definitely bothers some (just see all the reviews that take issue with it).  It seems trivial for Microsoft to address it, so I hope they offer some more options in a future service pack.So if needing a new office suite, this is still one of the best choices.  They did make some style choices that I like less, but if you have a tablet it might be more ideal.  If you already have Office 2010 on a mouse-based PC, I'd probably stick with 2010 for now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVRMQBZC4UTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPWJ98#wasThisHelpful","R2VVRMQBZC4UTT","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:57 MinsIf you are are looking for a good, decent router, with lots of features, this one does the job.  Also check for updated firmware that can add more features (like guest network) and fix some issues.  It has a lot of features, more than what any average person to moderate techie needs.  It is quite easy to set up and doesn't need a lot of tinkering.  I set mine up in less than 10 minutes, which was mostly just picking and writing down choices (SSID x 2, network key, & admin password.  Its range and performance is decent, but is not the top of the line range or performance, but should be good enough for most.  For laptops, tablets, and smartphone usage around the home, including upstairs, it gives decent coverage.  But my previous Buffalo N300 router was a bit stronger and did better (although still not perfect) for my xbox in an upstairs bedroom within a wooden cabinet with a glass door (an unreasonable expectation).  But regardless, the Buffalo router got 4-bars in that cabinet where this gets 3-bars.  Either are loads better than the cheap Westell DSL router that came with my DSL.  For normal usage around even upstairs rooms, it does the job reliably.There are a few drawbacks.  (1) It didn't quite have the power to get through every obstacle (but was respectable) that my Buffalo N300 could.  (2) Its LEDs are very bright compared to my other 2 routers, and can be a little distracting.  (3) The 5.0 GHz range wasn't as strong upstairs (although that is expected of 5.0 GHz vs 2.4 GHz).  (4) It is large and cannot be stood up.  (5) The 2.4 GHz ping was double (102ms) that of the 5.0 GHz (52ms).  Realistically, the only 2 things that disappointed me was that it didn't beat my Buffalo N300 router on my upstairs Xbox in a cabinet, and the LED lights are a little bright (maybe they can be configured in the settings?).Otherwise it has a lot of features and capabilities.  I would recommend it anyone who wants more features than my Buffalo N300 offers.  But if you are looking to push the range and performance to extremes, then there are more expensive better routers out there.  But I can still recommend this one for normal needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTF7C5GW7HVV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090EC5NC#wasThisHelpful","RTF7C5GW7HVV5","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:02 MinsIf you have a USB *3.0* micro port, then this is a good quality cable.  But make sure you actually have a 3.0 micro port, which is wider with a notch, and is *not* the same as a tiny USB 2.0 micro port.  I show some port comparisons in the video at the 1 minute mark.  Most cell phones and tiny portable devices use tiny USB 2.0 micro ports (at least as of 2013), and cannot be used with this.  But most USB 3.0 external drives will use this port.  So just verify what port you actually have before ordering, and compare to the pictured micro end of the cable (or compared in the video).It is a good quality USB 3.0 micro connector cable.  It seems slightly more sturdy than the stock cable that came with my external drive.  As a relatively short (3 feet) digital cable, signal quality shouldn't be a problem on any digital cable.  The micro end is colored blue, which isn't always the case.  The connectors otherwise seem standard.  The thickness is where you feel like it is more sturdy.

" 4:48 MinsThis contains (1) a generic USB charger, plus (2) a USB to Apple 30-pin connector cable.  So if you have an iPhone 4S or below, or iPod with 30-pin connector, then this kit is really for you.  Others can still make use of the USB charger, but bring your own cable.  It is a small, compact charger that doesn't stick out of your cigarette lighter very far, which is nice to have a low profile.  The light is surprisingly bright (as shown in the video).  For some, it might be too bright.  For others it is a welcome bright light you can actually see in the sunlight.  A small piece of electrical tape would do to cover it partially if it really bothers you.  But is bright enough that you will know for sure it is on, especially at night.  The bottom line is that it works, is a nice low profile, and has a light bright enough to see in the sunshine, but some may not like the brightness at night.You can use the USB charger with nearly any device provided you use your own USB charging cable.  Most phone chargers are just a USB plug for a power outet plus the USB cable to whatever port the device has.  The cable they provide is for the older Apple connector prior to the iPhone 5, such as the iPhone 4S or below.  Otherwise you need to remember to bring your existing cable with you.  In my case, I have an iPhone 5 and a Nokia Lumia 920 Windows 8 Phone, both with USB wall chargers and cables.  So I can just use those existing cables.  But if you want to leave the cable in the car, you will need to buy the cable separately, or buy a car charger that comes with the correct extra cable to match your device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKJVPTKO366O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KTIX50#wasThisHelpful","R1NKJVPTKO366O","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:39 MinsOf small massage cushions (meaning not full back chair cushions), I think it is possibly the best of its type.  It is very well constructed, seems like a quality product right out of the box, and does a good job doing what it does.  It is larger than many small cushions, so it fits better on your back and stays in place better than some.  It has larger rollers than many others I've tried, including Sharper Image full back massage cushions, which is nice because you really feel it more, but not in a painful way.  I prefer these larger rollers.  There is no heat, but that is okay unless you were expecting it.  You can reverse the direction of the rotation, which is nice, and not all others do this (including Sharper Image).  There are 3 intensity settings, which just means they rotate faster, not deeper.  I really like the slowest rotation setting.  The remote cord is plenty long enough, as well as the power cord.  For its type, I think it is a quality product.  Plus you can use it on more than just your back.  I particularly like using it on my feet.It does have two main drawbacks.  (1) All cushions that do not fill your whole back cause back strain where they leave your back unsupported.  You cannot just lean back and relax.  This is the largest failing of this cushion, or any of its type.  One part of your back feels better, but the other unsupported part aches from no support.  You can supplement this by placing additional pillows to fill the gaps, but then that also makes it harder to reposition the cushion.  At least this cushion is rather large compared to many of its type, and leaves you more supported than some others.  (2) Second, like any others of this type, it doesn't move up or down at all.  This means you have to constantly reposition it.  So you cannot just sit back and relax before you find yourself moving it again.  It it nice to work one spot sometimes when you really need it.  But the cushion is large, and the rollers are in the top half.  You can flip it over to get the lower part of your back.  But you do need to do a lot of repositioning.In terms of amount of relaxation and muscle soothing, after the added strain of the drawbacks, the net affect is just ""okay"".  I cannot highly recommend any cushion.  For the price, I think it is okay to keep.  I never yearn to use it, but I grab it once in a while.  After this I bought the Sharper Image full back massage cushion and was equally unimpressed and returned it.  If you are set on a small cushion, this seems to be one of the best of its type, and is well constructed.

The bottom line is at the end of the day, I expect to feel better, more relaxed and eased muscles, for having used this.  But it just didn't make me feel any better.  It has a lot of advantages over a small massage cushion that only rotates.  This is a full back cushion, so (1) you can lean back without the strain of leaning against only a partial smaller cushion, and (2) it traverses your back for you instead of you having to constantly reposition a fixed rotating cushion.  It is slightly better than a fixed cushion, but still did not do the job.  I really liked this more than other full-back massage chair cushions I tried, such as those from HoMedics and cheaper ones from Sharper Image.  So if you are set on one, I would suggest this as a best-of-available choices candidate, but any of them are hard to recommend for a good relaxing experience.  Due to the price, and it doesn't really do the job for me, I am returning mine.  I am going to start considering a real, full massage chair.  The net relaxing experience was just ""okay"".The heat aspect was very faint, if it even heated at all.  I expected the ""heat"" mode to actually feel warm or hot.  But I couldn't even tell if the heat was on, and seemed to be warm from the friction of the moving rollers alone.  I do like the rolling action much better on this Sharper Image than the other full-back massage cushions, especially compared to HoMedics.  And I rather liked the squeezing action of the air bags.  It was really nice that it would do the moving up and down for you instead of you moving the cushion anytime you want a change.  It also helps it roll past tender spots so if it does hurt, it hurts only for a second and moves on.  It isn't very tall, so it is unlikely to reach your shoulders unless you are 5'5"" or less.  I am 5'10"" and it didn't get quite high enough.  But it does get lower quite well, better than my fixed-location massage cushion for sure.The out of the box experience was very disappointing.  It had poor packaging internally and came with the bottom cushion carelessly mashed into the air bags when folded up and inserted into the box.  This left two defects, but weren't deal breakers.  It caused folds in the side air bags, which left the right one's inner bag creased and would not naturally stay to the side, so you have to hold it to the side as you sit.  And because the seat cushion was mashed against a harder structure, the foam was compressed and did not fully bounce back.  At first it was paper thin where it was in contact and only feels more normal after 2 weeks, but still hasn't fully bounced back so it is less even.  It was disappointing to find that they crammed it in and in such a way that it made it less nice.  It did not make a real functional difference.  But the first impression was lost.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTVS2I8CIVSZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AVJLYC#wasThisHelpful","RTVS2I8CIVSZD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:16 MinsThese are great for cable management, such as around your computer or entertainment center.  They are much better than the alternatives, mainly twist ties and cable zip ties.  Twist ties are small, break after reusing a few times, and can pinch into your cable shielding if you crank them down.  Cable ties are nice and easy to zip on, but have to be cut off, and sometimes can be risky to use cutters so close to your wires.  These are much more flexible.  You can always open them and add another wire and are plenty long.  I was surprised that the entire length was Velcro, not just the ends, so it easily grips.  But it is not your usual Velcro (not like on shoes or bags), it thinner and a felt-like bottom side.  But it doesn't seem cheap or too flimsy.  They seem very appropriate for cable management.  They are plenty reusable, but are meant for occasional re-opening, not something you do daily.  It has a eye to slip a smaller end through, but it is entirely optional to use, as the Velcro alone holds well.  You can even cut them to any length if you prefer.There are 3 drawbacks. (1) If you have a pile of them, they stick together, unlike twist ties and cable ties.  So you have to prepare to use them by setting out some separately.  They also stick to themselves.  So if you are trying to use them one handed while handing onto wires with the other, it can be more difficult if they start to stick together or to themselves.  This will be noticeable, but I think acceptable.  (2) It takes sightly more work to remove them from the roll than peeling the next twist tie, but really isn't a problem.  (3) If you are using the optional eye hole, upon reuse the narrow strips around the eye hole are a weak point that will wear down faster, but you don't even have to use it and can cut it off.  Also it is Velcro around the eye hole so it sticks around the hole too so it doesn't easily slide if it catches.  You can't just pull to or loosen.Just picture thin felt-backed Velcro strips.  It is hard to expect any more from them if you understand they are just entire strips of a fine Velcro.  I like them, but they are not revolutionary.  When any cable management solution has some pros and cons, I think these do a great job.  The only thing that bothers me at all is that they stick together, but removing that would cause other drawbacks, which I believe is better as it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDJQVBTDC5MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E1Y5O6#wasThisHelpful","R3PDJQVBTDC5MF","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:06 MinsThis is a perfect 270 degree right angle connector cable.  Unlike some other cables, and many angle adapters, this doesn't stick out too far in either direction, not too far past the head and not too tall.  This is critical because if it stands too tall, like some others that stick out an inch or more, then it still sticks out the side and is noticeable or speakers still cannot sit flush against the TV edge.  Also some TV ports don't have a lot of room beyond the port, and if the head of the cable sticks too far past the port, it doesn't fit, but this one fits well.  As shown in the video, this fits with room to spare.  If your TV is wall mounted, you will still have to pend the cable that sticks straight back and the amount of room might be tight depending on your TV.IMPORTANT: Pay close attention to which direction your port is facing, which will tell you which kind of right angle you need, 90 degree or 270 degree.  An HDMI port looks like a letter ""D"", and note which direction the rounded side of the ""D"" faces.  This cable works for ports where the rounded side faces forward where the cable runs in the opposite direction.  Some call this cable 270 degree.  There seem to be a lot more 90 degree cables out there where the rounded side is in the direction that the cable runs.  I needed one where the rounded side faced forward, and after searching I landed on this cable.  There are flexible adapters that can bend either way, but they usually stick out farther and tend to have poor reviews that report failure.  I really needed this direction that this cable supports, and am very happy that it solves my need.This is a standard Video+Audio v1.3 HDMI cable.  It only supports video+audio, which is standard for most people with cable boxes, DVRs, DVD or Blu-ray players, etc.  But if you need this cable to carry a wired internet signal to your TV passing it through from some other device, then you should look for a v1.4 cable or a v1.3 that says ""with Ethernet"".  This, being v1.3, also doesn't have what v1.4 adds -- 3D and audio-return.  If you don't need the TV to send audio back to something like a receiver through this same cable, and if you don't have 3D, then you should be vine with normal HD video & audio.  You can find more about HDMI specs on Wikipedia if you are unsure about differences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRIVHX7W74IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056YN83G#wasThisHelpful","RWRIVHX7W74IR","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:51 MinsThis small flashlight is incredibly powerful for such a small size.  It is comfortable in your hand, well constructed, and easier than many to carry with you.  But it is not quite pocket size, so you can easily stick the nicely narrow shaft into your back pocket with the head sticking out.  It blows away any older incandescent light, and many other cheaper LED flashlights I have.  It beats out my other multi-LED flashlight in light quality, evenness, and convenience.  Compared to any flight light I've had in the past, any of the Coast lights offer such a great, bright, and even flood light that is so much nicer for lighting a general small area than those only with a focused beam.  I find it easier to work with.  The construction quality seems top notch.  The low beam mode seems pointless, which seems about 10-20% of normal brightness, and not very useful to me.  Just use the high light and carry some extra rechargeable batteries instead of trying to conserve.Coast has other smaller flashlights if an easier fit in your pocket is more important, such as the HP5 that is the exact same light but only one AA instead of the two AA that this takes.  This one is longer only by the length of the second AA, and the light is noticeably brighter for it.  Or one that is even easier to carry is the tiny HP2 that is my favorite, takes one AAA, and is amazingly powerful for the tiny size.  The HP6 is noticeably brighter than the HP5 (as shown in the video).In my house, I love this flashlight for its brightness & small size, but it is still my third choice, but only to the other two smaller Coast flashlights for pocket size convenience.  I still tend to grab the HP2 first because it is so tiny, then the HP5 when I feel I might need to focus the light, and then the HP6 when I think I might need even more light.  When needed, I just tote it around sticking up out of my pocket like a tool belt.  But when the power went out yesterday night, this was the best.  Coast make a large range of flashlights.  You need to pick the most ideal combination for you.  If I could have only two, I'd get the HP2 & HP6.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7MIA84FG5FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Z29UGI#wasThisHelpful","R2R7MIA84FG5FC","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:56 MinsThe best thing about this is it looks so much better than foam can coolers.  It is at least as good as the foam coolers.  Better yet it does seem to keep cans slightly cooler than in foam.  The foam can coolers (cozies) work fine, as I used one for years.  But foam can coolers are often quite ugly, display an advertisement, and often the advertised company doesn't even exist anymore.  This looks so much nicer.  It claims to keep cans cold for up to 3 hours.  I've never taken that long to drink a can, so I cannot say if it really holds for 3 hours.  But in normal drinking, I can see it seems as though it is slightly better, but not dramatically so.  It is at least as good, and maybe slightly better, but it was not a stunning difference.  Buy it for looks and at least as good performance, but probably better.The thermal-dynamics speak for themselves.  It should be the best possible solution for keeping a can cool without ice or refrigeration.  It is a genuine thermos, using a vacuum.  It simply has two walls separated by a vacuum that has no air to transmit heat.  It completely knocks out one kind of heat transfer.  The only place it should touch is at the very top where the metal comes together.  Without any molecules in-between, it cannot transfer heat.  There are still other ways heat transfers, but that is a major one.  A foam insulator instead works like insulation in your attic, with many tiny air spaces.  It slows the progress of heat transfer between air pockets by having many of them.  Heat will slowly work its way heating the air bubble by bubble in foam.  The effectiveness on slowing heat transfer is the R rating.  But this Thermos is a vacuum.  It should be superior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13WJJYXEMWLS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000644AF#wasThisHelpful","R13WJJYXEMWLS8","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:27 MinsThis is an easy top choice for a very powerful small & convenient flashlight.  It easily fits in your pocket, takes only one AA battery and is sized only as wide along the shaft.  It blows away any older incandescent light, and many other cheaper LED flashlights I have.  It beats out my other multi-LED flashlight in light quality, evenness, and convenience.  It is very ideally shaped to throw in your pocket while working on odd jobs around the house that need more light.  Compared to any flight light I've had in the past, any of the Coast lights offer such a great, bright, and even flood light that is so much nicer for lighting a general small area than those only with a focused beam.  I find it easier to work with.  The construction quality seems top notch.  The low beam mode seems pointless, which seems about 10-20% of normal brightness, and not very useful to me.  Just use the high light and carry some extra rechargeable batteries instead of trying to conserve.In my house, it is second only to the even smaller and practically equally powerful Coast HP2.  This HP5 actually isn't noticeably brighter than the HP2, and has a wider head that is takes more room in your pocket than the HP2, which takes 1 AAA and the entire body is only as wide.  This HP5 has a focus-able head that can switch from an even flood to a focus light (or anywhere in-between), which can be useful.  Compared to the HP6, this HP5 is more ideally sized for just throwing in your pocket.  The HP6 is noticeably brighter than the HP5 (as shown in the video), but as it takes two AA batteries and is longer by one AA length.  But for the HP6 length alone, it doesn't fit in my pocket unless I just tote it around sticking up like a tool belt, which is only when I am focused on running around using it.  I still tend to grab the HP2 first because it is so tiny, then the HP5 when I feel I might need to focus the light, and then the HP6 when I think I might need even more light.The only negative is that with my HP5 unit, the head doesn't as easily move between flood and focus modes.  It takes more force than I expected.  My HP6 moves much more easily.  Neither can switch with just a finger, but at first I thought I was forcing it.  It really is perfectly fine and not a problem when you actually want to toggle the mode.  It really seems like the looseness of the head will likely vary between units as my HP5 and HP6 heads were very different in tightness.  The second thing to mention is that I thought the HP5 would be noticeably brighter than the 66 lumen HP2, but I really didn't notice a difference.  But it is still plenty powerful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179XRXXZXONYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Z29UCM#wasThisHelpful","R179XRXXZXONYP","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:53 MinsThe best thing about this bulb is its shape.  It nearly perfectly fits in place of any incandescent, including any lamp shades that connect directly to the bulb.  In other aspects it is a very close match to the standard warm 60W incandescent and is a suitable replacement that should be perfectly fine.  The color temperature is quite good, and you might not even notice if someone didn't tell you it is a LED.  I've been a stickler for incandescent & halogen color bulbs that has slowed my use of LED & CFL in living spaces, but I can live with this one (which says a lot).  But you can still tell if you are looking for it.  In a world that is moving on from incandescent, I think this is an equitable replacement.  You can see in my video that it seems fine, but you can still tell a slight difference when I toggle between them.  I am thrilled with the shape, and satisfied with the color and evenness.The most noticeable difference is in the evenness of the light, which is still decent, but noticeably different.  The bottom half of the bulb is plastic, so light only outputs from the top.  So in a lamp shade that is evenly lit with incandescent, you will see the light skew from more at the top and less at the bottom.  I still think this is fine, just not perfect, as shown in the video.  The second most noticeable difference is the weight.  This weighs 6 times more than a normal incandescent bulb.  It weights in at 6.25oz (over a half pound) versus 1oz for an incandescent bulb.  However the weight doesn't really matter and is perfectly fine.  Only beware if you have some lightweight fixtures with flexible necks.The one thing that isn't equitable to any incandescent is the dimming.  This applies to all dimmable LED & CFL bulbs and is not unique to this one.  You cannot just swap just any incandescent bulb with this if it is in an incandescent dimmer.  You must use a dimmer that is compatible with LED and CFL, or you will shorten the lift of the LED or CFL, which takes away the cost savings in the long run.  If you don't know if yours is compatible, if yours slowly rises or dims to turn on & off, it probably is *not* compatible.  The slow rise & fall of light is easy on the eyes, but bad for LED & CFL circuitry.  Also some dimmers pump an initial burst to help incandescent bulbs turn on faster, which also hurts LED & CFL.  So my home is full of the old dimmers which will take me some time and more expense to replace.  But none of that is the fault of this LED specifically.  This is just FYI.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OSXE6JG7ZYHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AC7RBEO#wasThisHelpful","R3OSXE6JG7ZYHD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Photo & Video suite is actually just a bundle of the independent photo and video suite, otherwise available separately.  You get 2 discs each with their own serial number.  These are powerful tools with lots of options that can do a really professional job.  For example, the video suite can help you make a really professional video with interesting titling affects & transitions, and somewhat easily.  It gives you templates to sample easily and just drag & drop in, with place holders to just edit the title text and right-click to replace a video or picture embedded within.  So your video starts with a nice titled introduction with embedded video (or picture) in a smaller bubble to introduce the segment.  There are lots of tools, filters / lenses, and options at your disposal.  Although with more options comes some amount of confusion and complexity at first.  More options and power doesn't make for quick editing.  The video conversions & combining might be optimized, but the time to actually work on your project will take some time.  This is not as intuitive or quick to do simple editing jobs as some simpler editors that just let you quickly trim/split/cut/combine/convert video.  It doesn't simply browser or organize your existing media library, but you can drag in anything to start working on it in a project.  But if you want to take the time to really work on something, then this offers the tools that help you do something really professional.The software starts with a getting started pop up with links to video tutorials to help you get started.  I strongly advise you to watch them if you are new (like me) to advanced editing tools, or you can be overwhelmed or confused about what to do and how to do it.  But it really isn't too bad.  But if you are expecting to just find your videos and start doing quick editing with them, this isn't the case.  For example, my Sony Camcorder comes with really good simple software that finds and browses all my videos easily, and can trim/cut/split/combine/convert videos as just the video files that they are.  But with this, you work within a project, and can drag/drop files into a story board, work on them from there, work on it to perfections, then produce the result.  But if you wanted to make a longer video like a wedding video with separately titled scenes, then this software can do far more than the simple camcorder software cannot.  So if you are looking only for an incremental step up from your existing editing tool, this one is just something suited for the larger picture than quick editing.  I wish it was a little easier to bridge the gap, and suit all needs.  For example, I do a lot of video reviews on Amazon, and it will take a lot less time to use the software that came with my camcorder to simply trim/cut/combine/convert to upload to Amazon more quickly.  But if I wanted to put together a DVD, I'd probably want to take more time to produce something that wasn't simply pure cut video that this suite can do.There is a lot to like, if you really want to spend the time to poke around and try tools.  For example, you can reverse videos, speed up or slow time video (think time lapse or slow to fill the time slot you want), separate video & audio tracks, overlay video & titles, overlay additional audio tracks, add music, etc.  It can read from lots of video formats, and has one of the most comprehensive video output format choices easily labeled for you that I have seen, much more than my camcorder software.  The video tutorials are helpful.The drawbacks are: (1) It doesn't have a simple mode to simply start with your existing video library like the usual camcorder software. (2) It takes more of your time for simple quick editing tasks (which is probably using the wrong tool for the job).  (3) There are so many choices that it can be overwhelming (but they have tutorials and you can ignore the stuff you don't want to look into yet).  (4) The free audio tracks are rather generic and make it sound like a little cheap (but they probably are royalty free and can use for the web) but for personal stuff you probably want your own music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340NX59UG0QKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MR2GUA#wasThisHelpful","R340NX59UG0QKP","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:14 MinsThis DVD set package is quite nice, although not the standard shape for media cabinets.  From a packaging perspective, I had zero problems with mine, all discs were flawless.  I have a few comments about the ease of sliding in the lower discs, but it was in superb condition.  The DVD case that is in the form of the book of spells is quite nice.  I think they did a great job in the look and construction of the book.  The cover is textured nicely, the pages with a somewhat antique feel and thick.  Each season's section starts out with graphics and a nicely done table of contents for each disc.  Personally, I would have preferred if each disc's table of contents were mirrored on the back of the previous page to the actual disc slot so it lines up with the actual disc that I open the book to for added convenience to reference with the disc I am pulling.  But overall, I thought it was styled very well, and constructed well.Functionally speaking, I still prefer the normally sized DVD cases that fit on a media cabinet shelf along with all my other DVDs.  Being a completely different shape, it doesn't fit on a shelf that fits a usual DVD case.  I would prefer either a collection of slim-line case boxes for each season, or even better is a set of cases with the flip book style that even more compactly fits a complete season.  This is actually available, or if you purchase the seasons individually, but the older style that is out of production or individual seasons are more expensive.  So I still prefer the better value over function.There were reports of issues by other reviews, that was reports of glue particles on some discs.  What I can say is mine was flawless, which I show in the video, and was sold by Amazon.  I recommend checking your discs within the Amazon return/exchange window in case yours has any issue.  I've never had a problem exchanging defective items for free by Amazon.

" 9:56 MinsThis is an excellent camera overall, packed with tons of features.  With so much going for it, I might say 5-star, if so much greatness outweighs a few drawbacks.  But having had the phenomenal Sony HDR-CX160 (m.blue)/(black) (2011 model at a lower price point & feature set) that I absolutely love everything about, there are a few drawbacks that matter to me.  The picture quality and image stabilization is superb at all light levels for me, including indoors in various lighting, and appears identical in picture quality to my CX160.  The audio quality is also equally superb.  Where the CX580 improves upon the CX160 is in other features, such as 32GB built in memory, 5.1 surround sound mic which shows you which direction sound is coming from in the LCD, built in light/flash, forward-facing recording indicator so others know when you are recording, comes with an HDMI cable to view on a TV without downloading, top-mount port for accessories like external lights, a few more configurable options (than the CX160) and both with lots of options.  This camera is highly configurable.  Btw, I really like smile detection that automatically takes photos.  They are fun to find later.AUTOMATIC SETTINGSIt does an excellent job with the automatic and default settings (same as my CX160) so that you don't have to tinker with it if you don't want to.  For example, if you are on vacation at Disney World, you want to just pull out the camera, snap a quick video, and not worry about adjusting anything.  This does a great job capturing moments.  I love a camcorder like this in place of a still camera.  It is so much more natural to take a short 30 second video, capture audio, and explain what is going on as it happens.  It used to take me longer to pause, wait for smiles, and take a static photo.  The key is to keep videos short to capture quick dynamic memories in place of still photos, but not take overall longer.  And beware, avoid recording everything like shows and attractions, because you will not really enjoy yourself live at the experience, and some would say your camera is going on vacation, not you.  This can take self control for some.  I pull it out before & after a show to capture our thoughts, and maybe once for a seconds in the middle to capture the essence for memory sake.  I took my CX160 to Las Vegas, it boy did it do a good job capturing the night time lighting indoors and out.  The CX580 is very similar in such quality.DRAWBACKSThe noticeable drawbacks to me are:1. The zoom is only 12X when my CX160 was 30X.  For video reviews and zooming in on attractions, I notice the difference right away, but you can easily live without it.  I've now done several reviews with the CX580 and have been happy, I just don't get quite as close up as I sometimes would.  You can turn on digital zoom, which goes up to 160X, but gets very grainy, but nobody says you have to zoom that much, so in-between it is okay.  The problem for me is that (like the CX160) zooming goes blurry out of focus at some point, and this CX580 goes blurry out of focus while zooming much earlier than my CX160, and takes longer than the CX160 to correct itself back into focus.2. The software for the CX580 is the new Play Memories Home (PMH), which has more functionality than the older Play Memories Browser (PMB) for my CX160.  The font size in PMH is noticeably smaller than in PMB, is not configurable, and doesn't follow the Windows setting to use large fonts.  With my eye sight, it gives me a headache when it is too small.  But this might be perfectly fine for you.  You can still trim, split, and combine videos.  But the new PMH software in an attempt to make it more intuitive also adds an extra step, so it takes more clicks.  In doing video reviews, I find it noticeable, but acceptable.  The PMB software can be upgraded to PMH, but I downgraded after.  You can still use this CX580 with PMB but only if you already have an older camera that activates PMB.  And from within PMB you can select to import, and pick the CX580 camera once attached, instead of it auto-launching.3. The CX580 is a little larger and taller than the CX160.  My CX160 was so small and fit so comfortably in my hand.  It felt so light and easy to control the zoom on top.  This CX580 isn't much larger, but it is a tad taller, and I can feel it.  It isn't quite as comfortable.  I was a little surprised that the higher end model (CX580) was larger.  Side by side it is noticeable, and noticeable to me only because I know what the CX160 felt like.  But apparently to get more functionality packed in, you have to let in a tiny bit more space.  However, after using the CX580 for a while, I really didn't notice and it is perfectly fine, especially if you don't remember a smaller one.  It still easily fits in one hand, just a bit tighter.OTHER TRICKSThe CX580 also sports a few other tricks.  One that I like is that you can more easily quickly delete videos.  It is subtle, but I like it.  Often enough I make a bad shot and just want to start over.  I wish you could click a button to delete the last video.  It can waste time to wade through later, by watching a partial one to see which ones finish or not, or have multiple takes.  With the CX580, the quickest way is click Menu, Edit, Delete, Movies and then start selecting, which is rather quick to do.  With the CX160, you have to enter play mode first by going into Event view, then can back out to Edit menu or else the delete action is disabled.  Both work in Event view mode directly to play and delete once playing, but that takes longer.  Btw, for me the CX580 cinema mode wasn't very useful.  I made things darker and less natural.  I prefer my vacation videos to look exactly as my eye saw them in real life, which is what these camera do a good job in under any lighting.EXAMPLESFor a low light example, see my Coast HP2 flashlight video review (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOZUUI0XZ2O8) taken with this camera (converted to SD).  For an indoor example, see my Harmony Touch video review (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5EF6N8ZEFLY) or Sony Multipod video review (http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LS2O9ODOP90) taken with this camera.SUMMARYSo for video & audio quality alone, Sony does have less expensive models that do as good of a job.  This CX580 packs more features than lesser models.  Feature sets and value to you is the main decision factor.  I don't think you can go very wrong with any decent Sony Handycam.  This just has more.RELATEDTravel Charger Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/RETABF9P6B42L/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permSony Multipod Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LS2O9ODOP90Case Logic MSEC-4 Case Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BOQMPQJ32S2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permCase Logic EHC-103 Case Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R16IEENF18E370/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permSony HDR-CX160 Text Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZXABW5J2HL7/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BB82TVSVBJ8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K54ZX2#wasThisHelpful","R3BB82TVSVBJ8C","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:59 MinsThis is a very good, truly universal remote.  It can truly replace your existing remotes (minus few RF-only devices like a Wii or some uncommon DVRs).  It has a wide blaster that can usually hit all of your devices in the general direction (with line of sight open or glass).  This uses the newer MyHarmony software which is excellent, very polished, and easier to use, which would be great even for someone who isn't as tech savvy.  I really like the polished look of the software, intuitive use, speed, and drag-drop to buttons on the remote picture.  You can configure everything for any device in the activity. You can add, remove, or reorder soft buttons for any available action from any device in an activity.  You can configure any of the physical buttons to any device too.  Plus it can learn buttons from your existing remote if you need to teach it one that it doesn't know.  The MyHarmony version doesn't seem to know as many buttons as the older software, such as my TV ratio buttons to directly toggle to 16:9 or standard or zoom.  The harmony database often knows more buttons than your actual device remote had available, but the old software had even more, at least for my devices.  You can also make modifications directly on the remote, which will save back later if you synchronize to the website again so they are not overwritten.  The touch screen also offers gestures that you can map to anything, although fairly limited to 5 - tap, swipe up/down/right/left, such as to swipe right to fast forward.Why you want a truly universal remote like this is that you can get rid of 4-5 remotes laying all over your couch or end table, and make it easy to just ""watch a DVD"" without having to use 3-4 different remotes to turn each on and set all the inputs correctly.  This (like any Harmony remote) just takes care of it.  You press one thing and it starts and sets input, and does anything else you want it to do, including sequences you specify.But here is the bottom line compared to other Harmony remotes.  This remote is centered on its touch screen, and other harmony remotes like the One and 900 center on physical buttons optimally placed with tactile feel.  If (A) you love touch screens, you don't normally memorize where all the buttons are, you don't prefer to press buttons by feel, you don't often issue remote commands other than to turn on / play / and occasionally pause, and you are happy to look down and scroll through a screen when you do need to do something, then this is an excellent 5-star remote for you.  But if (B) you normally hold the remote in your hand without looking, you play / pause / fast forward / and jump back frequently, you prefer the tactile feel of physical buttons, then this remote is an okay 3-star remote for you.  It is still a Harmony remote regardless which is well built & configurable.  But basically think how often you fast forward.  I skip commercials constantly, so an optimally placed fast forward button and 8-second jump back button is critical, so I prefer the One & 900.  The gestures (tap to play/pause and swipe to fast forward or rewind) are supposed to help place these actions more optimally, but they still don't make it as easy as a button in the center.  The play/pause and fast forward buttons on this remote are at the top and are ackward to use by feel alone, but are perfectly fine if you look down and use two hands.Compared to the Harmony One and Harmony 900, the differences are many.  Aside from the touch screen & buttons primary difference, there are more differences.  The software is notably better on the Touch than the older desktop software for the Harmony One or 900.  The battery is built-in and cannot be removed.  My 900 and One very infrequently lock up, and pulling the battery lets me reset it.  The Touch has never yet locked up on me, but if it does, I don't know what the solution will be.  The charger uses a micro USB cable, which you can use with the charger or directly on the remote.  The charger orientation stands the remote up, which takes up more space if you tuck the charging station on a low shelf.  But this way you can use the remote while in the cradle and it is easier to notice standing tall if you prefer.  I still tuck my One & 900 into a low shelf only when the battery runs low.  The soft button layout is just a single column that you scroll by swiping, instead of the 2 column and 3 row pages you page between on the One/900.  The soft button icons are automatic and are more subtle in the same color on the right side of the text within the text bubble, instead of the more noticeable soft button icons on the One/900.  Lastly, the button database seems of the newer software seems to know fewer commands, at least for my devices, than the older desktop software on the One/900.  But still, the biggest thing still comes down to physical buttons or touch screen, which is a preference.UPDATE 2014: Logitech released a significant update to the firmware that may make it more usable.  For example, you can now do 2 actions per button depending on a short or long press.  I believe it is now closer to the newer Harmony Ultimate with the on-device usability.  It is still the same remote ergonomically speaking.  In the absence of the discontinued One and 900, it looks better.  I now just keep my DVR remote out for more intensive browsing.H.One Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9NV6NMTOWVK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (discontinued)H.900 Video Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPJD72HKV7HC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (discontinued)H.Ultimate Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCRQA9JESHGQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permH.Simple Control Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDLD0ITMONOU/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5EF6N8ZEFLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EIUH6G#wasThisHelpful","R1J5EF6N8ZEFLY","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:57 MinsThis multipod is a great, compact way to carry all three (tripod, mono-pod, and mini-pod) all in one, and each very well built.  It is very versatile, easily configured and extended.  It feels well built, not cheap, but still lightweight, as it weighs 2lb 2oz on my kitchen scale.  The light metal, dense spongy grip, and rubber feet feel solid.  The extension points easily loosen, extend/collapse, and tighten (as long as you don't over-tighten).  The legs easily configure (surprisingly better than I expected) but take care not to step on them.  Mount point easily snaps securely into place and releases, and the hand nut to redirect it easily loosens & tightens.  I think it is a very nice, versatile tripod.  And in mini-pod form it is easily one of the best I had been looking at (as mini-pods tend to be cheaper and not have as many features).  The mini-pod is the exact same thing, just with the shaft removed.  The mono-pod is the same, just with a single foot and a bit lighter, but you might prefer to just keep the legs on while pushed together.Within each form, it is is very easily and quickly configurable.  The 3 standout features are: (1) The legs are so easy to configure.  There is a locking tab that easily clicks into 3 quick positions and the legs easily extend and retract. (2) The height adjusts very easily in 4 collapsing sections to quite a height (eye level for me, I'm 5'10""). (3) The mount on the top easily loosens and tightens to swivel in all directions *and* has a snap-in & release lever to attach/release your camera without having to spin your camera around a nut, just a little tiny platform that releases or snaps in.But to transition between the 3 forms, you will need to unscrew 2 things and reattach, such as remove the top & bottom (remove the middle shaft) to make a mini-pod, or remove the legs to make a mono-pod, etc.  It is very easy to unscrew and reattach (shown in video).  The case itself is very versatile and folds several different ways meant to store pieces when not used for each form.  But for a true professional who needs to instantly switch forms, it is too much to be unscrewing things.  But within each form, it is quickly configurable.  However you can almost instantly switch between tripod & mono-pod just by pushing together the legs or pulling back out as they easily configure.  But you must take care not to step on these legs, as they are lightweight hallow tubes, which might be a concern of someone running around crowds or stumbling around themselves in a rush.  I would think such a professional might choose an unbreakable piece of equipment, and perhaps the 3 pieces separately to suit the needs.The bag is surprisingly configurable, but is not perfect.  It transforms into several different shapes to store pieces and different modes, such as a mono-pod stuff into it supported by your shoulder instead of using the ground, such as to hold the camera high and steady.  The snaps and Velcro work well and quickly enough.  But it still take two hands to slide the tripod in due to the width and friction of the rubber feet.  But it is more about compact design and versatility.  The bag is not the highlight, but is a nice touch as opposed to a trivial bag or not having one.  The nylon strap detaches if you prefer to attach your own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LS2O9ODOP90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M8SH4E#wasThisHelpful","R10LS2O9ODOP90","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:31 MinsI absolutely love this ultra bright tiny flashlight.  It easily bests all of my other, larger flashlights, puts old incandescent lights to shame, and still beats out my previous favorite that was my compact 6-LED flashlight.  But it doesn't quite beat my large 18V light from my cordless Ryobi cordless drill set, but oddly comes close in useful light.  It is very well built, seems rock solid and precise, and feels good in your hand.  Being able to turn the head to tune from flood to narrow beam makes a big difference in applying the light most usefully.  In the full flood mode, it is easily the brightest, most useful, even light for looking around.  In the narrowest mode it makes a very bright spot, which you might use in a lit room to light up something you are working on.  The ability to tune to flood mode is what makes this little thing throw more useful light that much larger ones I have.  It is so small, that you can easily toss it in a purse, bag, or pocket, and it only weights 1.3oz with AAA battery.  I really like that it has a clip too.  There may be bigger, brighter ones out there, including from Coast too, but this one you can just have on you when you might not have through to grab a larger light from your toolbox, trunk, or closet.  It is so convenient, you can always have a backup ready to go, and save going back to get the big light for when you really need to.The 66 lumen are well used.  It is far less than the 780 lumen of an ordinary 57 Watt light bulb.  So don't expect it to light a whole room like daylight.  But in the dark, and compared to other flashlights, it was ultra bright, was superb well use of the light, and extraordinary considering its size.The only drawback is that the battery life is only 2.5 hours, so you get a lot of light, but the battery is used quickly.  I am happy to optimize for more compact light than battery life.  So grab some good rechargeable AAA batteries and have some spares if you are going to be out a while with it.  Get the newer style rechargables the hold their charge for a long time when unused so it will always be ready (like Sanyo eneloop or other pre-charged kinds).  I hear NiMH last much better with a higher draw than Alkaline batteries based on other reviews.I was so impressed that I went right away to buy another as a gift for a relative.  But because it was temporarily out of stock, I bought the Coast PX25 (208 Lumen) instead from the same brand, which is a highly rated 208 lumen variation that is thicker by the 3 AAA batteries it uses (and no focus control).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOZUUI0XZ2O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QV4E1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1EOZUUI0XZ2O8","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:40 MinsAs a ricer, this is well built, seems large enough, and works well.  Any firm items must be cooked first (such as potatoes or carrots), and then fairly easily presses through with two hands.  Obviously the smaller hole settings take more work than larger settings.  It easily rotates between the 3 size settings, and sticks there so it doesn't slip out of position.  The plunger that pushes food through makes a good seal (a good as I would expect), but not water tight, so a very small amount of potato ends up on the top rim over time, which you just brush off into the bowl.  It is large enough that you have plenty of leverage to squeeze the food through.  I can nearly do it one handed, but it is easy with two hands.  It starts out a little firm, then easily squeezes once it starts pushing through.  The hook to lay on the bowl edge works fine, except most of my pots are only just slightly deeper than this device, so you have to lift it up to squeeze so the food has somewhere to go as it piles up.  So I end up just setting it on top of the pile as I fill it, which works well.  Removing the outer plate when cleaning is easy enough, but takes a little wriggling back and forth.  The plates seem thick enough that I wouldn't worry about something like cooked potato.  Just remember you have to cook firm items first to make them sufficiently soft.  Cleaning takes some work just because it is a larger contraption, but would be no different than any other ricer.  As a ricer, I am happy with it.For mashed potatoes, it works well, but it is easier to make them with a good strong wire potato masher.  This makes creamy mashed potatoes of more consistent consistency, but depending on the hole size can still have enough chunkier tiny bits so that you know it isn't instant potato flakes.  You have to peel the skin from the potatoes to easily work with the grate.  But it does make quick work extruding the potato with ease, a few scoops at a time.  In my video, I actually made them with the middle size setting.  However, for mashed potatoes, I still prefer my good strong wire potato masher for several reasons. (1) The masher makes chunkier mashed potato of more irregularity (like many restaurants) depending simply on how much and how evenly you keep mashing. (2) The masher can doubly mash and mix flavorings (butter, milk, cheese or sour cream, salt, pepper) all at the same time as mashing instead of a separate mixing step. (3) The masher is much simpler to clean, just a small tool that is easy to clean compared to this whole contraption. (4) The masher can work with skin left on the potato (which I prefer).  But make sure you have a good sturdy wire masher (like my Kithenaid wire masher).  I have a plastic one that is terrible in comparison due to holes that clog, that bends, and takes more work.  So as a mashed potato maker only, I would rate this a 4/5, but I will use my wire masher due to combined steps, ease of cleaning, result consistency, and skins on.  But it is a preference, and many might prefer the ricer result.But a ricer has multiple applications, it isn't just for one kind of mashed potatoes.  I think it is a very good ricer overall.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYEP1I4FC16T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ME4WLK#wasThisHelpful","R1FYEP1I4FC16T","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:01 MinsThis is a very nice cable, seems very well constructed, but is also very thick and heavy, so it has a few drawbacks.  With HDMI + ethernet + 3D + audio return, this cable is significantly thicker (and heavier) than a simple HDMI + ethernet cable.  For long runs, and combined capabilities, it is a very nice cable that I would recommend.  However, if you need only a basic HDMI cable, or just +ethernet, or shorter runs, a slimmer, less capable AmazonBasics HDMI cable is noticeably slimmer and lighter.  So there are pros - quality, all the combined capabilities, long runs, etc.  And the cons are the thickness & weight which could affect some uses, or for many be of no issue at all.  I have always been thrilled with all AmazonBasics cables that I own, as well as Monster cables and other premium cables I have bought over time.  I now look to the value priced AmazonBasics for quality digital cables.Directly compared to the AmazonBasics HDMI+ethernet cable (2 pack with optical cable), this cable is significantly thicker and heaver.  Of course this one has + 3D + audio return that the other does not.  But it does affect the cable's thickness & weight.  The connector construction seems top notch on both.  (1) A concern I have is that the weight of the cable alone, if left unsupported and dangling for some height to the television port, it will be pulling down with its weight.  So you will probably want to support the cable around a hook, clamp, or otherwise tac it up to take the weight off from the ports that it connects to.  Usually this will not be a problem, but the orientation of your HDMI connector and wire run could be a concern.  (2) The thickness will not bend as tightly, so if you had to make a tight turn, such as where you want to connect it to the TV, or wrap it around a hook.  However, I don't mean to imply it is inflexible, I just mean compared to a slimmer AmazonBasics HDMI cable.  (3) The thickness will make it harder (or impossible) to tuck along a carpet edge or in a cable conduit.  (4) The color, black, will be more noticeable if it cannot be hidden from sight or fit into a cable conduit.  Still, I would not hesitate to use this cable, provided I had a plan to run it appropriately.So this is a great quality cable for a value price.  I have always found AmazonBasics to be significantly better than the other cheap cables out there.  It is on par or exceeding moderate premium cables out there.  It might not have everything that the top tier from Monster offers, but I think it comes close enough for most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDXHNTW4V8P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JR72SO#wasThisHelpful","RHDXHNTW4V8P7","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:59 MinsI love this router.  For home use of wireless access to your internet connection, it is excellent.  The signal was strong throughout my two-story house, and more importantly the internet throughput was nearly identical to the wired speed.  My upstairs bedroom (walls, ceilings in between) was especially problematic on my old router, which made my xbox internet connection spotty, slow to download, and extremely slow to start videos and frequently paused videos to buffer again.  With this router, I get a superb signal, and throughput to match, and my xbox works normally, and videos load quickly and with great quality to match my wired PC for internet streaming.  Upstairs, on DSL internet with 3 Mbps down / .75 Mbps up, my old router achieved 1.33 Mbps down / 0.66 up, and this achieved 2.90 Mbps down / 0.73 up, which was nearly the same as the wired speeds from my PC connected to the router.  For wired speeds it did not cause a slow down.  Before, directly with my DSL modem, my wired speeds were 2.89 down / 0.72 up, and now after it was 3.00-3.07 down / 0.66-0.72 up.  So the extra hop didn't seem noticeable, but overall there was always variance with the old or new router.  Oddly, the download speed tended to tick up a notch, and upload speed slightly down a notch, which is still just piggy backing on the old router that is the DSL modem.  Perhaps the QoS on this router prioritizes differently, or just real world variance.  It was just a different ratio overall on some tests.  So for a wireless internet connection, this router solved all of my problems.  I really couldn't be more thrilled.Internet access, downloads, and streaming is limited to your actual internet speed, such as 3 Mbps DSL, which uses only a small part of the states speeds of this router, making it effectively an N003 router.  Above your internet speed, the other 297 Mbps is only for within devices on your local network within your house, and limited by each specific device's card too, such as older wireless G, or N150 (single antenna), etc.  I think this N300 router does a fine job for the usual home user doing a casual amount of local network transfers, but I have not stressed it.  If you are really serious about tons of local network traffic and streaming between devices, you probably aren't looking at this N300 router, and instead looking at N600, N900, and the newest AC protocol routers.  So for the usual home router, I think this N300 is great for the average home user.  The back of the box clearly shows where this one sits among the current generation of technology this year.Setup was a breeze.  Connecting to it via the IP address given to you on a card was trivial, but just remember to connect directly to this router if using a wired connection to do it.  It walks you through optionally changing your router admin name, password, SSID, and security key.  You can also turn off the SSID broadcasting (which I recommend) for more security.  But the the changes to the SSID and disabling of SSID broadcasting did not take affect without rebooting the router (an option under the admin menu) which was not clear that I had to do that after saving.  For my xbox to work properly, I had to enable UPnP (QoS > UPnP menu, save, Admin menu > reboot).  They give you good quick start guides for Apple & Android portable devices & PCs (mac & windows), and a CD that you don't need to use (I never used it).  I had my network working in minutes.  Xbox took a few minutes to read up on the error about NAT issue, which xbox help pointed to enabling UPnP as I mentioned.  I had no problem at all using VPN for my work.  Both my mac and windows laptop easily connected to it too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B2F54SCVUVL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096239EC#wasThisHelpful","R2B2F54SCVUVL2","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:31 MinsSanDisk has never let me down with my HD Camcorder.  This card has never been the bottleneck to cause any quality loss or data loss.  For vacation video and pictures, I wanted the confidence that my recordings were not going to be lost, or reduced in quality due to card issues to be discovered when I return home.  You only have one chance to capture those memories.  SanDisk is a great brand.  Last year I bought two SanDisk Extreme SDHC 16GB 30 MB/s (the previous model), and this year I bought this SanDisk Extreme SDHC 32GB 45 MB/s (the next model).I recommend reading your camcorder or camera manual, and see what it states as the write speed at the quality setting you plan to use.  If it bothers to state it, I believe there is a reason.  If not stated, then don't worry, the minimum write speed by the minimum card spec should be fine.  For me, my manual (Sony HD Camcorder) clearly stated a write speed at about 23 MB/s for the mode I use, and up to 28 MB/s.  So I made sure I had a card that was internally capable of writing at the stated speed.  That way the card itself could not possibly be the bottleneck.  Now your manual should state the minimum card spec, like ""class 6"" or ""class 10"", or ""UHS-I"".  Class 10 refers to a 10 MB/s minimum sustained write speed, and makes indication that your camera or camcorder will actually take any advantage of using more than the minimum spec if it doesn't say otherwise.  Personally, I figure if the manual states write speeds separately, and only states a class 6 minimum, I am not taking any chances, as the math doesn't make sense.  A minimum spec class 6 could not possibly capture 28 MB/s of HD video over a long period of time without an equally sized internal buffer, or else it would have to degrade quality to keep up.  So I would see if you manual actually lists any numbers to see if it would matter in your case.This is a UHS-I rated card, and class 10, and backward compatible.  For UHS-I, I believe it is something that the hardware does have to specifically support to use the bus differently.  So you are likely to get somewhere less than that for devices supporting only beyond class 10 specifications.  I might guess that might mean somewhere near the 30 MB/s of the previous models claim before UHS-I.  For more on classifications, wikipedia is a good source.  Just do not expect to take full advantage of this card unless you have a UHS-I, or even beyond class 10, depending on device, which might not even be clearly documented.  In the end, I am happy with my choice with SanDisk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1BHFN3TX83H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q3C98S#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1BHFN3TX83H","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:57 MinsGlide is specifically for people with tight teeth, who shred floss, and have trouble getting it in and out.  Floss, like a tooth bush, is somewhat up to your liking and personal characteristics.  So Glide might not be for everyone, but I do believe it can be used by nearly anyone.  This packaging, the ""Pro Health For Life"" is stated for people 50 years or older for what it says ""because it is Glide's softest floss"".  So apparently compared to other Glide variations, this is softer.  But I personally really cannot tell any difference compared to Glide in the normal packaging that I have used for years, or compared to generic equivalents.  In fact, I thought it felt slightly less ""soft"" if I had to compare.  It is a tape style floss, very thin, but the tape width is wider than the normal packaging that I recall from before, or compared to the generic brand equivalent that I have been using.  The added tape width feels as though it might clean better (make up for not having brushing action of string floss), but feels to glide slightly less as there is more of it.This is a tape style, silky floss, that will feel and work differently than string floss (waxed or unwaxed).  I believe string floss can clean better because it can act as a brush and grab at grit slightly more.  But possibly thin tape floss might get deeper around your gums and teeth?  But if string floss doesn't work for you, tape floss is an excellent alternative, and loads better than not flossing.  You could always switch between them too if you can stand string floss.Overall, it really seems the same as any other Glide floss I've ever used, and I am equally happy with it.  The ""50+"" shouldn't matter.  I have used Glide floss for years now.  I am not a dentist and can only share my personal experience.  If you identify with tight teeth and do not like string floss, I would recommend Glide to anyone.  But perhaps if the tape is extremely bunched up, the very tightest teeth out there might feel it slightly more due to its width.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R71O8JM8OLO5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094G39KE#wasThisHelpful","R71O8JM8OLO5J","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:49 MinsWe love it.  It is an ideal size for small recipes for 1-2 people, with limited left overs depending on how much you eat, fill your plate or just 1/3 your plate with other sides like a veggie & potatoes or roll.  But it doesn't fit everything that you would want to make.  Realistically you will likely need both a 3.5 and 5 quart crock pots to select based on the size of the recipe.  We still use this 3.5qt most for 2 of us, but have on occasion found it filled too quickly and switched over to the 5qt.  Remember, any crock pot should only be filled to 2/3, not the top that is shown in all pictures on any box.  We had started with a lot of veggies and potatoes and found we were already at 2/3 on this 3.5qt before we could even add the meat, so we switched to the 5qt.  But then you do not want to always use a 5qt either, because you do not want too little in.  So we end up using this 3.5qt most for the 2 of us, but have to occasionally use 5qt.  The 3.5qt pot is easier to clean because it is smaller and weighs less than the 5qt.The construction and quality of this pot seem very good to us.  The lid is standard thickness for crock pots, and there doesn't seem to be any need for it to be heavier while it is cooking.  It does build up condensed water around the ring of the lid and bubbles out during cooking as it continually pushed out steam.  The 4 settings seem to give you plenty of flexibility, but we use low for most, and the automatic switch to warming mode is nice.  The recipe book was actually nice compared to a Crock Pot brand 5qt (that we also like) that claimed a recipe book, but really only added a few pages at the pack of its manual.  This one is a nice spiral bound book, but no pictures.We couldn't always just set it and forget it, or just follow the exact time on the recipe.  You really have to experiment to find the ideal cooking time for you.  We found our recipes are done earlier than the usual 8 hours stated in our recipes, and ended up getting overcooked.  So you make it once, realize it is dryer or veggies are overcooked, so you reduce the time next time.  So the meals weren't perfect the first time we did any recipe so far, but were better the second time around when we made cooking time adjustments.  For example, the first meal shown in the video was overdone, apples overcooked, and meat was a bit tough, which I think you can see in the video.  So next time, just cook it less.  For some meats, you really should test with a probe thermometer to ensure it is safely cooked, but hopefully only to confirm it is done, not to check frequently because you have to add cooking time every time you remove the lid.  For the second meal shown in the video (pulled pork), it too cooked longer than needed the first time, and was better the second time when we checked the temperature earlier and confirmed done earlier.  The best success we had with this was making pulled pork.  Btw, I skipped showing the steps testing the meat temperature, adding the BBQ sauce, and using a fork to shred the pork.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BR9H3T2Y24T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5CWVU#wasThisHelpful","R33BR9H3T2Y24T","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:27 MinsThis is a competent drive that works, improves boot and load times (like any SSD), focuses on value, and is clear what you get.  I own 3 SSD drives now, an excellent Intel 510 Series 120 GB SSD that I love but is expensive, a SanDisk Extreme SSD 120 GB that was also competent but offers zero help to migrate from HDD despite its feature focus on upgrade, and now this Kensington 128GB SSD.  I have the version that is just the drive itself, which is clearly explained, but Kengington offers versions with a migration kit or sold separately if you do need to migrate from an existing HDD.  When your existing computer is in ridiculously bad shape, you need to re-install the operation system from scratch to clean up both software glitches as well, which was my case for this drive.  But if you do want to migrate from an existing HDD, I had a lot of trouble on my own with freeware, but then found great success and ease with Apricorn SATA Wire Upgrade Kit ASW-USB-25 which I highly recommend (see my separate video review).This drive successfully restored life to my older laptop (with a fresh reinstall of Windows 7), my Lenovo Thinkpad T60p with Intel Core 2 Duo processor.  Afterwards it boots to logon in 20 seconds.  Applications nearly (but not completely) instantly pop right open, or at least much faster than before without all the think time it had when I opened anything before.  Remember any security suite slows down boot time, run time, and shut down time.  There are sites dedicated to comparing them.  With any of my SSDs, it has rendered worrying about that needless as they all boot without feeling like I am waiting for them.  With no moving parts, any SSD should be able to boot and load faster because of their superior random read performance versus an HDD's seek time between non-contiguous data strips.  But some data like large files, video, and archiving stuff still works well on an HDD as a secondary drive.They key here is to consider it at its price point, where it focuses on value.  There are always more expensive top of the line things out there, so it is unfair to compare it to an SSD that is 2-3 times the price.  But with this, you get most of the benefits, is still much faster booting and loading than any HDD, and just works.  If you don't want to shell out the big bucks for a top of the line alternative, I think this is a competent way to go.  I am perfectly happy with mine.  Based on Windows Experience Index, this disk is rated 7.1, versus 7.6 for my SanDisk SSD, and 7.8 for my Intel SSD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128CACRO2SJLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062IMAQ6#wasThisHelpful","R128CACRO2SJLP","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:08 MinsThis makes migrating disk drives painless & simple.  It is especially great migrating between unequally sized drives like migrating from a larger HDD to smaller SSD.  And it successfully handles a bootable partition with a working operating system like Windows 7.  If you bought an SSD that didn't come with a migration kit, I highly recommend this solution.Migrating is actually a complicated process.  Especially when moving from larger to smaller, you have to move data to the front, then shrink the partition, then copy to new drive, make alignment changes if it is SSD, then expand to fit the new drive, and hope the operating system still works (mine didn't).  I encourage you to search the web for ""migrate hard drive to SSD"" and you will find a number of articles and freeware offering guidance, all fairly complicated and different.  I liked the SSD Freaks and lifehacker articles best.  I tried a long time and ultimately failed to migrate a working Windows 7 partition.  You might not realize that migrating to SSD requires different alignment, which isn't fixed by a straight copy.  This Apricorn software just does it all for you, painlessly and simply.In retrospect, the only freeware alternative I think would really work, is a Windows 7 backup & restore, which should reload properly onto the new drive.  But if you are like me, it takes 2-4 weeks to get all the programs reinstalled and reconfigured to the same level of productivity on my work laptop with engineering software.  But with this, within hours you can simply be up on your new drive, but with everything else the same as before.  But if you have a USB 3.0 port, I recommend the Apricorn SATA Wire 3.0 Upgrade Kit ASW-USB3-25 which should copy faster.  Otherwise this one using USB 2.0, it is perfectly fine for something you rarely do, and still works with USB 3.0 ports.One thing to note is that the first time you log onto Windows 7 on the new drive, it detects and fixes something, and then reboots.  Re-run your windows experience score too, which supposedly will help it re-detect it is SSD, enable optimization, and disable defrag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RES5AVAD4FXHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EUCU3O#wasThisHelpful","RES5AVAD4FXHA","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:08 MinsI was excited to try this, but the results were unacceptable, and the proof is in the video.  I believe success depends a lot on your microwave wattage and internal dynamics.  I have a very good top rated high wattage microwave (1200W cooking power) which yielded terrible results.  The instructions are clearly for a 1200W microwave like mine.  But based on experimenting I've done, I theorize that a lower wattage microwave and maybe without a turn table might turn out more even due to slower cooking.It always resulted in a ring of overcooked rubbery scrambled eggs with a paper thin or just a hole in the middle where your fillings would go.  Closing the clam shell just makes a double stack of these rubbery things with the paper thin center or holes in the middle.  It was rather unappealing and looked nothing like the pictures.  Waiting for the middle to become set took too long while the outer ""ring"" bubbled up and overcooked.  It didn't smell very good either, and tasted not so good.  It was ""edible"", but my wife refused to taste it from the look & smell.  You don't get browning in the microwave (which oddly is shown in one of the pictures in the manual), and without a little butter or oil in the pan, you miss some of the flavor you normally get on the outside of the omelet.It really isn't much easier than just making in a pan.  You still have to prepare beat & season the eggs and fillings.  You are really only saving washing a pan & spatula from the pan cooking phase and instead throwing this in the dishwasher.  You still have to wash any pans, boards, and bowls used for the filling and egg prep.  I sometimes struggle with using a pan because it cooks fast so you have move quickly because it cooks fast, and folding sometimes doesn't go well.  I had hoped this would make it perfectly & easily.  But it was far from it, just overcooked it in different ways that was unacceptable.  This isn't just a defective item, as it is just plastic.I'm really sorry, I tried very hard to make this work.  I spent a long time on this.  The video is made up of 63 clips to piece together the story, trimmed from 3 times that many recordings.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DW2WPSTRS9I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZW65MO#wasThisHelpful","R3DW2WPSTRS9I1","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:41 MinsThis is a small notebook mouse to be used to throw in your pocket when you go to meetings.  This is what a ""notebook mouse"" is expected to be, small, lightweight, portable, and be able to work on most or all surfaces, and have a good range in case you are presenting via a projector and not adjacent to your actual laptop.  It would be cramped (like any notebook mouse) to use every day as your actual mouse.  It is lightened by using a single AAA battery.  It has about the tiniest possible receiver, which is common among most mice now.  It can be stored under the mouse (like many mice), but more likely you just leave the tiny thing in your laptop port since it can be left in while toting even in most bags.  This is what a ""notebook mouse"" is, and it works well for what it is.  For anyone looking to use for hours on end, you probably should tote a full size mouse with a tiny receiver and optional single AA battery supported by many full size mice.The texture and feel of the mouse was quite good in my opinion, with the rubber sizes, detect click feel, and scroll wheel isn't free spinning but the soft clicking context feel to how far you scroll (that I prefer).  Mine came with a defect, a tiny bump where my right thumb rests on the side rubber which doesn't feel quite right.  But for infrequent use to run to meetings, I really don't mind.  But to use daily, I'd say it is just a defect and should be replaced by Amazon or by warranty as defective.The one uncertainty is how well iHome holds up for battery life and functional life compared to Logitech and Microsoft mice that set a very high bar for conserving batter life and lasting forever for me.  This uses a AAA battery, so to be fair, the battery will last only as long as a AAA could carry it, which will be no match for two AA batteries of a full size.  You have to trade off a little for convenience of a small mouse purely in battery size.  What you hope is that they optimize every ounce of the AAA it does have.  Time will tell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OPCV4YHBQ8TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NTZFLO#wasThisHelpful","R1OPCV4YHBQ8TK","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:30 MinsWe are extremely happy with ours.  You do not even know the pillow cover is there.  When I bought new pillows, I wanted to protect my pillow more, and protect me more from my pillow over time.  My nose doesn't seem a stuffy in the morning with the new combination.  The biggest benefit of these is that it makes no additional sound, especially no crinkly sound.  If you have looked at pillow covers, especially those designated for allergy control, all of the others I've looked at make a loud crinkly noise when you press on them (or someone moves or lays down while sleeping).  This one make no crinkly noise at all.  Beware some pillows have the crinkly noise in the pillow fabric itself, so make sure you buy a pillow that doesn't already make a sound.  But the point is, adding this does not seem any different than if you didn't use a pillow cover at all.That does not mean it is noise less on its own, but paired with a normal pillow case on top, then you wouldn't know the difference.  The fabric itself makes a noise if you slide your hand on it, compared to a cotton pillow case, but it makes less rubbing noise than the pillow itself, and is completely eliminated by a pillow case that you have to put on anyway and is the only surface you will actually rub against in use.  In, use, compression goes through all layers, so any layer that crinkles would be noticeable.I ordered two, one of mine came unmarked for size, but was actually the right size.  I am very happy with my purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IH14DUGGXN9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002R0DR42#wasThisHelpful","R2IH14DUGGXN9H","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 4:13 MinsThese are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJYNESSFZ4KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JFMH8M#wasThisHelpful","R1JJYNESSFZ4KV","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:39 MinsThe bottom line is that it works, but is far from great.  When you just need a means to get access to data on a 2.5"" drive as cheap as possible, this can be an excellent value.  It is an adequate device to meet temporary needs.  The core components are just a bare aluminum case and SATA to USB connector.  There is no padding within the bay and your drive does not feel secure for toting around, but is perfectly adequate for making connections once in a while to get at data.  Surrounding the core component are very nice things, a USB Y-cable provided to draw extra power (although but you can use just one which I did only one), a plastic sheet to cover an exposed circuit board, screw driver, the tiniest screws you've seen aside from eye glasses, a pouch, instructions, and a little box to store it all in.  It is rather impressive that all this comes at at this value.My biggest problem with it was that the connector was bent a little, meaning my drive couldn't fit in perfectly, and I refused to stress the port on my drive, so I slid it in just enough to get one of the screws in and left the other askew a little.  It was perfectly adequate to get at my data during a computer outage that was down for repair.  But I handled it more gingerly and would not plan to use it to tote to work, throw in a drawer or backpack, etc.  The bottom line is the SATA & USB ports worked.  The second drawback is the drive is just by itself without padding of any kind in the aluminum tin.  It makes me a little uncomfortable, so I would handle it gingerly.  If you are going to tote it around a lot, or use it to build your own external drive, I would get a more durable one.  But for basic connections, it is fine.It worked perfectly fine with my Intel 510 SSD 120 GB SATA 3 (6 Gbps), but obviously ran more slowly like you would expect from USB 2.0.  Overall I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because it is so cheap, that for the price, you really can't be unhappy.  But it is definitely just ""okay"" otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R4IM3JZ7Y3ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JQNXZC#wasThisHelpful","R3R4IM3JZ7Y3ND","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:27 MinsOverall I am very happy with this drive.  Just plug it in and it just works.  And it is 2-3X as fast as my USB 2.0 external drive (WD Password 500GB).  It runs warm, but not hot, and is quiet.  It isn't as fast as an internal SATA 3 (6 Gbps) drive, but for expanding storage, archiving stuff, or for backups it will work great.  I was growing tired of backups running long and having to check back to turn off my computer and am happy to cut that time in 1/2 or more from before.  It doesn't come with any software, but you really shouldn't need any anymore, as current operating systems have it built in.  This is more like Western Digital's Elements line of external HDs that are just a nice working drive that is quiet and fast.  It is a brick, but small enough to tote when you need to, but not so small as a WD Passport or other pocket drive.  It seems plenty durable.I will use the drive for backups and storing my video content, so in a realistic test of a 608MB file (from one of my reviews), I tested copying from my existing Seagate SATA3 2TB HDD to (1) USB 2.0 WD My Passport 500GB = 29s, (2) USB 3.0 Seagate 2TB (this one) = 8s (but varied), and (3) SATA 3 Intel 510 series SSD = 0s (instant).  Compared to USB 2.0 speeds, USB 3.0 was great.  Nobody expects it to beat internal SATA 3.  USB 3.0 bus speed should be fairly common among any drive supporting it, provided the drive holds up its end.  As far as this Seagate goes, it seems to hold up.  I got 8s at first, but it did vary.  As seen in the video, it actually took longer in that shot, so expect it to vary some.  In this kind of ad-hoc testing, other factors are involved, like drive power saving state, OS and other computer states, etc.I did have one problem, the drive arrived with a defect, but I was able to fix it.  It arrived with the USB 3.0 & ports not lined up with the holes on the back, making it impossible to plug the cables into the drive.  The drive inside was clearly not sitting right.  They were offset from the holes by more than 1/3, with the USB port virtually inaccessible.  Fortunately, I could use the more robust AC plug to pry it down as if it were on a spring, which pulled the USB port down, and then plugged in the USB cable and pulled down more, which then seemed to click and nearly stay in place.  Assuming defective drives can be replaced immediately by Amazon, my only concern was how this passed inspection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150KBCM9T5UCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SJS0#wasThisHelpful","R150KBCM9T5UCV","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:45 MinsThe packaging is where this stands out, which is its major selling point.  It is a nice box holding 3 standard sized 500 reams.  You can just tuck it in a closet without worrying about the paper getting banged up.  The reams themselves are standard paper envelopes which are significantly better than plastic wrapped reams often found in consumer stores because they look better.  These don't tear to pieces like the plastic wraps once you open a ream.  You can actually reuse the box for reams you buy separately later.  Note that the top rests on the top ream, not the box edge, so that if you open the top ream and put it back and stack things on top, it will push down on that half open package until small enough to reach the box edge.The paper itself is just paper and conforms to the stated specs.  The brightness (92) is on par with other 92s, often labelled as bright white.  But side-by-side with my HP 92 it almost looked negligibly less white than the HP, perhaps due to surfaces reflecting differently in my lighting.  The weight (24lb) is more than your usual 20lb copy paper, but otherwise conforms to the state 24 lb that should be on par with any other paper stated at 24lb.  If you've never had 24lb before, it is only slightly thicker, nothing very stiff like cardboard or index cards.  Compared to 20lb, 24lb paper gives things a slightly better feel, better for two-sided (duplex) printing because the other side doesn't show through as much, inkjets will probably work better with in saturation, and the thicker, stiffer paper is probably slightly less likely to crinkle causing jam.  Honestly I haven't had a jam with 20lb paper in ages.  Jams are often due to rollers & grabber material in your printer needing replacement sooner than you realize they need servicing.It ships well, in a box with a few air pillows, but in general paper is pretty secure.  But rather than being a ream with only paper edges banging around a shipping box, this 3-ream box protects them well within the outer box while it ships.  The box itself would be safe enough to ship alone, but wouldn't look as nice or clean in your closet if banged up and full of stickers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XE1HRAIONIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W6JOQO#wasThisHelpful","R31XE1HRAIONIV","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:08 MinsIt really depends on many factors, so experiences will vary.  I think you will likely find varying degrees of success, not complete eradication.  If you have multiple pests, then you will probably deter some of them, in which you find 2-4 star reviews.  Or if you have one pest, whether or not it works on that one determines 1 or 5 star reviews.  I am happy with the products attempt to deter and isn't a gimmick, but the value will depend on your level of success.  Based on many reviews, clearly success varies.  At least this 5-lb shaker seems to last longer than the smaller cans at the local store.So it is really just a big can of pepper, mostly black pepper and cayenne pepper which are two of the 3 active ingredients.  Peppers smell and taste unpleasant to animals.  Whether this blend and processing are the perfect solution and cost effectiveness versus wholesale black and cayenne pepper depends.  It isn't a fence or barrier, just a deterrent to make it more unpleasant than the next alternative location for the animal which will hopefully move on and do its business elsewhere.  But you will be fighting against (1) habits that might take time to break, (2) areas previously marked by animals or other droppings that are more attractive that offset or overpower this, (3) if yours is still the least unpleasant alternative to limited or worse options, (4) the animal's sensitivity to taste and smell of this deterrent, and (5) how fast it gets washed away and perform at reduced levels.  You could have an old dog that has lost much of its sense of smell and has been using your lawn for ages and has marked the area that probably would be less deterred to change.  Or a cat's habit and previous droppings might overpower this product.This is similar to you going to the beach.  Suppose rocks litter one side of the beach along with a dead fish that washed up on shore and smells a little.  It doesn't stop you from walking through there, it is just unpleasant to setup your towel or walk around over there.  But you might walk through it to find better sands elsewhere.  But you would prefer to walk to the side of the beach that is sandy with a fresh air breeze.  Your yard is the beach to the pests.

" 9:38 MinsThe official genuine Lenovo part (P/N 0A65623), does exactly what it is designed to do, add a second SATA drive bay a Thinkpad with a 12.7mm slot, such as for a W520.  It seems as well constructed as I would expect.  You just lift the lever, flip the flap back, slide your drive in (with rubber rails), flip the flab down, lower the lever, remove existing optical drive, and pop this in its place.  It fits fairly tight, more than the optical drive due to rubber padding on the bottom.  I show the whole process in the video.  The BIOS will see it as an HD bay, and is likely by default after your existing drive in boot sequence order.  You can change the order and boot directly to this bay too.  More details are in the video.However, it does require the rubber drive rails, the same as any Thinkpad internal drive bay would, as it is just another bay to mimic the internal bay.  Rubber rails space it just right, and appear to offer both a vibration buffer and are a non-slip pressure point that the lever locks down to help hold it in place.  You can probably use it without rubber rails, but it really expects them.  Just remember it is no different than if you bought any hard drive to use in the existing built in drive bay which requires them.  However, it does not come with any rubber rails.  This is rather annoying because almost anyone buying a drive bay is buying a drive, and if bought anywhere other than from Lenovo they are not going to come with them.  I really think they should have thrown in the rails in the package.  You supposedly can order them from Lenovo as parts, but I had difficulty figuring out which part I really needed.  Your best bet is to hopefully have an old Thinkpad laying around with an old drive that you could take the rails from.  I contacted my IT department at work, and they had some extra drive rails from old Thinkpads or bad drives.  They haven't changed in years for standard sized drives.  I used some old ones on my new SSD.I almost want to rate this 4-star because of the missing rails.  However, it really just emulates an internal drive bay, which doesn't come with them either, but probably on a drive that was pre-installed, so I relent.  Had there just been a second internal bay, it wouldn't have had the rails either.  It certainly isn't friendly to not include the cheap rubber.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SH9WNUU2USG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QWGSCY#wasThisHelpful","R13SH9WNUU2USG","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:40 MinsIt delivered as promised.  It was easy to affix to the wall and held very well.  I was surprised by how strongly it really held.  It takes 1 hour to set before you can use it, so be aware in case you were thinking of just sticking and using immediately.  Removal was easy (as shown in the end of the video), but took slightly more effort than I expected.  Get a good grip before you start pulling because it will take some small effort.  Also hold the clip itself from snapping like a rubber band once it releases, but do not hold it firm against the wall.  This might not be advised if you have arthritis.  It didn't leave any residue or damage behind on my wall.You must pull straight in the direction of the tab, not towards you or it risks breaking.  So take care when you place it to make sure you orient the tab in the right direction and position with enough room to pull 6 inches straight.  This might mean you cannot position it exactly in the middle between the socket and baseboard, or in a corner, so measure.  Figure out the orientation first before affixing the strip so that you put the tab on the correct side, and watch for accidentally flipping the direction comparing the clip face down vs affixing the strip when flipped over.  It is only large enough for one or two normal cables, not a bunch per clip, and is quite firm which makes it a little more difficult to fit the largest cable in.  The adhesive effectiveness might vary by material (based on some other reviews) but held very well for me.  Once you remove, you only have 1 extra strip to reuse one clip one time.This is so much better than taping cables up under a desk which leaves residue and falls down eventually.  This would be great for college dorms where you cannot leave tape on the wall.  But only time will tell if it will remove damage free after years in place.  I am still worried if it will really not fall victim to deterioration that other tapes get after years and heat through the seasons that affects other kinds of tape.  But in shorter periods, so far it has held up to its claims.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24AGC12MG2FQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RKFCFO#wasThisHelpful","R24AGC12MG2FQG","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The drive alone is great.  For fresh new installs or as a secondary drive it works great.  It is easy to install, format, and it just works.  The speed improved boot time from 56s on HDD to 22s on this SSD, and after logon to being usable from 91s to 9s.  The drive has been reliable for me so far, visibly fast, and is being used daily on my work laptop with some heavy usage.  Applications open noticeably faster than my peers, but large applications are not exactly instant, but much improved.  I have used the drive heavily on an engineering laptop for a few months now and am very happy.  As a new fresh install, I give it very good marks, I'd say a 4/5.  I own 3 SSDs now, an Intel 510 Series 120GB SSD, a Kingston V200 128GB SSD, and this SanDisk Extreme 120GB SSD.  Performance-wise, this drive falls in the middle, but closer to the Intel than the Kensington.  Based on Windows Experience Index, the Intel rated 7.8, this SanDisk 7.6, and the Kensingon 7.1.INSTALLATIONAs a secondary drive, they give you no instructions, but you just pop it into any open SATA drive bay (or cable in PC), then in Windows 7 go to Control Panel > System & Security > Administrative Tools > Create and format hard disk partitions.  It should immediately recognize the new drive and offer to do something, say yes, select the drive, format, use defaults, and you can choose a different volume name like ""SSD"" if you want to.  You can always come back there to change the drive letter.  You can easily change the name later from Windows Explorer by accessing properties.PRIMARY DISK MIGRATIONBut for anyone looking to upgrading from an existing hard drive, and if it isn't convenient for you to reinstall everything, then you will not find any help built in here.  But it can work great, with some help.  My work laptop would take weeks to fully reload and reconfigure, which I cannot afford, so migration is by far a necessary way to go, and ideally should be fast and trivial (and believe me it can be).  But the upgrade experience packaged in this box is significantly lacking.  They leave you to your own devices to figure out how to migrate over from your existing HDD.  But you can buy an easy solution to help you easily migrate, as I did in two hours.  I find this lacking because the first bullet point on the front of the box is ""Upgrade your PC..."", but they really leave you hanging, as they give you no software, guidance, or cables.  Meanwhile competing brands do, such as Intel (Intel 510 Series 120 GB) provides free download software to migrate easily, and Crucial has a Youtube video showing migration using Apricorn EZ Upgrade (USB cable and software).  The instructions that come with this are useless, which just tell you to refer to your manufacturer manual.  SanDisk's own site doesn't offer any additional guidance, where they could have filled the gap.  So what to do?  I highly recommend buying Apricorn Hard Drive Upgrade Kit ASW-USB-25 (USB 2.0 cable & software), Apricorn ASW-USB3-25 (USB 3.0 cable & software), or Apricorn Hard Drive Upgrade Kit EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL (2.5"" bay & software).  I bought the Apricorn ASW-USB-25 and successfully migrated in about 2 hours.  But before this, it was a mess.  I encourage you to search the web for ""migrate hard drive to SSD"" and you will find a number of articles and freeware offering guidance, all fairly complicated and different.  I liked the SSD Freaks and lifehacker articles best.  I tried and ultimately failed to migrate a working Windows 7 partition following these.  So if you just buy this with the Apricorn upgrade kit (if you need to upgrade), then the experience is pretty good, mostly attributed to the Apricorn solution.  For claims for upgrade and in retail packaging, it really is incomplete.  Compared to Intel's retail box, I think they should have labelled this OEM as this is nothing but the drive.HARDWARESo the drive itself is nice, no dud.  It has a 4-star drive, and a 1 or 2-star upgrade migration experience (considering its claims, competitors, and retail packaging) which only matters if you are going to migrate.  So I am averaging to 3-star.  I believe competitors have better upgrade experiences, but SanDisk prices seem significantly lower, and you can buy an upgrade kit and still save a lot.  Buy it for the price, buy a better upgrade solution if you need one and save yourself wasting time like I did or look elsewhere.  Btw, I also own an Intel 510 Series 120 GB that is great.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9B0X77JAITO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006EKJCWM#wasThisHelpful","RC9B0X77JAITO","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:59 MinsIt is a great looking shaver, shaves very well for me (better than my Philips Norelco XL), trimmer works excellent for me, is easier to clean monthly, and has great charge level status lights.  But it is a little noisier, daily cleaning takes a little more work, and the bag is just okay.  Overall, I am very happy with it and am going to immediately stop using my Norelco XL and use this from now on.It is noticeably louder than I had expected (as seen in the video), but isn't too loud compared to some really cheap ones I've had in the past.  I really wish it were a bit more quiet, but is ignorable enough to only be a small negative in my mind.  But in shaving performance, it works really well for me.  In both shaving and trimming.  It is noticeably better for both than my Philips Norelco XL.  It also is a very comfortable feel in my hand.  I really like the battery status lights shows the level clearly.  They are nicely hidden under the shiny surface.  The daily cleaning is a little more work to pop off the head, shake and brush out, compared to flip open, dump, and rinse from my rotary.  But the monthly cleaning is much easier, still some work, but nowhere near the complicated work described for my rotary.  Of course a more expensive shaver with a cleaning system would be nice.  But this seems doable.Whether a rotary or foil shaver works best for you will vary.  I have found no rotary shaver can really pick up my hair without using a lot of force.  Foil shavers are just a different design and work better for me.  Now this foil shaver has a good foil design with various shaped holes that for me really do catch hair pretty well, better than my rotary XL.  It still doesn't mean only one pass, but it generally takes less pressure and work than my rotary.  It is better around my neck, chin line, and lip than my rotary, but still takes some time on my neck.  One thing to remember is that you still need to use circular motion with this foil shaver.  If you are shaving only in straight motions, it will not grab some stubborn hair.Replacement Parts: Remington SPF-73 Screen and Blades","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UYIS8OC3EKUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XWAJIY#wasThisHelpful","R2UYIS8OC3EKUZ","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:57 MinsI have mixed feeling about 2 flaws, but overall there is a lot to like.  It has some unique aspects specifically for CFLs, the slider feels great, can adjust dimming, it has an easily interchangeable plate, button, and slider for white, ivory, and almond, & great instructions.  Only the button and minimum dim level give me some pause.  You can dim 600W incandescent or 150W CFL or LED, but less if you need 2 (500W) or 3 (400W) of these next to each other in the same box (which is standard for dimmers).  But you have to remember to toggle a switch beneath the plate between CFL or LED/INC depending on which you have.  It is easy enough to get to, but is something that wasn't clear by the instructions that you should just pop off the plate to access.PROS - Has a CFL mode (via toggle switch) that helps CFLs turn on better. - Slider feels great - Interchangeable plate, slider, and button in white, ivory, & almond. - Great instructions, good for a non-electrician, better than most I have seen.CONS - The button doesn't feel as solid as I would have preferred (probably due to interchangeable button cover) but seems fine. - The minimum dim level adjustment is a little complicated but you can figure it out.  I had to re-read the section several times, but it makes sense once you follow it.  I would have preferred a simple adjustment wheel.VERY MINOR - CFL versus LED/Incandescent toggle switch is under the cover and wasn't clear that you should just remove the cover to get to it. - Instructions font size is a little small (still better than some) but I did strain my eyes reading both sides end to end.  I would have preferred larger fonts or a link to larger instructions to print myself if they didn't want to print the paper.FYINote that some dimming ability still depends on your CFL bulbs.  If they aren't all the same brand or actually more limited in actual dimming ability than they advertize, it can affect how much range you really get, or whether all the bulbs turn on at the same level.  So you have to pick the lowest common denominator when all turn on adequately.  The CFL ability of this should help a little.  If you change bulbs or brands, you might have to revisit the minimum level setting again to fit the new bulbs best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B1XDCFLKYDPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P1T7JC#wasThisHelpful","R3B1XDCFLKYDPD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:44 MinsThese are great to solve a problem that everyone has, fitting large AC adapters into power strips, and hugging a wall outlet.  I think these are nicer than the alternatives I've seen at the local stores.  They are a nice length that isn't too short to give you some room to work with, but not too long to become its own problem.  The combo bag is nice to get a sampling of the 3 styles from this brand.  But for real power strip organization, you might eventually want 5 of the same style.The 3 styles are suit unique purposes, two of which work well, and one seems to not function as well as I expected: (1.) Just an extension that has a small plug to put a buffer between your strip and the large plug.  The length is perfect to stand straight up in a U shape to connect to your AC adapter laying face up (like in the pictures).  It works best to simply liberate power strips, but only if you have the room to lay out AC adapters. I was surprised that I preferred this one over the rounded connector. (2.) A rounded plug that is both an extension and lets you stack more on top of it.  The wire extends to the side and at an angle so it can act more compact than #1 because it does not stand up.  However I had 2 problems with this one.  (A) It couldn't fit next to another in a compact power strip because the angled wire to the side was in the way (shown in the video).  (B) I couldn't actually use the stacking ability to plug anything into the top of the rounded plug (shown in the video).  It seems to be hitting something and I couldn't stack them. (3.) A wall outlet huger that lays flat against the outlet.  This is really great if you want to push something right up against the wall or don't want to see plug with a wire as prominently sticking out.  These aren't really a power strip liberator, and are more for a flat connection.  But you can use them too in a power strip, but they have a slightly larger head for a compact power strip.  I really like these, but for the right purpose, like behind a dresser, or TV entertainment center without room by the wall.The cables are 16 gauge (16 AWG) and rated for 13A, 1625W.  For 16 gauge is standard for extension cables.  Only more expensive cables for yard equipment and air conditioners offer 14 gauge.  Most power strips are 14 gauge for their own wire.  I wish these were 14 gauge, but realistically 16 gauges is normally the highest of most equipment you will be using these with.  I would not recommend pushing 1500W through a 16 gauge cable personally.  You home wiring is usually 14 gauge for a 15A circuit, or sometimes 12 gauge for higher amp circuits.  So 16 gauge for one device is standard.  But do watch out for space heaters, air conditioners, some coffee makers, or other things that draw high current that really should have a more expensive 14 gauge or 12 gauge extension.  But for liberating most things you plug into a power strip, 16 gauge should be fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ERU7RRZ9JXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076HPMK8#wasThisHelpful","R8ERU7RRZ9JXD","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:51 MinsIt looks so much nicer than all the black covers out there.  Its functionality is great, does not have the imperfections or design issues of some cheaper alternatives, looks great, and makes reading the kindle easier in some ways.  It really does look nice.  It doesn't smell in the least bit (unlike reports for some other covers).  The charging and headphone ports are still accessible when closed.  There are virtually no flaws with it, except one that is a pro and a con.  My wife loves this cover.It has nice muted maroon color, nice brown leather binding, textured cover, stitching, and gold paint trim on the front and binding that is antiqued a bit with imperfections that are a nice touch.  The inside has a material that seems nice too that isn't just plastic.  Its weight is well balanced.  It isn't feather light, but isn't too heavy either.  The cover folds back easily, which offers 2 additional advantages.  If your hand cramps up holding the kindle alone because of how thin it is, with the cover folded back it adds some thickness that really helps make it more comfortable.  Also, it gives you a little bit of a shelf to slip your finger under or rest on something that makes it more comfortable to hold.It has a pocket that runs the whole length, unlike some corner pockets of some other covers that have a design flaw.  Other corner pockets can curl slightly at the corner in the middle of the cover, even if not putting anything into it, and come into contact with the screen, causing it to do things, like order books without your knowledge.  This one does *not* have that design flaw.  But if you cram stuff in there, you could still cause a problem, so I advise against using the pocket.The only possible drawback, however slight, is that the cover isn't held closed, which is a pro and a con.  In normal use, it isn't a problem at all.  But it could open on its own if loose in a bag, enough to let something slip between.  I still much prefer this over the alternatives.  I really don't want a snap curling around and being in the way, or making me press to snap closed which transfers force to the screen behind the snap.  You can just slip a rubber band or ribbon around for the times when it could be a concern.  I really prefer it this way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJM3FKNJG39W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009K6WK8#wasThisHelpful","R1YJM3FKNJG39W","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:41 MinsThis drive is whisper quiet, blazing fast, and has worked flawlessly.  Being SATA III (6G/s) I never feel like disk access is a bottleneck anymore.  Being SSD, it boots and loads applications and files with blazing speed.  The Windows 7 64-bit OEM install disc had no problem detecting and formatting the drive and installing Windows 7 to it in such a short time it didn't seem possible.  Windows 7 initially booted in about 3 seconds, before it could finish drawing the logo.  But once you install internet security software, boot time slowed to 13 seconds.  But I no longer put my computer to sleep, I just shut it off because it boots so fast.  I really love how IE, FireFox, MS Word, and Excel just immediately open without a lag.  Some programs still take a few seconds like TurboTax, but much less time than my old computer.  I have to say, this really delivered.PERFORMANCEI own 3 SSDs now, this Intel drive, a SanDisk Extreme 120GB SSD, and a Kingston V200 128GB SSD.  Of the 3, this is the clear stand out winner, but the SanDisk comes close and is much cheaper.  Based on Windows Experience Index, this Intel drive rates 7.8, the SanDisk 7.6, and Kensington 7.1.  I still think the Intel is the golden standard and worth the extra cost for your primary computer, and is more of a complete package.PRIMARY DRIVEMake this your primary drive with the operating system, application installations, and document files.  120GB should be be plenty for that.  But for photos, videos, and music, I recommend getting a secondary HDD, like the Seagate ST2000DM001 Barracuda 7200RPM 2TB SATA 6G/s, which has been blazing fast for me to store and edit all my video from my HD camcorder.  Use a large HDD for large files that are very optimal for large files stored as contiguous blocks that can be read easily in sequence.RETAIL BOXThe retail box for this drive comes with a SATA cable, molex power adapter for if you don't have a SATA power available from your power supply, and a mounting kit for a 3.5"" bay if you don't have a 2.5"" bay found on some newer cases like the Cooler Master Storm Enforcer Case.  Any SATA cable will do for SATA 6G (they really don't differ) but you should just use the one it comes with.  Do plug it into SATA III (6G/s) port, which is the point of the 510 series over the 320 Series.  It fit great with my Intel DZ68BC motherboard SATA 6G ports.SOFTWAREIt came with software, but instead go to the Intel support site and download the latest version of the tool box.  The software can detect for firmware upgrades, but only for firmware released as of the release date of that software.  It doesn't actually check the web for future versions of the firmware after the software version release, or detect software updates.  It is very easy to find and install.  Then you will need to run the optimizer once a week, either manually at the click of a button, or you can setup a schedule to run automatically.  Supposedly it improves the performance and should be run weekly.  Windows 7 already knows not to defrag the drive.  But if you use other freeware defrag tools, you should double check and make sure it doesn't try to defrag the drive because it will shorten the life span.SUMMARYI am sold on SSD after this drive, and it looks like Intel is the king of the best SSD out there with the 510 series at the moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BF2SIDCO1RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZCBN9E#wasThisHelpful","R39BF2SIDCO1RT","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:08 MinsIt really depends on many factors, so experiences will vary.  I think you will likely find varying degrees of success, not complete eradication.  If you have multiple pests, then you will probably deter some of them, in which you find 2-4 star reviews.  Or if you have one pest, whether or not it works on that one determines 1 or 5 star reviews.  I am happy with the products attempt to deter and isn't a gimmick, but the value will depend on your level of success.  Based on many reviews, clearly success varies.  At least this 5-lb shaker seems to last longer than the smaller cans at the local store.So it is really just a big can of pepper, mostly black pepper and cayenne pepper which are two of the 3 active ingredients.  Peppers smell and taste unpleasant to animals.  Whether this blend and processing are the perfect solution and cost effectiveness versus wholesale black and cayenne pepper depends.  It isn't a fence or barrier, just a deterrent to make it more unpleasant than the next alternative location for the animal which will hopefully move on and do its business elsewhere.  But you will be fighting against (1) habits that might take time to break, (2) areas previously marked by animals or other droppings that are more attractive that offset or overpower this, (3) if yours is still the least unpleasant alternative to limited or worse options, (4) the animal's sensitivity to taste and smell of this deterrent, and (5) how fast it gets washed away and perform at reduced levels.  You could have an old dog that has lost much of its sense of smell and has been using your lawn for ages and has marked the area that probably would be less deterred to change.  Or a cat's habit and previous droppings might overpower this product.This is similar to you going to the beach.  Suppose rocks litter one side of the beach along with a dead fish that washed up on shore and smells a little.  It doesn't stop you from walking through there, it is just unpleasant to setup your towel or walk around over there.  But you might walk through it to find better sands elsewhere.  But you would prefer to walk to the side of the beach that is sandy with a fresh air breeze.  Your yard is the beach to the pests.  You are just trying to make it less desirable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335KHCDDDU4PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OR0GRC#wasThisHelpful","R335KHCDDDU4PC","A2I60HCAVEF3RC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I60HCAVEF3RC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is true that their canned dog food would be one of the better ones on the market if it contained the ingredients listed. This company would also get much credit for sourcing and manufacturing their food in the US. At first we thought we had done a good thing switching to Evangers for our little 8 lb Shorkie.However, not long after switching she started to have vomiting and seizures, even bleeding from the nose. So we did a quick Internet search on the food and found some very, very bad news.Aside from the customer reports of mold and rusty cans, we found this:Letters warning Evangers were sent by the FDA and are publicly available (read letters yourself online) about how they failed inspections by not having the ingredients listed on their cans, but something else in their food.----------------------------------""From December 2, 2010 through February 10, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your low-acid canned food manufacturing facility located at 221 Wheeling Road, Wheeling, Illinois. In addition, on August 19, 2010, FDA received samples of (b)(4) Lamb and Rice Dog Food from the distributor, (b)(4). This letter notifies you of the violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we found during our inspection and from the samples we received from the distributor. You can find the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through links on FDAs web page at www.fda.gov1.""""We found that you offered for sale (b)(4) Lamb and Rice Dog Food which was adulterated. Under Section 402(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C.  342(b)(2), a food is deemed to be adulterated if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part therefore. Our analytical sample results of this product revealed that a substance (lamb) was not detected in the product [...]""On December 14, 2010, FDA collected samples of your Evangers Grain-free Duck Pet Food during the inspection of your facility. We found that the Evangers Grain-free Duck Pet Food product was adulterated.""-----------------------------------------Worse even than that was the fact that in 2009 the FDA had to order a SHUTDOWN of their production:""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced today it was suspending Evanger's Dog & Cat Food Co.'s emergency permit to ship pet food because the company's procedures could allow the bacterium that causes botulism to survive in some of its products.The FDA is stopping Evanger's ability to ship pet food in interstate commerce, said Dr. Bernadette Dunham.""[Check that one out on Consumer Affairs web site]---------------------------------------------------------If all of THAT weren't bad enough, Evangers instituted a silent recall of their own food from their distributors because of the small, sharp pieces of metal found in their canned food:""Along with the peas, carrots, rice, and chicken, Ms.E**** found sharp metal tags floating in amongst the meat and veg When Ms. E**** asked what the tags were and what in the BLEEP they were they doing in her dog food, they assured her, that a similar incident happened a couple of years ago and were surprised to hear that there were still cans of it floating around.When Ms. E**** inquired about the extra ingredient, Evangers told her that the tags are used in the poultry industry as a means of identification and should have been removed from the chickens wings before they got used in pet food.""---------------------------------------------------Well, now. If that were not bad enough, there's MORE. Are you ready for this?From Chicago News Center:""Prosecutors charged a Lincolnwood couple today [The owners of Evangers] with illegally diverting nearly $2 million in utilities to their dog and cat food company through an elaborate scheme where [Evangers] workers performed highly dangerous maneuvers.An employee was given a pair of rubber gloves and told to go up in a forklift to disconnect an illegal bypass attached to a high-voltage line shortly before ComEd inspectors arrived.Another time, prosecutors say, the worker was ordered to use a jackhammer to tear up concrete and asphalt so gas could be diverted to the plant in Wheeling.

"This is the best tasting oat bran cereal we have found, bar none.  And we've tried A LOT of them.The instructions on the box are wrong.  It says microwave 1-2 mins.  That is patently wrong, unless you like undercooked, crunchy hot cereal.  Also, the amount of liquid seems too much to us, but that is dependent on how firm you like your cereal.  We use about 1 and 3/4 cups of water to a slightly rounded half cup of cereal.  We cook it for more like 6-7 minutes on high (stir before cooking and once after 5 minutes).The consistency then is rich and smooth and moderately firm.We add raisins, cinnamon and walnuts and a touch of brown sugar and either milk or vanilla coconut milk.Very good tasting cereal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GO2S0ODMJEG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IN28IM#wasThisHelpful","R1GO2S0ODMJEG3","A1SO1PGDNVMLXC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SO1PGDNVMLXC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When we grate carrots, the pieces are short and stubby, not long and thin the way other graters work.The opposite side is ok - more of a fine shredder.  The narrow side is for things like hard cheeses but is too fine for parmesan cheese or most things we want on a fine grate.

"This case worked for us after trying the regular non-grip case.  The regular CandyShell  case  (that is, the non-grippy version) is almost as slippery as the phone (which is saying a lot -- the phone is so slippery we don't dare use it without a case).We sent the regular CandyShell case back to get the grippy one and are very happy with the new one.  It still comes out of the pocket fine and is a well-made, easy to hold case.  It is only slightly ribbed so it acts as a protector and is easy to grasp without being too obtrusive.  It is somewhat flexible, but not too thick so that the form factor is not increased by much.  It fits the phone (HTC one m8) exactly right - cutouts are perfect and the built-in volume buttons work great.If you have one of these slippery phones (a design flaw if there ever was one), this case is an excellent protection for your phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1RF32S84TUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J18WLAO#wasThisHelpful","RN1RF32S84TUS","A1SO1PGDNVMLXC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SO1PGDNVMLXC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seemed like a reasonable printer at first, then it started having issues with the software.  A whole variety of errors, finally resulting in our taking it back to the store for a refund when it was less than a year old.It seems to be common to have color printers these days refuse to print black and white if their color inks are seen as empty.  It is also common for these vendors to say the ink containers are empty when they are not.Amazingly, they also won't allow refills and reuse of the same cartridges successively.So the ink ends up costing far more than the printer did really quickly.  In spite of this, out of laziness or inertia, we were going to keep the thing in spite of its frequent paper jams, errors, and wasteful use of ink.  Then it failed completely.We had bought a Brother B&W laser printer that operated cheaply and flawlessly, so we decided to replace this one with a Brother MFC J5720DW.We have been very happy with the replacement printer.

The amount of lemon juice is total guesswork because she says 5 lemons, but the amount of juice from lemons can vary greatly.  The amount of sugar is pretty normal, the amount of eggs is a bit lower than some recipes, but still within reason.  Then look at the amount of heavy cream she asks for.  1 cup plus 1/4 cup of sour cream.  REALLY?  Are you ****** kidding me?????!!!!  It made a bowl of lemon juice soup that was 200% of the amount of fluid needed to fill the tart pan.Compare to any other recipe for lemon tarts and you will see more like 3 tablespoons of cream!!!!!

"I found it after researching dry shampoos and their reviews for a couple of hours on Amazon, and this one has lived up to its reviews.  I didn't think it was possible for a dry shampoo to work on my fairly oily hair, but I am delighted to say that this product is awesome.  *I used to have to wash my hair every day, or else risk massive oiliness--no joke.*  Now if I oversleep for work or an airplane flight, I can use this product and my hair looks soft and shiny.  It doesn't look as thick as it would if I had washed and blowdried it, but at least it looks presentable.  I couldn't be happier.Some observations:1) You really do have to work it through all sections of your hair (for me I do this by spraying through sections around the crown of my head and my ears, AND doing the same by flipping my hair upside down and going section by section before brushing everything out).2) This bottle goes by fast!  I have only used it a dozen times and it's pretty much toast by now.  My hair is average length and thickness.  However, given how it has saved me about a dozen times with early morning meetings with clients and flights, I have happily purchased it again and I'm sure I'll continue to purchase it.(Review written by Woody's wife; Woody does not have to worry about washing, drying, and styling his locks.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DT0BRYEAZB2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005D7G12Q#wasThisHelpful","R2DT0BRYEAZB2C","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why we bought the Ring:We live smack in the middle of a place where home invasions arent uncommon and wouldnt even make news.  As a matter of practice, we dont answer the door if were not expecting somebody.  But we also have lots of people ringing our doorbell: politicians who come by for meet-and-greets, our neighbors who want to pop in at unexpected times, and people peddling goods.  We decided that because we dont typically answer the door, we wanted to do two things: (1) see who is at the door without being obvious that were looking, and, depending on who is there, (2) let them know that were home whether we are or are not home (especially for the peddlerswe never know if theyre just in our neighborhood to see whos home).In theory, the Ring doorbell is supposed to do these two things: if somebody rings your doorbell, a pop-up alert sounds on your iphone, ipad, i-whatever, which allows you to see a real-time feed of who is there.  You can then have a conversation with the person through the microphone on the Ring.  The entire interchange is recorded through Rings optional cloud service (free for 30 days then $3/month thereafter or $30/year).  All of these features recently drove me to my local big box store to buy and install the Ring.Unfortunately, the Ring turned out to be much better in theory than in reality, so Ive had to return it.  Below, Ill lay out what I think is great about the Ring and then why I returned it.What is great about the Ring:(1) The concept is awesome.  For a geek like me living in a moderately-high crime area, I cant think of anything cooler than being able to see who is at my door, being able to talk to that person, and being able to record our interchange.(2) The Ring is also supposed to send you a pop-up alert when motion detection is triggered.  You can change the settings on your iphone or ipad or other devices to narrow this range and even to limit it to certain areas.  Picture a half-circle  this represents the Rings 180-degree visibility due to its fish-eye lens.  There are six zones in this half-circle: one smaller half-circle for the 5-foot area right in front of your door, and five more zones beyond that, extending out to 30 feet.  So, if you want to shut off the motion detection for the left area of your yard/street because thats a busy intersection, the Ring app allows you to do that.  Again, very smart and very cool in theory.(3) Ring has done a good job of making the sound clear through the two-way noise reduction  even when Ive been in my car, at work, or anywhere but home, it sounds remarkably clear and thus believable that Im actually home.  (This is according to my wife, who performed several tests of the Ring with me to see how it was working.)(4) You have two installation options.  You can install it without connecting it to your existing wiring, but if you go this route, you will only hear the app alert and not your doorbell.  However, Ring does have an add-on device called the Chime to solve this problem  for $30, the Chime plugs into a regular socket and makes a noise similar to what your doorbell would make.  Alternatively, you can do what we did and install it straight into your existing doorbell system.  Installation was a beastly, 3-hour task, but once finished, the Ring worked flawlessly with our existing doorbell system.  Not only does installing the Ring this way allow you to hear your actual doorbell plus the alert on your Ring app, but there is an added benefit of conneting the Ring to your existing wiring: the wires will deliver a small trickle charge to the Ring so that you dont have to take it down to recharge the battery through the provided USB cord (which Ring says has to happen about once a year, unless you live on a very busy street, in which case the battery will drain faster).(5) Intuitive, easy-to-use software.  Multiple people in your household can download the free Ring app for their own devices and thus get alerts when somebody is at the door.  The app is quite simple to use.  Also, in case you were wondering (I certainly was), the alert on your iphone or other device will sound if you have your volume on, but will vibrate if you have silent mode + vibrate on your phone, or will make no sound if you have silent mode without vibration on.  In other words, you will not have an embarassing moment during your work conference because your Ring app sounds.(6) Great customer service.  I availed myself of several of Rings how-to videos during the installation process, and I felt (and still feel) connected to the brand.  I believe in what theyre doing and I like their philosophies and promises (such as replacing the Ring if its ever stolen).Why we returned the Ring:(1) The motion detection did not work.  It simply did not work.  We tried multiple sensitivity settings (bringing it farther away, bringing it closer, restricting zones), but it never picked up any activity unless the person rang the doorbell.  On various occasions, I even stood one foot from the Ring for several minutes, waving my arms, dancing around  and nothing.  The importance of this cannot be overstated.  While its quite useful to see who is there once that person rings the doorbell, I also wanted what Ring promised: seeing who was there when the person did not ring the doorbell.  We have plenty of people who knock, and we have plenty of package-theft incidents.  These are the types of things I was hoping to be able to record with the Ring.  Its simply not worth it to be to have the Ring alert triggered only if somebody rings the doorbell; for $199 (actually, for about half that price), I could put up a decent camera and get a companion app for my phone.(2) Along these same lines, the Ring had some lag in recording when somebody did ring the doorbell.  So, when our friendly UPS man delivered a package recently, he rang the doorbell (as he always does), but then promply got back into his truck without waiting for a response (as he always does).  The video feed, however, shows nothing  not even his truck driving away.  Others have reported a similar lag time; Im hoping that this is something Ring will fix in the future.(3) The Ring does not allow you to see whats going on unless the Ring is triggered by motion or by the doorbell being rung (in our case, only by the doorbell being rung).  Given that the Ring has a pretty big camera connected to your iphone or other device, it seems odd that this feature is not available.  In perusing the internet about the Ring before I purchased it, I saw from several other peoples thoughts on the Ring that this was something people wanted.  Im hopeful that this will be available in future versions of or software updates to the Ring.(4) The picture quality is pretty grainy  720 pixels.  When we had a suspicious person come to our door during broad daylight and ring the doorbell, his face in the video was somewhat clear, but not enough that Id be sure it was him if I saw him in person.Additional cons/things to be aware of (but not deal-breakers):(1) Before you buy this, know that this product is huge!  Its about as wide as a cigarette box and a little bit taller.  Unless your existing doorbell is on a large slab of siding, there will be installation issues.  You can remedy this by buying or creating a small slab of wood that sits behind the Ring and on top of your siding or next to your siding (i.e., you would drill that small slab of wood into the siding so that you now have a bigger face plate to install the Ring on).  Or, you can do what we did and install the Ring with just two of the screws on (there are four screws  one in each corner).  Surprinsingly, the Ring was still quite secure this way, but its an issue you should be aware of.(2) The mollies that come with the Ring are smaller than the drill bit that is provided with the Ring  so, you will be creating gaping holes in your siding with mollies that arent the right size.  We ended up using our own mollies (which I highly recommend), but not without creating some serious holes in our siding.(3) The cloud feature is great, but several people out there have lamented that it should be able to be stored in ones own cloud storage (like your Box or DropBox account) rather than in Rings proprietary cloud.  I dont so much have a problem with the fact that the videos are stored in Rings cloud  rather, I would just like more transparency with what security measures they take for their cloud.  I wouldnt just want anyone to be able to hack in and see the house.  Also, given that you do have to pay $30 a year for the cloud service, youve now essentially identified your home address by linking up your credit card (billing address) with images of your house.  For people who are in the market for this kind of doorbell (i.e., security-conscious people), this might be a sticking point.  (The Ring does ask for your home address when you set up the app, but this is not required for the camera to work and was certainly not something I provided.)Overall, while the Ring has some great concepts, it didnt deliver for us.  Im so disappointed that it didnt work out for us  I had such high hopes.  In sum, I believe theres no reason that this product cant be awesome with some tweaking.  I think its just too early for the technology to be all there, so to speak, or there arent enough competitors to make this product as exceptional as I know it can be.  Down the road, I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for later-offered doorbell cameras by Ring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8NV2X9CI4V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2ZDXW2#wasThisHelpful","R2U8NV2X9CI4V7","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for (1) pillow shams and (2) those oversized, square shams (24x24 or thereabouts) in plain white for a bedroom that's being redecorated.  Although I never could find the oversized, square shams, I finally found these pillow shams after many hours browsing and I am very happy with this purchase.Why I am very happy with this purchase:1) This is a very thick, very nice sham.  It has some texture to it--a quilted look, almost--which is nice because everything else I saw (and I trolled the Amazon site for hours looking for shams) was either faux velvet or faux suede.  There may have been a few that were just 100% cotton, but the reviews mentioned how thin they were.  So, this was the best I could find, and I'm very happy with it.  The room I'm using it in does not have any quilts in it, and is fairly modern, but this surprisingly fits in just great.2) My exhaustive Amazon search also led me to discover that it's nearly impossible to find plain white shams!  As mentioned above, what I found was generally either faux velvet or faux suede.  Those just wouldn't have fit into the overall decorating scheme of the room I bought these for.  So, if you're looking for something plain but with some interesting details (the quilting, as mentioned above, and the scalloped borders), I suspect these shams would work for you, too.3) Good price - $20 for two shams is a great deal, as far as what I could tell from comparison shopping.Something to note:1) They really mean it when they say this is a KING-sized sham.  These shams are very long and don't work with just a regular pillow in them.  I didn't take note of the king-size in the description, so I stuffed two regular pillows in there, and that is working pretty well (though a bit lumpy) until my new king-sized pillows arrive from Amazon.In sum, great product, especially given what else it out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DR3SQ2LRBZQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y71K0S0#wasThisHelpful","R3DR3SQ2LRBZQA","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were very pleasantly surprised when this came in the mail. The material is so soft and it's not see-through at all, and has held up well after washings. For what appears to be a high quality shirt, the price is also pretty great. (I haven't been able to find many kids' t-shirts for this price.)  I also love that although there's a tiny logo, it's really tiny and is just a darker gray color instead of something ""louder.""There's only one flaw we can find: it's on the short side. The picture doesn't really show it, but it's a little bit boxy. All of our other 3T shirts are much longer. So that was a disappointment but, with all of the good things about this shirt, we are happy with our purchase and will probably buy another one in another color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13IEXJ8I63RTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOYPEKY#wasThisHelpful","R13IEXJ8I63RTY","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After losing too many socks to the floor and to our household pets, and after seeing my son with cuff-marks from socks that last for days, I've become quite picky about kids' socks.  Once our young'un unfortunately finally outgrew our tried-and-true Fruit of the Loom Little Boys' Low Cut socks, it was time to find new socks.Not so easy!  I looked at a ton of different brands of socks and read a ton of reviews.  Falls off too easily?  Next.  May cause farmers' tan?  No thanks.  Causes red marks from digging into the ankle?  Been there, done that.  We finally landed on these socks and they looked great.  One small problem, though--other people had major sizing issues with them.  I, too, was confused.  What is a 9-2.5?  My young'un, age two, wears a size 9.5, but I don't know when the shoe sizes transition to 1, 2, etc., so I wasn't sure what the sizing meant or what to expect.I am happy to say that these socks are great!  I would say that they are half a size too big for him right now, so they may run one size too big.  Even though they're a little long in the toe area, they still fit great into his shoes. They also stay on his feet, which is upsetting to the family pets but very exciting for the rest of us.  We also really like the material--it's soft yet substantial. In other words, they aren't thin, they appear quite durable, but they're not scratchy at all.We will definitely be buying these again in the next size up when that time comes. Great find and great socks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E8XG2T6QE2ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KF1U70#wasThisHelpful","R2E8XG2T6QE2ZQ","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our family has been very pleased with these drawer liners, and we plan to buy more to cover more of our clothing storage areas.Why these are 1000% better than moth balls:1) Pleasant smell. Moth balls will leave your clothes smelling like your great-Grandma's house used to smell. Case in point: we recently returned from a B&B that had the stench of moth balls everywhere because the proprietors kept moth balls in all of the drawers and cabinets for the entire winter and spring and only just removed the moth balls before our stay. The clothes we brought on the trip and haven't yet laundered--like our rain jackets and other jackets--still reek of moth balls. That trip made me realize that we didn't have anything in our house to keep moths away, but we needed it--I had two nice-looking and expensive sweaters that got destroyed within 6 months, and my wife had a similar experience with one of her wool cardigans. When we wised up and got these cedar planks, I worried that they would leave a strong cedar smell on my clothes, but they haven't.2) Non-toxic. Moth balls are said to be toxic. Not only is the vapor harmful, but children and pets can mistake them for food, especially due to their sweet odor and taste. I certainly don't expect my two-year-old or dog to be gnashing on this large cedar plank.What else we like about these cedar planks:1) Great fit in our drawers. Each plank has grooves on the bottom so that it doesn't slide around as much when you open your drawers. The grooves are also great to fit onto a wire rack. But note that if you're using it on a wire rack, such as in a closet, they might not be as effective (more on that below). These planks take up much less space than a cedar block or a bag of cedar chips, and you can line them up to cover the whole bottom of a drawer, or you can use just one per drawer. (We just use one per drawer, which seems to be sufficient because you can smell the cedar each time you open the drawer.)2) They'll last forever. All you have to do is sand them every so often--once they don't smell anymore--to get them working again.From what we can tell, this is the safest and most pleasant way to keep moths away, but they're not 100% fool-proof:1) As mentioned above, they need to be sanded every so often to keep them effective. Time will tell if and when I or my wife will get around to doing that.2) As I understand it, cedar needs to be in a small, enclosed environment for maximum effectiveness. This means a container or drawer, not a regular closet. A closet means that there is potentially too much airflow for the cedar, and too much airflow means that it will not kill moth larvae (though it may be effective for adult moths). The reason behind this is that cedar is thought to mask the smell of the wool that attracts moths; it doesn't kill the moths or larvae like moth balls do. So, that's why you should keep the planks in a small, enclosed environment where the smell will be present. This means that you may have to rethink/reorganize where you keep your sweaters; that's what we had to do after we bought these planks and researched cedar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20NUJP8XCOKE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IF4T8Q#wasThisHelpful","R20NUJP8XCOKE3","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of my review pretty much sums it up.  We love, love, love this book.  It's a story about a little boy, Henry, and his teddy bear, who play together and learn to use the potty.  Despite the fact that the story is fairly long, our son actually pays attention throughout the whole story (not a typical thing--he usually gets through a few pages of any book!).  He also brings the book to us quite frequently to have us read it to him.Most importantly, this book really seems to have made things ""click"" for him.  We went shopping for ""big boy"" underwear shortly after reading this book to him for the first time, and he seemed to make the connection.  He also discusses Henry's diaper and his accidents while we're reading the book.  He engages with the story in a way unlike any other story.I agree with the reviewer who commented on the unforgivable grammar.  There is one portion of the book where it says ""Teddy and me . . .""!  I honestly think I'm going to take a sharpie to the book and fix it, because changing it to ""I"" doesn't mess up the rhyme or the rhythm.  It's very odd.  However, it doesn't affect my star rating and I suppose when my son is older, it would be a good way to teach him about grammar.  (On the other hand, I hope that we won't be reading this book at the same time that he's learning about grammar, because that would probably mean that we'd be potty training at age 5!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7K03D3PU84WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764152327#wasThisHelpful","R7K03D3PU84WB","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a tall and lean guy, and so it's not easy to find shirts that fit.  Shirts that are long enough tend to be too wide.  It's also a bit of trouble (and expensive) to go to specialty big and tall stores, so I don't get around to it too often.  So, I'm thrilled to have found this product online.Pros (in ascending order of importance):--It's made of a thick (but not too thick) material.  Very comfortable even in the hot summer weather.--It's a decent price compared to what I've seen at local big and tall stores.--It has held up well in several washings--I haven't seen any fading yet and I tend to wash my clothes maybe a little too often.--NO MORE ""PLUMBER'S CRACK""!  This makes me, my wife, our neighbors, my coworkers, and the general public VERY happy.Cons: None that I can think of.  This is a great product and I will be ordering again.

I even bought it as a gift for someone else because it was such a great little vacuum, the way that it sucked up dog fur on the steps and dust in the kitchen.

Those work fine, but require a LOT of adjusting, especially if you are wearing a tighter fitting jacket.  These long-sleeve shields do the trick, however.  I can go through an entire day and not have to adjust them at all (or at most, maybe once or twice, but only to position it a little bit better).I do not wear a suit jacket without these anymore, period.  I do this because even though I don't have a B.O. problem and I don't perspire (I use Certain Dri and so I don't sweat!), there's still a funky smell that occurs from wearing a suit jacket up against a bare armpit, or even a short-sleeved armpit.

"We purchased these straps to clip onto our child's Diono Radian car seat (the manufacturer sells its own straps, but those seem to break quickly for most people).  We've just done a test run on a whirlwind trip through four airports in the past 24 hours and these straps have been fantastic.  The fabric is sturdy and stiff, and so are the clips.  They fit our car seat perfectly, which allowed us to carry a VERY heavy car seat as a backpack (this is key when trying to herd a toddler through an airport).  The only thing I would change is the padding on the straps--there is some, but not much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TXWPNSROZRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOX992E#wasThisHelpful","R13TXWPNSROZRU","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this TV (KDL-40R450A) from Costco a little less than 2 years ago (Summer 2013).  The TV itself is very attractive and thin, and is very lightweight (I easily mounted it to my wall).  The display was also great, but within the past two months the TV has developed a thin horizontal line running across the entire screen, about 4-5 inches from the top of the screen.  The line exists regardless of which HDMI input source I use, and also shows up in TV settings menus.  It's not terribly annoying but it is distracting and obviously not something I'd expect from a Sony product.  I have another Sony TV that I purchased in 2002 that is still working flawlessly, so the appearance of this line is disappointing, to say the least.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6BDA7JPLA523/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWKBZQQ#wasThisHelpful","R6BDA7JPLA523","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the better cell phone covers I've owned.1)  S-View functionalityThe ""S-View"" screen is the small screen visible when you close the cover.  It provides extra functionality.  The added functions I've used most are answering phone calls without opening the cover and turning on the ""Flashlight"" function which turns on the LED light on the back of the phone (much easier than unlocking the phone and searching for the app).  The S-View display also lets you know the temperature and the number of steps you've taken if you're using the S Health app.The S-View screen is another screen and it does require additional cleaning, however.2)  Wireless chargingIf you own a wireless charging pad, you can use this case to drop the phone down on the pad and start charging the phone.  This prevents having to find a charging cord.  Not a life-changing convenience, but it is nice not having to look around for the charging cord and plug it in properly.  If you're buying a charging pad, make sure you get the larger pad so you don't have to balance the phone (as you do on the ""mini"" charging pads).3)  Protection from dropsI've dropped the phone a few times and it has seemed to protect the phone well.  There's a small crack in the glass of my phone after a drop that happened before I got this cover, but the crack hasn't got worse since I've used this cover, and the few times I've dropped the phone after getting the cover have not resulted in new cracks.  The leather edges of the case protrude slightly from the phone and seem to provide a decent bit of shock absorption, although this is certainly no Otterbox Defender.4)  Style/comfortThis is a somewhat subjective area but I feel like the cover adds a bit to style and comfort.  I like how this case doesn't add much to the bulk of the phone.  You have to replace the back battery cover with this cover and this removes a lot of the bulk you would have with other cases.  I do wonder if I'll be able to find the original phone cover when it comes time to sell or trade this phone in, so I would put the old cover in a place you can easily remember.The case feels like real leather.  Although the seams to the leather seem to have gotten a little dirty after months of use (my wife has used the term ""grody""), the cover itself has stayed a rather solid white.  Buying the darker cover would have avoided this.  I imagine I could clean the cover with some type of leather cleaning agent, but I haven't felt the need to do so yet.5)  CameraPictures taken with this cover on are saved in a different default folder in your photos.  The S-View pictures/videos are sized differently from pictures/videos taken without the cover on because the S-View screen is square and the regular phone screen is a rectangle.  I've taken to not using the S-View camera feature because I like the larger view and resolution of pictures when you use the phone's full screen.Overall, a great case and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5J134CPU876B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQG2WFG#wasThisHelpful","R5J134CPU876B","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATED JULY 2015 (3 stars):I'm sad to say that after just two uses of this book while traveling, and maybe three uses of this book at home, most all of the pages have ripped from their seams. This had already happened as of the time of my review below, and as I said there, I can't place all the blame with the book because it is a book that little kids are playing with (and we know they're not the gentlest of creatures). However, it's a bummer that after just a handful of uses, this book is now pretty much unusable (we bought it mostly for travel and didn't want to have miscellaneous loose sheets flying everywhere in a car or especially in an airplane).Also, another issue we have encountered after taking it on our second trip: it's just too big and cumbersome for any real, practical use on a trip.  It's so big that it doesn't even fit into a very large carry-on.  If it does fit, it sticks out of the top of the carry-on, is stiff, and takes up so much space in a bag.  So, the bulky size of the book, combined with the weak seams issue, means that we no longer travel with it, unfortunately.  It still gets three stars because I consider it an okay product--and I still love the concept of reusable, non-sticky stickers--but because our son doesn't really like to play with it at home and because we bought it primarily for traveling, it just doesn't suit our purposes. This has just been our experience--others may have a great experience with this book for their young'uns, especially if they're planning to use it at home.AUGUST 2014 REVIEW (5 stars):Before we had children, one of my top 15 fears as a parent was having stickers stuck to every surface of my house (I had seen too many of my wife's nieces and nephews going wild with stickers). So when my wife suggested a ""sticker book"" for our young'un, I immediately vetoed it until I found out these stickers are reusable.I'm so glad that I didn't veto this purchase. Not only are these stickers reusable (i.e., no mess), but they kept our young'un entertained for at least 25 minutes of a recent airplane flight. In airplane time and in one-year-old time, that's almost equivalent to a four-hour-movie. He loved peeling off the dinosaurs and re-peeling them off, over and over; for those 25 minutes or so, he truly was transfixed (and not bothering the flight attendants or other passengers!). The same has held true at home: he actually sits on the floor quietly and flips the pages of his book back and forth and peels and re-peels the stickers. It's unclear what he's actually doing, but he's around one, so he gets a hall pass, and the book seems to keep his attention and keep him happy, so that makes us happy.At the front of the book, there are several sheets of animals that are grouped into like categories--farm, aquatic, jungle, etc. Later in the book, there are ""scenes"" with illustrations depicting farm life, aquatic life, jungle life, and so on, so that the animals you saw earlier would ""fit"" into those scenes. (For instance, the jungle scene has a long tree rope that the monkeys can swing from, and the monkey stickers, I was pleased to see, are positioned so that their arms are up, not down, so that it looks like they're actually swinging from the tree when you put them next to the tree.) However, do note one thing about the sheets of animals at the front of the book: the stickers can be hard to peel off if you have a younger child. Like many young'uns, our young'un is probably too little to take the stickers off of the backing for the first time, and he got frustrated at first trying to peel them out to play with them. So, here's what we did: we peeled off the white background sheet that keeps all of the stickers in place, and then stuck the stickers back onto the background (not the ""scene"" backgrounds, but the plain white backgrounds in the beginning of the book). He could then easily peel them off when he wanted to play with them.We've just found one small downside to this book, and that's the seams to this book: they're not very sturdy. The very first time that our son played with this book, two of the sheets fell from their seams within minutes. There's no way to put them back into the book, so now the book has missing pages. I can't completely place blame with the book, when our young'un is a rambunctious, no-holds-barred young'un, but I was surprised that this happened after just a few minutes of play. Still, this doesn't affect my star rating of five stars.I am hopeful that as our young'un gets older, this book will become even more useful and entertaining to him. If he's occupied now around one year of age by just peeling and re-peeling stickers without an awareness of what they're doing or the fact that dinosaurs don't usually like farmland, then I think this book will last for at least several more years. It's also meant to be for 3+ years, so that's another reason I'm hoping it will keep its usefulness (note also that this means you have to watch your young'un to make sure he or she doesn't swallow any of the small stickers--there are some giant stickers in the book, like dolphins and dinosaurs, and then some tiny ones, like birds and flowers). In sum, we are beyond happy with this sticker book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTYDL1ZHQFSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PBN9BC#wasThisHelpful","R1KTYDL1ZHQFSP","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It only feels weird the first time you strap your baby into a three-point harness to change his diaper, until you come to two, key realizations: (a) your baby is not crawling or rolling around, naked and covered in unmentionables, all over a dirty bathroom floor, to ""explore""; and (b) because your baby is not doing (a), you are free to wash your hands and fix your hair in the mirror for three seconds.  It's a strange and liberating feeling.In all seriousness, our son is at the age--and has been at the age for months--where he likes to do gymnastics during diaper changes.  With several trips we took this summer, we knew that public changings were going to be disastrous.  I was sort of half joking when I googled three-point harnesses for portable changing pads and came across this pad.  My wife said it wouldn't work because the pad would roll up (because there would be nothing to weigh the harnesses down).  Well, this portable pad works beautifully because it does have a little bit of heft to it.  It has a dark blue thick plastic base that folds in three sections into what looks like a folio.  It is covered with a dark blue pad that also folds along with the plastic base.  Both the plastic base and the blue pad are washable.  There are then three adjustable yellow harnesses for the baby's chest and shoulders, plus a fourth strap that can go around a sink faucet (we've never tried this, but the instruction booklet explains it and shows pictures).We were worried that the changing pad, overall, would be too bulky to carry around on our various trips.  Now, it didn't fit in our regular (teeny) diaper bag, but that's because we had a teeny diaper bag when we first bought this (it would have fit a two-inch binder in the main compartment at most). We've since upgraded to a larger diaper bag and the pad fits just fine.  It's also not very heavy--it's a couple of pounds.  But honestly, the pad's slightly larger size and weight (as compared to the standard, flimsy portable changing pad that typically comes with a diaper bag) is WELL worth it.  I can't tell you how many times on our trips this summer my wife would return from the bathroom with our son and say ""I am SO glad we have this pad,"" and how many times I did the same.  True story.To sum it up, the only reason you shouldn't buy this pad is if you are blessed with a very calm child who sits still for diaper changes.  If not, and if you plan to travel anywhere (restaurants, out of town, etc.), I highly recommend that you get this product: it's the coolest thing ever and has my and my wife's highest recommendation because it has made our lives so much easier. I want to buy one of these for every new parent I know--that's how great I think this product is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7VSQI5OANJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GEDT8A#wasThisHelpful","RN7VSQI5OANJ5","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After quickly going through five pairs of shoes that never stayed on our son's feet (if we could even get them on his feet), we've finally found a shoe that goes on easily and stays on and we couldn't be happier.Here's a breakdown about these shoes:Sizing:As suggested by other reviewers, we ordered a larger size.  In fact, we ordered TWO sizes larger, and got the wide width, and the shoes still stay put.  (Never mind that our son looks like Ronald McDonald with his clown feet, but we keep telling ourselves that at least he'll have room to grow into the shoes....)Fit:I'm not sure if it's because we bought the wide version, or because we bought two sizes too large, or because you can loosen the shoes with the laces, or just the way the shoes are constructed, or all of the above, but these shoes go on quite easily (even over our son's high arches and beefy baby feet).  You can then get a pretty tight fit with the laces.  It's worth noting that even though we bought two sizes too big, the shoes still fit great.  We don't even need to put socks with them; the only place where they are big is in the toe (hence the clown shoe look).Comfort:As a general principle, our son HATES shoes.  Because he's a young'un of few words, I can't say definitively that he's smitten with these shoes.  However--and this is a big however--he doesn't try to pull these shoes off every chance he gets, unlike every other pair of shoes that he has had (I doubt he'd be able to, anyway, with how well they fit on the ankle and with the laces).  Also, after a full day of wearing them, even without socks, he has no blisters.Price:My wife and I had--and are still experiencing--some sticker shock when it comes to toddler shoe prices.  So, a little part of me hurts for saying that $20 is a reasonable price, but for what we've seen so far, this is a pretty reasonable price.Looks:Due to the aforementioned sticker shock we're experiencing, my wife and I wanted to get the most use we could out of these shoes, so we purposefully ordered a couple of sizes up (hoping he could wear these shoes into puberty, or at least into kindergarten).  So, not surprisingly, as mentioned, the shoes look a little clown-like because they're quite large in the toe area, though they fit very well everywhere else.  Because our son's feet are so small for the shoes, the laces are also quite long, further exacerbating the clown problem.  Otherwise, the shoes are cute.  The navy goes well with lots of outfits.  (Do note that the color in the pictures looks like a denim or chambray, but the actual shoes are a true navy.)Overall:We are so happy to have found these shoes. They're (relatively) affordable; they fit our son well, even with tons of room to grow; we don't have to struggle to put them on his feet; they appear comfortable; they are cute; and, above all, they stay on his feet.  Although this is our first Keds purchase, this certainly will not be our last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XBPK8CB3WFBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029DNMIS#wasThisHelpful","R1XBPK8CB3WFBM","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that any moderately attractive pair of shoes for a young'un is bound to fall off. It's like there's an inverse relationship between beauty and functionality, and the more contraptions and straps there are, the uglier the shoes are (but you know they'll stay put). So, with these Tom's, which are sleek, they don't stay on for very long at all. That's why I feel it's not fair to take away more than one star for these Tom's because it's likely that any itty-bitty shoe without a bunch of straps or laces isn't going to work out very well.And that's the huge downside to these shoes: they stay on for a few seconds, maybe a minute if we're lucky. However, these Tom's also have their own inherent flaw: they have pretty thin, shallow walls, which makes it quite easy for our son's feet to slide out of them. Just like adult Tom's, the shoes have a minimalist look. The only difference is that there's a small flap of Velcro over the top of the child's arch. We had hoped this would make the fit snugger--and it does, but only ever so marginally, and it's really the thinness and shallowness of the shoes' walls that cause them to fall off so much, and the lack of straps.With all the smack-talk above, what's to like about these shoes?1) For one, I like that they're closed-toed--good for keeping our son's feet clean as a whistle during trips to the city.2) They're cute in their simplicity. As mentioned, the shoes don't have a ton of straps every which way. They're just a basic looking pair of shoes that go with everything (my wife and I wanted to buy one pair of shoes, not a bunch of pairs, especially at this price). In my opinion, they're versatile because they're so simple--they look cute in pictures but they don't stand out, and they're neither too dressy nor too casual.3) For a slip-on pair of shoes, they're quite easy to put on because of the Velcro strap, which opens up to offer a little more room (great for those beefy baby arches).Would I buy these again?Probably not. Although the shoes were cute for some outings and photographs, and proved to some well-meaning family members that our son actually does go out in public in shoes (sometimes), the shoes didn't ever stay on for more than 60 seconds when my son was walking around. When my son was sitting down, he often pulled the shoes off due to the Velcro straps. We believe we had him in the correct size, and we in fact bought the shoes in two different sizes (it was recommended by many to size down and we found that one size down from our son's true shoe size indeed offered a much better fit in the Tom's). So, for all of the above reasons, we remain on the hunt for a pair of shoes that are simple-looking yet stay on the feet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VR3MOEGWGBA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B29Y2MK#wasThisHelpful","R3VR3MOEGWGBA7","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six years ago, I was checking out at a store and they were offering ""sweater stones"" to remove pills for something like $10.  At the time, I thought ""nah--I'll be fine, and if I ever end up needing one, I can find another one elsewhere.""Flash forward to every six months since then.  I've cursed the day that I didn't buy the sweater stone.  I've never seen a sweater stone sold in stores, and when I've asked people about them, they look at me like I'm crazy. For some reason, I didn't consider the internet until recently when a shirt (brand new) got so bad that I realized that these items must exist on the web!  Sure enough, I came across The Laundress Sweater Comb and I'm very happy with this purchase.The sweater comb is sleek--approximately 4L x 2W x .25H (all in inches)--kind of close to the size of a thicker, elongated credit card.  The design is attractive, with cedar covering most of the mesh.The product actually works, too.  I've used it on four of my shirts and a couple of sweaters where I was becoming ""that girl"" (you know, the one who won't lift up her arms because underneath it's so pilled?).One thing to note, and the instructions will mention this: this product is not the best for looser, yarn-like fabrics. If you're going on a hot date TONIGHT and the only option you have is your favorite pilled, yarn-like shirt, then what you need to do is test an ""inconspicuous"" section of the shirt so that you don't show up to your date with the fabric looking ""teased."" The only thing that should look ""teased"" is your hair, amirite, ladies? (I kid... do not tease either your shirt or your hair, dear reader.)Finally, though we can't always get what we want, I wish this cute little sweater comb came in a cute little sack or case so that I could travel with it and de-pill things on the road, on the plane, in all the hotels of my life. I travel a lot for work and I also create a whole lotta pills. That's the only flaw I can think of. Otherwise, this is an awesome product. Don't let this be the ""sweater stone"" that got away six years ago...(Written by Woody's wife; Woody doesn't know why a sweater would need to be combed or, heaven forbid, teased)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P91OZ19KB47G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X329O2#wasThisHelpful","R3P91OZ19KB47G","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that there's going to be some bathroom TMI in here, but if you're reading reviews for Metamucil, I'm going to assume that you're kind of okay with some TMI.  In any case, I will tone down the gross factor as much as I can.First, here are the positives of this product:(1) It's smooth and not gritty at all, and has no taste that I can detect.  I can't taste it when I've mixed it into even a thin beverage like water or apple juice.(2) It dissolves fairly easily. Usually it dissolves really easily, though occasionally, little intractable clumps get left behind on the spoon or in the bottom of the glass.(3) It hasn't made me any more constipated. Not that I would expect fiber to do that, but I'm trying to be as positive as I can about this product before I launch into the section below on ""why I'm already searching for a new fiber product.""Next, here's why I'm already searching for a new fiber product (this is in ascending order of importance to me):(1) It honestly doesn't do as much as I thought it would. I am taking the recommended daily amount (3 teaspoons, or 15 grams), and despite having stuck with it for a while, I haven't seen a noticeable change in my stool habits. I've gone from 4-5 bowel movements a week to... 4-5 bowel movements a week.(2) Here's the real kicker. The only real change I've noticed in my stool habits with this product is that everyone around me is mortified, including me. Because the product is made with inulin (which is derived from chicory root), it gives me gas like you wouldn't believe. (Maybe chicory root won't give you gas, but it has always given me terrible gas--e.g. Fiber One bars, which are made with chicory root, tear my stomach apart.) I know that some people have gas regularly; I'm not one of those people--or, at least, I wasn't until I started using this product. I went from an average of 0.5 farts per day (confirmed by my wife) to an unbelievable, unacceptable level of farts per hour (which I will abbreviate as FPH). I estimate the FPH at a whopping 15. At first, I was taking the bulk of the dose before bed, which caused an estimated 120 farts per night (15 FPH x 8 hours of sleep). My wife was horrified. She convinced me to switch the bulk of my dose to the morning, which has caused me to go the bathroom at work to have gas multiple times per hour. This has had a three-fold effect of (a) decreasing my work productivity; (b) raising coworkers' eyebrows; and (c) forcing me to be creative in finding new routes to the bathrooms and new bathrooms (on a positive note, I have discovered new bathrooms throughout my place of work). Of note, the gas is not productive in the least--in other words, as I mentioned above, I'm not making any more stools; rather, my stomach is just being torn up (even when I just take one or two teaspoons per day instead of three). It's highly uncomfortable and highly embarassing personally (if I take most of the dose before bed) and professionally (if I take most of the dose before work). Further, no matter when I've taken the dose, the FPH last all 24 hours of the day (though they are strongest in the 8-10 hours or so after I've taken a dose).Although brevity may be the soul of wit, I certainly haven't been able to keep my wits about me with all of the FPH going on with this product. So, to sum it up, you may have a different experience with it, but (1) chicory root has never sat well with me, and it's no different with this product; and, most importantly, (2) it's not helping my bowel issues at all. I remain on the hunt for a fiber product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLKFMU46DFMF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EP3IEA#wasThisHelpful","RLKFMU46DFMF2","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our young'un could not get the hang of regular sippy cups (the kind with the no-leak valves).  We just kept buying different brands and offering them to him as if that would make a difference.  My wife and I tried sucking on them to make sure nothing was stuck or that they weren't too hard to suck on, but that wasn't the problem: they were pretty easy to get liquid out of if you have a moderate ability to suck.  But, for some reason, our son couldn't get the liquid out.  We realize that part of the issue may be that our little one isn't adept at tilting while sipping, and maybe that's what you have to do with a regular sippy cup (but don't quote me on that).In any case, while exchanging dad war stories at work one day (his involved something cool; mine involved sippy cup woes), a coworker nonchalantly said ""you need a straw sippy,"" as if it was the most obvious thing.  When I got home, I read that straw sippies often work better for the young'uns because the straw resembles a nipple.  Well, wouldn't you know, when we ordered these straw sippies, our son chewed on the straw instead of sucking on it.  This persisted for a couple of days until it finally just clicked.  He now sips his young'un beverages all by himself!  It's a miracle (for us, at least). What I've now learned is that it's maybe not an actual miracle but the fact that these straw sippies have a different mechanism to prevent spills--a lock mechanism instead of a no-leak valve.  For us, that has made all the difference. Also, with the straw sippy, he doesn't have to tilt the cup; he can hold it below him just like you would with any straw-containing beverage and the liquid comes out fine.One caveat: do make sure that you twist the straw sippy lid on perfectly (even if you hear it click), or else the cup is prone to leaking.So, to sum it up, if your child is deficient at the whole regular sippy cup thing, don't throw in the towel just yet!  And if you order these straw sippies and they don't work out right away, give it a little time.  For us, it took a couple of days until our young'un finally ""got it.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EEYCAMP16J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006V84ME0#wasThisHelpful","R7EEYCAMP16J","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We usually exhaustively research baby socks, perhaps because our family pet likes to carry them away if he finds a stray sock, so we like to make sure any socks will stay on our son's feet.  This time, however, we bought these on a whim and couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  Here's why:(1) The socks pretty much stay on!  That's always the million dollar question with baby socks.  We've lost an average of two socks per week, which we consider much better than the typical baby sock (which, for us, averages a lost sock every ten minutes or so).(2) The band around the ankle isn't too restrictive.  We've found so many baby socks that cut off circulation around the ankle, leaving marks on our son's ankles.  This isn't the case with these socks.  The tradeoff is that, as mentioned, we have lost an average of two socks per week.  We are okay with that tradeoff.(3) The thickness is perfect--not too thick and not too thin.  It's obviously the summertime right now, so we wanted a material that would give him some protection and warmth but not too much.(4) We also like how low they are on the ankle.  With all of the other awkwardness in our lives, at least we don't have to worry about the awkwardness of a farmer's tan on our son's legs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVNHR5I88514O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G7JVZ6#wasThisHelpful","RVNHR5I88514O","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a mostly love and a little bit of hate relationship with our Dionos.  We're not the most patient people, but we've finally put a little muscle into these seats and we've come to love them.  If you can stick with these seats, I think you'll find, like we do, that they're a great investment.  But, I'll also tell you why they will make you cry at times. If you can bear with this lengthy review, I will let you in on the secrets of the awe-inspiring and tear-inducing Radian.Why we love these seats (we own two, one for each car):(1) The Radian is a tank. To my knowledge, it is one of only two seats on the market that is fully steel-framed. The Clek Foonf is the other one, which is unpronounceable, more expensive, and doesn't last as long: your child has to be able to sit upright before using it and it only lasts until the child is 65 pounds. At the rate my child eats, he will be 65 pounds by a year-and-a-half, which would be not long after he started sitting up. Now, with the Radian, although all car seats have to meet government safety standards (quite easy to forget in the guilt/hype advertising of buying baby products), we feel a great sense of peace and security when going on long car trips with it.(2) The Radian is narrow and therefore still lets you have some of your backseat. When my wife and I were young and nave (approximately 1 1/2 years ago, while expecting our aforementioned first child), we thought we would have three children, or we at least didn't want to have to re-buy car seats because of that possibility.  So, we initially gravitated toward the Radian because it's a super narrow seat and allegedly fits three across the backseat of cars. Well, now that the shock of having a toddler is with us, I can assure you that my wife and I have not measured or tested whether three Radians can fit across our backseats, nor do we plan on testing that out. But, if you are blessed with more baby-patience than we are and plan to have lots of young'uns, then you will probably like this feature of the Radian. In any case, the narrowness of the seat is nice when I'm schlepping my coworkers to Denny's for lunch and two of them can fit in the back of my tiny sedan with no problem.(3) The Radian's dimensions are compact, but if they don't make sense for your car, buy an angle adjuster. Speaking of my tiny sedan, the Radian probably will fit in your car. Before we bought our Radians, we read about people fitting these in Honda Accords and Honda Fits all day long. So unless you're driving a Pinto, I would think you'd be able to get the Radian installed. But, with that being said, the fit isn't necessarily going to be perfect (especially because the seat is so tall). Although the Radian fits perfectly into my small, older sedan, it was a mess at first in my wife's larger sedan. So, we researched and bought the $10 ""angle adjuster"" on Amazon that Radian makes, and that solved the problem. Just that inch of foam somehow made a huge difference, such that without the angle adjuster she couldn't see out the rearview mirror, and with the angle adjuster she can barely see that the Radian is even there. Her cousin also had fit problems (even with a mid-sized SUV) until she bought the angle adjuster, though her cousin had to end up installing the seat behind the passenger side instead of in the middle. So, to make a long story short, the fit of the Radian may not be perfect for your car, but you can likely rig it with the angle adjuster to make it work. In any case, I would definitely recommend choosing the shipping option that also offers free returns. I remember seeing that some colors would ship with free returns (I'm not sure if that's a Prime-specific thing or a seller-specific thing or what).(4) The Radian has high weight limits for rear-facing (45 pounds), which is important to us, so we can have our young'un rear-facing for as long as possible. This is higher than some other seats we were considering.Why we used to curse these seats (but we're over it now, we promise):(1) We bought these seats with the idea that this would be the only seat we'd have to buy for our young'un, because it's supposed to go from newborn in rear-facing mode to 120 pounds in booster mode. He was born a hearty size, not preemie but not humongous, yet the angle was so steep that he would have probably been taken away by CPS right then and there at the hospital if we had tried to drive him away like that--seriously, it was more like a 75 degree angle, not the desired 45 degree angle; he would have looked like Hannibal Lecter strapped to the almost-upright gurney in Silence of the Lambs. Maybe it was the slope of our sedans' back seats, and maybe you'll have better luck in your car, but we had to buy a Graco bucket seat (with two bases) that we used for the first several months. So, we weren't happy about spending the extra money on another seat, but in the long run, it didn't turn out to be too much money and it was convenient to be able to carry our infant in a bucket seat.(2) It took an act of Congress and many test runs with a very upset little boy for us to figure out how to tighten the straps properly. We find this to be a major downside to this seat, or at least a major frustration. The instructions are complicated and the seat is not intuitive at all. You can google it, and terms like ""ratchet"" and ""tug tug tug"" will pop up, and to us, that didn't help at all. Basically, what we learned is that there's a little metal bar at the bottom middle of the seat (almost at the base of the seat, in the front). It's a metal clip that resembles an airplane seat belt clip. To tighten the straps, you have to pull up on the metal bar/clip with one hand and pull on that section of the strap, while at the same time putting your other hand behind the car seat where the ""slack"" in the straps is and using that hand to pull the straps as tight as you need them. Some people say it helps to do this while having only the chest clip strapped; we found this to be true. Two things to note about this: you usually have to adjust the straps every time you get in the car, and the metal clip, at least in our cars, is wedged between the car seat and the backseat. So although we have figured out how to tighten the straps, the Radian is not known for being the most user-friendly car seat.(3) Finally, we won't talk about the long nights that my wife made me install the seats. We just won't. My only advice on that is to watch the video instructions that come with the instruction booklet (through the QR reader on your smartphone), google, google, google, and beer, beer, beer. Then, once you think you have it installed, definitely don't forget to have a local fireman (or two or three) check your work.Basically, the Radian makes you feel like it's possible to get close to being Parent of the Year for buying a steel-framed car seat, until you realize that you have no idea to use it. And then slowly, you learn how to use it, and then you feel kind of awesome again.********************************UPDATED JUNE 2015 after traveling with the Radian on six airplane legs with one rambunctious toddler:I recently traveled on six flights with the Radian and wanted to update my review to offer some observations and tips about flying with it. For starters, I had no idea what to expect and the whole idea of hauling the carseat around the airport and installing it in the plane was previously daunting, but it was actually a relative breeze. This section is lengthy, so read this only if youre planning on using the Radian for an airplane trip; otherwise, youll gouge your eyes out from boredom.PRE-TRIP:1) I highly, highly recommend buying two straps to attach to the back of the seat so that you can carry it through the airport like a backpack. On the back of the Radian, there are three hooks at the top and two at the bottom, so you'll want to choose the inner two hooks on the top so that the straps are symmetrical; ignore the random hook on the left outer side. The hooks from top to bottom are 19 inches apart so you'll need straps that are at least a little bit longer than that. We had much success with a set of Nylon Backpack Straps (abrasion resistant 400D diamond grid ripstop nylon straps) from Amazon (under $10 for a set of two straps). After researching straps for about an hour,  including Dionos straps, and realizing that we were not about to carry the 400-pound Radian and our sizable toddler through several airports if the straps broke, we decided to go with the Nylon Backpack Straps because of what we read about some peoples Diono brand straps breaking unexpectedly.2) Once you get the straps, plan your other luggage accordingly. The womans smile on the Radian brochure must be photoshopped, because it's not a fun experience to carry the Radian, but with two straps, its bearable. My wife, who is fairly tall and strong, carried the seat like a backpack for just one of our legs, and her shoulders were mildly sore, but nothing too bad. Mine were not sore after carrying the carseat for the other legs of our trip. But its still a heavy and unwieldy carseat, even as a backpack, so I would recommend as little carry-on luggage as possible, and for what you must carry on, wheels and/or backpack straps are a good idea. (This was especially true for my wife, who now can only carry my son on her hip because he's now about 1/3 of her weight and half her height. Side-hip toddler carrying is an impossibility when carrying the Radian as a backpack.) For our first trip (4 legs), we had two very large tote bags as our carry-ons and that did not make things easy. For our second trip (2 legs), we checked everything but the kitchen sink/my wife's purse, so that made things much easier.3) Find your Radian manual and read about how to fold the carseat. Its extremely easy after youve done it once, so that's why a practice run is a good idea. We have two Radians, so we just took one out of the car we werent driving to the airport, and folded up this one. If you can't practice on your Radian beforehand, know these things:(a) You'll need to get on your knees on the ground to fold up this sucker, so plan your outfit accordingly. (I did not do this. To the skycaps who got a show, I apologize.)(b) The most important thing is to fish out the little red strap with white Velcro. This is located between the chest straps and is accessible through the little slots of fabric. This red strap is what folds over onto itself to keep your Radian folded up while your carry it. Once you fold the Radian (also a bit trickyyou have to push down on two small red levers located on the bottom, back side of the seat), thread the red Velcro strap through the bar underneath the seat, and attach the red Velcro strap back onto itself. This is explained in the manual except the red Velcro strap part was very hard to see on the manual's picture. The first photo I have attached shows the red Velcro strap undone, and the second photo shows the red Velcro strap holding the Radian folded into place (and the third photo is the same as the second but with the entire folded Radian in view).(c) Consider bringing a few rubber bands to tie together all the random straps that are in the back of the seat. No big deal if you don't bring them, but you'll have lots of straps hitting you and possibly dragging on the ground and generally causing mayhem.BOARDING THE PLANE:1) Of course, if you can and want to, board during ""pre-board.""  This is for passengers who need additional assistance or who are traveling with small children--usually additional assistance comes first and then small children, but some airlines lump them together.  In any case, this occurs before even the million milers can board, so you'll have plenty of needed time to get situated and get the carseat installed.2) As soon as you get on the plane, find the first friendly looking flight attendant and ask for a seatbelt extender. You'll need this whether you're installing forward-facing or rear-facing.  Also: clarify with the flight attendant that its for the carseat, unless you want him or her to stare you up and down to decide whether you need a seatbelt extender.A note on traveling with the Radian but doing infant-in-arms: if you did not purchase an airplane seat for your child but are traveling with the Radian, it DOES fit in the overhead bins and would even have enough room on the top of the seat for any small luggage. I read online that in order for this to work--being allowed to put the Radian in the overhead bin instead of gate-checking it--you need to follow the high school locker room rule: keep your eyes down. Quickly and calmly heave the Radian into the overhead bin and then sit down in your seat and keep your mouth shut. I did this on one leg of our second trip with the young'un and there were no problems. I felt okay with using the overhead bin space because that was my only ""carry on"" item and it's about the size of a big rollerboard; my wife had only a small under-seat carry-on--her purse. Also, I've read that gate-checking is probably fine, but I personally don't like that you can't see if the luggage handlers throw (or accidentally drop) the carseat; if that were to happen, I always worry that this could cause damage or render the seat unsafe or unusable. Finally, and importantly, bringing the carseat as a ""carry on"" instead of gate-checking it also creates the possibility that for those of you flying with an under-2-year-old, you can use the seat if there ends up being an open seat. Now, we know this almost never happens on oversold airplanes these days, so if you want to have even a remote chance of this happening (it happened to us on one of our legs!), book the window and aisle seats of a three-across section as close to the back of the plane as possible.  This is because the middle seats in the back of the plane tend to fill up last. Then, when you're at the airport, kindly ask a gate agent if the middle seat can be ""blocked"" out for you--it will be filled if needed, but it will be the LAST seat to be filled.REAR-FACING OR FORWARD-FACING?We did both. We really liked with forward-facing that the seat had a good angle relative to the bottom seat cushion, and that our youngun had lots of room for his legs. He had plenty of room in economy comfort on two of the legs of our first trip (which we splurged on because we wanted to be sure we had enough room for the seat). On the downside, on the trip legs that were NOT economy comfort, forward-facing allowed our youngun to kick the seat in front of him, and he's too young to understand the ""golden rule,"" so we flipped him to rear-facing for those segments.With rear-facing, the obvious disadvantage is that the carseat is bracing up against the seat in front of it--see fourth photo. This was the case on our first trip, but oddly on our second trip (same airline and same aircraft), the carseat just grazed the seat in front of it but didn't press against it. In either case, however, the close distance between the Radian and the seat in front of the Radian means that the person's movement will move the carseat, and possibly wake your child during a nap. It also means the person cant recline the seat. We have read online some horror stories about people being angry that they cant recline their seat, and we decided that if the person in front of us said anything pre-flight, we would offer to turn the seat to forward-facing but mention that there might be some kicking that we arent able to control well. Fortunately, we got kids in front of our son those times, and they never even tried to recline their seat. The rear-facing angle is also very upright. (The fourth photo also shows the angle of the Radian in rear-facing mode.) Therefore, I'm not sure how well a very young infant would fare in a Radian in coach (whether rear-facing or forward-facing), due to the fairly steep upright angle of the seat.INSTALLATION:1) IT FIT. The Radian easily fit both forward-facing and rear-facing, and we were even able to have the armrest down. I feared we would have to gate-check it, but thanks to the Radians narrow frame, we had no problems there.2) Installation (both forward-facing and rear-facing) was surprisingly simple and quick. After you have the seat belt extender attached, thread the seat belt through while your knee is on the seat (in order to get the most leverage and tightest fit possible). If you have another adult with you, that person can wrangle your youngun in the aisle seat while you are working on the window seat with the carseat.3) We were never able to get a super tight fit, meaning the seat would move around a little if we pushed on it, but we felt that this was less important in an airplane than in a car.4) Un-installing the seat is equally easy. Lest we had to wait for the entire plane to deplane before we got off, we just used the time waiting at the gate before deplaning began to take our youngun out of the seat and into one parents arms while the other one of us undid the airplane seatbelt and folded up the carseat while the carseat rested in our lap.  Very quick and simple.  One time we didnt have enough time to fold up the carseat before we had to deplane, so I just carried it off the jetway and folded it on the floor of the terminal. It was heavy but definitely manageable for a short distance.One final tip: If your child is old enough to grip food and bring it to his mouth, I also highly recommend bringing along a Munchkin Click LockDeluxe Snack Catcher filled with your childs favorite snack, and then looping it around the harness with the Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy. This way, you wont be worried about a snack rolling down several rows while your child screams for his food.All in all, air travel with the Radian was pretty much a breeze. If you do nothing else, buy two shoulder straps to carry it and bring your Diono manual in case you need to refer to it while traveling (whether to fold the seat or install it into a rental car or an unfamiliar car). Safe travels!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWOIDD8ND3JOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MQRAAK#wasThisHelpful","RWOIDD8ND3JOX","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this mascara.  I've been using it for years with great results.Here's why I like it:-***I don't get puffy eyelids anymore, which used to be a consistent problem (!)***-It doesn't irritate my eyes or underneath my eyelids (which is where most mascaras used to irritate), which I attribute to its natural status, but who knows-It doesn't make my lashes clump-It makes my lashes look longer (they need all the help they can get), and if I apply it slowly and apply a couple of layers back to back after curling my lashes, this really helps my lashes look longer-It makes my lashes look thicker and darker (I always order the black color)-I always get a consistent application with itThe only downside is that it seems that the mascara doesn't last super long (I estimate 4-5 months of daily use).

"Now that I am the proud parent of a small child who requires a packhorse to travel with him for an hour-long outing, I knew that our planned trips to the beach and abroad would be nightmares.  Why?  Because I would have to do the thing I dread the most in life: check a bag.Once I accepted that the most efficient way for our family to travel would be to pack all of our family's clothes into one large, checked bag, I knew we would have to get the largest suitcase available while still keeping some ground rules.  Here's what we looked for, and what we found, in this Samsonite set:(1) The large suitcase is VERY spacious but is not ridiculously big.  Although I wish the large suitcase were more like 29"", the 27"" suitcase is still really spacious.  This is the only one we used for our beach trip, and we were easily able to fit all of our family's clothes for the beach into the suitcase (as well as souvenirs on the way home).  You don't want the large suitcase to be anything more than 29"" or 30"" or so, because then you get dangerously close to the oversized bag charges, and those sure are fun!(2) The large suitcase is light.  It's easy for my wife to carry.  My under-one child can't carry it yet, but he can push it across the floor with ease (when it's empty).  There are handles everywhere--on every single side of the suitcase, including a little portal on the bottom of the suitcase.(3) The small suitcase is 21"", which is well within any carry-on size limit I've ever seen on any airplane, but let me tell you: it is HUGE looking for a 21"" suitcase.  Pre-child, I regularly carried on a 25"" rollerboard (yes, I was that guy), but it fit every time and I would laugh at my wife's tiny looking 20"" or 21"" rollerboard.  Well, this 21"" is spacious.  Should I get the chance to fly solo again, literally and figuratively, I will be taking this little 21"" suitcase and it will be amazing how much I can fit into it.(4) Both suitcases, in addition to being spacious, are well laid out.  There are compartments galore: multiple pockets in the front, pockets on the inside rim, and pockets and dividers on the inside liner section.(5) Both suitcases are spinners!  I remember when Up in the Air came out in 2009 and George Clooney bragged about his perfect 22"" spinner suitcase and how it allowed him to speed through the security line.  Well, since that movie, it seems like everybody has a spinner.  I didn't get them, until I got these suitcases.  They are fantastic!  It makes such a huge difference in the maneuverability.  If you have a choice between a spinner and a non-spinner, get a spinner.(6) The suitcases are nice looking.  I have had what I consider some nice suitcases in my life, but never a giant suitcase, and so with so many suitcases in my house, I simply wasn't willing to spend a fortune on yet another suitcase.  These suitcases are good looking suitcases that probably any reasonable person would feel comfortable bringing on a business trip or anywhere else.  They don't stand out one way or the other.The only downside I can think of is that EVERYBODY at baggage claim had a black Samsonite, so that's something to consider.  My wife tugged at me to grab ""our bag"" about seven times before our actual bag actually came out.Finally, note that you may be able to find cheaper options elsewhere: I was *this close* to buying these on Amazon when I was in Costco and saw these on sale for $70 less--the exact same set.  Obviously, I chose to go the Costco route.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B32XSEW5SEVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F4KEV60#wasThisHelpful","R2B32XSEW5SEVN","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were pleasantly surprised to receive this juicer as a gift.  We've never juiced before, but we've been curious to ""juice"" due to too many of those tempting late-night infomercials about the ""bullet"" and other juicers or blenders.  We had fantasies of quickly whipping up healthful and tasty vegetable cocktails to sip on while our toddler quietly plays with his Legos in the other room and takes Lego breaks to sip up his own baby vegetable juice from a mini straw (I am not making this up).I can't blame the Big Boss Juicer for crushing our dreams, but things didn't go exactly as planned.  For starters, I didn't place the juice pitcher beneath the spout where the juice comes out, so that made a big mess.  Next, our son, who is not bipedal and does not yet speak English, did not understand what a straw was and therefore did not drink from the straw.  (He did, however, love the carrot-apple-spinach juice.)  Angered by the straw incident, he did not quietly play with his Legos in the other room and therefore my wife and I did not peacefully sip on our juice.  It was more like we shotgunned the glasses of juice.  Please learn from our failures.How the Big Boss made things easier in our time of tragedy:(1) It's powerful and massive.  It gets the job done.  I chucked some whole carrots in there and wham! bam! - those suckers were pulverized in just a few seconds. I didn't have to cut anything except for one apple that was a little too big to fit down the hatch.(2) It's compartmentalized into a helpful way: dry pulp on one size and juice on the other.  I hear that the dry pulp is tasty in sweet breads and other recipes, and the Big Boss handily sorts this out for you into a big, black container.(3) The food pusher (the tubular, black piece pictured at the top of the Big Boss) is instrumental in pushing stubborn food down into the juicer to meet its certain death.(4) From my limited knowledge of juicers, this price point ($99) is very good for such a powerful machine.Where the Big Boss made a grown man (me) cry a little bit inside:(1) It's gigantic.  Either we let this be another item on our precious counter space by pretending we are going to juice a lot, or we store this in the pantry and schlep it out when we want to use it; either way, it's annoying.(2) The cleaning is no joke.  I might be the laziest S.O.B. around when it comes to cleaning, but when one reviewer on here said ""clean or else you'll get ants (trust me),"" I listened up and scrubbed my Big Boss.  But do you know how long it took?  Seven minutes to wash all of the parts and pre-soak two of the parts that needed pre-soaking, then five more minutes to come back and scrub the two parts after they had been adequately soaked.  I did actually time it.  That's twelve (12) minutes of my life that I'll never get back, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.When you combine the time it takes the clean the Big Boss with the fail that was our first juicing experience, I can't say how often we'll be using this machine.  Don't get me wrong: it's a powerful machine and does a great job, producing delicious juices.  I just think that you need to evaluate what you are buying it for.  Do you have juicing fantasies brought on by late-night infomercials and a not-yet-bipedal child who is destined to splash carrot juice everywhere?  Or do you actually know what juicing is (unlike me) and would use this machine more than once per week?  If you answered yes to the latter, then, by all means, juice away!  I don't think you'll be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6F0FSF23NYGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLAOLBQ#wasThisHelpful","R6F0FSF23NYGE","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:01 MinsWe are loving these Waxman gripper pads.  We bought these once we discovered little pock marks all over our wood floors from the bottom of our chairs and couch.

"So, I foolishly didn't have a case on my Note 3 for the longest time, because I guess I didn't think that any case would work (the phone is already SO darn big, which you know if you own one or are considering owning one).  I kept the phone in my back pocket or wherever I thought the screen wouldn't get scratched.  Thankfully, before purchasing a case, the screen didn't get scratched, but my under-one-year-old son thought it would be a good idea to smash one of our household tablets to pieces (!).  We thanked him for picking our least favorite tablet, and considered it a wake-up call to baby-proof ALL of our electronics, including this massive Note 3.Enter the OtterBox Commuter Series.  I used to be an OtterBox Defender guy, back when I had an iPhone, but I just couldn't justify that larger size with the already huge Note 3 (how would I even be able to fit it into my pocket?).  Plus, the reviews of the Commuter were pretty great, so I bit the bullet.  Once the Commuter arrived, I was a bit disappointed that the instructions were a bit like Ikea furniture instructions (seriously--it took me a while to figure it out, but I'm also not that savvy with putting things together).  But 10 minutes later, the case was on.9/10 for looks and functionality of the case.  The case does not add much bulk at all to the Note 3 but it seems really sturdy.  The Commuter really seems to strike the balance of size and protection.  I also love that the rim of the case sits up about 1/3 centimeter from the top of the screen, so that I can put the phone face down and not worry about scratching the screen.  My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the back of the phone is quite slippery.  I wish there were a little more rubber on the back so that it would stay put on slippery surfaces (plane tray tables, car middle consoles).But, 3/10 for the screen protector that's included with this case.  Although it hasn't interfered with the functionality of the touch screen, it's quite flimsy, and mine has pockets of bubbles in it and bumps from my application of it.  Perhaps somebody else with a surgeon's steady hands could get it right the first time, but I couldn't.  They do include what looks like a small credit card in the package to smooth out the kinks, but not only did this not get rid of the bubbles, but it left little streaks on the screen protector.  Now when I look at my phone, you can't see any of the marks unless the screen is white, gray, or black (or off), but it looks pretty pock-marked and bad, so off shopping for a nicer screen protector I go.  So, this is something to keep in mind if you order this case.  I'm usually not picky about things like this, but the bubbles and marks on the screen really don't look so great on an otherwise great looking phone (plus, again, it's bumpy in parts when I scroll through pages).Despite the screen protector issue, I'd recommend this case in a heartbeat--as I said above, it's a great mix of size and protection for the Note 3.  Just be forewarned about the flimsy screen protector that comes included in the box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CR1UOU4CZEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9VRQ2K#wasThisHelpful","R3CR1UOU4CZEG","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After our son threw down one of our unprotected tablets in a fit of curiosity and shattered the entire screen, we realized, once again, that we apparently are terrible at the whole concept of ""babyproofing.""So I went off to research protectors for our other, unscathed tablets and our phones.  I initially was going to go with the otterbox for my ipad mini because that's the brand I knew of, and years ago when I had an iphone, that's the brand of case I had for my iphone, and it was built like a rock.  I also liked the stand that came with the case, for watching movies.  I was this close to buying that when I happened to read articles about tablet cases that are specifically built to protect tablets from young'uns' fierce ways.  Trident was one of the recommended brands.  I read lots of great reviews here for the Trident case, and was sold.Now that I've had the Trident for a while, I'm ready to say that I'm quite satisfied.  Once I had my ipad mini properly encased in the Trident, my son came over to inspect.  He whacked the corners of the ipad onto the carpet a couple of times (just a couple!), and I cried a little bit inside, but I knew that it would be okay based on the military tests from six feet with this product (as well as the other reviews here of what little hands have done to ipads protected in Trident cases).  I'm happy to say that the screen is not cracked, though I won't be letting my son perform that scientific field test again....Some other nice features are: (1) the side grippers (though these could be moved toward the front just a little more, or maybe that's just the way I hold my ipad); (2) the size (the case is STURDY but really doesn't seem to add too much bulk or weight to the mini); and (3) the price (a little less than what I felt were comparable cases).To sum it up: I'm really glad I found this brand.  It's a solid case and I'm now confident that a second household tablet won't also end up in tablet heaven.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O2D0GNJIZ9K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B014CF2#wasThisHelpful","R2O2D0GNJIZ9K8","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I haven't been feeding our under-one-year-old gluten (due to my wife's gluten issues): we want to have a baseline first to see what his reactions to different foods are.  The problem is that this makes his practice of his self-feeding and fine-motor skills quite difficult, as most finger foods contain wheat or are slippery (like fruit).We were on the fence about buying this product.  It's organic, which is great, and gluten free, which is obviously great for our situation, and it contains less sugar than other comparable brands.  But as we all know, this product really is just glorified rice puffs.Well, glorified rice puffs be darned, the boy loves them.  And they give him a much-needed opportunity to practice his self-feeding and fine-motor skills PLUS the huge added benefit of less mess.  Prior to this, pieces of banana were what he practiced on, but of course those stuck everywhere--to his face, to his clothes, to the high chair, to the floor, to the dog's fur, you name it.  We love that we don't have to monitor for choking hazards as carefully with these puffs as we would with something like Cheerios, because these puffs melt in the mouth (my wife and I may have sampled one or two of these...).  Also, these puffs have given us parents a nice break from spoon-feeding for a few moments while he learns to feed himself.  Just this evening when company dropped by, he entertained himself by picking at a dozen of these puffs.  (Sure, it took him approximately 22 minutes to eat the 12 puffs, and our friends wondered what was taking him so long, but it bought us some much needed catch-up socializing time with our friends.)Although we don't plan to give him these puffs often--we bought them primarily for road trips and social outings--we think he'll survive, despite the debatable nutritional content.  Plus, everybody in the household stays sane, which is important, too.  In sum, the whole family is happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZJXZY128JA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SBU2CO#wasThisHelpful","R1YZJXZY128JA2","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are beautiful blocks: they are colorful, with interesting detail.  Each six-sided block has four letters (two of which are embossed, two of which are flat), one number, and one animal (with a picture of the animal and a description underneath the animal stating what the animal is).Our son has immensely enjoyed playing with these blocks.  He enjoys stacking them up, knocking them down, and clacking them together.  The blocks make a fantastic sound when clacked together.  We've also successfully been able to get his attention or turn his sour mood into a good mood by clacking the blocks together a few times.The fact that our son enjoys playing with these blocks is really just a bonus: in reality, we initially bought these blocks only to take ""documentary"" photos of him every month (e.g. stacking up the blocks to say ""THREE MONTHS"").  These blocks have been a cornerstone to these monthly photographs--in particular, the embossed letters really add a lot to the pictures and make everything look great.  We wanted to do something more than just writing his age on paper, but we aren't crafty enough to do some of the really cool ways people do monthly photos that you can find on Pinterest or other craft sites.  We've seen the cool pictures of the ""age blocks"" (the three blocks--one giant block that says MONTHS and sits on the bottom of two smaller blocks that have the different numbers you can rotate for the months), but those are more expensive and single-purpose, whereas these blocks have allowed our son countless hours of playtime outside of his monthly photos.We've discovered only a small downside to these blocks.  As our son is fond of gnawing on most everything, I wasn't surprised to find him gnawing on one of these blocks a few weeks ago.  However, I was surprised to find that after just 15-20 seconds of his gnawing on the block, the embossed border on the side of the block was already splintered off.  In other words, the wood is pretty soft.  I don't feel that it's fair to remove stars for this, because this product is intended for ages two and up, so just be aware of this if your child is ""orally fixated"" like ours is.  Now that we know this about these blocks, our son's chewing experience with the block was his first and last time.In sum, these are beautiful blocks that have added much joy to our son's play time and have added a lot to our monthly photos of our son.  We are really happy with our purchase of these, even if they require additional supervision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEOPBQWL98IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BW51UQ#wasThisHelpful","R3KEOPBQWL98IE","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love these pajamas.  First, they are incredibly soft.  The back of the truck design would be rough, but they've put in a soft patch to cover it up.Second, the PJs themselves have a really cute design.  We often have a hard time finding clothes that aren't overrun with slogans on them and tons of busy patterns, so we really like that these PJs are a little more subdued than what we can usually find in the stores.This is our second Leveret pajama order.  Our other order was the turtle PJ set.  That set is really cute, too, but definitely not as soft, and the material is thinner on that.

"In my opinion, this book is greatly improved over the original book, and heres why:(1) Keirsey provides a helpful framework to understand potential sources of friction in relationships: he proposes that NTs and SJs are opposites, and SPs and NFs are opposites (he calls them ""mirror images,"" and he has tweaked these mirror opposite combinations since the original Please Understand Me).  This was incredibly helpful to me, because I bought to book to help beef up my understanding of MBTI types.  Even though I already had the original Please Understand Me, I was having trouble with a person who was like oil to my water; I couldnt figure him out but I knew that some others didnt have problems clicking with him.Armed with all of my mirror images possible temperaments (there were only a couple), I read through the descriptions until I settled on a description of a person that was as if it was written by Keirsey describing the person I was  having trouble with.  I was so pleasantly shocked that I have now figured out this guy, which I had not been able to do with the original Please Understand Me, and not even with the first book's description of that same temperament because that description wasn't nearly as detailed or helpful. It almost skimmed the surface. This updated book has cleaner, fresher examples, and they resonated with me so much more.How does it help me to use this book to find out other people's MBTI profiles? Well, before I read this book, I thought the guy I didnt click with seriously could be just plain out of his mind, but now that I see how he thinks and what makes him tick, I TOTALLY understand why he acts in certain ways. So, now that I'm armed with this information, I have already been able to build bridges instead of, every day, wonder ""dude, WTF is wrong with you?"" Because that latter approach previously hadnt been working for me...(2) Theres much more meat to the analysis of each type, which is great.  The analysis goes into more depth about work and home, and provides illustrations to show how the type compares to other types.  I do wish, however, that there was a bit more constructive criticism (when warranted)for instance, how a persons personality traits come off at times in a not-so-positive way and how a person could consider tweaking these behaviors from time to time.  I noticed Keirsey does this in some places for some types but not as much (or at all) for other types.(3) On the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II, as with the Keirsey Temperament Sorter I (this is where you determine your type preference), there are still 70 questions (10 for introvert/extravert (I/E), 20 for sensing/intuition (S/N), 20 for thinking/feeling (T/F), and 10 for judging/perceiving (J/P)).  However, for the S/N, T/F, and J/P questions, I found the questions on the Sorter II to be more nuanced than the Sorter I.  Not only were they more nuanced, but in many cases I couldnt even figure out which category the question was going for, which I think is great (you never want to be able to game the test).However, and this is a big however, the I/E questions on the Sorter II seem to have been revised to more simplicity.  For instance: several of the 10 I/E questions ask things like waiting in line, do you often chat with others or stick to business? and are you the kind of person who is rather talkative or doesnt miss much? and at work do you tend to be sociable with your colleagues or keep more to yourself? The Sorter I questions, on the other hand, have more questions that get at whether one derives his energy from others or is sapped by others.  An example of an I/E question on the Sorter I: At a party, do you stay late with increased energy or leave early with decreased energy?  In fact, I got a completely different result from the Sorter II for Introvert/Extravert, then retook the test with the Sorter I, and got the opposite result (7 points v. 3 points both times, but in opposite directions).To sum it up:(1) If you already have the original Please Understand Me, theres no need to buy this one unless you have some curiosities (like I did), in which case you will be very pleasantly surprised.(2) If you do not already have either of the Please Understand Me books, buy Please Understand Me II, but just know that the Keirsey Temperament Sorter may not pin you down for extraversion v. introversion.  You may want to take the official test for that or just keep in mind the differences in some of the questions, some of which I discussed above (that the first test focuses more on the energy felt from others by extroverts).Why buy this book at all?  Because until everybody is forced to wear his or her MBTI preference on a little nametag, this book is the next best thing to trying to figure out how to make peace with the very different people in your lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FH3DMLQHNG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1885705026#wasThisHelpful","R11FH3DMLQHNG6","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Listen up, guys, I thought I knew it all about underarm products.  I was and still am a Certain Dri devotee.  Because of Certain Dri P.M., which I put on almost every night, I haven't sweat under my pits since Britney's Toxic album was big.  So I thought I was doing great in that department.BUT, and this is a big but, I try to be very careful about suit jackets (and any nice shirts, like silk shirts)--especially suit jackets--when I am wearing them close-fitted for all-day on the job or an all-day event, and then turning around the next day for another all-day event with no time in between for dry cleaning.  I find that even doing this once--even with the protection of Certain Dri and my men's strength Arm and Hammer deodorant--will leave a funky smell on the suit armpits.  It's not a BO smell, but more like a musty smell.  And I find that the smell NEVER GOES AWAY, no matter how many times you dry clean the suit.Enter these ""ready shields"" from Kleinert's.  So, at first I had my doubts.  The average review was 3 stars when I decided to buy these.  I decided to take the plunge because I just bought a couple of new suits and I really did not want to ruin yet another couple of suit jackets.  I am SO glad that I got these.  I wore them two days in a row, all day, and both suits, my silk shirt, and a cotton shirt smell just like they did after I picked them up from the dry cleaner.  I could not be happier.  I then laundered the pads just to make sure to keep them clean (and for another suit-wearing experience tomorrow), and they laundered well.Now, these things don't change my star rating, because this product is awesome, but there are a few things I think you should know about:1 - The product packaging was designed by Don Draper.  Seriously, it's from the '60s and consequently hasn't been updated to have any sort of useful information to me.  It simply tells you to ""place shield in armhole with cotton ply against the body"" (the shield has two sides, one of which is more of a matted material; one of which is more of a shiny material, and I still have no idea which is the cotton ply side).  I googled and googled and watched a bunch of Kleinert's videos with some very nice ladies in them, but it still didn't tell me which side is cotton ply.  I'm guessing it's the matted side, so this is the side I've been putting closest to my body.  The packaging also just discusses how to sew in the product to your clothes and states that Kleinert's also has a snap product available (though this product is a snap product) - so, it's all a little confusing, but once you take it out of the package, it's really a snap (pun intended!) to put on: you just put the pad in your armpit, tuck your arm down to hold it into place, then loop both of the snaps around your bra (one snap around the front bra strap, and the other snap around the top bra snap).  You can even leave the pad and snaps in place when you take your bra off to save time getting dressed.2 - Wearing the product can take a little getting used to.  First, I feel like a bird flapping with wings when I wear them (though you can't see them under long-sleeved shirts).  Sometimes you have to tug at the top strap a little bit because sometimes the top strap will fall down your arm a little bit.  This doesn't really bother me because I have this product for use under suits.  However, I could see this being more of a problem if you were going to use this product for short-sleeves, though perhaps it's easily fixable by affixing the strap to your bra strap with a safety pin.I'm so happy I found these little suckers, even if I feel odd wearing them.(Woody's wife wrote the following review; Woody does not wear bras)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PP9GF1S19KES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LY5QNM#wasThisHelpful","R1PP9GF1S19KES","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, these sheets worked okay.  I liked that I could wear them in the shower and that they offered great protection for my scar.  I also liked that they stayed on for a few days.  My scar started to look smoother and softer after just a few uses.However, the instructions say that you can wash the sheets and reuse them (this also gives your skin much needed time to air out each day).  I did this carefully several times, but I was never able to reuse them successfully: the sheets would curl up and look dirty from things sticking to the adhesive.  And even when I decided not to take off a sheet for a couple of days, the sheet would start to curl up and fall off anyway.When I finally got frustrated with how often these sheets were falling off, I happened upon Neosporin Scar Solution.  These are great.  They stay on for 6-7 days at a time and I only take them off because the edges start to look a little dirty.  My scar looks smoother and softer (though it did with ScarAway).  I haven't tried to wash them and reuse them because every time I look into the package, there's another sheet.  It says it's a 12 week supply, but I've been using it since mid-January and I still have several left in the box.

"My wife and I big Mineral Fusion fans, and this product is no exception.Here's why we love this product:(1) It's the BEST product that we've been able to find for our skin.  We play a lot of tennis, which means we need to put on sunblock on our faces all the time, or else we'll get scorched.  If we put on regular sunblock, or even oil free sunblock, it wreaks havoc on our skin.(2) Related to point #1 above, this product is gluten free.  Though there is a debate in the gluten-free community as to whether this matters, my wife cannot eat gluten and therefore prefers not to put gluten-containing products on her skin (and notices that her skin is less itchy and bumpy when she avoids gluten-containing products).(3) Because the product is a mineral powder that is applied with a brush, you don't have to touch any sticky sunblock.  Enough said on this point.(4) Because this is a specialty item, it's not something we can find at our destination when we're traveling, so I'm always happy when a product can fit into our carry-on luggage.  I love that this is a sunblock but isn't subject to TSA's 3-ounce liquid rule.  Along these same lines, it's also a really easy product to carry in your purse, bag, etc.Here are some things you should know, though:(1) The product is not meant for heavy coverage.  You'll want to reapply very often.  Even when reapplying very often, you'll still get some sun (though not a burn, in my experience, and I have somewhat fair skin).(2) If you plan on using this product a fair amount, it doesn't last very long.  When I'm playing a competitive tennis season, plus practices (~20 uses), the bottle is nearly gone, and I only use it on my face and shoulders.  This is always a little frustrating because the product is relatively expensive.  However, given the benefits of the product, and how it doesn't mess up my skin, I can live with this (I just wish it lasted longer and/or were cheaper).(3) The brush is not the best quality.  Not only is it rough and feels scratchy when you apply it to your face, but it often leaves bristles behind on your face and body.(4) The product is a little drying.  This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it's one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.(5) Using the product can be hard to get the hang of at first.  You have to turn the bottle over and shake it vigorously and even tap it on a surface if necessary, and then apply it.  If you don't see beige powder emerging through the bristles, then nothing is coming out.(6) People will look at you like you're crazy when you apply this product.  At tennis matches, my wife always feels like she has to make the disclaimer: ""this isn't powder! I'm not putting on makeup!""In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q57P3ZD1JAKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WQWJES#wasThisHelpful","R3Q57P3ZD1JAKU","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She also loves that you can't see through the pants like every other type of spandex pants she has.  The material is thick and the compression is good.She far prefers using these in her walking workouts compared to her pilates and yoga workouts because they are a little stiff/constricting when she bends and the fabric is a little slick, making her moves uncoordinated.She says she's still on the hunt for a pant that will make her butt look even better, and one whose fabric won't be so slick and stiff so that she can use it for all workouts.

"Our previous household pillow situation was pretty bleak.  We had only (1) hand-me-down goose down pillows from my in-laws, circa 1977, that had about five feathers left in them, or (2) cheapo pillows that felt like they were stuffed with cotton balls.  Both options were flimsy and left my body (particularly my neck) in pain.Therefore, it was no surprise that I woke up every morning with a huge crick in my neck.  After I bought this pillow, the pain went away after about a week.  It has not returned since.My wife then started trying to steal my pillow, so we bought one for her.  She never had the neck pain that I had, but she reports sleeping better and moving around less in her sleep (and I can confirm that she sleeps like a rock now).The memory foam is awesome.  The pillow has kept its shape for a long time now, and the cooling effect of the pillow is a great feature.  We no longer have to worry about flipping the pillow because the pillow stays cool.The only thing we both would change about this pillow is that its just a smidge thicker that we would like.  It always feels a little high upon trying to fall asleep.  So, if we could change it, we would make it one 1/2 inch to an inch shorter, but this is minor.

"We've been hosting gluten free holidays these days and have been trying to make gluten free recipes that taste as close to the real thing as possible.  This is *especially* hard with stuffing: it's pretty easy for people to sniff out a fake stuffing, given that bread plays such a prominent role.For the first such holiday, my wife and I were up for a challenge: we chose to make a somewhat difficult stuffing recipe, Emeril Lagasse's Savory Spinach and Artichoke Stuffing, even though we had never made stuffing before, and gluten free to boot.  We knew that we needed to choose a very soft bread (which many gluten free breads are not).These Udi's baguettes were perfect for the job.  They were soft, and ended up retaining the right amount of softness even after leaving them out for a few days for the recipe.  The stuffing turned out perfectly.  We've ended up making this recipe many times since, and we wouldn't consider making it with anything else other than these baguettes.Of note: it has been very hard to find these baguettes in our local stores--even at Whole Foods and even at our specialty mom and pop health foods store that carries a wide selection of gluten free foods and used to carry these baguettes.  Even if you can find these baguettes locally in the freezer section, I would recommend buying these fresh because the bread will be softer this way and will taste better in your recipes.

I wasn't thrilled, but I knew from research that (1) other, less expensive steamers didn't work at all, and (2) more expensive steamers might do a better job, but we weren't in the position to spend several hundred dollars on a steamer.I am disappointed to say that now the steamer doesn't work at all.  It turns on, it makes noise as if it's going to put out some steam, but it doesn't do anything at all.  I have cleaned out the reservoir and the tubing, but this hasn't made a difference whatsoever.  Now that the steamer is out of warranty--after very little time has passed--we are stuck with an expensive, worthless steamer.  This happened after approximately 25 mediocre uses--mediocre in that the steam function lasted only for 1-2 minutes per steaming session.My regret is that I ignored the strong warnings on here before I ordered this steamer and listened only to the glowing reviews.  I, unfortunately, now find myself in the camp of those who must try to steer you away from this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYIU3KUPCMCU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B8KGN6#wasThisHelpful","RYIU3KUPCMCU1","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll never forget the day I thought I was doing a good husbandly deed by taking my wife to a birthday weekend at the spa.  Everything seemed like a good idea upon booking the trip, during the trip, and all the way up until my wife went to her last class: a pilates reformer class.  At the time of her class, I was sunning at the pool (not particularly wanting to work out my muscles).  When she exited her class 90 minutes later, she was beaming.She described being reformed by a pilates reformer.  She described hanging nearly upside-down on the ""Cadillac of reformers.""  She described feeling much more toned--just after that one workout--and feeling refreshed.  But I'm no fool.  I saw the look on her face.  She wanted one at home, given that running had been giving her some trouble those days.  The price tag for one of those things?  Oh, you know, just $5-10k.So we both researched what types of machines might be even remotely affordable; might fit into our home; and might come close to offering a true pilates reformer workout.  Fortunately, we found this machine, and at a fraction of the cost of the ""Cadillac"" reformer, and it has all of the qualities we were looking for--and more (e.g. the ""total gym"" elements like a fixed pulling bar).  It's such a nifty machine that I've started doing my workouts there and now we have fights over who gets to use the machine.As for the pilates-specific features, the machine offers tons of different exercises, and a DVD to show you various types of workouts.  My wife actually has been able to wing several of the workouts just from her one pilates class, and I've been able to do the same just from watching her (or quick searches on the internet).  It's an intuitive machine with easy-to-use features but tons of options.  I love that I can adjust the machine to a higher angle (therefore making it harder) while my wife can adjust the machine to a lower angle (therefore making it easier).  I also like that the numbers on the side of the machine at the adjustment sites allow me to track my progress.Our machine has been going strong for almost four years now and works just as well as it did the day it arrived at our home.  We have never folded it up, so I can't comment meaningfully on how well it folds up and stores.  To note: there's a slight bump in the sliding feature (when you're, say, lying on your back and sliding up and down on the cushion), and that sensation and noise can be a little annoying, but I've learned to live with that given the multi-thousand-dollar costs savings.If you like pilates or any sort of resistance strength training, and if you think you'll use this machine at least 2-3 days a week and have the space for it (it's about 8 feet long!), then I would recommend this product wholeheartedly.  My wife and I have both seen small but important changes in our bodies just from using his machine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T4Q8X8GVAPHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N2VSAG#wasThisHelpful","R3T4Q8X8GVAPHU","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mac and cheese is stupendous.  I had never had any until I came home the other day and my wife handed me a bowl of white cheddar mac and cheese for dinner.  I knew it would be gluten free because we don't eat gluten, so I wasn't sure if the noodles would be good, given that some GF products can be hit-or-miss.I was shocked when I ate the first bite of this.  It is creamy and the noodles taste like real noodles--none of that stiff taste that some GF noodles are known to taste like.  Another thing that makes this mac and cheese so delicious is that the cheese doesn't clump up like the cheese in other mac and cheeses do.  Finally, the cheese has the perfect mix of richness and tartness.  It has a nice taste and is a bit unusual (in a good and welcome way) for a mac and cheese mix.The icing on the cake: buying this 12-pack turns out to be $2 cheaper per box than our local grocery store.Downsides (there are a couple):(1) We're down to box 2 of 12.  This shipment arrived within the past seven days, folks.(2) I've started making it for dinner now on more nights than I'd like to admit (see #1 immediately above for the result of that).  Sadly, when I hand my wife her bowl of macaroni, she always asks with a glimmer of hope, ""This isn't the WHOLE box, is it?""  But it always is.  It's darn near impossible to eat just one serving.  So, we end up wasting 80% of our daily calories on whey, cultured pasteurized milk, non-animal enzymes, and sodium phosphate.Essentially, we can't go back to any other brand!  It's delicious!  And there's no comparison between this and Annie's single-serving microwave mac and cheese; this one is the clear winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQWHL3TE0TY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7D1Y52#wasThisHelpful","R3FQWHL3TE0TY7","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once we started finding the telltale little teeth marks on the backs of our iPhones and iPads, we knew it was time to buy our son his own ""smartphone,"" the cautionary tales of ""screentime for children under two"" be damned.  No--we bought him this ""faux"" smartphone, and this purchase has been a pretty good one overall.Here's what we like:1) It's designed like a regular smartphone--rectangular shape, home button in the bottom middle, and nine ""apps""--to make your child think that this is his own smartphone.  So far, it has kept our child's interest, though he still lunges for our devices sometimes. His interest in our devices has definitely waned.2) The characters are engaging.  Each character says something different, and each character says up to three (or more) different sayings, depending on when you press their buttons.  Some of their sayings aren't necessarily grammatical (e.g. Cookie Monster: ""me favorite color is blue""; Elmo: ""What's your favorite thing to do today?""), but my memory doesn't go far back enough to know if this is in line with Sesame Street, and certainly I'm not worried my son is going to say ""me favorite color is _________,"" at least not through adulthood.  (And I just wrote what was probably the worst run-on sentence in the history of mankind, so what was that expression about not throwing rocks if you live in a glass house?)3) The lights and colors keep our son fascinated for a pretty decent amount of time.4) The touch screen is quite sensitive, which allows our son to manipulate the touch screen himself--and it seems to amuse him to no end that he's able to elicit these noises from the phone.5) The phone is quite sturdy.  We haven't had any major accidents with it yet, but it looks like it will last.Here's what we'd improve upon:1) The home button is what activates the nine ""apps"" on the touch screen.  If your child doesn't press the apps frequently enough, then your child has to ""reactivate"" the touch screen by pressing the home button.  This is, of course, all lost on our under-one child; all he cares about is that the Sweet Lil Elmo who was talking to him (ungrammatically) about weekend activities all of a sudden went away.  So, as it turns out, the toy ends up being much more mom-and-dad interactive than I hoped it would be.  On the other hand, it is supposed to be a toy for older kids, so this is all pretty understandable.2) The phone is pretty bulky.  It's approximately three times the thickness of a regular iPhone, so if the Sesame Street characters belting out ABCs didn't already scream out to your kid that ""hey! This is NOT a real iPhone!"", then the bulkiness of this toy will definitely give it away.These two things above are minor, however.  This toy keeps our little guy entertained--even if only for a few minutes at a time--and he lights up when he hears Elmo ""calling"" him.  For $13, the price is well worth it.A few final notes:1) We find the noise is perfectly adequate.  This is a huge con for lots of other reviewers--maybe they're living in louder houses with more children, which would then make it understandable that they can't hear this smartphone over the din of the other noises in their house, but this phone seems like the perfect volume.  It's definitely not quiet enough that I would take it on an airplane or anything like that--it's basically just a regular volume.  I actually like that it's regular volume and not loud, both for my child's ears and our sanity as parents.2) The item description says that there are some small parts that could be a choking hazard for children under three.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not seeing anything like that.  Our child is well under one and we let him munch on this phone for snacks in between meals.  The battery cover is encased in recessed screws, and I can't see how the home button would pop out.  So, if you're looking for this product for a child who is under the age of three, I'm not your attorney, and I'm not your torts attorney, but I can't see why you wouldn't be fine purchasing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S55O56D7BQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A671NOE#wasThisHelpful","R9S55O56D7BQN","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit, it feels a little bit like Fight Club every time I talk about these mints.  Everyone else is either pretending as if they've never heard about these mints or they've actually never heard about these mints.  Does nobody else remember those 1990s commercials with George Kennedy (Captain Ed Hocken in the Naked Gun series) for Breath Asure?  I don't know what the difference is between Breath Asure and Mint Asure, but I do know that I used to be able to find them in skeezy convenience stores, circa 2000, until one day I couldn't.  Thank god for the internet.Essentially, in the aforementioned 1990s commercials, George Kennedy used to discuss how bad breath was really down deep and not just in your mouth.  There was even a picture of an esophagus and an intestinal tract.  Well, I've come to believe that he was so right.  Every time I've ever had onions or garlic and then brushed my teeth, I've still had bad breath, presumably because the onions or garlic have traveled beyond my mouth and I can't get to them.  (This is a gross but necessary way of putting it: your burp doesn't smell like mint just because you've brushed your teeth, right?)  These little suckers, however, are amazing.  They're just parsley seed oil capsules, coated in something better tasting--parsley seed oil itself is extremely bitter, so don't bite through the capsule out of curiosity; I made that mistake one time.Here's what you do with the mints: anytime you've had a garlicky meal, take 1-3 of these mints and roll them around in your mouth for approximately 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes.  Then swallow them.  That's it!  They last for about 12 hours for me.  For instance, if I have a really garlicky dinner and take a few mints, I'll notice the next morning that everything is great, but then that later in the day, a little bit of bad breath can come creeping back.  However, this is only for meals that are extremely garlicky.Note that you'll still want to brush your teeth.  If you do both of those things (these mints + tooth brushing), you'll be golden.  If you aren't around a toothbrush because you're out and about, these mints plus a regular mint or gum will also do the trick.  But these mints are NOT equal to gum.  These mints are a completely different animal than anything else.  Again, these mints go down into your body and neutralize the smell of the garlic or onions.  Gum or a peppermint in your mouth cannot do this.  This cannot be overstated enough.These mints truly are genius.  I don't eat garlic or onions that much, but when I do, I cannot be without these mints.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18LNG54IB9YX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00121UW0O#wasThisHelpful","R18LNG54IB9YX3","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was young, my parents had this book and used to (gently) demand that we ""play"" this book from time to time.  It was always thought provoking and always an ice breaker.Fast forward to when I moved into my own apartment in college: they were delighted to dump many of their well-worn possessions--including this book--into my lap.  I used this book many a time with new and old friends to get to know them better, both in college, in my 20s and beyond.  It's a great after dinner activity at a dinner party when the conversation has lulled, because everybody gets to know a lot about everybody else and everybody seems to like it.  The questions, a mix of ""what would you do in this situation"" and ""what's more important to you: x or y?"" and other psychological questions, are thought provoking and entertaining.  Of course, there's no right or wrong answer and every time I've used the book, people have seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.I recently ordered this revised version and was really happy with the changes.  First, there are more questions: 291, up from 217.  Next, and perhaps more importantly, the ""follow up"" questions that some of the questions had have been moved from the back of the book to a light blue font below the relevant questions.  This way, you don't have to clumsily flip back and forth and find the question number.  It's a small change but a definite improvement.  Finally, and most importantly, the questions are fresher, updated for today.In sum, if you already have The Book of Questions, I highly recommend buying the revised and updated version, and if you don't already haven't the Book of Questions, I highly recommend buying this revised and updated version and trying it out with your spouse, your family, your friends--it's a great way to get to know people and quite fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGAQBDQ642TKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761177310#wasThisHelpful","RGAQBDQ642TKW","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like anyone else who registered for their wedding, my wife and I have one of those gargantuan slow cookers that collects dust in the pantry because (1) it weighs approximately 24 pounds; (2) it has miscellaneous splatter stains on it, circa 2007; and (3) the fights we get into over who will scrub it and who will heave it back into the corner of the pantry are, over time, quite damaging to our relationship.So, needless to say, we were looking for a more manageable slow cooker to use for holidays and dinner parties so that our guests could nibble on my wife's famous spinach-and-artichoke dip, buying us some time to scrub some misc. splatter stains off of some other serveware.We found this on Amazon, and aside from a few issues some people have had with cooking temps and not getting the pictured item (for the record, our red cooker says ""Proctor Silex"" and not ""Texas Chili""), our experience has been in accord with most: it's a great, powerful little cooker that does the trick.Downsides?  There are a couple.First, the cord is ridiculously short, perhaps to match the cooker's small size.  (I kid you not, the cord is exactly two feet long.)  So, you can plan on having your guests sit cross-legged on the floor and shovel spinach-and-artichoke dip into their mouths, or you can do what we do and have the (inelegant and bulkier) solution of an extension cord.Next--and this is admittedly minor--the lid doesn't attach to the cooker.  This is a bit frustrating when the lid is wet with condensation and your guests clumsily put said lid face-down onto, say, a nice, new wood table.  You can awkwardly wipe up after them, or sigh and watch your new table slowly begin to warp.As for the cooking power, I cannot offer too much insight into this.  What we do is ""preheat"" the cooker on ""high"" while our appetizer of choice is cooking in the oven (so that there's not any warm up time in the slow cooker that would cool down the food).  We then take our appetizer straight from the oven and put it into the slow cooker.  The ""high"" setting keeps the food piping hot for hours and hasn't scalded it, in our experience.  However, as for the ""keep warm"" setting, we did recently use this for the aforementioned spinach-and-artichoke dip, and the cooker didn't do the best job.  It kept the dip somewhere between ""warm"" and ""lukewarm""--slightly more toward lukewarm.  So, if you use this cooker, keep in mind that the cooker probably does a better job on the higher settings than the ""keep warm"" setting.All in all, despite its few flaws, this cooker is a delight to have.  At its small size, it's so convenient, has saved us many a heartache and marital discord, and has kept our guests happy and well fed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5EKRMV48OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003K7XI0O#wasThisHelpful","R2K5EKRMV48OY","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours (unbeknownst to us), my wife and I decided we wanted another prison--I mean ""play yard""--for our son to roam around in because apparently we're terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and, through my sleeplessness, thought the dimensions were 9' x 9'--sounded like a steal for $90.  We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n' play.  It's small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9' by 9', but that's another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here's why it's ten times better than your average pack n' play:  1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n' play.  2.  Each wall of the pack n' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I've ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.  3.  It's sturdier than any pack n' play I've seen, and the walls don't budge when he stands up in it, but it's also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I've seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn't seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.  4.  Though not 9' x 9', it's bigger than any pack n' play I've ever seen.  (Note: I've heard this can cause problems if you're using it for sleep, because it can be harder to find sheets that fit, though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets.)  5.  Our son actually likes going in there, unlike his other pack n' play (or--god forbid--his North States Superyard play yard--you'd think we'd sent him to Guantanamo Bay).Overall, it really just looks like a fun, happy, and bright place to be in, and it's well made and looks like it will last for a while, and perhaps most importantly, our son doesn't fuss when we put him in there, and, to state the obvious, putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home.  So although I don't think you need TWO pack n' plays, I'm not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake, because this particular pack n' play is awesome.To sum it up, if you're going to buy one pack 'n play, buy this one, because it's the clear winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IS3DIRHPF266/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000056C86#wasThisHelpful","R2IS3DIRHPF266","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had many mouse pads over the years, ranging from cheapo promotional giveaway pads to higher end ones such as the Razer SWTOR pad and the jumbo Steelseries QcK pad, but I always felt like there was room for improvement in each of the pads.  The Razer SWTOR pad got me hooked back on solid surfaces (I had a pad with a hard, gel-like surface back in the day that I also liked, but I don't recall the brand or model), but the SWTOR pad had a ridiculous gamer aesthetic and was too small of a surface area.  The jumbo QcK pad was just too huge, and even though they make smaller versions, once I got back to quality hard gaming mats I didn't want to go back to the softer surface of the QcK.After extensive research I decided to give this mat a try.  It's about halfway between the size of the SWTOR pad and the jumbo QcK pad, and the size seems just about right.  It has an understated, all black aesthetic that can fit in either a gamer or professional environment.  My mouse easily glides across the surface, but there is also just the right amount of tension between the surface of the pad and mouse.

"Just two weeks after we started reading this book to our son every other night, he started jerking his head to the side and smiling so widely if we'd quote a line from it during the day time.  I think it's because this book is so memorable due to the repetition.  Each page starts off with an attempt to get an animal as a pet, and the discovery of that pet (behind a shipping box, zoo bars, basket, etc.), and then why it won't work out.For example:""I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet.They sent me an...[turn page to open large flap with a box pictured on it and hiding an elephant behind it][child or you screams out ""ELEPHANT!""]""He was too big!I sent him back.""And the list of other animals goes on until the perfect animal is found...It is true that there is no rhyming on each page.  However, there is some rhyming.  For instance, the camel is described as too grumpy, and then a couple of animals later, the frog is described as too jumpy.  Further, the repetition of the book sets up the child's expectation--every page is the same except for the animal's name and the one adjective characteristic as to why the animal didn't work out.  As mentioned, at least in our case, our child clearly knew this book just based on a handful of readings, and he continues to love reading it to this day.  This, along with Little Blue Truck, are still are go-to books and are absolutely recommended even for the smallest of babies.Also, I totally didn't get the point of ""board books"" until this book came along... but now I get it.  We bought the regular book (not the board book), and here's the problem with that: our son LOVES to grab at the ""doors"" that hide the animals, so much so that the doors are starting to rip off.  So, my suggestion is that you buy the board book version so that you won't have to worry about little fingers prying off flimsy little doors!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8BUTHK0WTBDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0027164403#wasThisHelpful","R8BUTHK0WTBDP","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We were having a stink problem with our cloth diapers.  Turns out we have the bad combination of hard water plus a high efficiency washer--both of these things mean that our diapers don't get rinsed out as much as they should so the ammonia smell from urine builds up over time.As for the high efficiency washer problem, we've solved this problem by ""tricking"" our washer into using more water by putting a couple of wet towels in there with the diapers.And as for the hard water problem, we've solved this problem by pouring a tablespoon of Calgon into each hot water cycle (we do a cold rinse first, then a hot water cycle with detergent and the Calgon, then a cold water rinse again). We couldn't be happier to have gotten rid of the stink problem.As a bonus, now that we know we have a hard water problem, we've also started using the Calgon in our dishwasher and our dishes have come out much cleaner and with less built-up and cloudiness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMFKX4LQLOMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VL3ZPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3TMFKX4LQLOMI","A298F32S0REZ1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A298F32S0REZ1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off you need the basic SAVAGE WORLDS to play this game. The book does a good job of updating the Deadlands franchise keeping some of the original content yet blending it with the Savage Worlds model. By the way, you should like Savage Worlds (which has several similarities to Deadlands like dice exploding, poker initiative, etc) or this game won't fly for you. Think of the Wild West with a twist in History and then toss in steampunk, horror, monsters and all types of Western cliches.I really like the poker method for initiative, the poker chips (which are like the Fate/Action Points in other games), the dueling, and, of course, the world of Deadlands, especially the extended American Civil War as I'm a big time enthusiast.

"I was hesitant purchasing this remote. I have the kinect so I use voice commands for nearly everything on the Xbone. However, at night, I found myself reaching for a controller to avoid talking out loud and waking the wife. This was annoying being that my controllers are on a charger far from the couch. I would solve this dilemma by opening up the Xbox One Windows 10 app on my Surface or Smartglass on my phone to change channels/volume/etc. The annoyance with that is that you have to wake up your device, open the app, wait for it to load, etc. I am lazy and I wanted something quicker.

There is not Microsoft written anywhere on the actual charger so this could very well be a knock-off but it works and was half the price of an original Microsoft charger.Only time will tell if it hold up like an original but so far, I am very very pleased and I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs an extra or replacement charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9QTI6YQL0QY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TEBEGO#wasThisHelpful","R1T9QTI6YQL0QY","A2KCNRFE5NL5B6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KCNRFE5NL5B6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this is a fantastic bag at an even better price. Very well built and deigned.The canvas (I purchased the black) is very thick and the stitching is top quality.The zippers seem extremely durable and feel great when zipping/unzipping. There are plenty of pockets to store everything for a day out on the town. I currently have my surface pro 3, external HDD, diary/notebook, extra cords for phone/sp3/etc, umbrella, and a bunch of pens/leatherman tools/etc. There is plenty of room to spare. There is a zippered pocket on the front flap and on the back of the bag. Two pockets when you open the flap that shut (not completely) with velcro. The main compartment is zippered (I wanted this) and has a small zippered pocket on the inside with two pen pockets and two small pockets (to hold gum or business cards). I really wanted a bag that had a zippered main compartment and that had latches to hold down the flap. I live in Manhattan and I needed a semi-secure bag. The magnetic flaps would not hold up well with pick-pockets.ProsDurableConstructionZippersThick CanvasPlenty of room for up to a 14inch laptop and accessoriesConsI am not a fan of the two side mesh pockets. To me it looks kinda tacky but many people like these pockets for water bottles or umbrellasI do not like the strap and how it is connected to the bag. Most messenger bags have a removable strap. I like this design because I can change or replace the straps if needed. This bag has a permanent strap. If/when the strap breaks, you will be out of luck.Bottom lineI would highly recommend this bag. It looks and feels superb. My only real complaint is the strap but for the price it cannot be beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VFC56DFZ6SJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014B1HU8S#wasThisHelpful","R2VFC56DFZ6SJW","A2KCNRFE5NL5B6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KCNRFE5NL5B6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works fantastic after a week of tinkering with all settings.I use this with 2 X 3tb WD Red NAS drives. I wanted additional storage at home on my network and wanted to be able to access it anywhere at anytime. I also have two Foscam cameras that I wanted attached to my NAS. Finally, I wanted a multimedia box to store and play all my movies. I have a lifetime subscription to Plex but unfortunately, this model Synology does not support Plex (this was a mistake on my end for not researching). This Synology NAS fits the bill almost perfectly.As a storage that I can access anywhere, this setup is perfect and absolutely no complaints. I enabled port forwarding on my router but otherwise there are apps and internet to access any and all your files from any device (smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.). Personally I have a Surface RT, Surface Pro 3, and Windows Phone 8.1 and I have had zero issues (apps or otherwise).My two Foscam F18910W cameras were a bit tricky. Synology uses its own surveillance software called Surveillance Station. This piece of software (or app on your Disk Station) is very useful and powerful. However, it took about a week to finally adjust everything so that it was working properly (motion detection, detection strength, motion timer/scheduler, etc.). There are a ton of options you can choose and sometimes instructions are lacking so there was often many internet searches to find solutions. I had to set many different clocks and settings on both the camera themselves and the Surveillance Station. It was time consuming and frustrating at times, but I think I finally figured it out and everything is running smoothly.I wanted to install Plex on my NAS and have it play/transcode. This Synology model is not compatible with Plex. This is an error on my end. Synology does provide their own media/video app so that you can still use it for a ""media server"". Alternatively, I use my HTPC for my Plex server and link this NAS for all the media and that works just fine. The only downside is that I must have my HTPC on at all times if I need/want to access the server. I cannot fault this NAS a star for the Plex issue as it was clearly my fault.For the price, this is the best and most user friendly NAS you can get. I highly recommend this NAS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GZAFH6RBRSVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRB9CK4#wasThisHelpful","R1GZAFH6RBRSVU","A2KCNRFE5NL5B6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KCNRFE5NL5B6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was initially hesitant to jump on the ""mechanical keyboard"" bandwagon. In fact, I had put it off for many years thinking it was ridiculous and a down right waste of money. I, however, think that the Logiteh G710+ is a great piece of computing hardware.The keyboard itself is made rugged. It feels like a durable and heavy keyboard that should last a long time. I was very pleasantly surprised with the rubber o-rings on the keys so that the ""clicky"" noise is muffled. The backlight is bright and looks great (has essentially 6 settings). I wanted a new keyboard that had volume control, a USB port and limited G-keys and this fit the bill perfectly. Typing and gaming on this keyboard is very nice and just feels right.My only real complain or critique is that awful orange border around the G-keys. I have no idea what Logitech was thinking with this. It sticks out like a sore thumb and I can't imagine the color fitting anyone's color scheme. I have found some tutorials on how to disassemble the keyboard (fairly easy) and I will paint it black.Despite what others may say, a mechanical keyboard will not make you magically better at gaming. To be honest it is pretty gimmicky. That being said, this keyboard is a quality product that I am sure will last a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R60L3IZAVO6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009C98NPY#wasThisHelpful","R3R60L3IZAVO6G","A2KCNRFE5NL5B6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KCNRFE5NL5B6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love Pyrex and who doesn't???  This product is great as is any Pyrex product (almost).ProsConvieneint handlesIncluded coversNice red color (not orange like the picture shows)ConsYou need to take into account that the overall length of these because of the large handles on either end.The smaller dish had a ""chunk"" taken out of the bottomThe smaller dish had a ""chunk"" of glass taken out of the bottom with a black mark going over it.  It looks as though it was marked on the production line but they forgot to pull it before boxing.  I did not return the piece because it does not affect the useability of the dish.  Pyrex is made so that if a chip occurs, it will not compromise the integrity of the rest of the product.  My other problem is that the handles make the dish a lot longer than previous versions of this dish.  I cannot fit the small fish in my toaster oven despite other dishes of the same capacity fitting just fine.I would recommend this product but took off one star for the obvious defect and another star for the length.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAYH6SZEM1IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057SN2YG#wasThisHelpful","R1SAYH6SZEM1IZ","A2KCNRFE5NL5B6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KCNRFE5NL5B6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She claims they are very comfortable and are extremely warm when she wears them.  She ordinary wear a 7 but found that the 7 was a little snug so she got a 7.5 and it fit perfect.

I don't think I will need my straightener either on the days I blow dry my hair.

I have washed 2 so far and no issues. They are incredibly soft, keep things in place and have adjustable straps.

"I have a LOT of China Glaze neon colors. First of all, Pool Party is not bubblegum pink it is actually what I would call Neon Watermelon if that helps anyone. I just got my nails done and what is showing on my computer is NOT what color it is. It's neon orangish-pink and if you have ever had a neon watermelon bathing suit you will know what this color is. Flip Flop Fantasy is actually what I would call neon coral. It's more pink than orange but it's one of my favorites. Orange knockout shows it as very diluted here but trust me, it is incredibly bright bright bright orange. And finally shocking pink is neon light pink. I wanted to comment because the colors showing are not the colors. I am sitting here with my nail polish next to me and it's not showing the vibrancy or even hue they are. Yes, the neons do chip easier and they also need 2-3 coats to even out and a top coat to make it glossy and not matted. I have found that even getting a manicure at the nail salon my fingers will chip after 2 days. However, when i get these colors on my toes they last at least 2 weeks because my toes experience less contact.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0P0DW8H6B1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003EAFIO6#wasThisHelpful","R2I0P0DW8H6B1U","A3V86XI9YB1KKH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V86XI9YB1KKH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although it gets off to a fantastic start with the groundbreaking animated opening credits sequence presenting the Pink Panther; and it contains a brilliant Henry Mancini original musical score (with an unforgettable instrumental theme song); and it introduces the classic comic character, the bumbling French police inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers); and it boasts some enticing European locations, sumptuous sets and costumes, this film never really gains momentum.  Other than several bits of semi-inspired comedy involving Clouseau, most of the movie is on the creaky and somewhat creepy side.Peter Sellers turned out to have been an extremely lucky casting coup.  Co-screenwriter/director Blake Edwards originally intended the part of Clouseau for Peter Ustinov, a serious actor who could handle sophisticated comedy, but he belatedly turned the role down to do another project.Forgotten by many is that Clouseau is in the secondary male role and that this film is actually a romantic comedy vehicle for David Niven, of the bedroom farce genre, which has him romancing a pair of international beauties played by Claudia Cardinale and Capucine.  Edwards was infatuated with Niven as a suave and romantic leading man (his supposedly ideal dashing jewel thief for this picture) and badly wanted to work with him.  But the problem, as one can plainly see, is that Niven was way too long in the tooth at this point in his career, making his love affairs with the much younger women seem more pathetic (and creepy) than humorously charming (not to mention halfway believable).  Nor did it help that Cardinale (as the princess) couldn't speak comprehensible English and had to have all her dialogue dubbed.  Edwards also thought that having the police detective's wife (Capucine) be the the jewel thief's partner-in-crime and lover (making the police inspector Clouseau a classic comic cuckold) was an unbeatably hilarious premise in and of itself.  Only none of this is convincing, even in the context of comedy where the credibility bar need not be all that high.  The additional character of Niven's nephew (Robert Wagner), who suddenly materializes for no good reason, only clutters matters as he attempts to steal his uncle's thunder, producing no comic payoff - just a dull thud.If you are amused by the type of bedroom farce that has an aging David Niven repeatedly crawling under a bed to hide from his lover's husband, you will be in seventh heaven watching this movie.  For me, without the occasional improvised departures from the script by Sellers (who had to push Edwards to up the wacky slapstick quotient), this is a rather lifeless and laughless film (nor is there any suspense in the diamond heist sequence) despite all the excellent surrounding features I listed previously - most memorably the Mancini music and the first appearance of the animated Pink Panther.As for the DVD extras, Blake Edwards' commentary is a snorefest, Robert Wagner's interview is moderately engaging, and the feature about the creation of the Pink Panther carton will only interest hardcore fans of the rose-colored feline.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YHGLXXVJDYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009S4J3C#wasThisHelpful","R7YHGLXXVJDYU","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Impressive!  100 tracks over 4 discs, featuring excellent sound (make that VERY impressive, given the age of these records and the rarity of most of them).  The two years receiving by far the most focus are 1961 and 1962, when the various influences that would eventually coalesce into the soul genre (as it came to be known later in the 1960s) were clearly in evidence.  You can hear the echoes of the harmony-group era, both the bluesier and more rocking sides of R&B, gospel-style singing (which really gave soul its soul), as well as pop - especially the kind that appealed to young people.  Put it all together and you can sense that something remarkable was happening.  These are well produced (but never overproduced) records that still sound amazingly vibrant and appealing today, especially for fans of '60s soul.While quite a few of the recording artists in this collection were hardly heard from again (making this collection all the more essential historically), it was not for lack of talent.  You may be amazed at how good the persistently propulsive and emphatic ""She'll Be Gone"" by Betty O'Brian is.  (I never heard of her or this record before and now can't stop listening to it.)  And on the other side of the equation, there is a wealth of artists who were either already well established (Sam Cooke, Roy Hamilton, Etta James [the great ""Seven Day Fool"" is here!], The 5 Royales), peaking at the time (Dee Clark, Little Eva, Chuck Jackson, Marv Johnson, Benny Spellman), just starting to make their names (Bobby Bland, Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Baby Washington, Dee Dee Sharp, Mitty Collier, Sugar Pie De Santo), and later break-out stars (Wilson Pickett, Irma Thomas, Maxine Brown, Lou Rawls, The O'Jays, Johnny Nash, Johnnie Taylor, Joe Simon, Jimmy Ruffin, The Tams, Major Lance, Ted Taylor, Dobie Gray).  Early Motown is represented by the Miracles, Barrett Strong, Eddie Holland, LaBrenda Ben, The Marvelettes, The Temptations, and Marvin Gaye.Of added value for me was hearing for the first time records by later favorites of mine on their earlier labels that I had never heard before: Jimmy Ruffin's one-off dbut recording on the Miracle label from 1961 (""Don't Feel Sorry for Me""), Joe Simon on the Hush label from 1961 (""I See Your Face""), and Johnnie Taylor on Sam Cooke's SAR label from 1962 (""Rome Wasn't Built in a Day"").  Before listening to this collection I never knew of anything by Robert Knight prior to ""Everlasting Love"" (1967); and here he is on the powerfully pleading, well-orchestrated ""Free Me"" from 1962.What we don't get here is a booklet with notes or musical credits.  Real Gone obviously wanted to keep the cost down while providing the most extensive array of great early soul music in a single package.  They have succeeded.Best record in this collection by a one-hit wonder (IMO): Timmy ""Gonna Send You Back to Georgia"" Shaw's shudder-inducing slow blues ""Thunder in My Heart.""Excellent find on CD:  Sugar Pie DeSanto's first (and biggest, reaching #4) R&B hit, the funky soul blues ""I Want to Know"" on the Veltone label.And how about the first record ever released by Berry Gordy and Tamla-Motown (Tamla 101):  Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me,"" which after a distribution deal was subsequently made with United Artists, rose to #6 R&B / #30 pop in early 1959.Also of historical note concerning Motown is the appearance of the original version of ""Someday We'll Be Together"" (obviously best known as the 1969-70 #1 pop and soul smash that was Diana Ross & the Supremes' swan song before going their separate ways) by Jackey (Beavers) and Johnny (Bristol) from 1961 on Harvey Fuqua's Tri-Phi label.  ""Someday"" co-writer Johnny Bristol would later team with the song's co-writer/producer Fuqua at Motown where they produced (and sometimes also co-wrote for) a number of acts, including Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Jr. Walker & the All Stars, and Gladys Knight & the Pips.  Bristol, who had a significant solo recording career after Motown (with the national top ten soul and pop crossover smash ""Hang On in There Baby"" in 1974), was the male voice on the hit Motown version of ""Someday We'll Be Together.""  The Jackey & Johnny original is instantly recognizable but sounds rather primitive compared to its exquisitely produced (by Johnny Bristol!) famous cover.Leaving aside the star-powered major hits ""Turn On Your Love Light"" (Bobby Bland), ""Bye Bye Baby"" (Mary Wells's dbut, with the raspy voice later emulated by John Lennon on ""Twist and Shout"") and ""Any Day Now"" (Chuck Jackson), the best record of the whole one hundred can be found on Disc Two, Track 15: Nolan Strong & the Diablos' exciting ""Mind Over Matter"" from 1962.  Don't miss this one (by that I mean this track and this entire collection)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UUTL59XCBMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KYBBT4Q#wasThisHelpful","R15UUTL59XCBMN","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most series would be losing steam or on their last legs this far along - and would be contemplating shutting down - but this one is locked in and just keeps the laughter coming like few other shows.  The writing is brilliant, the direction is spot on, and the ensemble cast is unmatched for a family sitcom.  I would put Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet up there in the top ten of sitcom actors in this century.  And Ed O'Neill as family elder Jay Pritchett has accomplished the nearly impossible by making us forget that he once played the irrepressible Al Bundy.This show contains a dazzling mix of character-driven, verbal and physical comedy that almost always surprises.  With about four minutes left in the final episode, very possibly the single most outrageously clever, daring and hilarious play on words I've ever heard on TV is uncorked in a deftly delivered verbal exchange between Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet).  How it got past network Standards and Practices is anybody's guess.If there is a weakness in the writing, in my opinion it is that Manny's (Rico Rodriguez) and Lilly's (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) lines tend to be one-note and predictable.  Little Lily speaks in wisecracks that are too cute by half; and there has always been a problem with the forced and overwritten nature of Manny's lines, which feel stilted, unnatural, and too obviously scripted.  It's not the young actor's fault that the writers saddled him with an unbelievably quirky character.  (And while I'm at it, his character's crush on his cousin Haley [Sarah Hyland] is creepier than it is comical; and although it's a relatively minor [no pun intended] recurring subplot, it represents a major miscalculation by the writers.)The development of the Dunphy children is a main focus this season: Haley still lives at home but lands a low-level job in a field rife with humorous possibilities - and her sudden awakening to something resembling romantic love creates an intriguing final-episode cliffhanger.  Middle child Alex (Ariel Winter) is finally emerging as her own person (more than just the family brainiac suffering from middle-child syndrome) as she approaches high school graduation and a promising college future.  And formerly little Luke (Nolan Gould) undergoes an astonishing growth and maturity spurt that causes mixed reactions in his father.Jay and Gloria (Sofia Vergara) have a fine acting moment together in an episode subplot about an anniversary gift; and Ed O'Neill as Jay has a comedic acting field day in the episode that finds him competing on Cam's team in a gay bowling league.The Claire (Julie Bowen)-on-her-computer episode (""Connection Lost"") is extremely ambitious and well executed, if a bit disorienting.  Modern technology gets another comical workout in the ""American Skyper"" [clever title] episode featuring a robotic camera and Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) who is literally not all there.A hilarious dual addition to the cast this season is the appearance of Steve Zahn and Andrea Anders as the Dunphy's new next-door neighbors, Ronnie and Amber LaFontaine, ex-trailer trash who made a ton of money overnight in California's newly legalized medical marijuana business and took a significant residential upgrade.Looking forward to the next season on DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IMUTHHA19ONW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPMFLT4#wasThisHelpful","R3IMUTHHA19ONW","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Bear Family (of Germany) did its earlier three-part series ""And the Answer Is,"" it juxtaposed the original hit record with its sequel that attempted to cash in on the predecessor's success.  ""Second Helpings"" is Ace Records' (of London, England) second collection of such follow-up records; and like the first, it consists of nothing but the sequels.  So if you are not familiar with the originals, all of which go back to the 1950s and '60s (the latest being from 1966), your enjoyment of this disc will be considerably lessened.  You may deduce from this then that this compilation is almost completely geared toward knowledgeable fans of the oldies from approximately fifty to sixty years ago.Since this CD comes to us from Ace, which represents the paragon of consistent quality in this field, you can expect a five-star package with sparkling sound mastering (these may be moldy oldies but they sound like they could have been recorded last week) and a 20-page booklet that is impressive-looking even for Ace (which is really saying something!).  It's loaded with photos and colorful record realia (label, record jacket, album cover, trade magazine ad and poster repros), and holes in our knowledge are plugged by compiler Sam Szczepanski's (whom I'm nicknaming ""Eyechart"") superbly limned, ultra-informative liner notes.There are actually a few sizable hits here, although nothing that rivals their predecessors: Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs' ""The Hair on My Chinny Chin Chin"" (inspired by their #1 hit ""L'il Red Riding Hood"") made it to #14 on one national pop chart in 1966; The Marvelettes' ""Twistin' Postman"" (the de rigueur 1962 twist-based follow-up to their #1 pop and R&B smash ""Please Mr. Postman"") went Top 40 pop and got to #13 R&B; Jimmy Dean's ""The Cajun Queen"" (#22 pop and #16 country in 1962) exhumes ""Big Bad John,"" the #1 pop and country hit that preceded it; and Paul Anka reached Top 40 pop by asking us in 1963 to ""Remember Diana,"" his self-penned dbut chart-topper from six years earlier when he was 15-16 years old (it rode the charts for more than half a year).  The only other charter is Jan & Dean's mouthful, ""The Anaheim, Azusa & Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review and Timing Association,"" their 1964 follow-up to their memorable #3 smash ""The Little Old Lady from Pasadena.""  ""The Anaheim, Azusa..."" [I'm not going to write it again!] peaked at #50 in Record World.Best sequel title:  The Crests' ""You Blew Out the Candles"" as the sequel to ""Sixteen Candles.""One case in which the sequel is arguably better than the predecessor: soulful, powerhouse singer Lenny Miles' ""Donna's Gone"" (1962), the answer to ""Don't Believe Him, Donna.""By far the worst sequel here is Marty Robbins' ""Feleena (from El Paso),"" an LP track that slogs on to the same repetitive ""El Paso"" tune for an interminable 8:17.The most indispensable sequel record: Buddy Holly's ""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" the demo of which was completed after his death and inspired the 1986 Francis Ford Coppola film of the same title.  We are fortunate this even saw the light of day.Personal favorites of mine include Wanda Jackson's rockin' ""Man, We Had a Party"" (1961), which sums up her equally raucous ""Let's Have a Party""; George Jones's tongue-in-cheek ""Root Beer"" (1962), which followed up on ""White Lightnin'""; Slim Harpo's ""Little Queen Bee"" (1964), the answer to ""I'm a King Bee"" from seven years earlier; and Booker T & the MGs' ""Mo' Onions (1962), based on ""Green Onions"" and even mo' (I mean ""more"") of a showcase for Steve Cropper's stinging guitar licks.Grab ""Second Helpings"" before they're all gone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G81V6EN7O0F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTN1BPU#wasThisHelpful","R3G81V6EN7O0F3","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a veritable treasure trove for fans of this too-often forgotten era of pop and pop-rock (1959-1963) between the first wave of rock & roll and the British ""invasion"" that followed the Beatles in early 1964.  Here are 90 of the most forgotten records from this period [total running time: 3 hours, 35 minutes] - ones that NEVER get played on oldies radio because they not only missed reaching the pop Top 40, they missed the entire Billboard Hot 100!  (Most oldies radio avoids anything that wasn't at least Top 20.)  The case with many of these records is that they were quite popular in some markets, but for some reason were unable to get the radio airplay elsewhere needed to generate broader demand.A real advantage of a collection like this is that there should be very little duplication with any other CD collection you own.  I especially enjoyed the fact that I knew so few of these records, even though by around the mid-point of this time frame I was starting to becomebe aware of everything that was being played on the radio.  This is a trip back in time that one can hear with fresh ears.  And that reminds me of another advantage: the sound is astonishingly good given the age and relative rarity of these records.  Two more advantages: 1) a 16-page booklet with an informative paragraph devoted to each and every artist and record (that's 90 records by 90 different artists); and 2) every record is presented chronologically, giving one a greater sense of the musical flavors of each year.For anyone who might think that such lesser hits as these must have been throwaways, let me point out that 13 of the 90 recordings were by future Rock & Roll Hall of Famers.  Here's the list: Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, The Crickets, Duane Eddy, The ""5"" Royales, The Flamingos, The 4 Seasons, Barry Mann (in the R&R HOF as a songwriter), Del Shannon, The Temptations, Ike and Tina Turner, and Stevie Wonder (13-year-old Little Stevie Wonder in 1963).  Johnny Cash is also in the Country & Western Hall of Fame, as are Glen Campbell, Sonny James, Webb Pierce, Hank Snow and Conway Twitty.  And Sarah Vaughan is a Grammy Lifetime Achievement honoree.Other artists of note appearing in this collection include Arthur Alexander, The Angels, Paul Anka, Bobby Bare, Gary (U.S.) Bonds, Johnny Burnette, Vikki Carr (her competing version of The Crystals' ""He's a Rebel"" from 1962 is on the unconvincing and borderline shrill side), The Chantels, The Del Vikings, Jackie DeShannon, Ral Donner, Shelley Fabares, Barbara George, Clarence Henry, Brian Hyland, Jay & the Americans, Hank Locklin, Aaron Neville, Tony Orlando, The Robins, Tommy Roe, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Vee  and Baby Washington.There are 14 Billboard ""Bubbling Under"" one-timers who never appeared on any other national chart with this or any other record.  Ever heard of the Kenjolairs, Aki Aleong, Vicki Tasso, Doug Warren & the Rays, or Jan Burgens & His New Orleans Syncopators...?  I didn't think so.My Top 20 from this collection (the highest positions most of these records have ever seen!)1) Nolan Strong & The Diablos -  ""Mind Over Matter"" (1962) - Detroit proto-soul classic (penned by Devora Brown) with a phenomenal lead vocal by the ethereally high-voiced ""Daddy Rockin'"" Strong and the stellar electric blues-rock guitar of [sounds like it could be Lonnie Mack/Jimi Hendrix icon Robert Ward!(?)]  It broke through on WLS (50,000-watt Top 40 radio) in Chicago, reaching #16, but surprisingly went no further.  Definitely for fans of Nathaniel Mayer & The Fabulous Twilights' ""Village of Love"" (on the same Fortune label) - and definitely (IMO) one of the best records of 1962.2) Little Stevie Wonder  ""I Call It Pretty Music But the Old People Call It the Blues Pt. 1)"" (1963) - dynamic and propulsive, and by an unmatched talent, but it got lost in the immediate wake of Stevie's phenomenal dbut single, the #1 pop and R&B smash ""Fingertips, Pt. 2""3) Robert Parker  ""All Nite Long (Pt. 1)"" (1959) - cookin' and jivin' sax instro that should never have stalled at #113 in its only week on the chart.  This was Robert Parker five and half years before his Top Ten hit ""Barefootin'.""4) Johnny Cash  ""Johnny Yuma, the Rebel"" (1961) - one of the best vocal TV theme songs of all time (from the Western series ""The Rebel"" starring Nick Adams)5) Big Al Downing  ""The Story of My Life"" (1962) - harmonica-powered Southern-style R&B take on Marty Robbins' 1958 country and pop hit (an early Burt Bacharach-Hal David composition).  Like ""Mind Over Matter,"" it was a hit on WLS in Chicago [#15] but failed to break nationally.6) Googie Ren  ""The Slide"" (1960) - sizzling and grooving organ-&-sax-propelled R&B dance-call tune7) The Temptations  ""Paradise"" (1962) - This Temptations chart dbut record was obviously inspired by The 4 Seasons, with Eddie Kendricks taking the high-voiced lead vocal (in other words, the Frankie Valli part, but in his natural voice, as opposed to Valli's falsetto)8) Ray Charles  ""No Letter Today"" (1963) - Ray in his brilliant country-soul period doing credit to the 1944 Ted Daffan country ballad hit.  This one got buried on the flipside of ""Take These Chains from My Heart.""9) Conway Twitty  ""What a Dream"" (1960) - This otherwise rather ordinary ballad serves as a showcase for seemingly all of the Twitty bird's trademark vocal tricks, especially his guttural croaks.10) Baby Washington  ""Handful of Memories"" (1962) - #16 R&B hit by one of the all-time great voices of the genre11) Aaron Neville  ""Over You"" (1960) - cool, relentlessly rhythmic New Orleans R&B with a neat horn chart. Living legend Allen Toussaint produced and co-wrote it.  It was Neville's first chart record (preceding ""Tell It Like It Is"" by six years) and a significant national R&B hit (reaching #21).12) Sam Fletcher  ""Time Has a Way"" (1959) - big ballad by the big-voiced Roy Hamilton sound-alike called ""The Man with the Golden Voice"" (which later became Paul Carrack's sobriquet)13) Jack B.

In fact, it is only on Trk 14 (one of the earlier ""bonus"" tracks), a rousing duet with Georgie Fame on ""Yeh Yeh,"" the disc's sole song with any kind of a link to jazz (the Latin soul-jazz of Mongo Santamaria - and the oldest covered song here), that this album really ever ventures forth from its cocoon.  (Incidentally, Fame and his group had a #1 UK hit with it in January '65, and it subsequently got as high as #13 in the U.S.  He remains a superb organist and has always ""owned"" this tune.)  Still, I am very pleased with every one of these ballad renditions whose originals date from the mid-1960s on.  And frankly, I've just about had my fill of 1930s and 1940s standards.  (One more version of ""How Deep Is the Ocean"" [from 1932] and I'll jump into the ocean!)  Before getting to ""The Complete Sessions"" additions (Trks 17-20), I would say that my favorites (other than ""Yeh Yeh"") are probably ""I'm Not in Love"" (she absolutely nails it!), ""I Can't Tell You Why"" (best new arrangement - and Eagle/co-writer Timothy B. Schmit does the background vocals on it),"" ""Don't Dream It's Over"" (fine song that hasn't been overcovered), and two that were contemporaries of each other in early 1966, ""In My Life"" (from ""Rubber Soul"") and ""California Dreamin'.""  Her vocals on ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" and the McCartney dbut song ""If I Take You Home Tonight"" are admirably affecting as well.Clearly, the intention here was to do a purely pop album of high-quality songs from the second decade of the rock era on, nearly all by writer-performers.  I have no doubt it was a labor of love for the artist, Diana Krall, and it's a highly successful one reflecting her integrity and commitment.  I'm just saying that a little more variety would not have hurt the cause.Now for the four tracks appearing exclusively on this CD (bringing the total running time to 74:30):- ""A Case of You"":  Her gorgeous piano accompanies her most mesmerizing, duskiest, jazz-inflected vocal.  I suspect Joni Mitchell would heartily approve of this stellar interpretation.- ""If You Could Read My Mind"":  Hauntingly beautiful duet with Sarah McLachlan.  Heavenly harmonizing.- ""Everybody's Talkin'"":  Luminescent duet with Vince Gill, featuring more lovely harmonies backed by an intriguing orchestral pop and country-tinged arrangement.- ""Heart of Gold"":  Stunning take on the Neil Young classic.  Diana's voice sounds genuinely weary from the title quest, and the country violin backing follows up perfectly on ""Everybody's Talkin'.""These final four tracks on the ""Complete Sessions"" are as strong as anything that precedes them (on average, even stronger), making it hard to fathom how they could have been held out until this edition.  Because they are all so good, I raised my earlier (pre-""Complete Sessions"") rating from four and a half stars to five stars.  Diana Krall is just too fine a star to be denied her full due!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIN7OKIUMP60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141SMR34#wasThisHelpful","R3MIN7OKIUMP60","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He is really that good that he can be mentioned in this company.  I actually prefer his vocal on ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" to the original, as it lends a truer, more emotive David Ruffin-esque feel to the Gamble-Huff Philly-soul song that flirted with easy listening back in the '70s.  It is neat [no pun intended] to hear the gender flip in ""Clean Up MAN"" from the Betty Wright 1971 soul and pop smash original.  The backing vocals are very well done, and on a few tracks, particularly those ballads originally featuring a woman (Aretha's ""Ain't No Way"" and Shirley Murdock's ""As We Lay""), the female duet vocalist (uncredited) is excellent.Obviously it would be impossible to top the originals (other than possibly in the one case I mentioned), given all the great artists (many immortal) and producers involved with those, but this is an exceptionally solid album of classic soul covers (with the one very good original ""Feel Good"" in the final position).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MA6Q5AC717O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PYM54S#wasThisHelpful","R14MA6Q5AC717O","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have always enjoyed the way he growls in his heavy urban N'Awlins accent, which is a unique mlange of Southern and Brooklynese (""toin"" for ""turn,"" for example).Malcolm ""Mac"" Rebennack (before he became ""Dr. John"") was a teenage prodigy local piano wizard, session player, songwriter and R&B record producer going back to the late 1950s,  but these are the key songs that really put him on the American popular music map.  As I suppose many did, I first became aware of him through his strikingly soulful pop-rock smash ""Right Place Wrong Time"" from 1973, which continues to be a staple of oldies radio.  (I turn it up loud every time.)  ""Such a Night"" (his original and not the same as the much earlier Elvis Presley record) was a delightfully cool follow-up that should have been a bigger hit.  Both of these were produced and arranged by his friend, the great New Orleans creator of immortal music, Allen Toussaint.  These two tracks stand out, but everything in this collection is entertaining.Three particularly pleasant surprises for me here are: 1) the opening track, the U.S. promo-only single version of the brilliantly ironic ""The Patriotic Flag Waver"" (1969), which skewers political and social hypocrisy; 2) his very credible 1972 version of Willie Dixon's ""Wang Dang Doodle"" (also a U.S.-only promo single); and 3) an outstanding 1972 collaboration with Buddy Guy and Eric Clapton on Guy's ""A Man of Many Words,"" which was clearly intended as a tribute to the late Otis Redding.The package includes a colorful ten-page booklet with five pages of informative new liner notes by Gene Sculatti, and the sound mastering is top-notch.If you're a Dr. John fan, you can't go wrong with this CD.

"Lindi Ortega's ""Faded Gloryville"" is up there sharing the same rarefied Americana air as Eilen Jewell's stellar ""Sundown Over Ghost Town,"" and we can only hope that these two artistically extraordinary albums will be duking it out for the Best Americana Album Grammy.  (When asked to offer a definition of Americana music, I usually respond that it's country music for people with measurable IQs.)These songs are realistic depictions of life and love in working-class America where emotional and day-to-day survival can no longer be taken for granted.  One can get trapped in a ""Run-Down Neighborhood"" and a woman can find that her man has ""Run Amuck"" amid the ""bars and dirty alleys...whiskey and tequila...uppers, downers, coffee and cocaine.""  ""Faded Gloryville"" is the trickle-down American dream now come crashing down - a place of disillusion where ""nobody wears a crown.""  But she holds out hope that ""Someday Soon"" there will be ""somethin' better [...] waitin' for me...a thousand miles from yesterday.""In addition to the previously cited pair of ballads, the album begins and ends with a pair of strikingly poetic and poignant beauties, ""Ashes"" and ""Half Moon,"" respectively.  And by way of contrast, besides the aforementioned ""Run"" songs, there are some other potent rockers as well: the appealingly New Orleans-y ""When You Ain't Home""; the bouncy, coolly melodic and emphatic ""Tell It Like It Is""; and her breezy ""I Ain't the Girl,"" which is thematically somewhat reminiscent of Bob Dylan's ""It Ain't Be Babe"" (but from the distaff side five decades later).The only song not written or co-written by Lindi Ortega is her splendid Memphis-soul-style cover of an all-time favorite of mine, the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"" from 1967, which they originally intended to be an Otis Redding Memphis soul record.  This is one of three tracks not recorded in Nashville but in that other Mecca of Southern sixties soul, Muscle Shoals, Alabama.Excellent production, songwriting, musicianship, vocals...the works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG3Z3O6HZMCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3BXVRK#wasThisHelpful","R1RG3Z3O6HZMCN","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't view myself as a fan of new age music, yet I enjoy everything by this remarkably gifted composer and master of the guitar and other instruments.  How he comes up with gorgeous melody after gorgeous melody, so often lilting, intriguing and exotic, tropically breezy and refreshing (and with Latin motifs) is a secret for the ages, new or otherwise.  Phenomenal blend of guitars, acoustic and electric (and sitar on two tracks) and enjoyable percussion that is almost always strangely soothing.The opening track ""Passage to Paradise"" (so many of his titles are beautiful, inviting and exotic in and of themselves) is a paragon of this formula of musical loveliness; while the closer ""Peruvian Joy"" is sheer acoustic perfection - and will leave you joyful.  In-between, we get a few more tracks than usual of the electric variety that brush up against pop-rock and are not all that distant from some of Carlos Santana's purely instrumental work.  His uncharacteristic title for one of these, ""Strat Your Stuff,"" reveals his affinity with some of the slightly edgier guitar guys.It may appear to be a contradiction in terms, but this is an intensely pleasant 52 minutes of music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6AD120LXIXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGQTC88#wasThisHelpful","R2T6AD120LXIXD","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I didn't know better and you told me this album was from 1972, I would believe it - and that's a compliment to the timeless, vintage nature of what 79-year-old R&B/soul-blues harp (harmonica) master Billy Boy Arnold and producer/guitarist Duke Robillard have put together here (13 years after their excellent collaboration ""Boogie 'n' Shuffle"").Arnold's wailing Sonny Boy Williamson [I]-influenced blues harp is always a highlight, but it's his astounding versatility that really carries the day here: everything from 1940s Louis Jordan jump blues to electric blues, to 1950s and '60s R&B, to early-'60s soul jazz, to late-'60s/early-'70s soul.  And he can really deliver the goods vocally in every one of these genres with his uniquely compelling, soulful and emotive, been-through-it-all singing.With 14 songs (including eleven covers of other artists) the highlights abound, but special mentions must go to the deeply emotive seven-and-a-half-minute gem of a performance on B.B. King's ""Worried Dream"" from 1967 (featuring standout electric blues guitar work by Robillard) and the 1960 soul-jazz classic ""Work Song.""  The latter receives its best vocal version since lyricist (and fellow Chicagoan) Oscar Brown, Jr.'s original interpretation.  Arnold's warm, sincere and confessional tone offers a different take on it and is so convincing that if I had the power I would see that he (the narrator of the tale) is immediately released from hard labor on the chain gang!Being a big fan of '60s and early-'70s soul, I am particularly pleased with his enthusiastic cover of Ray Charles's 1962 hit ""Don't Set Me Free"" (with searing saxes and trumpet, as well as Raelettes-style backing vocals), Mack Rice's undervalued ""Coal Man"" from 1969, the propulsive 1971 Ann Peebles B-side ""99 Lbs.,"" and Joe Tex's brilliant 1972 social message song ""A Mother's Prayer"" (which unfortunately was largely overlooked as the flipside of his funky mega-hit ""I Gotcha"").The only misstep is that Arnold's repetitious, one-joke, double-entendre novelty-song closer ""Keep On Rubbing,"" at six-minutes duration, goes on three times too long for sober ears (just a minor blip after thirteen very solid-to-superb tracks).This is the work of a true Chicago living legend and should not be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X9QHWDPV1I4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYK0U72#wasThisHelpful","R1X9QHWDPV1I4T","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(""Security"" was originally a lesser R&B hit in 1964 for Otis Redding, who wrote it.)Note that other big hits that resulted from this North-South collaboration (Bobby Moore & the Rhythm Ace's ""Searching for My Love,"" Etta James's ""Tell Mama,"" etc.) have been included in prior Fame compilations by Kent Soul.If you are expecting something special from a 24-track, 65-minute Kent Soul collection of late-1960s Chicago Chess Records artists recording with the phenomenal Muscle Shoals, Alabama musicians at Fame Studios under the supervision of Rick Hall, you are not going to be disappointed.Three of the four female Chess artists who were sent down there came out with hits, especially native Chicagoan Laura Lee and Etta James, the latter whose stalling R&B/soul-superstar career was resuscitated by the new Southern surroundings and tightly focused atmosphere.  New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas's Chess output merited much greater success than what you see above, as the three tracks appearing here amply demonstrate.  The fourth outstanding female Chess artist, Mitty ""I Had a Talk with My Man"" Collier (originally from Birmingham, Alabama) is heard in a pair of previously unissued performances, including a particularly poignant take on the Don Gibson country ballad chestnut ""Too Soon to Know.""  The unusually deep rasp in her voice was due to vocal cord problems that led to a temporary cessation of her singing career.On the male side, we get three excellent tracks by the deep southern (Montgomery, Alabama-based) soul combo Bobby Moore & the Rhythm Aces, who had landed the very first Chess hit recorded at Fame (in '66), the national soul top ten and pop top 30 crossover smash ""Searching for My Love"" with their stellar vocalist Chico Jenkins.  How their powerhouse plaintive ballad ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" with its majestic soul horns, went nowhere is a bit of a mystery.None of the other male artists who went down to Fame scored hits.  Maurice and Mac, who split from The Radiants (of ""Voice Your Choice"" fame), sought to emulate Sam & Dave to no avail despite their fairly solid songs and very solid performances.  Singer-songwriter Lee Webber is positively Wilson Pickett-esque in his soul stylings, especially on his ultra-funky reading of the Beatles' ""Good Day Sunshine.""  This one is guaranteed to grab multiple spins.A real find here is the Fame tenor sax man Charles (""Charlie"") Chalmers whom Chess recruited to record a soul-jazz instrumental LP (which was given the tacky title ""Sax and the Single Girl,"" a play on a popular book and movie of the era).  Three undeniably cool tracks are included and are among my favorites.This set is full of rarities, and the overall quality never wanes.Kudos once again to compiler and sleeve notes author Tony Rounce for his peerless work.  As ever with Ace/Kent Soul, the sound mastering is impeccable, and the 16-page booklet - in addition to being so informative - is attractively adorned with photos and record realia.For anyone into this exhaustive Fame compilation series, there should be absolutely no hesitation about this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GY3ZZ0MFX2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01130DT1M#wasThisHelpful","R3GY3ZZ0MFX2N","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

All of the label's charting tracks (listed above) are included, plus all of its 12 other A-sides, for a total of 21 tracks, plus two previously unissued acetate duets with Granahan and Janie Grant (not that these are of any real interest beyond historical, I suppose.)The standout talents are clearly the ones who performed on the label's two biggest hits:  1) The New Jersey girl trio the Angels, who did a gloriously harmonized take on the 1957 easy listening standard ""'Til.""  Their more age-appropriate early-'62 follow-up ""Cry Baby Cry"" was even more affecting, IMO, even if it didn't burn up the charts to same extent as its predecessor.  Unluckily for Granahan and the label, the girls bolted for the Mercury subsidiary Smash; and true to that label's moniker they quickly broke through with one of the biggest hits of 1963, My Boyfriend's Back,"" a much tougher-sounding record and an oldies classic.  2) James Ray, a diminutive 20-year-old homeless Harlem kid with a powerful and soulful voice, was brought aboard by songwriter Rudy Clark to be a demo singer; but he proved ideal for the hybrid pop/R&B Clark song ""If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody,"" which became a sizable crossover hit.  The excellent Clark-penned follow-up ""Itty Bitty Pieces"" was more raucous and narrowly missed the top 40 (while inexplicably being passed over by R&B radio).  Unsurprisingly, these were the two recording acts who got to record the label's only two LPs.  A brilliant extra is the inclusion here of the James Ray LP track ""I've Got My Mind Set on You,"" which I'll take any day over the George Harrison remake 25 years later.  Sadly, Ray reverted to his drug habit (only this time presumably with a bit more cash on hand) and didn't live beyond his early twenties.  (The liner notes have him not making it to his 22nd birthday.)Also on the label, 15-year-old Janie Grant (real name: Rose Marie Casilli) came up with her own first two charting A-sides reflecting her young romantic experiences, ""Triangle"" and ""Romeo.""  The former went top 30 in both Billboard and Cashbox. (Incidentally, ""Triangle,"" whose original session tape is missing, gets a superb DCS [Digital Constructed Stereo] makeover.)  Her next top side, ""Unhappy Birthday,"" was penned by future '60s superstar songwriter Jeff Barry (""Da Doo Ron Ron,"" ""Then He Kissed Me,""  ""Be My Baby,"" ""Baby I Love You,"" ""Sugar Sugar,"" etc.) but went nowhere.  The song is excessively self-pitying, yet it's clearly a thematic forerunner of Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"" without the Judy and Johnny name-drops.  She got back on the charts twice more: with an actual ""Johnny"" tune, ""Oh Johnny,"" which dates back to 1917 (!); and the gimmicky, of-the-moment song ""That Greasy Kid Stuff,"" which referred to a TV commercial for Vitalis hair tonic.  That was the label's final charting record.Granahan's own '61 records were cool ones: an uptempo version of ""Unchained Melody"" and a high-flyin' ""Dance Girl Dance.""  And for the epitome of obscure 1961 Caprice vocal cool, we have one-non-hit-wonder Jesse Dean's vocal version of the classic Jerry Lordan instrumental ""Apache,"" a #1 monster hit for the Shadows in the UK and a #2 U.S. hit by Jorgen Ingmann.A fine 12-page accompanying booklet, containing photos, informative liner notes and the label's singles discography, is included.For anyone who disparages this era of youth-oriented American pop (1960-63) preceding the British Invasion, you might wish to reconsider somewhat after listening to this CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R114YK04L8FJ30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000U66BGG#wasThisHelpful","R114YK04L8FJ30","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The only surprise here is that the actual song ""Time and the River"" (known best for the original 1960 Nat King Cole hit version) does not appear.  What is completely unsurprising is that David Sanborn - in his 25th LP and 40th year as a lead recording artist - comes through again with a terrific effort and another dazzling display of alto sax virtuosity.  I would also expect no less from a Marcus Miller production, as bassist Miller and saxophonist Sanborn have a collaboration on record going back 35 years.Sanborn's alto playing is as expressive, emotive, impassioned and soulful as ever, and the participation of the exceptional Afro-Cuban percussionist Javier Diaz makes this record even more refreshing and rhythmically exciting.  A spectacular choice for a cover, especially given Diaz's involvement, is D'Angelo's collaboration with Roy Hargrove, ""Spanish Joint,"" from D'Angelo's 2000 album ""Voodoo.""  It's a funky Latin sizzler all the way.  Marcus Miller's original song contribution, ""Seven Days Seven Nights,"" is strongly melodic and creates the impression of a kind of Latin-jazz ""Take Five.""  ""A La Verticale"" is a stunning opener with a brilliant arrangement featuring eleven instruments, including blistering electric guitar work by Yotam Silberstein in the second half when this track really takes flight.  By way of contrast, the closer is a short, simple, languid and lovely instrumental duet between Sanborn and pianist Roy Assaf on David Amram's theme from the 2004 version of the film ""The Manchurian Candidate.""  I admire all of these tracks immensely but I'll give the edge to his original, ""Ordinary People,"" with its deep Latin-soul groove and Ricky Peterson on Hammond organ.Sanborn is a master at working with vocalists, especially soulful ones, and we get a pair of fine guest vocal performances here: Larry Briggs on ""Can't Get Next to You,"" the 1969 and 1970 soul smash by the Temptations and Al Green, respectively (this version hews much closer to the funky Memphis groove of Green and his producer Willie Mitchell); and the sublimely soulful Randy Crawford doing her compelling best on ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" the swirling Oscar-winning ballad from 1968 (the film ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") by Michel Legrand and Alan & Marilyn Bergman.  This is the finest version of it, IMO, since Dusty Springfield's in 1969.  (For music trivia fans: the original version was sung by the late Noel Harrison, son of Rex.)42:21 passes very quickly and enjoyably when listening to this outstanding music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C43YOL2UPK4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7XCLO0#wasThisHelpful","R3C43YOL2UPK4P","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Considered the companion compilation to the previously well-received ""Finders Keepers: Motown Girls 1961-1967"" (which I reviewed 7/27/13 and also gave 4 stars to), this one is not quite up to it in quality - but only because it contains nothing that was issued in its day - whereas its distaff predecessor contained nine released recordings, including one by the Supremes, as well as one of Mary Wells's greatest hits.  So, not a completely level playing field.Motown did not bring in untalented performers or producers, so there is nothing here that is not competently rendered.  The problem in many cases was a logjam of releases causing tracks to get lost in the shuffle.  In some other cases, the songs themselves are undistinguished and not nearly up to the talent level of the performer(s).  A blatant example of this is Detroit's fantastic Fantastic Four (with their fantastic lead singer, James Epps) wasting their talent on a nothing of a song titled ""I Wanna Say I Love You.""  Another would be the phenomenal Edwin Starr getting stuck with the astoundingly trite ""The Sound of Love.""  One wonders who could do such a thing to this dynamo who recorded ""Twenty-Five Miles,"" ""War"" and its terrific sequel ""Stop the War Now.""  There's a bit too much of this sort of thing going on here to allow me to enthusiastically endorse this collection.  (But wait, there is justification for a four-star recommendation on the way.)In another case, we have a track that was left in an unfinished state - and it's one of my favorite things here: Jimmy Ruffin doing ""(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need"" nearly a year before the Temptations had the big hit on it with Jimmy's brother David Ruffin doing the lead vocal.  With no background voices or extra musical ""sweetening"" (beyond the basic instrumental track) and Jimmy's voice dominating the track, it is fascinating to listen to such a high-risk/high-reward soul singer pre-""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted.""  He is pure soul perfection deep into the song until he stays too long in his high register and breaks off key momentarily  (something that would have been easily fixed in a second take).  As compiler Keith Hughes says about this in his liner notes (excellent ones that cover each track in depth over 12 pages): ""[A]n unfinished [Jimmy Ruffin track] is better than none at all"" (and nothing else of his remains in the Motown vaults).In my estimation, the three completed most ""must-have"" tracks here are Marvin Gaye's January 1963 studio recording (as opposed to his issued ""live"" one) of the rousing ""Mojo Hannah,"" which would have been an obvious R&B-chart smash single (but probably one with too little pop crossover potential for Motown's liking); Frank Wilson's drop-dead gorgeous self-penned ballad ""Together 'Til the End of Time"" (which only made it to #125 pop as a 1966 Brenda Holloway release); and veteran soul star Chuck Jackson's powerhouse take (in late 1967) on Holland-Dozier-Holland's ""Where Did You Go,"" a 1965 Four Tops B-side.Overall, I found half of the 24 tracks to be enjoyable and a number of others to be listenable and/or of historical interest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26U0CXFYB198B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NB7LG20#wasThisHelpful","R26U0CXFYB198B","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If this newly recorded and released CD sounds like one of the best Memphis soul albums from 1967 or 1968 that you have never heard until now, it might have something to do with the fact that this Minneapolis-based septuagenarian soul singer par excellence Willie Walker recorded three singles at Goldwax in Memphis in those years (two of which were leased to Chess for distribution) and sounds just as fresh and strong in 2015.  I would situate his expressive soul voice somewhere between Johnnie Taylor and Syl Johnson, both of whom put in time recording in Memphis, for the Stax and Hi labels, respectively.  Great work creating a completely convincing and compelling traditional sixties-sounding southern-soul album (with some blues and country influences) by producers Rick Estrin and Kid Anderson for Jim Pugh's (who plays organ and piano here) Little Village Foundation label.There are too many stellar tracks (of the twelve total) to enumerate here, but I have to start with the track that joins five others as my favorite all-time soul adaptations of Beatles songs.  As previously constituted, my list included Ray Charles's covers of ""Yesterday"" (1967) and ""Eleanor Rigby"" (1968); Joe Cocker's versions of ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" (1968) and ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"" (1969) and Esther Phillips' ""And I Love Him"" (1965).  Joining these now five decades later is the version of ""Help!"" heard here, a duet with Curtis Salgado that is hard to hear any other way than as an authentic deep southern soul ballad of desperation interpreted with intense feeling.  There are a few others that stun as old-school southern-soul ballads as well, including Willie Walker's own heart-wrenching ""Not That I Care,"" Rick Estrin's touching original, ""What Love Can Do,"" and an emotionally devastating take on John Conlee's top ten hit country ballad from 1982, ""I Don't Remember You.""  And I certainly can't leave out the other big ballad here, ""If Nothing Ever Changes"" (the title song, no less), a majestic soul blues with a social conscience, penned by local Minneapolis pianist Bruce Pedalty.  This one also features a powerful blues guitar solo by co-producer Kid Anderson.It's not all ballads as the relentlessly propulsive Willie Walker version of Eddie Hinton's ""Everybody Meets Mr. Blue"" definitively establishes.  It's one of a pair of Eddie Hinton (""the white Otis Redding"") covers - the other being the closing mid-tempo consoler ""Hymn for the Lonely Hearts.""  The disc's opener ""Read Between the Lines"" (penned by Clarence Reid and Willie Clarke) is a hot Miami soul groover that also graced the late Michael Burks' final album ""Show of Strength.""  Rick Estrin finally unleashes his blues harp on Calvin Arnold's ""Funky Way"" (a 1967 song).  I mentioned Estrin's songwriting skill with the ballad ""What Love Can Do,"" but he also contributed ""Is That It?"" with its Johnnie Taylor ""Cheaper to Keep Her"" vibe; while both producers collaborated on the old-school-R&B-sounding ""Hands of Time"" with its lesson that boils down to time wounds all heels (""payback is a...drag"").  We also get a dose of mid-'70s funk/R&B with a version of Southside Movement's chilling and semi-creepy ""I've Been Watching You."" a Bobby Rush co-write.Did I say earlier I wasn't going to enumerate all twelve tracks?  I lied.Get this album if you're a '60s soul fan.  I hope they'll make more like this.  It may be 47-48 years later, but Wee Willie is still in his prime - possibly more so than ever!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUYACWXCYLM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC4ZMA2#wasThisHelpful","R3DUYACWXCYLM7","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this, her fifth studio album, it is pretty much indisputable that Jessy J is the queen of Latin-tinged contemporary jazz saxophone (and she is excellent when she picks up the flute as well).  She is an impeccable player, and this is her best piece of work from start to finish.Seven songs here are originals - all of these co-written by Jessy J, who was involved in nearly all of the album's arrangements and some of the production.  Guitarist Paul Brown produced, recorded and mixed a number of tracks and plays on five.  Keyboardist Gregg Karukas also guest stars on four of the Paul Brown-produced tracks.Lead single ""The Tango Boy"" is endlessly catchy, with its relentlessly pulsating beat, and features Jessy J's most uninhibited playing.  Let's just call it the contemporary jazz original lead single of the year.  The Cuban-flavored ""Paraso Mgico"" (which I reference in my title here) is a joyous Caribbean delight with Jessy J on flute and leading the colorful Spanish-language chorus.  Catch the cool and clever, perfect ending of the song.  ""Back to the Basics"" is melodic (as is everything she composes) but has a cool, funky Latin beat and a particularly fine piano solo by Norman Jackson.  Opening original ""Una Mas"" combines gracefulness and soulfulness and is followed by the sultry and dreamy title ballad (""My One and Only One"").  ""Cuba"" (we're back in the Caribbean!) has a swirling melody and features excellent drumming by Iajhi Hampden and a Wes Montgomery-esque guitar solo by Michael Angel.  ""Siempre"" features the sultry solo voice of Jessy J, as well as her flute stylings, and a very fine Rusian Sirota piano solo.Her three well-chosen cover versions, it seems to me, take her out of her usual bag and are the proof that she is the equal of anyone in this contemporary jazz (sometimes called ""smooth jazz"") genre.  Her take on The Cure's ""Love Song"" (or ""Lovesong"") is exquisite, possessing a beautiful, rich tenor tone.  The percussion, as well as Paul Brown's superb guitar backing and solo, all contribute to a stunning ballad track.  (IMO, this is one of the most gorgeous melodies to emerge from pop music in the last 20 years of the 20th century; and it's not hard to see why Adele would make it the only cover version on her second, incredibly successful LP, ""21."")  Then there's the Jessy J version of Toni Braxton's #1 R&B and pop smash from 1996, ""You're Makin' Me High.""  It's melodic, soulful and grooving - and 6:22 seldom goes by this quickly.  Paul Brown outdoes himself on this one with his tasty guitar licks and red-hot blues-jazz solo.And finally (and it is in the closing [Trk 10] position) there's my favorite of all, an absolutely loaded-to-the-brim (Jessy J is heard on three instruments; and there is some rare programming here, but it all works in building an astounding wall of sound) instrumental cover of the phenomenal song ""Strawberry Letter 23,"" composed by teenage genius Shuggie Otis in 1971, off his magnificent ""Freedom Flight"" LP, which I was lucky (or perceptive) enough to purchase at the time.  There is nothing more to say after this.Warning: This album is not recommended for jazz snobs and avant-gardists who prefer incoherent, out-of-tune saxophone screeching and fourteen-minute solos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MFSMJ8EAU4J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUVDJB0#wasThisHelpful","R2MFSMJ8EAU4J4","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At 6'5"" and 300 pounds (according to his blazingly brilliant autobiographical song ""Texas Bluesman"" - which also serves as a tribute to his Lone Star State musical heroes), Sugaray Rayford is one big bluesman possessing a full-throated baritone soul-blues voice that can really deliver the goods with compelling clarity and passion.  He executive-produced this CD and wrote or co-wrote every song (eight of the nine tracks on this 44-minute disc co-written with bassist Ralph Carter, who also co-produced), all of which are well-constructed and sound completely distinct from one another.The band, in addition to Carter, is first-rate and includes sax and trumpet (plus a guest appearance on the CD's one live track by blues harp virtuoso Bob Corritore), with guitarist Gino Matteo in stellar form throughout.I mentioned ""Texas Bluesman"" and should also give props to the paragon of Sugaray's impassioned singing, ""Take Away These Blues,"" as well as the socially committed pro-peace-and-brotherhood-and-the-environment ""Call Off the Mission""; the sincere and personal ""Live to Love Again"" (""if I live to love again, I'll be a better man next time""); the funky and hot ""Miss Thang""; and the enthusiastic invitation for fun on the ""Southside of Town.""  Only the nearly-seven-minute bedroom-seducer closer ""Slow Motion"" threatens to wear out its welcome (although I realize it's more for ""doing"" than listening - in which case seven minutes isn't long enough!).This is one of the year's best in the soul-blues arena.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OQGQH5KA63V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US68XVE#wasThisHelpful","R33OQGQH5KA63V","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chronology of Isley Brothers chart hits (1966-69) at Motown [soul / U.S. pop (highest position on a national chart listed) / U.K.]:""THIS OLD HEART OF MINE (IS WEAK FOR YOU)"" (1966)  [#2 soul / #12 pop / #3 UK (in '68)]""Take Some Time Out for Love"" (1966)  [#66 pop]""I Guess I'll Always Love You"" (1966)  [#31 soul / #52 pop / #11 UK (in '69)]""Got to Have You Back"" (1967)  [#47 soul / #93 pop]""That's the Way Love Is"" (1967)  [#105 pop]""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)""  [#22 soul / #97 pop]""Behind a Painted Smile"" (1968)  [#5 UK (in '69)]LP: ""This Old Heart of Mine"" (1966)  [#15 soul / #140 pop]The question is whether or not the Isleys should have stayed with their own new T-Neck label in '65 instead of joining Motown, where as you can see they only had one top 20 U.S. hit during these prime years of the 1960s.  After they left Motown and resumed on T-Neck in '69, all their first record ""It's Your Thing"" did was go to #1 soul (spending four weeks at the top) and #2 pop, en route to taking home the best R&B vocal group Grammy.  I for one am glad they went to Motown, if for no other reason than they got to work with Holland-Dozier-Holland in their prime, which resulted in their classic hit ""This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),"" one that graced my collection at the time.  Had they not been there, some other group or artist would certainly have had a hit with it (it may actually be my favorite H-D-H song, which is really saying something!), but no one could have done it better.  That song and Ronald Isley's voice were made for each other.  Its follow-up, ""Take Some Time Out for Love,"" by its title sounds like a relaxed ballad, but instead it's rockin' R&B more like their earlier more raucous and raw pre-Motown stuff.Next best for me, after ""This Old Heart of Mine,"" is the intriguing and dramatic ""Behind a Painted Smile,"" from two years later, which inexplicably went nowhere in the U.S. yet climbed all the way to #5 in the UK in '69.  The following year something similar happened when Jimmy Ruffin's ""It's Wonderful,"" a non-charting Motown record in the U.S., rose to #6 in the U.K.  And speaking of Jimmy Ruffin, Disc 2, Trk 3 of this collection contains the unissued original version of ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" which bore the incongruous title of ""Smile.""  We hear the same basic backing track as on the immortal Jimmy Ruffin ballad, but with completely different lyrics, which are threadbare and don't come close to matching the majestic melody.  The song was altered to ""Crying in the Night"" and then finally ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted.""The Isleys' version of ""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)"" is relentlessly pulsating, and it's clear why it became a hit again just three years after Motown's Kim Weston had a #4 soul hit with it.  ""I Guess I'll Always Love You"" was a bouncy 1966 semi-hit (and another one that saw far greater success a few years later in Britain), but so often in this collection it's the Isleys' recordings of material done first by other Motown artists that we encounter.  This kind of recycling was par for the course at Motown but was ultimately not going to allow the group to get many breakout hits of their own.  Besides the competent covers of Marvin Gaye's ""Baby, Don't You Do It"" and ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)"" (there's a large area of overlap between Ronald Isley's and Marvin Gaye's voices), there are entirely too many tracks here that sound like they could be Marvin Gaye B-sides or LP tracks.  Not that I particularly mind that, as I liked those songs, and both Gaye and the Isleys gave their full commitment to everything they did during this period.  But for the Isleys' advancement, it was not a good thing that so much of the material they were given was not standing out from the pack.Other particularly strong cover versions are H-D-H's ""I Hear a Symphony,"" which would have been a huge hit for them had they gotten to Motown earlier and arm-wrestled the Supremes for it; ""Greetings (This Is Uncle Sam),"" which distinguishes itself from the Monitors' semi-hit version by specifically referring to the war in Vietnam (certainly Motown's first reference to it in song); the Four Tops' B-side ""Sad Souvenirs""; and an admirably rough take on Paul Revere & the Raiders' ""Good Thing.""  I would include ""Whispers (Gettin' Louder)"" in this list, but Jackie Wilson's soaring vocals on the original hit version just can't be matched.The emotive ballad ""Nevermore"" probably features the best vocal performance here among the unissued tracks  Two other notable ones are the Smokey Robinson-penned ""It's Out of the Question"" and ""Little Miss Sweetness.""There are unquestionably a few too many tracks that don't make much of an impression, but I can't penalize this collection for being TOO inclusive when there is so much of value here.  (Total running time for the 52 tracks/two discs: 2 hours, 25 minutes plus.)  The sound is excellent (the final eight tracks feature stereo or alternate mono versions [""I Guess I'll Always Love You"" is heard three ways]) and the booklet is attractive, although nowhere near as comprehensive or informative as what Ace compilations offer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8S6AYJIFV87B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L5R73K#wasThisHelpful","R8S6AYJIFV87B","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of a series of superb Ace/Kent Soul anthologies, this one may be the most fun due to the fact that the Monitors were so undeservedly obscure.  Sometimes referred to as a ""second-tier"" Motown act, with only five singles and one LP in a six-year period, ""third-tier"" might be more like it.  If it hadn't been for a regular local (Detroit) lounge gig, they couldn't have afforded to remain with Motown as long as they did.  More than for any particular recording, the group is undoubtedly most well known for its outstanding lead singer Richard Street, who subsequently became a Temptation for 24 years after being brought in as Paul Williams' replacement in 1971.  Street was also employed as a member of Motown's famous Quality Control Department and got to witness up close for a time all the label's great material winding up with other acts.This collection manages to cobble together the Monitors' sole LP (from 1968, which also happened to be their final release for the label), their five singles (all of whose A-sides were on the LP), their two non-LP B-sides, and twelve previously unreleased recordings, for a total of 26 tracks and a 70-minute running time.The fine title song of this collection (""Say You"") showed the Monitors at their mid-tempo smoothest.  It was the first of their four singles, but despite breaking big in their home town of Detroit, it only went to #36 soul nationally and did not cross over to pop at all.  Their second 1966 release, ""Greetings (This Is Uncle Sam),"" was their only semblance of a significant hit, reaching #21 soul in Billboard while barely squeezing into the top 100 of all three national pop charts at the time.  Originally a 1961 semi-novelty R&B harmony song by the early (integrated) Motown group The Valadiers, this lightweight take on being drafted into the military took on an entirely different, ironic tone in 1966 with the war in Vietnam then raging.  Suddenly, the line, ""Please don't take me, Uncle Sam"" could be heard as a genuine plea of protestation.One can easily make a case for the Monitors' two 1967 single A-sides being their best: ""Since I Lost You Girl,"" is a sizzler with an impassioned lead vocal by Richard Street, who co--wrote the song with co-Monitor Warren Harris and producers Harvey Fuqua and Johnny Bristol.  Chart-wise, It appeared only as ""bubbling under"" the Billboard pop Hot 100 [at #117].  Even better (and really sounding like a can't miss hit IMO, although it didn't chart nationally at all) is the William Weatherspoon/James Dean (of ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" fame) produced and co-penned ""Bring Back the Love.""  It's intense and insistent and really pleads its case, while the Motown Funk Brothers go to town on it.  Street, the record expert, thought it ""was the closest one [to being a big hit for the Monitors] out of all them; that if they'd played it, it should have been a hit.""1968 brought their last single, both sides of which were written and produced by Weatherspoon and Dean.  Top side ""Step by Step (Hand in Hand)"" cheerleads catchily for uniting in positive social action.  Not that much of an attention-grabber, but any social engagement in a Motown record was relatively rare prior to 1970.  The B-side ""Time Is Passin' By"" is yet another intense and compelling Weatherspoon/Dean composition right up there with ""Bring Back the Love.""On the1968 ""Greetings (We're the Monitors)"" LP, by far the best of the songs not already mentioned is their very deft cover of Jay & the Techniques' easily melodic ""Baby Make Your Own Sweet Music.""Nearly half of this collection is made up of previously unreleased tracks, and there is hardly a difference in quality between most of these and the released material.  For me, the most essential track of this whole collection is the one that Weatherspoon/Dean and ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" fans can't do without: ""Crying in the Night"" is the sped-up sibling of ""What Becomes...""  The history is a bit convoluted but suffice to say that ""What Becomes..."" and this one sprang up from the same source.  While on the subject of Motown classics, here also is an early version of ""Too Busy Thinking About My Baby,"" which morphed into a Marvin Gaye smash two years later.  Johnny Rivers twice paid homage to Motown with his hit covers of the Four Tops' ""Baby I Need Your Loving"" and Smokey & the Miracles ""Tracks of My Tears""; so why not (?) a reverse tribute with the Monitors taking on Johnny Rivers' own #1 record from 1966, ""Poor Side of Town,"" which Rivers wrote with producer Lou Adler.  It's a good one, heard here for the first time.  Also of note is the Monitors' first crack at the Smokey Robinson co-penned-and-produced ""The Letter.""  It's melodically coherent and insistent (as one expects from a Smokey song), with moving lyrics (another Smokey trait), and it has a cool arrangement with horns.  Alas, it too got shelved (and a new version appeared the following year as a David Ruffin LP track).Richard Street describes the Monitors' fate at Motown best when he states that the group got ""lost in the shuffle"" at Motown.Ace/Kent Soul does it again with its stellar sound mastering and deluxe 20-page accompanying booklet full of photos and color (featuring the de rigueur record jacket and label repros)...and especially 17 pages of comprehensive and informative liner notes (and detailed credits with each song's recording history) by co-compiler (with Tony Rounce) and Motown historian Keith Hughes.  And obviously, it really helps to have Richard Street's lucid commentary woven so seamlessly into the notes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3XFZ6AKS9XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VV42IK#wasThisHelpful","R1S3XFZ6AKS9XA","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can hardly believe that there is yet another outstanding Johnnie Taylor LP (this one from 1977) that I'm first hearing now all these years later.  It is essentially a Detroit album (produced by Don Davis) recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama - making it quite an unbeatable combination (the best of two soul worlds), one that reflects back to JT's real persona as a soul artist (without a trace of anything synthetic or disco: think JT at Stax) and presages his final stop as a recording artist way down south in Jackson, Mississippi at Malaco Records, where he would again consistently excel with his patented mix of soul, blues and occasional scooch of pop done soulfully.  This obscure, one-off effort for RCA came between charting albums for Columbia but charted nowhere itself (nor did the one single off it top-sided by the LP's leadoff track ""I Want You Back Again"").  Unfortunately, the previous few (post-Stax) years had found JT having to compromise for commercial success, which meant dropping the blues altogether and watering down the soul in favor of dance-oriented pop-funk.  This project got his soul-blues juices flowing again, and he delivered 32 minutes (eight tracks) of completely committed performances in the service of very good to excellent material.Up to now, when I have thought of the finest soul covers of 1960s pop and rock, the records that would spring to mind were Otis Redding doing the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction""; Ray Charles's takes on both of the Paul McCartney/Beatles' songs ""Yesterday"" and ""Eleanor Rigby,"" as well as Wilson Pickett doing ""Hey Jude""; and Bobby Womack's version of ""California Dreamin'.""  From this trouvaille of an LP, and joining their ranks, is JT's knockout reading of the Association's ""Never My Love.""  Call him ""Johnnie Taylor the all-out soul wailer"" on this rousing, emotive soul triumph that just keeps building all the way.  It's a powerhouse track featuring a terrific Wade Marcus arrangement with dramatic backing vocals.In addition to ""Never My Love,"" I recognized the mature and compassionate soul ballad ""I Worry About You"" from a 1968 Joe Simon single.  The rest are originals that all impress in their own way: ""Forgive and Forget"" is the closer and it takes us out with some heartfelt and authentic JT blues wailing.  ""Stop Half Lovin' These Women"" delivers a message the guys had better heed.  It features some down-home soul rapping, not unlike what Bobby Womack was becoming known for in the '70s while recording in Muscle Shoals (a style which can be traced back to Joe Tex in the mid-'60s).  His ode to frustration, ""Wanting What You Can't Have,"" begins with some unearthly JT screams as it moves into the territory of those relentless '70s ""blaxploitation""-type movie themes.  ""Heaven Bless This Home"" gets down to some serious prayerful pleading as JT calls out for his woman to come home for the sake of their children.  He doles out more advice to the guys on ""If You Really Love Your Girl (Show It),"" a sweet and sincere southern-soul-style ballad.I'm grateful to finally be able to hear this superbly recorded and performed Southern soul LP (that I didn't even know existed!) on a high-quality Fever Dream CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYR61LQ0ZO8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WNJ15RI#wasThisHelpful","R1HYR61LQ0ZO8X","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At 79, Buddy Guy may be the last surviving still actively recording link to both the blues of the Deep South and the 1960s Chicago electric blues scene.  I was wondering what he would do next (in 2015) now that we are definitively in the post-B.B. King era.  What I wasn't really expecting was this, one of his greatest albums ever.For the first six tracks of this 14-track, 59-minute disc, I was thinking this is very entertaining, very upbeat, sounds great, is well produced (by drummer Tom Hambridge, who wrote or co-wrote all twelve of the original songs here - five with Buddy); and although ""five-star""-worthy for sure, not necessarily one of his all-time best.  Then came Trk 7 and the stellar soul blues of ""Crying Out of One Eye"" (featuring the Muscle Shoals Horns) and a whole parade of fantastic tracks all the way through the closing pair of heart-felt tributes: to B.B. King (the stunning gospel-soul-blues duet ""Flesh & Bone"" with Van Morrison), and the other to his great mentor and friend Muddy Waters (the poignant and brilliantly played - on dual acoustic guitars [with Doyle Bramhall II] - ""Come Back Muddy"").Although the opening title track seeks to explain Buddy's lifelong (or at least since the age of two!) obsession with the guitar, it's Trk 8, ""Turn Me Wild,"" which contains his single best encapsulating refrain: ""The blues done turn me wild, dug deep down in my soul.""  ""Thick Like Mississippi Mud"" (Trk 12) is the real, deep southern stuff again with the Muscle Shoals Horns (who jumped on over to Nashville where this LP was recorded) and Buddy's plaintive and scorching 1957 Stratocaster guitar licks.Besides the moving B.B. King homage with Van Morrison, Trk 8 takes the cover version duet cake with a terrific R&B (accent on the ""B"") remake of Brook Benton & Dinah Washington's all-time classic from 1960, ""(Baby) You've Got What It Takes"" [the #1 R&B record of the year; and it even got to #2 pop in Cash Box], with Joss Stone doing an astoundingly effective job with the Dinah Washington part.  Both of them sound genuinely inspired.  Not to slight the other guest stars,  Billy Gibbons of Z.Z. Top provides a throaty vocal and blistering guitar alongside Buddy on the raucous, pounding  Texas shuffle ""Wear You Out"" (one of those early tracks I found so entertaining); and Kim Wilson of Fabulous Thunderbirds fame guests on harmonica (reminiscent of Junior Wells with Buddy) on Little Walter's ""Too Late"" (a Willie Dixon co-write from 1953), as well as on the spunky original, ""Kiss Me Quick.""Lastly, something has to be said about Trk 10, another masterpiece (penned by Guy, Hambridge and Gary Nicholson), called ""Crazy World.""  If you have always wanted to hear Buddy Guy express his deepest thoughts about the state of our beleaguered planet - socially, economically, ecologically; crying out against the injustices (as he backs himself with startlingly emotive ""wah-wah"" guitar riffs) - this is it.  Very powerful, without trying to be overpowering - and an original-song-of-the-year candidate with ""Crying Out of One Eye"" (if I have anything to say about it...which of course I don't). I have nothing else to say at this time, as I need to listen to this phenomenal album again (for the I've-lost-count-of-how-many-eth-time in these past few days).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWUFREXC878N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGVMKCE#wasThisHelpful","RMWUFREXC878N","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bobby Womack ""Across 110th Street""/""Facts of Life""/""Lookin' for a Love Again"" Charly [UK] hit chronology (peak positions on national soul [Billboard] and pop [Billboard or Cash Box] singles charts):""Across 110th Street"" (1973)  #19 soul / #49 pop""Nobody Wants You When You're Down and Out"" (1973)  #2 soul / #29 pop""I'm Through Trying to Prove My Love to You"" (1973) * #80 soul / #101 pop* B-side of ""Nobody Wants You...""""Lookin' for a Love"" (1974)  #1 soul (for 3 wks) / #8 pop""You're Welcome, Stop On By"" (1974)  #5 soul / #53 popOn the Billboard LP chart:""Across 110th Street"" (1973)  #6 soul / #50 pop""Facts of Life"" (1973)  #6 soul / #37 pop""Lookin' for a Love Again"" (1974)  #5 soul / #85 pop""Across 110th Street"":  Isaac Hayes's ""Theme from Shaft"" won the 1971 Academy Award for best original song, and that seemed to assuage the Hollywood establishment's guilt over ignoring black singer-songwriters; so much so that the following year they completely bypassed the greatest film soundtrack/song combination ever (IMO) in Curtis Mayfield's ""Superfly"" original score and song ""Freddie's Dead.""  To this I would add the third greatest ""blaxploitation"" film theme (in three consecutive years), Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street,"" which he wrote with his soundtrack collaborator J.J. Johnson.  Again, no nominations, but it's a keenly observed, dynamic recording that was worthy of greater recognition.  The LP is almost equally divided between Womack vocals and J.J. Johnson & His Orchestra instrumentals; and it's all cool stuff, although not nearly at the level of the title song (which also appears in instrumental form with powerful, emphatic horns and a hot organ solo at the end).  Two other fine Womack songs here are the relaxed and resigned, mid-tempo ""If You Don't Want My Love"" and the relentless soul-blues-funk of ""Do It Right,"" punctuated by Bobby's James Brown-esque (or Wilson Pickett-esque) soul screams.""Facts of Life"" is most notable for the strength and variety of its cover versions, starting with what I think is his Womack's all-time best in this category: his take on the brilliant 1920s blues song ""Nobody Wants You When You're Down and Out,"" made famous by Bessie Smith's immortal 1929 rendition.  His mentor Sam Cooke also recorded it in 1961. which certainly would have inspired him, but remarkably he perfectly adapts the song to his own voice and style, rendering it virtually unrecognizable as anything other than a Bobby Womack record.  His cover of Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers' ""That's Heaven to Me"" is a direct and beautiful tribute to Cooke.  ""I'm Through Trying to Prove My Love to You"" is sheer Bobby Womack in its testifying style straight out of the mold of his earlier hit ""That's the Way I Feel About Cha.""  The last three tracks are all late-'60s ('67-68) covers:  Burt Bacharach-Hal David's ""The Look of Love,"" originally recorded by Dusty Springfield as the theme from the James Bond film ""Casino Royale,"" ""A Natural Man,"" which is his gender-reversed take on Carole King/Gerry Goffin's song for Aretha Franklin - one of her great signature recordings at Atlantic; and Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower,"" which Jimi Hendrix made his own with his transcendent electric guitar-powered psychedelic-blues-rock version.  ""Look of Love"" is done in the manner of his gritty-cool '60s covers of the pop hits ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and ""California Dreamin'""; ""A Natural Man"" is subdued and poignantly soulful; and the closing ""All Along the Watchtower"" gets an emphatic soul reading with searing guitar backing, but it's no match for Hendrix.The ""Lookin' for a Love Again"" LP is dominated by the fantastically propulsive title song, which was Bobby Womack's biggest hit single ever, both soul (the #3 soul hit of 1974) and pop (his only ten pop-chart record ever).  Of historical note, it was a remake of the biggest hit The Valentinos (a.k.a. the five Womack Brothers) ever had: the gospel-influenced soul rocker (featuring an 18-year-old Bobby) on Sam Cooke's SAR label reached #8 R&B and was clearly ahead of its time.  Also here is the 1974 follow-up hit soul single with an easy-going, conversational style, ""You're Welcome, Stop On By,"" as well as the smoothly delivered slice of Southern soul, ""You're Messing Up a Good Thing.""This is an excellent collection solidly housed in great-looking hard-cover book form (featuring a scene from ""Across 110th Street"" on the cover) with secure, smooth-plastic disc holders on both sides of a 16-page booklet replete with full-color cover art (and additional photos), three pages of song listings and writing credits, and seven pages of informative liner notes by Roger Dopson.  In tandem with the 2015 Charly box set ""Preacher"" (which I reviewed 7/24/15), all of Bobby Womack's first eight LPs are included in two neat packages with first-rate sound mastering.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RNGOGG5NZ6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00835UWAC#wasThisHelpful","R24RNGOGG5NZ6V","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second Real Gone CD in just over three months to unearth a ""lost"" Dusty Springfield (unissued) LP from the turn of the 1970s.  First came ""Faithful"" (which I reviewed 5/5/15), intended for U.S. release on Atlantic in 1971; and now this one for Philips recorded in London in '70 and '71.  Some of these tracks did come out on a ""hodgepodge"" (meant disparagingly by critics) British LP in 1972, as did others on much later CD anthologies.  But now, as with ""Faithful,"" we get a coherent and complete collection of what could have been had Philips originally included all of this material on a single LP, along with concurrent non-LP singles.  (A major problem in both cases was that Dusty prematurely bolted for ABC/Dunhill.  The story is beyond convoluted, but it receives full explication in Joe Marchese's six pages of comprehensive, highly informative liner notes.)What matters at this time is the quality of the music and Dusty's work - and there are no problems at all on that score.  There are absolutely gorgeous, beautifully orchestrated ballad covers (Michel Legrand/Alan & Marilyn Bergman's ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?""; Charles Aznavour's ""Yesterday When I Was Young""; the Rascals' ""How Can I Be Sure""; Leon Russell's ""A Song for You""); more ace songwiter material (Carole King/Gerry Goffin's ""I Wasn't Born to Follow""; Jimmy Webb's ""Mixed Up Girl""); soft and sensual bossa nova songs (A.C. Jobim's ""Come for a Dream"" [title tune of this collection]; the enigmatic ""See All Her Faces"" [title song of the 1972 ""hodgepodge"" LP]; ""Goodbye,"" composed specifically for her by Spike Milligan); pure pop (""Let Me Down Easy"" and the Roger Cook/Roger Greenaway/Tony Burrows hit-factory-sounding ""Sweet Inspiration""); as well as recent U.S. girl soul (Betty Wright's ""Girls Can't Do What the Guys Do""; The Honey Cone's ""Girls It Ain't Easy""; and The Glass House's ""Crumbs Off the Table"").I happen to appreciate Dusty's mastery of all these genres and have no objections to their being mixed together.  The ""hodgepodge"" charge seems too facile for me, since you know that if there were nothing but soft ballads and pop, it could just as easily be dismissed by naysayers as ""unadventurous,"" ""monotonous,""or the lazybones' favorite, ""boring.""As with the earlier ""Faithful, I can't recommend this collection highly enough for Dusty Springfield fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190QQ6RX3V9JS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZB7Q9UC#wasThisHelpful","R190QQ6RX3V9JS","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1963, as a kid in my second year of collecting 45 rpm records, the very first time I heard the Cascades' ""Rhythm of the Rain"" on the radio I knew where my next dollar was going.  It came between Del Shannon's ""Little Town Flirt"" and Skeeter Davis's ""The End of the World,"" and I bought it at the same time as The Rockin' Rebels' instrumental ""Wild Weekend.""  (Somehow I had managed to scrape two dollars together!)  This was late January outside Chicago, but the elements were not going to hold me back.  In my world at the time, ""Rhythm of the Rain"" was a masterpiece pop record, and I have never wavered from that view.  It got to #2 in Chicago on WLS radio (890 AM), #2 nationally in Cash Box, #3 nationally in both Billboard and Music Vendor, and even crossed the pond reaching #5 in the UK.  Especially cool was the fact that ""Rhythm"" was able to cross over onto the R&B charts and place as high as #7.The follow-up 45 came along in April.  In Chicago, only the moving and gorgeous ballad ""The Last Leaf"" got played, and it rose to #14 on the WLS Silver Dollar Survey.  However, nationally the other excellent side ""Shy Girl"" received more initial airplay until ""The Last Leaf"" took over.  This radio exposure split was a setback for ""Leaf,"" the higher charting side, which only got to #42 in Cash Box and #60 on the Billboard Hot 100.  (Due to being tapped out from my prior purchases I couldn't get this fine double-sided hit 45.)The big selling points to this Teensville collection from Sydney, Australia are:1) its thoroughness: this is by far the most comprehensive disc covering the Cascades era with John Claude Gummoe (founding member, lead singer and writer of ""Rhythm of the Rain""), as it contains all of the group's recordings on Valiant and RCA (and four unreleased tracks), plus significant material from three other labels.2) its 33 tracks and total running time of 80:14 (not a misprint; it exceeds 79:59 by 15 seconds)3) its flawless all-stereo sound4)  the neat 12-page booklet with an introduction by John Claude Gummoe, Mr. ""Rhythm of the Rain"" himself; seven pages of concise, informative liner notes; color label scans; photos of the group, as well as of Gummoe alone from 1960 (pre-Cascades) and 1995.5) the music itself, obviously; but of special note are four of the last five tracks:- Trk 29: ""I Bet You Won't Stay"" (Liberty/1965) - written for the Cascades by a British fan of the group, none other than Ray Davies of the Kinks!  It has a cool jangly mid-'60s British beat sound, with emphatic vocals, and is one of the group's finest records.  How it could have been largely ignored is anyone's guess.  (I suppose it's possible that no one was expecting this type of record from this group.  Too bad - but at least we can hear it now!)-Trks 30 & 31:  ""Truly Julie's Blues"" and ""Cheryl's Goin' Home"" (Arwin [label]/1966) - a pair of top-notch Bob ""Elusive Butterfly"" Lind covers, the latter of which ""bubbled under"" all three national top 100 singles charts at the time.- ""bonus"" track 33: ""Rhythm of the Rain (Millennium Version)"" [2005 recording] - John Claude Gummoe's beautifully produced home-studio-recorded (with storm and rain effects) updated version of his classic.  It's dreamier and more reflective (hence slower) than the original, and his voice had matured and mellowed into magnificence, maintaining an easy and natural high register.Overall, this is an outstanding collection.  For Cascades/""Rhythm of the Rain"" fans it is an essential one.  By dint of its very thoroughness though, a number of rather instantly forgettable lesser tracks - trite, saccharine romantic (young love) ballads - tend to weigh it down a bit in the middle; however, the Cascades' commitment and sheer harmonic talent are always there, making even these tracks listenable.  The numerous musical high points - especially the two towering versions of ""Rhythm of the Rain"" - along with the superb production and presentation, make this an exceptional single-group sixties compilation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38J8XUBZSMZ3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O24LZNQ#wasThisHelpful","R38J8XUBZSMZ3I","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No question, this is largely diatribe with a lot of repetitive overkill and heavy-handedness; and attempting to listen to the entire 51 minutes in a single sitting will become ponderous, for sure.  Yet, one can admire Neil's single-minded focus and be grateful for a singer-songwriter (backed by an outstanding group of musicians) who is not preoccupied with self and who is willing to take on what he considers to be a broader global danger.  I find it impossible to doubt the sincerity of his belief that hypercorporatist greed is destroying our way of life and our freedom - and ultimately poses an existential threat to our planet.Two of his songs talk about love but not in a mundane way.  ""People Want to Hear About Love"" is an engagingly tuneful rocker that deals with the subject ironically, while ""A New Day for Love"" offers a heartfelt message of hope for the future.The country-tinged rocker ""Workin' Man"" pulls no punches in describing the plight of small farmers, whom mega-agribusiness is out to crush (if they resist being wholly exploited) using its high-priced corporate attorneys (U.S. Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas - who was once one of these Monsanto ""men with briefcases"" - gets called out for his hypocrisy in this matter).""A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop,"" with its punny title and jaunty melody (featuring happy-go-lucky whistling, no less!) is all in-your-face irony, as its lyrics just continue to pile on the outrage to this upbeat tune.  The title track piles it on thick as well, only it's heavy, plodding, repetitious, long and drawn out.By the way, for anyone who thinks Neil Young sings off key, have you ever heard him before?  He has always sung in his OWN key!  There is nothing new to say on this score.  Q magazine's Mark Blake describes the ""grizzled and angry"" Young's voice as one that ""creaks like an un-oiled silo door.""  At least he said nothing new in a new way!  No doubt that the more layered the sound of a track is behind him, the better he sounds.What really makes this album a winner is the presence of a near masterpiece: the song ""Big Box"" (which calls out Walmart by name in one verse) gets everything right musically and lyrically.  It is an epic, superbly constructed track that really hits the bull's-eye.  Even with its 8:16 running time it doesn't seem too long.  I would almost go so far as to call it a ""Layla"" for this century, only political.From ""Big Box"": ""[Plundering, law-breaking] corporations [are getting] too big to fail, too rich for jail...some way, somehow we will prevail.""Write on, Neil!The DVD includes complete versions of every song as they are being recorded.

"The Fantastic Four were the rare case of a group that was hot until they joined Motown, hot again after they left Motown, but who had nearly nothing to show for their time there.  In fact, these native Detroiters' one hit record at Motown, ""I Love You Madly"" (not in this collection) originally came out on their previous label and was then transferred to Motown's Soul imprint (the label home of Jr. Walker & the All Stars, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Jimmy Ruffin).  At Motown they did not receive consistent support and were relegated to second-tier (arguably third-tier) status.  (One of their members called it being ""put on the shelf."")  However, they themselves were as consistent as could be, as one can hear across the 25 tracks found here: 12 which were for a projected LP that never materialized, and 13 additional tracks.  Both sides of their three issued 1969-1970 singles (the only ones recorded at Motown) are here.  I knew of this Detroit group when they were with their previous label (Ric Tic) and had their 1968 soul-chart single ""I've Got to Have You,"" but I never heard these three before.The Fantastic Four were blessed with an outstanding, powerhouse lead singer in the portly form of ""Sweet"" James Epps, whom I would situate voice-wise between Darrell ""Open the Door to Your Heart"" Banks and Motown's David Ruffin.  Since the projected LP was going to be called ""How Sweet He Is,"" there was no doubt that the plan was to spin James off as a solo act.For me, the two most outstanding tracks by a mile from ""How Sweet He Is,"" which should have been A-side singles in my estimation, are their fantastic (hey, it's the right adjective for these!), exquisitely rendered cover versions of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell's beautiful duet ballad ""If This World Were Mine"" (written by Marvin) and Jerry Butler's cleverly tuneful ""Just Can't Forget About You.""  Both of these in their original releases had been B-sides and thus way undervalued. - meaning, there could have been huge hit potential to exploit.  ""If This World Were Mine"" was the flip side of ""If I Could Build My Whole World Around You"" and did not receive anywhere near the kind of attention it deserved: only #27 soul nationally and #68 pop.  Butler's ""Just Can't Forget About You,"" as the flip side of the #1 soul (and #16 pop) smash ""Hey, Western Union Man,"" was completely ignored.  The singles that were put out on the Fantastic Four were solid but just wouldn't have stood out from the crowd enough to have had much impact (that and the lack of promotion).The bonus tracks feature a killer version of Johnny Bristol's ""I'm Still a Struggling Man,"" which went on to become Edwin Starr's follow-up hit to ""Twenty-Five Miles.""  Three Bobby Taylor-produced tracks - ""Loving You (Is Hurting Me), ""I Hate Myself for Loving You"" and ""Fan the Flame"" - are excellent, emotive (as the titles suggest) midtempo ballads.  (""Fan the Flame,"" co-written by Smokey Robinson, originally appeared on a Temptations LP.)  The uptempo, very catchy and well-constructed ""In a Bad Way"" would have been another fine choice for a Fantastic Four single - it had originally been a 1964 Freddie Gorman single on Ric Tic and was worthy of a second chance.This is a typically outstanding Ace/Kent Soul compilation.  The sound mastering is flawless - and included is the obligatory Ace booklet with photos that never fails.  Co-compiler Tony Rounce's six pages of liner notes tell the Fantastic Four's story about as well as it can be told in this format.  Sadly, as we learn in the final paragraph, none of the original Fantastic Four survived to see this ""long-overdue retrospective of their time at Motown...""  But Fantastic Four fans now have this pleasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YBOQ8NWG07P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XAB4ZRU#wasThisHelpful","R1YBOQ8NWG07P1","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Jazz chanteuse Carmen McRae's recording - produced in London by Johnny Keating, replete with theremin - is a near masterpiece among Brian Wilson/Beach Boys cover versions.  Betty Everett's Gene-and-Billy-Page-produced ""God Only Knows"" is an emphatically soulful mid-'70s take on the classic tune.  And Kirsty MacColl's ""You Still Believe in Me"" qualifies as an outright masterpiece, taking into account all aspects of the multi-layered production supporting her magnificent, deeply connected reading of the poignant ""Pet Sounds"" ballad from fifteen years earlier.The problem with this compilation, though, involves the other twelve tracks which do not make my cut.  Most of them are concentrated in the middle of the disc, creating kind of a doughnut effect.  Tracks 11 through 17 take the inconsequentiality cake, with Jay & the Americans' ""Things Are Changing"" (a Bob Dylan rip-off title) hitting rock bottom (in more ways than one).  It's actually a bizarre piece of Phil Spector-produced propaganda (in the form of an extended public service announcement) urging poor minority kids to go out and get jobs which were supposedly so plentiful.  This is an even preachier and more dumbed-down quasi sequel to Jay & the Americans' jingoistic 1963 hit that proclaimed, ""Only in America, land of opportunity...""  This feels like the longest 2:50 ever captured on vinyl and would appear to be here only as a sop to completists.(Incidentally, a suddenly distracted Homer Simpson stopped reading this review following my ""doughnut"" and ""cake"" references.)As usual, one can trust Ace Records to provide the best sound mastering possible, along with a deluxe 20-page full-color booklet chock-full of eye-popping realia and comprehensive liner notes covering each track and artist.The effort is here - and there is very little I had ever heard before - but getting through a dozen of the lesser tracks (just about half) felt like a bit of a slog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14Q1ZRHJFSZ00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XAB4ZUM#wasThisHelpful","R14Q1ZRHJFSZ00","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leon Bridges in his recording dbut takes us back further than most retro-soul artists who concentrate on the 1965-1975 time frame.  Clearly inspired by Sam Cooke, he ushers us back to the R&B and early gospel-tinged soul sounds I would situate more in the vicinity of 1957-1964, paralleling Cooke's heyday.  Bridges, who is from Fort Worth, puts an unmistakable Southern spin on these tracks, evoking New Orleans and a bit of Memphis.  Remarkably, there are no covers - only brand new, very authentic-sounding originals co-written by the artist.  He possesses a sterling, smoky-textured soul voice that is all his own, even if it does at times contain distant echoes of Cooke.  He can bend notes with the best of them and occasionally displays melismatic skills recalling Aaron Neville but in moderation and without the falsetto register.Within the somewhat narrow format he has chosen for this outing, each song seems distinctive to me (successive listens bear this out):  ""Smooth Sailin'"" is a cool and classy groover with organ, a pulsating beat and emphatic backing vocals by Brittni Jessie; ""Pull Away"" is an R&B ballad reminiscent of Sam Cooke at the turn of the '60s; while the closer ""River"" is the most overtly Cookian song, seemingly derived from the opening line of ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" (""I was born by the river..."").  ""Twistin' and Groovin'"" may suggest Cooke's ""Twistin' the Night Away"" by its title, but the inspiration here is clearly Wilbert Harrison's 1959 crossover smash ""Kansas City"" - this is bouncy, old-school blues-rockin' R&B with blues guitar and Lee Allen-style New Orleans sax.  The three songs at the top - the title track ""Coming Home,"" ""Better Man,"" and ""Brown Skin Girl"" - will completely draw you into this intriguing alternate retro-soul world of his; the aforementioned ""Smooth Sailin'"" in the four-spot will refresh; but then prepare to be bowled over by the phenomenal gospel-soul melodic beauty of ""Shine"" with its irresistibly churchy female backing voices; and possibly even more so by the tender, haunting quality of the ode to his mom (from New Orleans) ""LIsa Sawyer,"" replete with dreamy sax and hypnotic backing vocals.The album's running time is a little over 34 minutes but that would have been typical of LPs from the period being reflected here.  I was left wondering what this outstanding young talent is going to do for an encore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C69VC3YUQCRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVZUPIU#wasThisHelpful","R2C69VC3YUQCRZ","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is definitely not up to five-star level of its 2014 predecessor (""Dor L.A. Soul Sides 1""), but it has enough worthwhile moments to recommend it: certainly Johnny Braff's ""This Girl Is a Good Girl,"" a 1970s Trinidadian import that sounds a bit like deep southern '60s soul  la Percy Sledge with unusual lyrics; ""Nitty Gritty City"" by the girl-group The Swans (1966) which suggests second-tier Motown (but the beloved kind!); the solid soul ballad ""I Look in the Mirror"" from 1968 by one Eddie Kool (unsurprisingly, not his real last name!); and ""I Only Cry Once a Day Now"" by The Puffs (talk about obscure girl groups!), which is transformed from maudlin to quirky-good by Gene Page's new (1966) arrangement of it.  A few too many of these records sound a bit out-of-date even for their time, though; and some of the attempts to update the label's sound (by trying to increase the social relevance or funk quotients) feel a bit awkward and/or imitative.This being an Ace/Kent Soul compilation, one can trust the sound remastering to be as good as it can be; and as usual, the accompanying booklet (16 pages) with compiler Ady Croasdell's liner notes (telling the well-researched stories behind each act and each track) and superlative color graphics is a real treat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9717NIF92ITY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GLVK06#wasThisHelpful","R9717NIF92ITY","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One listen to his amazingly soulful spin on the Mamas & the Papas' pop-folk smash from three years earlier, ""California Dreamin',"" attests to this.  When he wasn't doing likewise with the previous-generation oldies ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and ""Moonlight in Vermont,"" he was exhibiting his remarkable composing talent as a writer on seven of the twelve tracks.  No doubt the two best of these were his versions of his recent collaborations with Wilson Pickett, ""I'm in Love"" and ""I'm a Midnight Mover.""  His B-side of ""California Dreamin'"" titled ""Baby! You Oughta Thimk It Over,"" provides a preview for a number of his future compositions in the 1970s.  ""Love, the Time Is Now"" is a Memphis-style ballad clearly inspired by Sam Cooke and Otis Redding.Speaking of Memphis, all of these LPs were recorded in Memphis or in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, as he had learned from working with Wilson Pickett that that was where the best soul musicians (of the non-Motown stripe) were currently working.  Womack himself, of course, was a guitarist of note, which is why Ray Charles had hired him for his band a few years earlier (pre-Pickett).""My Prescription"" may top the list for most undervalued soul LP of 1970.  All it contained were seven (!) chart songs (counting a reprise of ""Fly Me to the Moon,"" his dbut album's title song).  The first single from it, following the earlier ""Fly Me to the Moon"" / ""Moonlight in Vermont"" chestnut/soul-revival template, was a funky-soul reading of ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco.""  It went nowhere (barely even Top 50 soul), but fortunately he had a supply of self-(co-)penned originals that made for better singles, especially ""How I Miss You Baby"" and ""More Than I Can Stand,"" both of which did well on the soul charts (the former was actually his biggest solo soul hit until 1972).  One more ""Moon"" song appeared on this LP, a stunningly soulful cover of the British pop hit from 1965, Jonathan King's ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon.""""The Womack 'Live'"" LP (1971) was his breakthrough soul album, and it featured the track (with its extended soul ""rap"") titled ""The Preacher,"" which provided him his nickname (as well as this box set's title).  Edited and combined in a medley with ""More Than I Can Stand,"" it became the memorable sole single (A-side) from the live album.  Other highlights abound, including another smokin' hot take on ""I'm a Midnight Mover""; but above all I'll go with his bluesy Sam Cooke/Percy Mayfield medley ""Laughing and Clowning""/""To Live the Past"" and the surprise guest appearance by the great Percy Mayfield himself.  Not to be missed either are his superb back-to-back covers of the iconic '60s pop ballads ""Everybody's Talkin'"" (by Fred Neil - and a huge Nilsson hit from ""Midnight Cowboy"") and George Harrison's ""Something"" with the Beatles.""Communication"" ('71-72) and ""Understanding"" (1972) gave Womack a pair of consecutive #7 smash soul albums, plus his two biggest hit solo soul singles to date: the gentle, testifyin', electric-guitar-punctuated ""That's the Way I Feel About Cha"" and the understanding and sympathetic ""Woman's Gotta Have It"" (from ""Understanding"") - #2 and #1 soul-chart smashes, respectively.  Both LPs included a classic pop ballad for Womack to feast on, as he took both James Taylor's very personal story ""Fire and Rain"" and the Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" to the church of soul.  ""Understanding""'s opener ""I Can Understand It"" became a sizable soul-radio LP-track hit, while the LP's second single yielded hits on both sides: the initial A-side was yet another ""soul-icized"" pop cover, this time of Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline""; and then came the touching, easy-flowing B-side ""Harry Hippie,"" written by Jim Ford about one of Bobby's brothers.  As a result of the single's remarkable longevity (on the charts from late August of '72 to early March '73 [a 28-week span]), it became his first solo million-seller.Each of the five discs is housed in its own replica original record jacket (easy-to-handle, non-abrasive cardboard).  These are contained inside a single attractive, easy-opening box.  The 16-page accompanying booklet is a treat: jam-packed with photos, colorful record-jacket repros, label scans and a trade-publication poster ad.  There are seven pages of comprehensive and informative liner notes; and the sound has been newly remastered from the original analog master tapes.This is absolutely essential 1968-1972 soul by one of the immortal masters of the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSOK7ISVYF4B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TESLJDQ#wasThisHelpful","R2NSOK7ISVYF4B","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be prepared for 79 absolutely astonishing minutes of blues magic, with a couple of ultra-soulful R&B ballad oldies and a late-'50s soul-jazz instrumental classic.For Chicago West Side blues fans, we get four excellent covers of classics by two of the best of all time, Otis Rush and Magic Sam.  A couple of Rush's ""time"" songs, ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" and ""It Takes Time"" receive high-intensity makeovers with Earl's blazing guitar and Michael Ledbetter's powerful, soul-drenched vocals.  ""All Your Love,"" my favorite magic Sam tune, is explored for seven-plus minutes, with another outstanding Ledbetter vocal and plenty of room for Earl to dazzle with his stinging Magic Sam-esque guitar fills and for Dave Limina to delve deep on piano and Hammond B-3 organ.  Diane Blue does the vocal honors on Sam's probing, soul-searching ""What Have I Done Wrong.""Limina is especially luminescent (on B-3) with Earl on B.B. King's ""I Need You So Bad"" (KIng's recent death really raising the stakes for this track as a tribute).  There is also a top-notch bit of New Orleans blues here with a fiery remake of Fats Domino's ""Every Night About This Time.""Of Ronnie Earl's three originals, two are impressive soul-blues duets (""Follow Your Heart"" and ""Higher Love"") with the aforementioned guest vocalists (who appear on twelve of the thirteen tracks), Michael Ledbetter and Diane Blue.  The third is the title song ""Father's Day"" by Earl and Ledbetter - very movingly sung by the latter - which deals with the very difficult personal issue of repairing rifts in the family and coming together in peace, understanding and forgiveness while there is still time.Earl et al (Limina, Jim Mouradian on bass, Lorne Entree on drums) transform themselves into a stellar electric guitar, organ and sax (Mario Perett on tenor, Scott Shetler on baritone) soul-jazz combo with their brilliant rendition of Bobby Timmons' classic ""Moanin',"" first recorded by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in 1958.The variety keeps on going right to the end with the closing gospel tune ""Precious Lord"" sung to a fare-thee-well by Diane Blue.But I was most taken aback by the 15 minutes devoted to a pair of early '60s R&B songs:  Gladys Knight & the Pips' 1964 hit ballad [#4 R&B / # 38 pop] ""Giving Up"" (written by Van McCoy) is taken to the church of the blues.  Just the deepest soul and blues together in a magnificent instrumental arrangement and with a vocal by Michael Ledbetter that will overwhelm you with its soulfulness.  Fine song, but I can't imagine what could have inspired such a masterpiece to emerge from it five decades later.  Four tracks down, the deep exploration of Bobby Bland's #2 R&B hit ballad from 1960, ""I'll Take Care of You"" (written by Brook Benton and Clyde Otis), stretches out to nine minutes - all instrumental for the second half - with stunningly gorgeous solos by Earl and Limina.There is so much intense, smoldering, passionate, high-powered playing and singing on this one CD that it's hard to imagine anything that could ever top it - yet if anyone can, Ronnie Earl will find a way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVIMAQ7ZKJDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJNQVJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2DVIMAQ7ZKJDM","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tad Robinson is the most exquisitely mellow soul and soul-blues crooner since the late Bobby Bland (leaving aside Mr. Bland's occasionally injected guttural growl which no one could ever duplicate), and this latest album ""Day Into Night"" affords him ample opportunity to excel for 53 minutes, most of this time spent luxuriating in his sweet spot, that being relaxed retro-1970s-sounding soul and blues with a lot of soul.Of the 12 tracks, ten of them are originals co-penned by Robinson or members of his band (particularly keyboardist Kevin Anker and bassist Steve Gomes), one of them is a cover, and the other is an alternate take (using a different instrumental arrangement) on one of the originals.  And wouldn't you know it, this one remake is of Bobby Bland's great ""Lead Me On,"" a #9 R&B hit on the Duke label from 1960.  This more '70s-style funk-infused remake is unquestionably the finest recorded version of this song in the 55 years since. The one we hear twice is ""Call Me"" (not Al Green's or Blondie's, etc, - as I said, original), a terrific mid-tempo groover (personally, I prefer the Trk 12 second version with the soul horns in the mix, but Trk 2 has the strong guest organ part by Benjie Porecki in its favor).Not only is there the fine aforementioned tribute to Bobby Bland, but on my favorite of all my favorite tracks here, Syl Johnson and Hi Records/ Willie Mitchell-as-producer receive a fantastic doff of the old chapeau on the impossibly funky and grooving Gomes-Robinson-penned ""While You Were Gone.""  As if this isn't over-the-top great enough Tad also treats us to his only harmonica solo on the album, and it's a sizzling Slim Harpo/Louisiana-swamp--style one.  Speaking of Hi Records '70s male soul artists (other than Al Green), ""Lonely Talking"" is a lovely Otis Clay-type soul-blues ballad featuring more soulful organ sound as well as an astonishing guest appearance by Anson Funderburgh on blues guitar.  The other top soul-blues ballad here (and one which I'm guessing inspired the album's title) is the powerful and haunting ""Nightwatch,"" with another magnificent blues-guitar guest appearance, this time by Alex Schultz.  The other Memphis soul giant Stax Records gets its shout-out with ""Need Some Better,"" which is pure Johnnie Taylor.There is not weak moment anywhere on this album, nor is any track undeserving of praise, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the moving tribute to Bobby Womack, whom we lost a year ago, bearing the title ""He's Moved On.""  Kevin Anker created a right-on-the-money Womack-esque tune, replete with horns and stirring backing vocals, while Tad Robinson almost seems to be channeling his spirit with his emotive, pleading vocal (and soul-rapping, as Womack would do so effectively before the definition of ""rapping"" changed).For those who appreciate this genre and wish to hear one classic and ten new original songs that do honor to it, I don't think there will be many (if any) better than this in 2015.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RUCX0XRGV9L1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3LARUK#wasThisHelpful","R3RUCX0XRGV9L1","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an attempt by the RPM International Retro series to capture the origins of French rock 'n' roll (a major cultural import from the U.S,) when it was raw, vital and untamed -- before much of it became watered-down y-y (teeny-bopper) pop music.The rock 'n' roll explosion in France really occurred with the emergence of Johnny Hallyday in 1960.  However,  that particular chapter was covered on a prior CD in this series, so what we get here are 1) the sparse 1956-1959 period when ""rock and roll"" seemed to be more of a music-hall novelty-act item featuring sped-up orchestral arrangements with accordions (!) and clarinets, and very little connection to the contemporaneous American youth phenomenon; and 2) the male groups and female solo rock 'n' roll artists who came along in Johnny's wake.The male groups include Les Chaussettes Noires (""the Black Socks"") fronted by future solo star Eddy Mitchell (they do an Elvis and a Gene Vincent cover in French); Les Chats Sauvages (""the Wild Cats""), with lead singer Dick Rivers, who are also heard twice, including on the classic, disc-opening Twist  Saint-Tropez; and the menacing and rowdy, bad-boy, black-leather-clad Vince Taylor et ses Play-Boys (who were actually a British group) with their wild English-language covers of Elvis's ""Baby Let's Play House"" and Chuck Berry's ""Sweet Little Sixteen.""  They clearly possessed more attitude than musical ability - which depending on one's point of view, now make them either seem all the greater or all the worse for it.  Incidentally, like Johnny Hallyday, none of these native French lead artists used their real names, as the idea was to adopt an American rock 'n' roller identity.  Eddy Mitchell and Dick Rivers were U.S.-inspired names (the latter's was derived from the Elvis film character Deke Rivers: ""Dick"" is pronounced like ""Deke"" in French); and Brit Brian Holden took the more supposedly American-sounding name of Vince Taylor.Johnny Hallyday is in fact featured on this CD, on the last two tracks, as a 15-year-old on home-made French-language recordings of ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Tutti Frutti"" from 1958.  Unsurprisingly the audio quality is on the muddy side, but these tracks are here to preserve a bit of history and only appear at the very end.  Still, the Johnny vocal talent is already in evidence.  He clearly has the best natural feel for this music, as well as the most rock and R&B-ready voice.Also of note is the group El Toro et les Cyclones (a name which must have sounded absolutely wild in 1962 France), heard here on their French ""Long Tall Sally"" cover (Oncle John), featuring future French recording star Jacques Dutronc on guitar.  Danyel Grard, in an early recording, gets wild (and borderline scary) with his hyped-up Gallic take on the Ike Turner-penned Gong-Gong (I'm Blue) an R&B hit by the Ikettes.  On the distaff side - but staying sauvage - there's Nicole Paquin's Mon mari, c'est Frankenstein (originally, ""You Can Get Him, Frankenstein"" by the Castle Kings).  And another transplanted Brit, Gillian Hills, turns in a credible French-language version of the Shirelles' ""Mama Said,"" tying it to the unstoppable dance craze as En dansant le twist.  Jackie Seven's (definitely not the young Frenchwoman's real name!) Le Rhythme du rock is one of my least favorites from this post-Johnny wave: just too mindless and repetitious, although in its day it might have seemed admirably anthemic.By far the best of the pre-Johnny era is the French-language cover of Little Willie John's ""Fever"" by Gabriel Dalar, which mostly uses the 1958 pop-hit arrangement for Peggy Lee.  For my two favorites overall, I have to go with les Daltons, the guitar instrumental group heavily influenced by the Shadows of the U.K.  With Long Chris (a future close musical associate of Johnny Hallyday's) providing the vocal they do an astoundingly hot and rocking French version of Fats Domino's ""Hello Josephine,"" as well as the twangy, reverbed, Shadows-like instrumental with a Western U.S. motif titled Dalton City.All twenty of the studio-recorded tracks sound tremendous; and the twelve-page accompanying full-color booklet is to be treasured - as besides the indispensable seven pages of informative Kieron Tyler liner notes, we also get repros of the 17 record jackets that once held all of the featured records here issued between 1956 and 1962.  The presentation is five-star all the way, which leaves the overall quality of the music as the tricky issue.  There is about one-third of this disc that I would not want to hear again anytime soon and a slightly lesser percentage than that which I am really enthusiastic about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33N7HIWC6OEIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYZM8ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R33N7HIWC6OEIH","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ace [UK] ""California Nights"" hit parade (highest U.S. national pop chart positions):""My Town, My Guy and Me"" (1965)  #32 Billboard""I Won't Love You Anymore (Sorry)"" (1965)  #61 Cash Box""We Know We're in Love"" (1966)  #58 Record World""Off and Running"" (1966)  #94 Record World (only ""bubbled under"" in Billboard at #108)""Treat Me Like a Lady"" (1966)  ""bubbled under"" at #115 in Billboard""California Nights"" (1967)  #11 Cash Box""California Nights"" turned out to be '60s pop princess Lesley Gore's last major hit and she was only just turning 21; yet her run which began at age 16 in '63 with her recording of ""It's My Party"" was impressive and memorable, as well as being more enduring than any of her teen girl-pop counterparts'.  At least she held her own rather well against the British invasion, although her best record ""You Don't Own Me"" was prevented from becoming a national number one record when the Beatles suddenly crashed the U.S. pop charts with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in early '64.  What she couldn't weather as the late sixties approached was the onslaught of more heavyweight, relevant and personal material being generated by her rock and singer-songwriter contemporaries.In any event, what is clear now is that whenever Lesley Gore had a distinctive song to work with she did very well with it.  All of her hits attest to this; and it should be noted that she co-wrote the first three hits listed chronologically above (all contained in the bonus tracks) - two of them with brother Michael (in 1980 they were Grammy and Oscar nominated for their songwriting on the ballad ""Out Here on My Own"" from the movie ""Fame."").  ""California Nights"" is a beautifully composed tune by the late Marvin Hamlisch (just a couple years older than Lesley - both are gone now, sadly), who went on to great heights in the business. [For trivia buffs: Hamlisch is the only person to win all of the following awards: Academy Award (3), Grammy (4), Emmy (4), Tony (1), Golden Globe (2) and Pulitzer Prize (1, shared).]The Bob Crewe co-writes on the ""California Nights"" album, other than the catchy, undervalued single ""Treat Me Like a Lady"" just sort of blend together with several others, but there are two more that make a strong impression: the single ""Off and Running"" (written by Carole Bayer and Toni Wine/produced by Quincy Jones, who produced ""It's My Party"") is a British beat-influenced rocker with a hot Jack Nitzsche arrangement.  It barely cracked one of three national top 100s, yet in retrospect it seems like one of her better efforts.  My guess is that it was just too unexpected from her, and neither radio programmers nor her fans would go for it.  ""Cry Like a Baby"" is not the subsequent Box Tops hit but a genuine soul record (a fairly minor R&B hit for Aretha Franklin while still at Columbia) penned by Jo Armstead, Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson.  These two fine tracks took Lesley out of her pure pop bag and allowed her to shine in very different ways.This being an Ace package we get the 16-page deluxe-booklet treatment loaded with colorful photographic realia; while the liner notes by Malcolm Baumgart briefly tell the story behind every one of the 25 recordings.I just wish there were more songs here that really stood out and would have been fully up to Lesley's Gore level of talent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPE40IAVD0LQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTN1CC2#wasThisHelpful","R1TPE40IAVD0LQ","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's about a 36-minute masterpiece of an album lurking inside this 56-minute Brian Wilson CD produced by BW and Joe Thomas.  Toss out six tracks that are sappy (""Our Special Love,"" ""Somewhere Quiet"" and ""One Kind of Love""), overly self-absorbed (""I'm Feeling Sad""), inconsequential (""Saturday Night""), and a major misfire in the key number two track position (""Runaway Dancer,"" with its trite, outmoded Sebu Simonian programmed beats and Brian sounding ridiculously out of his element), and this is one eminently enjoyable 12-track album (deluxe version).The stand-out of my dozen recommended songs here is without a doubt ""Whatever Happened,"" featuring Al Jardine and David Marks.  The lyrics express longing nostalgia in a strikingly authentic and convincing way, and the Beach Boys harmonies are magnificently recreated.  An original song-of-the-year candidate in my view.  The same combo returns four tracks later with more lush harmonies on ""The Right Time,"" while Brian and Al duet (and Al is truly outstanding here) on the exquisitely harmonious and tuneful ""Tell Me Why.""  For bouncy, poppy and irresistible, you can't do much better than ""Guess You Had to Be There,"" a duet with Kacey Musgraves, who also co-wrote it.""On the Island"" is a short and breezily refreshing number with She & Him, on which She (Zooey Deschanel) sounds more like this generation's Doris Day than ever (which is a huge compliment in my book).  Brian's backing vocal is absolutely priceless on this track.  ""Half Moon Bay"" is a drop-dead gorgeous instrumental featuring the solo trumpet of Mark Isham; and continuing the theme of enjoyment and appreciation of the water and/or tropical island life is ""Sail Away,"" which brings back Blondie Chaplin and Al Jardine for yet more golden Beach Boys sounds - and this one cleverly and delightfully adds musical cues (especially toward the end) reminiscent of Brian's brilliant 1966 Beach Boys adaptation of ""Sloop John B"" from ""Pet Sounds.""""Don't Worry,"" despite the similarity of titles, is unrelated to ""Don't Worry Baby.""  I might have written it off as featherweight but for the completely winning and unexpected turn-of-the-'70s midtempo soul arrangement.  The first 14 non-""deluxe"" tracks are bookended by the brief but gorgeous disc opener ""This Beautiful Day"" and the beautifully orchestrated four-and-a-half minute closer ""The Last Song.""That leaves the two ""deluxe"" edition bonus tracks: a reprise of ""Love and Mercy"" coinciding with the new biographical film of Brian Wilson by that title; and his heart-felt home recording (just Brian and his piano) of ""In the Back of My Mind.""  After becoming completely accustomed to his meticulous production techniques for so long, it is startling to hear anything this raw from him.  It is stark and soul-baring...and a whole different type of proof of his genius.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXD0JI2X9X2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSOP6ZE#wasThisHelpful","RPXD0JI2X9X2Z","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been five months now since Lesley Gore has been gone, so it felt like time to go back and listen to the last album she made (and the only one after 1982).  In short, it is even better than I remembered, and I am now more sold than ever on the original songs that were written for it.These original songs from 2005 are nearly all ballads of an reflective, introspective nature, as they weave an almost hypnotic late-night-jazz-tinged web of sheer fascination.  Speaking of ""web,"" one of the best here is the entrancing ""Cool Web"" (written by John Fischer), which is about a romance fraught with peril.  Once you get over the shock that her voice and her approach to singing are a thousand miles removed from the teenage Lesley Gore, you will develop a real appreciation for the highly skilled, mature chanteuse that she became.  Sensitive producer and pianist Blake Morgan penned a pair of the most lovely original ballads on the album: ""It's Gone"" (about the end of a love affair) and the especially beautiful ""Better Angels,"" which is now even more compelling (and beyond spooky) as she sings, ""And though my case looks fatal, I'm still hoping better angels come to me.""  The title song, written by guitarist Mike Errico, is about longing, and like ""Better Angels"" stuns with the line, ""We picked up where we left off in another life.""  Lesley, along with Errico and Morgan (and Tanya Leah and Lorraine Ferro), composed the wistful and delicate ""Words We Don't Say,"" while Lesley and Ellen Weston collaborated on her final track ""We Went So High,"" which looks back at love and life, making it the ideal last word on all of it.Lesley was the sole writer on the clever and bouncy (thus, quite a change of pace) ""Not the First,"" with the line, ""You're not the first to think you'll be the last.""And then there are two of her great older hits from two very successful periods, both of which impressed me the most ten years ago and do not disappoint in any way now:  The Academy Award-nominated ""Out Here on My Own,"" which Lesley wrote with her brother Michael, was a huge Irene Cara hit ballad [#4 in Billboard, with a 26-week chart run] from the smash 1980 movie ""Fame.""  (She was also nominated for a Grammy for her work on the original score of the film.)  This can now be viewed as the definitive version.  And then there's her immortal ""You Don't Own Me,"" the proto-women's liberation song penned by two of the writers of Danny & the Juniors' ""At the Hop"" (Dave White and John Madara), which earned the distinction of being the first record that was blocked from the #1 position by the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" when the British Invasion struck in February of 1964.  (In Chicago, it was knocked out of the #1 spot.)  Here, Lesley takes ""You Don't Own Me"" at a languid pace, making her point with every syllable, while making us realize once again what a brilliantly constructed and written song this is.For a final album (sadly, as it turned out), recorded some forty years after one's height of fame [no play on words with the film title intended], this is about as solid an effort as one could hope for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7706CTF2R1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TPXJEU#wasThisHelpful","RE7706CTF2R1O","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gregor Hilden from Mnster, Germany, employing eight different classic guitar models (by Gibson, Fender and Gretsch) over the course of 13 tracks and 59 and a half minutes, takes us on an astounding sonic adventure that in some ways feels like a direct line back to the mid-1970s when artists at his level of talent and musical knowledge could break the barriers of blues and soul and funk and jazz and fuse them all in the most appealing ways.  That he begins with a cover of Grover Washington Jr.'s ""Mr. Magic"" (composed by Ralph MacDonald) from 1975 (you can't get any more mid-'70s than that!), the biggest and most memorable soul-jazz hit of the decade, seems completely appropriate.  The song's transition from sax to electric guitar could not have been handled more deftly than it is here.  This is scintillating soul-jazz that truly stands the test of time - that being 40 years now.  The other soul-jazz (with Latin and blues flavors) standard Hilden and his combo cover is Kenny Burrell's immortal ""Chitlins Con Carne"" from his 1963 LP ""Midnight Blues.""  Thomas Hufschmidt's electric keyboard, also featured in a superb solo on ""Mr. Magic,"" is key [no pun intended] in lending this version an updated '70s-fusion vibe.  Horst Bergmeyer's B-3 organ solo infuses it with some late-'60s soul.Classic '60s heavy blues-rock receives a dose of jazz flair in a tribute to Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, while the remaining ten tracks are all original Hilden compositions, all of which are impressive in their mastery of each of these genres in a greater jazz context.  Since ""Mr. Magic"" is my favorite overall, my second favorite would have to be Hilden's own ""Mr. Magic"" equivalent, titled ""Desert Song.""  It's exciting but gorgeous and soulful at the same time, with that seemingly inevitable, natural groove that ""Mr. Magic"" possesses in spades, while being totally original.  ""On Flow"" is a sizzling, pulsating blues-rock, R&B and soul-jazz hybrid (really, it's all there!), which is lacking just one thing: a good title!  ""Springtime"" is tuneful and upbeat and features a majorly soulful Bergmeyer B-3 solo.  On ""Naylor's Blues,"" what can I say? He nails the blues; and I would be surprised if B.B. King were not a prime inspiration.  ""Rock-Zabern is oxymoronic relaxed funk; Greg's Funk"" is funky blues; ""Blues from the Other Side"" is easy-going blues jazz; and the title song (""In Phase"") has a lilting melody and is also taken at an easy pace.Fans of the late, great Jeff Golub should really like this album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAJSSCR5DBWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5C9Q0A#wasThisHelpful","R2AAJSSCR5DBWF","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1989-90 season of ""The Wonder Years"" resulted in its highest ratings ever: the 8th most popular show on TV.  At a time of sitcom dominance (seven of the top nine shows) ""The Wonder Years"" was the second highest-rated on ABC, behind only ""Roseanne.""  This represented a significant bounce-back after its Season 2 ratings slump when it wound up in a tie for 22nd place.  I enjoyed Season 2, but as I pointed out in my five-star review of the DVD, there were a couple of problems which I think were reflected in the ratings.  Season 3 is right in the pocket all the way, and we can see why it was the most successful full season of the series.Season 3 tells the story of Kevin Arnold's (Fred Savage) year in eighth grade (1969-70).  It has its quirky moments, but nothing that goes out too far on a limb - and that includes the brilliantly quirky ""Tree House"" episode, which (shall I say) branched off in a delightfully unpredictable direction.Older brother Wayne's (Jason Hervey) tormenting is toned down this season (I wrote that excessive bullying and weirdness was a problem in Season 2), and the result is both the best comic pay-off (the lurching car scene) and the best character pay-off thus far in the series for Wayne, as we come to understand some of his very believable middle-child frustrations.  Beneath all the derision directed toward Kevin, it begins to become clear that he really cares about his brother.  Juliette Lewis guest-appears memorably in a few episodes as Wayne's gum-chomping bimbo girlfriend Delores (definitely not the same as the Delores from a notorious ""Seinfeld"" episode""!).Hippie-ish older sister Karen (Olivia D'Abo), as a high school senior with leaving her ""bourgeois"" home for college on her mind, continues to assert her independence, leading to unavoidable conflict with her hard-working, minimally-communicative Korean War-vet father (Dan Lauria, as Jack Arnold), as well as to an emotional resolution of their generation-gap issues in the ""Daddy's Little Girl"" episode.  Alley Mills (as Norma Arnold/Mom) is stellar in the ""Faith"" episode, in which her losing the year's tax receipts reveals the true extent to which she is the glue that holds the family together.But mostly it's about Kevin and best friends Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) as they navigate their way through junior high school and the mounting pressures (particularly social) of eighth grade.  The back-to-back episodes ""She, My Friend and I"" and ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,"" are pivotal in the inevitably changing nature of Kevin and Winnie's relationship.In a bonus-feature interview Jason Hervey talks about the music being an absolutely essential element in the telling of the ""Wonder Years"" story.  Now with nearly all (96%) of the licensing rights to the originally-featured music obtained, the series feels complete on DVD.  There is almost an embarrassment of musical riches, but from this season I'll just mention three particularly effective uses of 1960s recordings: 1) The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" in the opening ""Summer Song"" family-vacation-at-the-seashore episode; 2) the comedic use of James Brown's ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"" and Jewel Akens' ""The Birds and the Bees"" in the aforementioned ""Tree House"" episode; and especially 3) the powerfully affecting appearances of the Motown ballads ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted"" (Jimmy Ruffin) and ""You're All I Need to Get By"" (Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell) in the most emotionally charged moments between Kevin and Winnie in the unforgettable ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" episode.The bonus features are extensive and illuminating (with no shortage of intelligent, in-depth observations) AND we get the answer (from one of the producers) as to how in the world Wayne's repeatedly addressing his brother as ""Scrote"" was able to get past the network censors.  The only drawback with this extra material is that it covers the entire series, so there are spoilers all over the place.  And alas, there is no episode commentary.Saving the best for last, I will mention that this is the season that includes what is possibly the greatest three-episode story arc in network half-hour-series TV history: Episodes 2, 9 and 20 (""Math Class,"" ""Math Class Squared"" and ""Good-Bye"").  The third of this trilogy earned Emmy awards for writing (Bob Brush) and directing (Michael Dinner), while the late Steven Gilborn was robbed of one for his acting portrayal of Mr. Collins, the no-nonsense, uncompromised-standards-upholding, ""old-school"" algebra teacher who believed that ""every problem contains its own solution.""  Kevin would be changed forever (for the better) by having been his student.  (Gilborn in real life held a Ph.D. in literature and had been a college professor before becoming an actor.)This is a season to cherish in one of American television's finest series","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI21VWNZ3D0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBZLLZC#wasThisHelpful","RI21VWNZ3D0R","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is 59 minutes of reverbed guitar and wailing sax heaven; some of the greatest Southern California surf music (from 1963-64) never heard on record prior to this present stellar Thom Starr and the Galaxies collection.Fender Jazzmaster master Starr, heavily influenced by Dick Dale, Duane Eddy, and especially by Paul Johnson of the Belairs (of ""Mr. Moto"" fame) from the local South Bay area, just a year out of high school was composing his own superb surf-style tunes, and he and his band did record a ten-track all-instro LP in 1963 with the brilliant title ""Sons of the Beach.""  Only problem: it fell through the cracks and never got issued by any label.  Terrific tracks with titles like ""Strange Fever (Just Before Dawn),"" Woodie Welcome Wagon Part 2,"" ""Surfer's Bubble,"" ""No. 1 Son,"" ""Launching Pad,"" ""Cherry Wipe Out,"" ""Sand Blast"" and ""Jellyfish Kiss"" stayed in the can for the rest of Starr's lifetime.  These songs were right in the pocket (or should I say ""pipeline"") of the best surf music out there at the time.  The problem I had where I was (in the Midwest) was that we got none of this phenomenal instro-surf-combo stuff except for the Chantays' ""Pipeline"" and the Surfaris' ""Wipe Out.""  For some dumb reason the radio programmers here wouldn't touch this stuff (besides those two that somehow managed to made it through); and when it came to instrumentals we would only get ""safe"" easy-listening ones.  (I guess ""safe"" was their reason, and it was indeed a dumb one!)The 1964 tracks, a mix of covers of Paul Johnson (""Mr. Moto,"" ""Bedlam"" ""Squad Car"" and ""Vmonos"") and Dick Dale (""Shake & Stomp"") songs and his own originals, are even stronger that the '63 stuff - and Starr's original compositions show just how phenomenally gifted he was.  ""The Nomad"" is definitely intriguing and ""Renegade"" rocks out, while his only down-tempo one, ""Enchanted Island,"" is a thrillingly (and chillingly) gorgeous masterpiece that needs to be discovered.  It is easily one of the best melodic compositions this genre ever produced.Fine, concise and informative liner notes by John Blair (author of ""The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961-1965"") are contained in the accompanying fold-out card, which adds color photos and track info.  The mono sound mastering is excellent throughout.

"""Been all around this world just to come back to you...; it's a long and lonesome highway, it's a bitter shade of blue...""  - from Trk 1, ""Worried Mind"" by Eilen JewellThis album, which has so much to do about returning home as part of her search for peace of mind, is pensive, poetic and deeply personal.  It is also bittersweet, as there is still much to be disillusioned about - such as the discovery that a cherished place of one's youth (in Idaho) is now abandoned and desolate (and officially designated as a ""ghost town"").  She sings of ""empty silos on state highways"" and about ""this whole place...going under.""  Yet, the closing track, ""Songbird,"" which almost certainly is inspired by her young daughter (""My whole world rests on those tiny wings"") is a gentle song of belief in a beautiful future, full of comfort and hope.Each of these twelve songs (averaging just over three minutes in duration) stands on its own; but put together they add up to a thoughtful, thought-provoking and ultimately haunting whole, demanding repeated listens.  Metaphors abound in the form of trains and rivers and roads, a ""half-broke horse,"" and even an ""old guitar with broken strings...played by the unseen hand...in the 'hallelujah band.'""  The latter song's eerie vibe is enhanced by the reverbed electric surf guitar of Jerry Miller.  (I had to check the credits to see if maybe Los Straitjackets had made a guest appearance!)  The layering of guitars throughout (Eilen Jewell's acoustic, Miller's electric [plus mandolin on one track], and Jake Hoffman's pedal steel) is brilliant.  The effect of all three together is particularly shattering on ""Some Things Weren't Meant to Be,"" with Miller supplying the tender twang as Eilen laments, ""My best was less than you wanted from me.""  The twang (with its distinctly western sound) adds punctuation again on the introspective ""Pages"" (""...I search for words to make things right"") and the melancholy song of longing, ""[If You Were] Here with Me.""  Her harmonica solo, which she saves for the aforementioned closer ""Songbird"" is as poignant as it gets.  And in the most striking change of pace, Trk 3, ""Rio Grande,"" begins with a blast of Jack Gardner's south-of-the-border trumpet and features more snaky surf guitar, plus a pulsating beat kept by Eilen Jewell's husband, Jason Beek.Superb songs, beautifully languid lead vocals, excellent musicianship with completely on-point arrangements all combine to create what I believe will stand as one of this year's best (maybe THE best - we'll have to see) albums of all-original singer-songwriter material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Q6W2TWOBO8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7GVMJ4#wasThisHelpful","R25Q6W2TWOBO8J","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Catacombs U.S. hit parade - peak national chart positions:Gene Chandler  ""Nothing Can Stop Me"" (1965)  #3 R&B / #18 popThe C.O.D.'s  ""Michael [The Lover]"" ('65-66)  #5 R&B / #41 popFred Hughes  ""You Can't Take It Away"" (1965)  #12 R&B / #89 popThere are not many hits here out of 28 tracks, but then that was precisely the point of the working-class underground dance-club scene in a number of UK cities north of London that began in the '60s: finding the rarest highly danceable, uptempo U.S. R&B/soul imports on 45, which in turn would help define the local club's unique ambiance.  Nothing from the British pop charts allowed.  The Catacombs (popularly abbreviated to the ""Cats""), located in the West Midlands city of Wolverhampton, was an influential Northern Soul (as the scene came to be called) venue established in a 107-year-old building that was originally a convent, and in the intervening years had multiple uses such as a lead smelting works and a warehouse.  This collection contains 72 minutes of music that was featured there during its six years of operation.  It all sounds sensational and is in true hardcover CD album format, with a colorful 24-page booklet loaded with label scans of these obscure 45s, photos, brief background info on each recording artist, and a ten-page history of the Catacombs.These records date from 1962-1970 - the golden age of U.S. soul, one might say - with a large majority from the sweet-spot years 1965-67.  Listening to WVON in Chicago in '65-66, I certainly remember the Chicago soul hits featured here: Gene Chandler's ""Nothing Can Stop Me"" (Chandler was a favorite of mine since ""Duke of Earl"" in 1962, the first 45 I ever bought; and this present record got a lot of Top 40 pop airplay as well) and The C.O.D.""s ultra-catchy ""Michael,"" which is one I may not have heard since.  It's unlikely I had ever heard more than a handful of these selections before.  Other examples of Chicago soul here include the good ones ""That's My Girl"" by Dee ""Raindrops"" Clark (1964), ""Every Beat of My Heart"" by the Du-Ettes (1965/Mar-V-Lus label), and the Five Stairsteps' ""Change of Pace"" (1967/Windy C label).The third of the above-listed national chart hits is Fred Hughes' melodic and rhythmic, sweet-spirited ""You Can't Take It Away.""  In addition to this one, I would especially recommend Johnny & Lilly's hard-soul Huey P. Meaux/Crazy Cajun production ""Suffering City"" (Johnny & Lilly were Texas soul and blues man Johnny Copeland and his wife Lavelle White); the great Bobby Womack's 1966 original (and superior) version of his debut solo single two years later, ""What Is This?""; the Fi-Dels' Motownish ""Try a Little Harder""; and the driving uptown soul of Jerry Williams (before he morphed into his Swamp Dogg soul innovator persona) on ""If You Ask Me"" (1967).  And then there's the one that is credited as being the most influential of all early Northern Soul discs, Leon ""I-Wanna-Do-Something-Freaky-to-You"" Haywood's Four Tops-inspired ""Baby, Reconsider"" from 1966 (on the Fat Fish [!] label).You can't go wrong with anything involving this collection - unless you're looking for ballads, that is!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29J86XGZBSTT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4V0BWI#wasThisHelpful","R29J86XGZBSTT8","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine syllables instantly vaulted David Ruffin to stardom in 1965: ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day.""  The song ""My Girl"" went to #1 R&B and pop; and for the next three years - until his expulsion from the group - he was the principal lead singer of the Temptations at their 1960s peak.  He joined Smokey Robinson (co-writer/producer of ""My Girl"" and others for the Tempts) of the Miracles and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as the top three lead vocalists of male Motown groups of the era.Cut to 1971.  Despite some prior solo success, Ruffin ceased to be a priority at Motown.  Not being first-tier there was an iffy situation at best for an artist, and consistent backing of the company went out the window.  Seven different producers or combinations of producers were involved with the dozen tracks originally scheduled for release as the LP ""David"" in mid-1971 (that many producers being a sign in and of itself of a non-priority project), but it is a matter of speculation why the album got shelved (and was only first released here by Hip-O Select decades later).  Certainly, a complete lack of volatility swirling around Ruffin since his ouster from the Tempts was NOT among the possible explanations.Not helping matters was that the four songs from the unissued LP that did see release at the time as single sides made virtually no impact in the marketplace.  The first single was doubly strong and included both the opening and closing tracks of the projected LP, respectively: the Henry Cosby co-written-and-produced ""Each Day Is a Lifetime"" and the Dale Browner penned-and-produced ""Don't Stop Lovin' Me.""  The latter was the only one to register at all - barely, at a peak of #103 in Cash Box.  Obviously, with both singles tanking, the chances of the LP going anywhere would not have been good at all.I find it to be about two-thirds of a very good album, but even on the weaker songs Ruffin's commitment to them is remarkable.  He always remained in fine form as a vocalist, possessing the strongest combination of a deep soul rasp, impressive vocal flexibility and range, and a unique ability to emphasize his emotions (so often hurt and anguish) with a whole assortment of chilling whoops and wails - and do so naturally, without a hint of artifice.  And ever since ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"" in '66 with the Tempts, he was the undisputed king of imploration in soul music.Besides the aforementioned ""Each Day Is a Lifetime"" and ""Don't Stop Lovin' Me,"" ""Anything That You Ask For,"" ""Out in the Country"" [not the same as the recent Three Dog Night hit], ""I Can't Be Hurt Anymore,"" and ""Let Somebody Love Me"" are solid tracks.  But special mentions need to go to his covers of the big crossover soul and pop hits ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" and ""I Want You Back.""  Nobody but Jerry Butler perhaps could have been as mellow as Brook Benton on ""Rainy Night in Georgia,"" but Ruffin gets down to his best Benton-esque baritone, as well as adding flavors of his own to the gorgeous 4:40 track.  Taking on Michael and his four Jackson brothers on ""I Want You Back"" might seem like an odd choice, but Ruffin's version offers convincing evidence that the song has a more mature message than can be gleaned from the pre-adolescent/adolescent Jackson 5's original.Of the seven ""bonus"" tracks - ones that did not make the cut for the unissued ""David"" LP - the stand-out is Ron Miller's ""Heaven Help Us All,"" which went on to glory in the latter part of 1970 as a Stevie Wonder single.  It's a moving song with a touching and heart-felt Ruffin reading of it, although Stevie's was clearly the more dynamic version.  On the inexplicable side, how did they completely miss the powerhouse Johnny Bristol co-written-and-produced ""Get Away Heartache (Keep Moving On),"" the most obvious ready-made potential hit of this entire collection?  The heartache he expresses so convincingly and deeply might have had something to do with the then understood-to-be-hopeless health situation of Tammi Terrell with whom he had had a love affair.  (She was in a coma and gone within weeks.)Excellent work by Hip-O Select in compiling this 76 minute CD, applying impeccable digital mastering to the superlative stereo (plus, the four mono single mixes), and providing a colorful (even featuring the original LP artwork that no one got to see at the time), informative 16-page booklet with remarkably thorough credits and recording-session details.  My holding out on the highest rating (by one-half of a star) comes from there being nine or ten tracks out of the 23 total that I think are beneath David Ruffin's talent to the point that they can be a bit of a chore to sit through.  Still, the presence of 13 or 14 really good ones is easily enough for me to highly recommend this collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1VH5FTU6QQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00975LCMO#wasThisHelpful","R2O1VH5FTU6QQQ","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bettye LaVette is better than ever in 2015 at the age of 69 (a 53-year span as a recording artist) as her current LP ""Worthy"" - one of the best of the year so far - will attest.  This CD ""Take Another Little Piece of My Heart"" takes us back to late '69/early '70 when Bettye (""Betty"" then, without the final ""e"" she later added) was still 23 and already on her sixth (!) different record label.  This time she found herself on the short-lived Nashville-based Silver Fox imprint, so named not for Charlie Rich but for the guy who had the nickname earlier, Kenny Rogers' brother Lelan Rogers, who ran this SSS International subsidiary and produced these 13 tracks.  No LP (like Dusty Springfield's ""Dusty in Memphis"" earlier that year) emerged from these Bettye LaVette Memphis sessions, but four singles (eight sides) were issued at the time.Bettye's from-deep-in-the-gut, guttural singing style (so unusual for her age) was already well established by this time, and the sounds of Memphis Studio, with the backing of its Dixie Flyers rhythm section, was made to order for this young woman from Detroit who sounded so much more like a Southern R&B/blues singer than she did Motown.The four issued singles:1) ""He Made a Woman Out of Me"" (1969-70) - typically Bettye in that it held nothing back.  It rode the soul charts in December '69/January '70, peaking at #25.  This was the only one that appeared on a national pop chart, although barely: only making #118 in Cash Box.  A few months later, Bobbie Gentry, in her country-soul style, had a version out that got to #71 on the pop Hot 100.2) ""Do Your Duty"" (1970) - Yikes!  Talk about not holding back!  This was a real soul sister's women's liberation song demanding that certain needs, shall we say, be met by her man.  This goes well beyond Aretha Franklin's version of Otis Redding's ""Respect"" -- and ironically, its writer, Ronnie Shannon, wrote two of Aretha's other early hits at Atlantic (""I Never Loved a Man the Way I Loved You"" and ""Baby I Love You."").  It climbed to #38 soul in early spring.3) ""Games People Play"" (1970) - No national chart action at all but a phenomenal soul rendition of the recent Joe South Grammy winner for 1969 Song of the Year.  Maybe too recent and the public was ""Games People Played""-out at the time, although it sounds completely fresh today.  The B-side ""My Train's Comin' In"" is a hot one that sounds like another shoulda-been hit.4) ""Piece of My Heart"" (1970) - Yes, that (""Take Another Little) Piece of My Heart"" by Jerry Ragovoy and Bert Berns - originally by Erma Franklin (1967) and immortalized by Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company the following year.  Make the total three stellar versions in three years.  The B-side ""At the Mercy of a Man"" - the CD opener - is funky, bluesy, horn-driven, gutbucket soul that could probably only be sung by her or Tina Turner or Janis Joplin, or possibly Etta James then.  Bettye could still sing it now in the same way, but with even more maturity.  Alas, no chart action on this single either, so Bettye was off to label number seven.Most notable of the unissued tracks were the two she sang with Hank Ballard, the former R&B giant who came up with ""The Twist"" and also happened to be a Silver Fox artist at the time:  ""Hello Sunshine"" is a solid soul ballad previously recorded by both Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett at Atlantic; and ""Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go"" is a fun recreation of Ballard's own #1 R&B/ #6 pop smash from ten years earlier.  But my favorite of all is what could have been one of her signature records had it been released (up there [almost] with ""Let Me Down Easy"" which I bought midway through high school in June 1965): the magnificent southern soul ballad ""Easier to Say (Than Do)"" which has everything working for it: a superlative instrumental track featuring mighty Memphis soul horns and a right-on-the-money background vocal chorus - and above all, a beautifully deep, warm, heartfelt and commanding vocal by Bettye.  It was withheld from release most likely due to an another Lelan Rogers-produced version (with the same backing tracks) being out at the time as a Charles Hodges B-side -- ironically on the Calla label, on which Bettye had had her aforementioned biggest hit ""Let Me Down Easy"" four and a half years earlier.I gleaned the previous nugget of information, as well as a few others, from the five pages of accompanying booklet liner notes by author Bill Dahl.  (The best little informational gem is how Bettye got to Lelan Rogers and Silver Fox: it was at the suggestion of the latter's brother Kenny Rogers who thought Bettye's 1968 version of Mickey Newbury's ""What Condition My Condition Is In"" on the obscure Karen label in Detroit was ""the greatest thing [he'd] ever heard"" and ""much better"" than his own breakthrough hit version with the First Edition.)This is an excellent Varse Sarabande CD I'm glad I finally got to hear - in yet another great year in the amazing career of Bettye LaVette.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJH0I4490UTXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CQQHFE#wasThisHelpful","RJH0I4490UTXE","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Her contemporaries Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight both heaped praise upon her, and Linda Jones was only 22 when she had her signature hit record, the entrancing soul ballad ""Hypnotized"" in the summer of 1967 (a.k.a. ""the summer of love"").  The record had been rejected by a number of labels, until the brilliant soul songwriter and producer, Jerry Ragovoy, who was running Warner Brothers' soul imprint Loma at the time, instantly recognized its potential and put it out - the first of five chart records Ms. Jones was to have with the label in '67 and '68.  ""Hypnotized' went to #4 on the Billboard R&B chart while crossing over to #21 on its pop Hot 100.  She would double that number, making it an even ten on her two subsequent labels (Neptune and Turbo) before her shocking death resulting from diabetes at the age of 27.A true vocal dynamo, Linda Jones can be situated on the '60s/early-'70s soul-sister powerhouse-vocalist continuum between Aretha Franklin and Dee Dee Warwick, her ""neighbor"" from Northern New Jersey.  All three came from family gospel-singling groups and thus could instinctively belt out the secular soul as well.  Jones actually beat Aretha to Atlantic Records by two years, but she moved on after her dbut single on their Atco imprint, the hard-charging dancer, ""Take the Boy Out of the Country"" (b/w the mid-paced, organ-propelled beauty ""Taking Back My Love,"" which has her singing with passion in her highest register), surprisingly didn't catch on.  Jones was especially known for her intensely emotive, dramatic performances on ballads such as ""Hypnotized"" and its hit follow-up single ""What've I Done (To Make You Mad)"" [#8 R&B / #61 pop]; but besides her earlier Atco single, there are multiple examples here of her excelling at Motownesque uptempo material as well.  Her final single at Warner Brothers/Loma, ""I Just Can't Live My Life (Without You Babe)"" [one of five making its dbut on CD], even sounds like a Supremes title, but when it failed to chart, she and her excellent producer George Kerr moved on to Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Neptune label.  It was preceded by the classic big soul ballad ""I (Who Have Nothing),"" previously recorded by Ben E. King (who had the original U.S. hit with it) and the aforementioned Dee Dee Warwick.  This was just the type of song -tailor-made for Linda Jones.  The other slow-ballad cover version here [also making its CD dbut] is the one almost everyone was covering back then, Paul McCartney's ""Yesterday.""  Besides being ultra-soulful in her hands, this is her only song performance with a low-key ending, rendering it all the more dramatic.  Two other original ballads (co-written by Kerr) stand out for their rather spectacular, uncompromising expressions of heartbreak and torment: ""Seeing Is Believing"" and ""Fugitive from Love.""  Favorites of mine also include the southern-soul-style ballads ""The Things I've Been Through (Loving You)"" and ""What Can I Do (Without You).""As one would expect from a Real Gone Music/Rhino release, the digital remastering from the original sources is impeccable; plus this being a David Nathan/SoulMusic production, we benefit from his extensive knowledge of the subject of American soul from this era in the form of four pages of liner notes (contained in the eight-page accompanying booklet).  Thanks to him as well, we finally get the definitive clarification 48 years later on the ""hyp - NO - tized"" / ""hyp - MO -tized"" mini- (extermely mini-) controversy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TVLGCSYK1UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O58SPG4#wasThisHelpful","R12TVLGCSYK1UU","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For admirers of this utterly amazing and unique, modern-era (recording as a lead artist from 1957 to 1970, the year of his premature death at age 45) Louisiana delta blues harmonica master, songwriter and brilliantly expressive vocal interpreter of downhome, often country- and rock-tinged blues and R&B, this ""complete"" (and it is, for all practical purposes, just that) collection (5 discs, 410 minutes [=6 hours, 50 minutes], which averages to 82 minutes [!] per disc) is going to be incredibly difficult to pass up.The first two discs contain all his Excello-label issued material, which has all been available on high-quality CDs.  The harder question concerns the value of the other three discs: two containing all of the existing alternate takes and material that was unissued in his lifetime, plus the first-time-ever appearance of the last song he ever wrote and recorded (presumably, a home-made demo) during the last month of his life - January, 1970), and one (Disc 5) containing 87 and a half minutes of his live sets (including previously unissued material) from 1961.  I will admit that as a major fan of his since his biggest hit, ""Baby Scratch My Back"" from 1966 (talk about unique!) [#1 R&B / #13 pop in Cash Box], the first blues record I ever got - and I subsequently picked up his incredibly cool cover of Charlie Rich's ""Mohair Sam"" from 1968 (recorded at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals) [#113 pop in Cash Box], as well as his 1969 ""The Best of Slim Harpo"" LP - I was a bit hesitant about this purchase.  The clincher for me was the 12 in. X 12 in., 104-page book, available nowhere else but as part of this package.  It is colorful and comprehensive and of the highest quality.  62 pages of extremely well-written and detailed notes by Martin Hawkins on Slim's life (and death) and entire career - including each recording session - make it totally indispensable for Harpo-ites. (I would estimate that on its own it would be a $60 item.)  And having listened to Discs 2 through 5, I am fully convinced they are worth it as well.  Some of the alternate takes are significantly different from the released versions and are arguably even more enjoyable in their own way.  The live tracks from '61 are a bit iffy, given that the sub-par amateur sound recording rendered Slim's vocals somewhat muddy.  However, his harp and his band's instrumental work come through tolerably well; and the extended live versions of their instrumentals ""Buzzin'"" and ""Moody Blues"" are outstanding - especially the nine-minute latter song which thankfully was mic-ed much better.Ultimately, you can never really go wrong with Bear Family box sets of your favorite musical artists.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXK2FK7G1B0Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T6G0Y6E#wasThisHelpful","RXK2FK7G1B0Y2","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1964 was undoubtedly a watershed year for the American pop-music scene due to the breakthrough of Liverpool, England's Beatles (whose three U.S.-issued 1963 singles, including future U.S. #1 ""She Loves You,"" all tanked stateside that prior year) and the resulting so-called ""British invasion"" of groups and vocalists who followed them to the upper reaches of the U.S. pop charts.  There had been a mini-pre-""invasion"" of sorts in 1962, but that was mostly by British instrumentalists such as Kenny Ball with ""Midnight in Moscow"" [#2]; Acker Bilk and his ""Stranger on the Shore"" [#1];and the first #1 record in the U.S. by a British group, ""Telstar"" by the Tornadoes (produced by the legendary and notorious Joe Meek), which held the #1 spot on the America's national pop charts for three weeks, just 13 months before the Beatles got there.  The other big breakthrough in 1964 was the Supremes becoming Motown's first act to cross over onto the pop charts with multiple #1 records (both pop and R&B) - three in a row in '64.  In fact, the Supremes actually spent more time at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the second half of 1964 than the Beatles did.This present collection contains no Beatles or Supremes - who would hardly qualify as ""hard to find"" - but it does feature other British Invasion acts; some girl and girl-group pop (a genre which, apart from the emerging Supremes, peaked in '63); a pair of surf-style instrumentals; a five-song R&B hunk (including blues man B.B. King's biggest crossover-to-pop hit up to that point, ""Rock Me Baby"" [so sad to hear of his death this very morning]); a couple of cool remakes (Johnny Rivers' ""Mountain of Love"" and veteran crooner Dean Martin's ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime,"" which plowed right through to #1 in August); a car song (""G.T.O."" by Ronny & the Daytonas); a novelty (Shirley Ellis's ""The Name Game""); and a Top 40 hit by an unknown group, the Chartbusters, who were the first American group to credibly recreate the British beat-group sound with their ""She's the One.""Speaking of the British Invasion, in addition to the Kinks, Dusty Springfield, Herman's Hermits, Chad & Jeremy, and Matt Monro, THE highlight of this disc has to be the dbut in sensational digitally-enhanced stereo (DES) of the Animals' ""The House of the Rising Sun"" in its original unedited four-and-a-half minute British single form.  Five others that receive the first-time DES treatment and have never sounded better are Diane Renay's ""Navy Blue""; the surf instro ""Penetration"" by the Pyramids; rockabilly Gene Simmons' ""Haunted House""; Alvin Cash & the Crawlers' R&B dancer ""Twine Time""; and saving the next most impressive for last: Terry Stafford's ""Suspicion,"" the record that WOULD HAVE spent three weeks at #1 in the U.S. (instead of none nationally) if it weren't for the Beatles.The other U.S. solo act blocked by the Beatles (in this case, by their first and biggest of the year, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"") for what also would have been three weeks at the top was Lesley Gore with her powerfully-delivered proto-women's-liberation anthem ""You Don't Own Me.""  It's the closer (Trk 29) and is especially moving in the wake of her recent passing.  [For the sake of pure trivia, since the record in question doesn't appear here, the U.S. act that got screwed the worst by the Moptops (twice as badly as either Lesley Gore or Terry Stafford) was the Four Seasons, whose ""Dawn (Go Away)"" was deprived of six (!) weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.]The Diane Renay ""twin spin"" of ""Navy Blue"" and ""Kiss Me Sailor"" breaks format a bit, but forgotten follow-ups that flagrantly tried to ride their big-hit predecessors' coattails were a favorite phenomenon of mine from that era.  I'm also glad to get to hear a few records from the old days for the first time ever (51 years later!).  For me, there are three in this category for sure: French-Canadian chanteuse Lucille Starr's Edith Piaf-influenced ballad ""The French Song (Quand le soleil dit bonjour aux montagnes), Scott English (an American from Brooklyn, as opposed to being yet another British invader) and his ""High on a Hill"" (not a drug song!), and the Gene Pitney-penned ""Across the Street (Is a Million Miles Away)"" by Ray Peterson, which barely squeezed into the Cash Box top 100 at #99.Please keep going with these superb compilations, producer Bill Buster (with sound producers Mark Mathews and Walt Weiskopf) and Hit Parade/Eric Records.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6Z2W36XLC48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZJVIUW#wasThisHelpful","RX6Z2W36XLC48","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""Complete 60s"" pop instrumental series hit a licensing snag along the way (after Volume 3/1962) and has since had to double back to the 1950s, producing a brilliant set dedicated to 1959 and now this one, with 78 sparkling minutes of superbly sound-engineered nationally-charting instrumentals from 1950 to 1958.With a few exceptions from 1958, when the rock-inflected instrumental was becoming a bit more mainstream, what appears here for the most part is what came to be known as ""easy listening,"" a very popular format on the radio with adult audiences of the era and well into the sixties.  In its instrumental form it tended to be highly orchestrated and would often feature one dominant lead instrument that would carry a catchy melody and have a ""radio-friendly"" running time of under three minutes.  More than being anti-rock-and-roll, this music was really anti-jazz, which in the '50s turned considerably more be-bop and diverged fairly dramatically from the pop mainstream.  As far as I can determine, only ""Night Train"" from 1952 (here in Buddy Morrow's orchestral version) came directly out of jazz.I'll confess that I like much of this time period's ""easy listening"" material somewhat less than its rock-era counterpart but am glad that it is being preserved by Bill Buster and company (sound production by Mark Mathews and Walt Weiskopf) and presented with superior sound to anything it has ever previously known.Why is this collection absolutely ""essential""?  Answer: the magnificent ""digitally-extracted stereo"" (DES) CD dbuts of Les Baxter's ""The Poor People of Paris"" [the #1 instrumental hit of 1956 and sixth biggest pop hit overall in the breakthrough year of Elvis Presley]; Hugo Winterhalter and Eddie Heywood's ""Canadian Sunset"" [the fifth biggest instrumental hit of that same year, 1956 (and 21st biggest overall)]; and the rock instrumental classic ""Tequila"" by the Champs [the #1 instrumental and fifth biggest pop hit overall of 1958 (and the first-ever Grammy winner in the Rhythm & Blues category)].The accompanying booklet includes Greg Adams' six pages of concise but informative paragraphs covering each of the songs and artists featured in this collection.  The CD's back cover includes each song's national chart peak position (along with the year and month it dbuted on the chart), its running time, and if it appears here in regular stereo or in DES.Let's hope this valuable series can resume with its deep exploration of the rest of the 1960s; but in the meantime Bill Buster et al have done a phenomenal job with the fifties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358NRHQK25T8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZJVISE#wasThisHelpful","R358NRHQK25T8U","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gene Chandler's Brunswick singles national hit parade (peak positions on the Billboard soul chart listed as well as the peak pop-chart positions reached in either Billboard, Cash Box or Record World -- chronological song listing, which matches the CD track order):""The Girl Don't Care"" (1967)  #16 soul / #50 pop""There Goes the Lover"" (1967)  #46 soul / #96 pop""Show Me the Way to Go"" [with Barbara Acklin] (1968)  #30 soul / - pop (did not chart)""There Was a Time"" (1968)  #22 soul / #63 pop""From the Teacher to the Preacher"" [with Barbara Acklin] (1968)  #16 soul / #40 pop""Little Green Apples"" [with Barbara Acklin] (1969)  - soul (did not chart) / #123 popGene Chandler's national chart-hitting career spanned 24 years (1962-1986), and during this period of time he holds the record for hitting the R&B/soul charts on more different labels (9) than any other solo act.  I'm not sure what the significance of this ""record"" is, but it would seem to indicate that he was unstoppable.  At Vee Jay in 1962 he told us, ""Nothing can stop the Duke of Earl"" [#1 R&B and pop for multiple weeks on each chart]; and at his next stop at Constellation he proclaimed (in its title line), ""Nothing Can Stop Me"" [#3 R&B / #18 pop].  This present disc includes all nine of his singles (both A and B sides) at his fourth Chicago stop (immediately after the Checker division of Chess Records), Brunswick, from 1967 to 1969.  While at Brunswick he was the label's #2 male star after its longtime mainstay, the great Jackie Wilson.  Three of his nine single releases were duets with Barbara ""Love Makes a Woman"" Acklin, a terrific pairing clearly inspired by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell at Motown.As you can see from the above ""hit parade,"" there were no ""Duke of Earl"" massive-hit equivalents among his nine Brunswick singles, nor anything to rival ""Groovy Situation,"" his first release at his next Chicago-based label Mercury in 1970 [#8 soul / #10 pop].  Yet all these Brunswick records are solidly soulful, mature and creative.  Chandler co-wrote nine of the 18 sides, all of which were superbly produced by Carl Davis.This whole Brunswick reissue series on Japan's Solid/Ultra-Vybe imprint boasts masterly stereo remastering and sounds astonishingly vibrant and bright (even on the disc closer ""Suicide"" [!], one of Chandler's greatest little-known records).  Included in the twelve-page accompanying booklet are six pages of clearly legible English lyrics to all 18 songs, plus two pages of new liner notes (in Japanese, which I don't read).Chandler's tenor soul balladry is intense from start (""The Girl Don't Care"") to finish (""Suicide"").  ""Familiar Footsteps"" is an absolutely exquisite ballad that is kind of a throwback to his earlier post-doo-wop/early-soul style.  Shame on all the radio stations that didn't play this back in 1969!  ""Suicide"" is shatteringly dramatic and beautifully orchestrated; but even in an era when a melodramatic death ballad like Bobby Goldsboro's version of ""Honey"" could reach the top spot on the pop charts, ""Suicide"" was taking things a step too far for radio programmers.  Note that Chandler's next release (and first at Mercury) was the irresistibly upbeat and sunny ""Groovy Situation,"" which returned him to the Top Ten, both soul and pop.The big one with Barbara Acklin is the catchy, very Marvin-and-Tammi-like ""From the Teacher to the Preacher""; but the surprise here is the best cover version (the sexiest, anyway) of ""Little Green Apples,"" featuring a swirling orchestral backing.  Chandler's ""Eleanor Rigby"" cover is a cool mid-tempo one that borrows heavily from Ray Charles's hit remake.And for anyone convinced that Gene Chandler was merely a master of the soul ballad or occasional mid-tempo fare, listen to his sizzling take on James Brown's ""There Was a Time.""  He completely lets loose on this one, even tossing in his notorious post-""Duke of Earl"" nickname ""The Woman Handler"" as he dances ""the Gene Chandler.""This is a fantastic 49 minutes of Chicago soul.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQCWGB99GJ3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKC5SV0#wasThisHelpful","R2BQCWGB99GJ3G","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Volume One of this series, covering the One-Derful! label, began with Otis Clay's ""Got to Find a Way,"" his tribute to his mentor and great Chicago West side R&B/soul man Harold Burrage who suddenly departed this world in 1966 while at the height of his powers.  In fact, just the year before, Burrage had his biggest hit ever - as well as the M-Pac! label's [#7 on Cash Box's national R&B chart] - with his immortal original version of that hard-charging, relentlessly pulsating soul record.

The B-side ""Every Night,"" which closes the disc, is a powerhouse bluesy ballad with an after-midnight feel.It is so enjoyable to hear the Accents ever-so-upbeat ""New Girl"" from the summer of '64 again after so long - and the whistling bit remains a real attention-grabber.  It wasn't a nation-wide hit (unless you call a one-week ""Bubbling Under the Hot 100"" appearance at #128 in Billboard a hit), but it was huge in Chicago, reaching the top five on R&B station WVON and the top 30 on Chicago's pop giant WLS at a time when the British invasion was dominating their play list.  Just a carefree summer record from a youthful time.Maurice Dollison & the Turnkeys may not have succeeded in their attempt to launch a dance craze in 1963 with ""The Earthworm, Part 1,"" but they did leave us with a cool, funky workout featuring Dollison's slithery guitar licks and a girl chorus's priceless backing vocal chants of ""ah ooh wiggle wiggle"" and ""wiggle wiggle baby.""  Also from the early days (late '62) comes Bobby Davis's one-off frenetic rocker ""Damper Down,"" with sizzling guitar by Mighty Joe Young and a hot sax solo by Monk Higgins..  Also from '62 we get from Bobby Turner (the still actively recording younger half-brother of Blues and Rock & Roll hall of Famer Freddie King) and his fine self-penned ballad ""Come Back Home,"" which melds his mellow vocal with Phil Upchurch's blues guitar and an early urban-soul-emerging-out-of-doo-wop sound.1966 brought the excellent southern-soul-style single ""Don't Try to Fool Me"" b/w ""I Stand Alone"" by raspy-voiced Stacy Johnson; while the even raspier voice of Willie Parker in 1967 inhabited three (two previously unissued) hard-driving tunes which sound eerily like Motown productions with the Funk Brothers.  And in this disc's most pleasant surprise, I'll take the closest thing M-Pac! had to Motown's Miracles, the Ringleaders (from Saginaw, Michigan) and their pleading, sweet-soul (a contrast with all the ""hard soul"" around it) 1966 ballad ""Let's Start Over"" reminiscent of ""Ooo Baby Baby"" with its soaring high-tenor (Smokey-esque) lead vocal.  It became a Chicago soul hit, but the other side (""Baby, What Happened to Our Love"") also garnered some attention, as well it should have: it's a super-slinky, harmony-laden uptempo groover that refuses to let up.As with its predecessors, the sound work on this relatively - ranging to extremely - obscure material is sensational.

"With a voice that could just about have had her passing as the fourth singing Franklin sister (after Aretha, Erma and Carolyn) and a warm, honest and passionate delivery 100% on target on every one of these well-crafted Southern soul songs, the late Sandra Wright should have gotten more opportunities to record and become a big name in soul.Her only two real chances for a breakthrough came first with a pair of Coral-label singles recorded in Nashville in 1968 when she was twenty (they elicited no action) and then six years later for Stax Records in her native Memphis.  Both sides of her two singles for Stax (issued on the company's subsidiary Truth label in '74 and early '75 are here on this disc: the title track ""Wounded Woman"" b/w ""Midnight Affair"" and ""Lovin' You Lovin' Me"" b/w  ""Please Don't Say Goodbye.""  Again, no action, despite these being such strong soul tracks superbly produced and engineered by David Johnson at Broadway Sound in Sheffield, Alabama using a group of outstanding musicians mostly from Muscle Shoals (including a stellar horn section).  Still, five more tracks were recorded with the intention of an LP being released in '75.  Following Shirley Brown's huge soul/pop crossover success in late '74 on this same Truth label with her single ""Woman to Woman"" [#1 soul / #22 pop], things still looked promising for this type of down-home Southern soul.  But by '75 Stax was struggling financially (en route to bankruptcy the following year), and there was no way at that point for them to be able to promote and work a distribution deal for a virtually unknown artist with zero hits to her credit.  Thus, the LP was shelved and only first came out on the UK's Demon label in 1989.  And now it returns in 2015 on Soul Brother Records (thanks to the continuing British interest in traditional soul music), digitally remastered and sounding better than ever.  The nine tracks total just 28 and a half minutes, but this is solid Southern soul that sounds fresh and won't wear out its welcome.I would estimate that I have seven or eight favorites out of the nine, so I'll just mention a handful: ""Wounded Woman,"" with its infectious mid-tempo groove makes it in my mind a cousin to Barbara Acklin's ""Love Makes a Woman"" and ""Clean Up Woman"" by Betty Wright [no relation]; ""Lovin' You Lovin' Me"" adds some sensuality of the sort Millie Jackson was selling with at the time (albeit without any of the raunch occasionally associated with Ms. Jackson); ""I Come Running Back"" is an Aretha-style mid-tempo ballad fueled by the fantastic horn section; ""I'm Not Strong Enough to Love You Again"" (the briefer ""Not Strong Enough"" might have been a better title) is in the warm and confessional style of labelmate Shirley Brown; while ""The Sha-La Bandit"" is the one that fascinates me the most.  It has somewhat of a soft and slinky Memphis Hi Records style that makes me think this had to be inspired by Al Green's ""Sha-La-La (Make Me Happy),"" which was just taking off around the time this was recorded.  It almost seems like an ""answer"" record about having her ""sha-la"" (happiness) stolen from her.  I could be way off here, but I'm enjoying it anyway, as I am this entire disc.This is classic, traditional Southern soul with a 1968-1974 flavor - with no funk or synthetic elements.  Thanks again, Soul Brother, for giving us the real thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BA8GCA74FXS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2TAP1S#wasThisHelpful","R1BA8GCA74FXS2","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recorded in 1971, ""Faithful"" was intended to be Dusty Springfield's third LP at Atlantic, after ""Dusty in Memphis"" (1969) and ""A Brand New Me"" (1970), and was expected to be released early in 1972.  Yet only now (a mere 43 years later!), thanks to Real Gone Music (UK), it is seeing its first release in its complete original album form.White-hot producer at the time, Jeff Barry, was brought over to Atlantic to helm this project (he also arranged, as well as contributing three new songs); and while I'm not going to say this LP, as now thoroughly reconstituted, is as strong overall as its two predecessors, it is definitely playing in the same league.  Dusty is as passionate and emotional, sultry and soulful as ever -- and I would contend that at least a couple of her finest performances on record can be found here.Two singles from this set did in fact get issued in 1971, but despite their high quality, neither charted nationally.  The first single A-side, ""Haunted,"" (written by Barry and Bobby ""Montego Bay"" Bloom) has Dusty in hard-charging Motown mode on a song that reminds me a lot of two by Marvin Gaye that I really liked from 1968 (preceding ""I Heard it Through the Grapevine""): ""You"" and ""Chained"" (both about love obsessions, as is ""Haunted"").  The Barry-Bloom B-side ""Nothing is Forever"" (a bonus track here, as it was not intended for the ""Faithful"" LP) is a big ballad, Dusty's other specialty besides soulful pop.  The second issued single was Jeff Barry's ""I Believe in You,"" which sounds as though it could have been the deepest southern-soul recording ever attempted by a white British artist up to that point.  It's one of her greatest moments, but it may have been too specialized for the marketplace at the time, which was mostly driven by radio airplay.  The B-side was the dramatic pop ballad with strings, ""Someone Who Cares,"" a 1970 movie theme done first by Kenny Rogers & the First Edition.In any event, with these two singles going nowhere; and given Dusty's ""dissatisfaction"" with Atlantic (according to Joe Marchese's informative liner notes), she flew the coop (moving to ABC/Dunhill) before the LP could be released, pretty much assuring its extinction.But at least we have it now!  And in addition to ""Haunted"" and ""I Believe in You,"" it contains some other truly fine ones.  The original, ""Love Shine Down,"" is one of several gospel-tinged numbers (there is also the opener ""I'll Be Faithful,"" whence the LP's title, and its closer, ""I Found My Way Through the Darkness""), and her performance on it is clearly Aretha-inspired.  Interestingly, Dusty does a catchy, uptempo original titled ""All the King's Horses,"" which would appear to have inspired labelmate Aretha's own self-penned 1972 ballad by this exact title.Besides the aforementioned ""Someone Who Cares,"" the two other cover versions here are of some note [no pun intended]: Carole King's ""You've Got a Friend"" (from ""Tapestry"") has to be one of the most covered songs of the '70s, but Dusty's version was actually one of the very earliest, recorded before ""Tapestry"" even got to the #1 spot.  It should be noted that Dusty had regularly been covering Carole's songs for eight years when she recorded this one.  But taking the remake cake is a magnificent, heavenly reading (with a gorgeous Barry arrangement) of David Gates/Bread's #1 pop ballad from the previous year, ""Make It with You.""  It could very well be Dusty's most sensual vocal performance ever.  She almost seems to be caressing the words as much as singing them; and it doesn't take long before she's floating on air into her highest register.  I'll repeat: magnificent!And only four tracks later (with the excellent ""Love Shine Down,"" ""I Believe in You"" and ""Have a Good Life"" in between), she is rocking out southern-style (very credibly, I might add) on the pounding, insistent, electric-guitar-laden ""Natchez Trace.""This is definitely the frontrunner so far in 2015 for finest album reissue of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R604G249LYT1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPVW2A6#wasThisHelpful","R604G249LYT1K","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I belatedly realized I could not consider myself a true connoisseur of '60s/70s pop music without owning at least one full CD of the best of Serge Gainsbourg.  Given the task of putting together 70 minutes of his best work, I don't think it's possible to do much better than this ""best-of"" set consisting of 23 songs spanning 1958-1980.  I really can't quibble with any of the selections here; and I'm grateful that some songs I find irritating, such as Marabout, Jeunes femmes at vieux messieurs and Nazi Rock are NOT present.  (I realize Nazi Rock is a spoof, but having heard it once is sufficient.)Most indispensable of course is the inclusion of the sexually provocative Trk 12, Je t'aime moi non plus with Jane Birkin from 1969, the notorious international sensation that was banned from the airwaves all over the place (even in France, where it was not allowed to be broadcast until after 11 p.m.).  Despite being banned by the BBC (or possibly because of it), it got to #1 in the UK.  In the U.S., where it was disallowed by most outlets, it got to #58 nationally on the Billboard Hot 100 (make that the very hot 100!); and Record World had its fun by allowing it to rise to #69 on its chart.  I heard it on the air in Urbana, Illinois, but that was on college radio.  (Chicago's two 50,000-watts Top 40 stations were busy playing the Archies and the Cuff Links at the time.)  And yes, Gainsbourg did purposely plan this record's release for '69, which he labeled l'anne rotique.  Trk 14, in fact, is none other than the companion Jane Birkin duet titled 69 Anne rotique.  Both Bonnie and Clyde (Trk 8) and Je t'aime moi non plus were recorded as duets with Brigitte Bardot, but BB requested her original version of the latter be withdrawn before release (so to speak).  Gainsbourg, after offering the song to a few others who turned it down, finally landed on (so to speak) a willing Jane Birkin.  Trk 10, Initials BB, has a moping Serge in London trying to drink away the vivid, haunting memories of his steamy, whirlwind affair with Bardot.  It too is essential listening.From the turn of the '70s, La Ballade de Melody Nelson is here, as is La Dcadanse (such a clever wordplay coinage for dirty dancing) with Birkin.  From mid-decade is the terrific pop song Je suis venu te dire que je m'en vais (""I Came to Tell You I'm Going""), an eloquent expression of profound regret about a romantic affair run its course.  From the end of the decade is Gainsbourg's most highly-charged political song ever: his reggae-style, defiantly satirical and anti-establishment take-off on the French national anthem La Marseillaise titled Aux armes et caetera.  France's virulently anti-Semitic right-wing went nuts and his life was seriously threatened.  Gainsbourg, in his own iconoclastic way, wound up reminding the country that La Marseillaise was itself a hated, feared - and banned! - song by the establishment of its time, which is how it emerged to become the anthem of the Revolution in the first place.The disc closes with a duet featuring yet another all-time lovely, Catherine Deneuve, on the only slightly blasphemous song Dieu fumeur de Havanes about God being an appreciator of fine Cuban cigars.Besides Je t'aime moi non plus I'll choose as three favorites: 1) the disc-opening Le Poinoinneur de Lilas, which was also the opening track of Gainsbourg's dbut LP from 1958 -- it's really a brilliant short story in the form of a mesmerizing up-tempo song about a Paris Mtro ticket puncher who faces an existential dilemma; 2) Qui est in qui est out? (1966), a breezy freakbeat commentary on the disposable pop culture of the time (including the pop music scene that he himself was part of); and 3) last but not least, the insanely catchy (and just plain insane - like a fox) Chez les Y-Y (1963), in which he recreates what would roughly be the equivalent of a Taylor Swift pop hit for its time appealing to young girls (of course, the music was much better then!) and...let's just say, he adopts a subversive, highly socially inappropriate attitude that turns it inside out.  Hilarious, as is the must-see(-to-believe!) YouTube dancing man video of the song.Poet, satirist, sensualist, iconoclast, provocateur, playboy, pervert, eccentric genius with a solid grasp of popular music and the power of the pop lyric, Serge Gainsbourg was not afraid of flying too close to the sun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDB02L0SJ3W8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IW6I#wasThisHelpful","RMDB02L0SJ3W8","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is truly exceptional: over two and a half hours of instrumental music from Motown Records 1964-1970.  The Motown hit factory in the Detroit years (until the move to LA starting in '72) was not exactly known for its instrumentals.  In fact, only five Motown instrumental single sides from this era ever charted nationally: four by Jr. Walker & the All Stars and one by Stevie Wonder using the pseudonym Eivets Rednow (his name spelled backwards).  And none of these cracked the Top 30 on any of the national pop charts.However, the company in its Detroit heyday was known for its fantastic, extremely consistent and influential session musicians. They were the ones who developed what became identified as ""the Motown sound"" and were its backbone and unsung heroes.  Chief among them were bassist James Jamerson and the Detroit jazz organist/pianist Earl Van Dyke whom Jamerson persuaded to give up life on the road and come to work at Motown.  Van Dyke was such a powerful and unique player Motown went ahead and released six singles and two LPs under his name.  They are all here on these two filled-to-the-brim discs by Hip-O/Select/UMG/Motown - plus ample bonus material, including three ultra-rare (two previously unissued) tracks under Jamerson's name.  There is nothing here that is short of smoking hot, despite the fact that none of the issued material ever rang up enough sales to chart nation-wide.The first LP, ""That Motown Sound"" (1965) by Earl Van Dyke and the Soul Brothers (Motown felt that the name Soul Brothers had more class than the rhythm section's real name, the Funk Brothers), consists of 12 tracks whose vocals were replaced by EVD's Hammond B3.  Most of these tracks are so familiar (""My Girl,"" ""Nowhere to Run,"" ""Come See About Me,"" ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You),"" etc., that at first it seems strange to hear EVD's organ chime in at the exact point, for example, you're expecting to hear David Ruffin intone ""I've got sunshine on a cloudy day..."".  Each track on its own really cooks, no doubt about it, but you really have to like the soul organ sound to stay with this for 12 straight tracks.  Four (!) tracks of Marvin Gaye tunes is excessive (more variety is needed) and will make you miss Marvin's voice.The Disc 1 bonus tracks really help out with this variety ""problem,"" as they include both sides of EVD's 1964 dbut single ""Soul Stomp"" and ""Hot 'N' Tot"" (on which those titles tell the whole story), as well as his cool 1966 single ""6 By 6"" with The Motown Brass (Motown's stellar horn section).  ""The Flick"" (composed by EVD, Jamerson and guitarist Robert White) is not in its two-part 1966 single form but appears instead in a previously unissued, uncut alternate version, which at 12 minutes long becomes rather tedious (too much of a good thing perhaps).  There are also a couple of tracks recorded live in Paris: sizzling, somewhat jazzier reprises of singles heard earlier, ""Soul Stomp"" and from the ""That Motown Sound"" LP, the Marvelettes' ""Too Many Fish in the Sea.""Disc 2 is anchored by Van Dyke's second, final and even rarer live LP, ""The Earl of Funk,"" from 1970.  Since it is not tied to any previously laid-down tracks, it has the distinct advantage of being freer and looser (although the funk is tight and intense on a number of the dozen tunes here), allowing these superb musicians (George Benson, sax; Uriel Jones, drums; Eddie ""Bongo"" Brown, congas and percussion; in addition to EVD, Jamerson and White) to really shine (and jam [!] on the funk numbers).  It's a cool mix of mid-tempo to slow pop and pop-soul ballads of the era (""Someday We'll Be Together,"" ""My Cherie Amour,"" ""Rainy Night in Georgia,"" ""Wichita Lineman,"" and one from the early '60s, ""Stand by Me""), one pop-rocker that gets s soul workout (""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye""), a bunch that get majorly funked up (The Meters' ""Cissy Strut,"" Sly Stone's ""Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin,"" EVD's previous single ""The Flick"" and two originals: EVD's ""The Stingray"" and the EVD-Henry Cosby-Stevie Wonder co-write ""The Whip-A-Rang,"" as well as a throwback to an earlier era (think Duke Ellington in the '40s), saxophonist George Benson's ""Fuschia [sic] Moods.""  Speaking of this George Benson (as opposed to the singer-guitarist of the same name), he is also amazingly mellow and compelling at the same time on ""My Cherie Amour"" and ""Rainy Night in Georgia.""  Electric guitarist Robert White glows on ""My Cherie Amour"" and is utterly fine on my favorite here, the bluesiest version ever of Ben E. King's ""Stand by Me.""The Disc Two bonus tracks, besides the three James Jamerson features (Wow, does ""Fever in the Funkhouse"" ever live up to its title!), include the moving closer ""Ode to Benny B."" (dedicated to the recently deceased Funk Brothers drummer Benny Benjamin), on which Stevie Wonder contributes the harmonica part; EVD's final single, ""Runaway Child, Running Wild""; and two of my other favorites in this collection, which have EVD playing piano:  Jimmy Ruffin's ""Gonna Give Her All the Love I've Got"" (very slinky and cool) and a previously unissued version of the ever-tuneful ""Too Busy Thinking About My Baby.""  (I know, yet another Marvin Gaye song over a a pre-recorded track; but this is from a different time, and we get to hear EVD on a different instrument.)This is an outstanding compilation, with sparkling digitally remastered sound and a colorful, photo-filled 28-page booklet that includes detailed track credits and well-written, informative notes by ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" author (and film co-producer) Allan Slutsky,  It's a bit too rich for even a couple of sittings; but listened to a bit at a time it's a breath of fresh air for fans of Motown, instrumentals, and sixties soul and funk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKCJ6KLBUOUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IGNP0G#wasThisHelpful","R3RKCJ6KLBUOUU","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One would most likely need to be a dedicated fan of the genre to even know the name of the late songwriter/singer George Jackson (who passed away two years ago), let alone be interested in this third volume of his ""rare and unreleased recordings from the Fame [Records in Muscle Shoals, Alabama] vaults"" from the late '60s/early '70s. Jackson was a staff songwriter at Fame during this time, so what we have here are mostly unsold demos sung by him.  Only the anomalous title song of this collection, the ""tear-in-his-beer"" country ballad ""Old Friend"" (co-written with O.B. McClinton, who went on to become one of the most successful black country recording artists of the '70s and '80s), sounds fully fleshed out.  It had previously been recorded at Goldwax in Memphis by soul artist Spencer Wiggins, and it seems as if it were at some point intended for release in this George Jackson Fame-recorded version.As far as pure lyrical phrasing is concerned, Jackson was close to unbeatable, as no one grasped the nuances of his songs as well as he.  But vocally, in terms of his sound, while pleasing and competent enough, his singing did not possess the excitement or uniqueness (the memorability or recognition factor) necessary to stoke major record sales - certainly not in a league with, say, Clarence Carter or Wilson Pickett, the two most prominent male recording artists who recorded his Fame songs.One song here in demo form that did make it onto a Fame recording was the swaggering ""My Own Style of Lovin',"" which was tailor-made for Wilson Pickett on whose 1969 ""Hey Jude"" LP it would appear.  Both the Jackson demo and the Pickett recording feature the stinging electric guitar licks of the immortal Duane Allman.  Another good one that got picked up was ""Heart on a String,"" which came out as the 1970 B-side of Candi Staton's soul/pop crossover hit (also a Jackson co-write), ""I'm Just a Prisoner (Of Your Good Lovin').""  (Staton was by far Fame's all-time leading female artist.)  ""Break Away from Me"" was no doubt intended for Clarence Carter but was obviously too much of a sound-alike with his big hit ""Too Weak to Fight,"" also co-penned by Jackson.  And speaking of unsellable sound-alikes, Jackson's ""I'm in the Middle of a Good Thing"" comes perilously close to infringing on Eddie Floyd/Steve Cropper's ""Knock on Wood"" copyright.These demo recordings have the major advantage of being backed by Fame's stellar Southern-soul session musicians; and the more layers that were applied to each one the better.  The lead-off track ""It's Up to His Woman"" has impressive soul horns on it, while the consecutive rocking tracks, ""Switch Tracks"" and ""Two Legs and a Red"" (the latter again penned by O.B. McClinton), feature cool (non-Duane Allman) guitar.  ""Just Another Day"" is a sweet soul ballad [no kinship with the Paul McCartney song] with gorgeous piano, organ and guitar.  The bouncy, organ-driven duet ""Gotta Have Soul"" with co-writer Marjorie Ingram (sounding a bit like Carla Thomas) could have had minor hit potential with a full production.Frankly though, a few too many of these songs and recordings don't really amount to much and would seem to be here solely to be put on the historical record, so to speak - and can be considered completist fare only.  Hence, my four-star rating.  As CDs of demos go, this is no Carole King's ""The Legendary Demos"" (2012); but it still contains enough good tracks to recommend it.One track I am definitely not recommending is the closing one, which is just a curiosity piece: the 1963 crude home demo recording of an 18-year-old Jackson doing his own ""Won't Nobody Cha-Cha with Me.""  It's as bad as its title would indicate (and it's a rough two and a half minutes to get through for the listener).Finally, this being a Tony Rounce Ace/Kent Soul compilation, we get the benefit of his four pages of insightful, meticulously researched liner notes.Oddity: The penultimate track, an attempt at a Percy Sledge-style ballad, is twice listed and once referred to in Rounce's notes as ""That from the Heart,"" which is not even English.  It should be ""That Comes from the Heart.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPC7XMXS6GNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPP99FM#wasThisHelpful","R2RPC7XMXS6GNG","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is easily one of the best soul jazz recordings of its decade (the 1970s), made for what had been the genre's leading label, Cadet, the jazz division of the legendary Chess Records of Chicago.  ""Superstition"" (1973) was the third of organist Shirley Scott's three LPs for Cadet from '71 to '73, but the label was then owned by GRT out of New York and wouldn't be for much longer.  But whereas the business situation was in decline (as it had been since Leonard Chess's death in 1969), artistically it had no effect on the excellence on display here: superb production by Esmond Edwards and a fantastic lineup of personnel backing Shirley Scott who was still at her '60s peak.This is forty minutes of ""sizzling hot, funky '70s soul jazz"" [quoting my review title] that never lets up.  Shirley's 7:44 original ""Hanky's Panky"" (I assure you, nothing to do with Tommy James & the Shondells!) is rip-roaring and sets the whole tone for this LP, allowing her whole crew of soloists to let loose: Jimmy Ponder (electric guitar), Jimmy Owens (trumpet), and a real star turn throughout by Ramon Morris on tenor sax.  In the penultimate position (Trk 6) comes her other original here, the equally hot (but shorter and with a higher Shirley solo quotient) ""Liberation Song.""  Not receiving solo time but deserving of major credit is the rhythm section of drummer Grady Tate and bassists Ron Carter and Richard Evans, the latter of whom provided all the stellar horn arrangements.That leaves the five cover versions, all of which receive the funkiest blasts of soul they have ever known: the Carpenters' ""Rainy Days and Mondays"" for darn sure!  The Beatles' ""Lady Madonna"" is the first of these.  We knew from Fats Domino it had R&B/soul potential, but nothing like this.  It positively smokes!  The title song, Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"" is the least surprising choice, but it's definitely a cool one to hear on soulful organ.  For me, two peak high points (as opposed to all the other nothing but high points) are her takes on the Stylistics' touching and beautiful ""People Make the World Go Round"" and Gato Barbieri's brilliant jazz theme from ""Last Tango in Paris.""  The former is framed in all its melodic gorgeousness, but Shirley and company are undeterred from exploring its inner grooviness and jamming with it for a while.  The latter builds on Barbieri's sweet, swirling melody and takes it to the stratosphere - and saxophonist Ramon Morris does seem to be somewhere in outer space on his intro and outro solos.  But then, when you see that the closer is the languid Paul Williams/Roger Nichols ballad ""Rainy Days and Mondays (Always Get Me Down),"" immortalized by the soothing but sad-sounding voice of Karen Carpenter, it looks like Shirley is set to take us home with a sweet, slow one.  Not on your life!  She turns it into a jaunty romp that will have you thinking maybe rainy days and Mondays aren't so bad after all.This is the sort of seventies soul jazz I like the best: all organic (excuse the pun).

"This is entirely synthed and programmed electro-pop music, which I don't care for in most contexts - but it works very well on ""Maneater,"" ""I Can't Go for That,"" ""Kiss on My List,"" and surprisingly, ""Sara Smile.""  On some of the other tracks, though, it's a bit off, even creating sort of a sour sound (which nearly sinks ""She's Gone,"" for example, and detracts from what otherwise could have been an excellent ""One on One."")  At least, the mechanics of this music are understated and simple enough that it doesn't become unlistenable at any point.  However, it's Inara George's cool, detached, yet pleasingly retro-soulful, note-perfect vocals on every one of these Hall & Oates covers which make this album something special and worth listening to on repeated occasions.The disc's opener is the one original here by the duo (Greg Kurstin and Inara George), and it's a real attention-grabber: ""Heard It on the Radio"" is by far the ""busiest,"" most thoroughly contemporary production here, but it fulfills its mission of setting you up for the tuneful Hall & Oates music (we heard on the radio) to follow.These H & O songs are solidly constructed pop gems that don't need much alteration; and fortunately, the melodies are all left intact.  But it's kind of a mixed bag for me overall.  I really like the aforementioned four (from my opening sentence) a lot but cannot completely endorse the rest.  Organic musicianship with some of the same cleverness exhibited here could have made this an all-around indispensable covers album.

"Little Milton (Campbell) may not have been the greatest R&B artist or the greatest blues artist or the greatest soul artist of all time (although I would rank him high in each category), but he and Bobby Bland were easily the two best ever at incorporating all three genres into all their work for many decades (both of them breaking big in the 1960s).  Little Milton could also play a downright dazzling electric blues guitar when the song at hand called for it.Growing up in the '60s, I had three Little Milton 45s on the Checker (division of Chicago's Chess Records) label: the magnificent message song ""We're Gonna Make It"" from 1965 [his biggest hit ever: #1 R&B / #18 pop]; ""More and More"" (famously covered by Blood, Sweat & Tears"" later in 1968); and in 1969, the title song of this present stellar LP which sounds sensational on this super-high-quality stereo Japanese-import reissue.""Grits Ain't Groceries"" is sheer late-'60s R&B greatness - an exciting, rollicking remake of the Titus Turner tune that turned out to be Little Willie John's dbut hit [#5 R&B] in 1955 (then titled ""All Around the World"").  Little Milton scored a #13 soul / # 73 pop hit with it.  I thought its passionately powerful and smoldering Chicago blues B-side ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" (co-written by Milton, and with that dazzling guitar I mentioned) made it an unbeatable combination, worthy of of #1 - at least on the soul charts.  ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" (all 6:42 of it) appears here as Trk 3, right after ""Grits,"" which is as it should be.  In any case, it was Chess Records' biggest R&B/soul hit of the year, which is significant considering that they were up against the Motown machine, James Brown and Aretha Franklin who combined to spend 36 (out of 52) weeks at the top of the Billboard soul chart in '69.Both sides of the follow-up 45 to ""Grits Ain't Groceries""/""I Can't Quit You Baby"" are here: ""Just a Little Bit"" b/w ""Spring.""  ""Just a Little Bit"" (originally recorded by Tiny Topsy in 1959) is another rousing and gritty energy generator that coincidentally also peaked at #13 soul - but could only manage to crawl to the #97 position on the Hot 100 pop chart.  (Neither Bobby Bland nor Little Milton were artists Top 40 stations of the era were interested in programming consistently: too soul-bluesy, as opposed to toned-down and smoothed-out Motown-y pop-soul which dominated the black-music quotient on white-run stations across the country),  ""Spring"" is a mid-tempo groover with a hot horns, sax and organ accompaniment that won't just won't quit (truly - it goes on for an extra minute or so with Milton just joyfully ad-libbing and soul-wailing behind it.There is an excellent cover of Jimmy Hughes' Muscle Shoals/Fame studio original ""Steal Away,"" while ""You're the One"" has Little Milton in full-on, smoky-voiced Bobby Bland R&B crooner mode.  The LP closer takes him deep into B.B. King territory (guitar and all): a stunning remake of B.B.'s ""Did You Ever Really Love a Woman"" from 1956.  For anyone looking for a shorthand way of describing Little Milton's music, you could just say he was kind of a musical cross between B.B. King and Bobby Bland, and you wouldn't be far off.What a year 1969 was for these three: B.B. King's ""Why I Sing the Blues,"" Bobby Bland's ""Chains of Love"" and Little Milton's ""Grits Ain't Groceries""!

"Ace/Kent Soul and compiler/liner-notes author Tony Rounce have done it again!  For the first time ever we get every one of Garnet Mimms's 14 singles (both A & B sides) during his hit-making years (1963-66) at United Artists working with the great Jerry Ragovoy and Bert Berns as his producers and co-writers (Jerry Ragovoy produced on all 29 tracks).  And to bring the total CD running time to 77 minutes, Kent Soul included as the catchy closer the 1964 LP title track (and should-have-been single) ""As Long As I Have You.""  Incidentally, the Veep label was United Artists' R&B subsidiary on which Mimms's final three 45s for the company were placed.Because we are dealing with Ace Records, all the deluxe CD-package amenities are in place: impeccable sound mastering (nearly all tracks are in stereo), making the 1960s sound as good as they ever have since...well, the '60s and the original 45s (until we wore them down); and exquisite graphic and photographic art, featuring all the colorful realia you could want in a 16-page booklet, and which serve to illustrate Tony Rounce's telling of the complete Garnet Mimms musical story: from his gospel, pre-R&B/soul roots and finally back to gospel and the church again.In 1963 Garnet Mimms accomplished something that Hall of Famers James Brown, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding and Jackie Wilson did not: Mimms had two U.S. Top Ten R&B records, including a #1 song that also made the pop top four.  The only other recording act that year to do this was Martha & the Vandellas.  And by the way, the aforementioned Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson were - as we learn in the liner notes - the two biggest influences on the big-voiced Mimms's singing.  The fact is that Mimms was so vocally versatile he could sing comfortably in several different registers and styles.  (Just for fun, see if he doesn't sound almost exactly like Ben E. King on his revival of the Jarmels' ""A Little Bit of Soap,"" as well as getting eerily close to Sam Cooke's sound on ""That Goes to Show You"" and ""Keep On Smilin'."")Garnet Mimms's great #1 R&B smash [three weeks at #1; also, #4 pop on all three principal U.S. charts at the time] was Ragovoy's and Berns's ""Cry Baby,"" his dbut United Artists record with his backing group the Enchanters.  The verses are sincerely and warmly voiced, measured and melodic; but then the chorus erupts into emotive secularized gospel fervor in a strikingly original way that caught people's attention and may have advanced the development of soul music in the '60s (as a separate branch of R&B) more than any other single record - particularly given its huge and unexpected crossover success.  The song was still as compelling as ever eight years later when Janis Joplin had a posthumous Top 20 pop hit with it.I will just mention my favorite Garnet Mimms records from the following two years: ""A Quiet Place"" (1964), with its realistic depiction of close-quarters urban living (euphemism for tenements/slums), had diminished chart success [#25 R&B / #73 pop] due to its having been a B-side originally; and the emphatic and sophisticated ""It Was Easier to Hurt Her"" (1965), which only ""bubbled under"" the Billboard Hot 100 at #124.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROIPEXE8GIJA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TE3P5AE#wasThisHelpful","ROIPEXE8GIJA2","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the case of the Rolling Stones and ""It's All Over Now,"" which came out just a month after the Valentinos' original, the original's progress on the pop charts was significantly impaired  as the latter came to dominate Top 40 radio airplay.  (However, an initially disappointed Bobby Womack would receive ample consolation in the form of songwriter royalties.)The new early-sixties term ""soul music,"" as opposed to the existing term ""rhythm & blues,"" originally referred to the secularized adaptations of gospel songs that were becoming hits. The clearest example of this is offered by the juxtaposition on this present CD of Trks 2 and 3, the gospel single ""Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray"" by the Womack Brothers and their dbut secular single ""Lookin' for a Love"" as the Valentinos, a direct adaptation of the former.  Sam Cooke, who co-founded and was heavily involved with running SAR, was a major proponent of this new development in black popular music and was only too glad to have his young protgs (the Womack brothers, a.k.a. the Valentinos) become the breakthrough group in this field.This is exciting, very raw and emotive, organic-sounding music - all the more so on the tracks featuring Bobby Womack's raspy, gritty, compelling and commanding lead vocals.  Some of the others (ironically, on those most influenced by Sam Cooke's smoother sound) make a much lesser impression.Stellar sound engineering by ABKCO Records and a very fine booklet with comprehensive, highly informative liner notes by author Bill Dahl; and also possibly the most thorough individual track and session credits you will see this year for recordings that go back 54 years.  Just a superlatively produced compilation by Teri Landi.  This is a superb follow-up to last year's L.C. Cooke's ""Complete SAR Recordings.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA4IFVMQRT0FL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P2HSCBU#wasThisHelpful","RA4IFVMQRT0FL","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LP was the very obvious follow-up to the moderately commercially successful ""The Look of Love.""  Both took their titles from their opening Burt Bacharach tunes; and both included other contemporary pop hits, including by the Beatles.  This one added a second Paul McCartney Beatles song, with the last two tracks being ""Hey Jude"" and ""Fool on the Hill.""The arranger on both ""The Look of Love"" and ""Always Something There"" was the great Thad Jones, who contributed one excellent original blues-jazz composition for each - here, one called ""Home Town,"" which outstrips everything else due to its creative jazz content.  For this outing, Jones - who strictly stuck to his arranger-composer duties on ""The Look of Love"" - played trumpet on half of the ten tracks.  However, only add to the orchestral pop side while detracting from the soul-jazz side.I would have to say that much of this particular ""Always Something There"" advantage is offset by the dubbed-in strings on all tracks which There is quite a roster of notable sidemen here, including Kenny Burrell on guitar (for eight tracks); Jerome Richardson on flute, clarinet and duet tenor sax; and Herbie Hancock and Hank Jones splitting the piano assignments (with Hancock appearing on eight tracks).The two slow, romantic ballads, Leslie Bricusse's ""When I Look in Your Eyes"" (from ""Doctor Dolittle"") and ""Song for Bonnie"" (an original by brother Tommy Turrentine) are beautifully rendered - and I'll cut them some slack for their use of the dubbed-in strings.That leaves the seven pop covers, which are generally taken at a midtempo pace (which means ""Hey Jude"" moves along faster normal, actually making for an appealing change) and don't stray too far from their principal melodies.  Frankly, not much can be done with ""Little Green Apples"" or ""Those Were the Days,"" but Turrentine and company sizzle and sometimes even soar on the others due to the cool, brilliant melodies, changes and sequences they have to work with.  In addition to ""Hey Jude"" and a graceful, waltz-time ""Fool on the Hill,"" we're talking the Doors' ""Light My Fire"" (definitely an incendiary bluesy-soulful take on this one!) and Laura Nyro's groovy ""Stoned Soul Picnic.""  And the title song, ""Always Something There,"" originally recorded as a soul record by Lou Johnson, is given a prime soul-jazz take here to get things started.  Blue Note artists as formidable as the ones I've named cannot possibly miss targets this well constructed - and they don't.  The good time they are having bounces right back on us, the listeners.  Special kudos to Stanley on ""Stoned Soul Picnic"" for becoming so enthralled that he can't hold back from launching into some far-out improvisation toward the end.  Too bad it gets faded out so quickly, as this LP was not really going for that.This Japanese-import Blue Note reissue is the first high-quality one for this LP (avoid the earlier Liberty-label cheapo knockoff reissue at all costs!) - with impeccable stereo sound, all the original artwork, plus the original liner notes by the renowned musician and jazz writer Leonard Feather.Granted, this is not for jazz purists who view with utter contempt anything associated with sixties pop songs.  In my opinion, just a couple of the song choices are not the best, and the strings should have been limited to the ballads only.  However, if you just want to hear some delightfully melodic '60s music played unpretentiously and enthusiastically by an all-time great who delivers the goods with his trademark soulful tone and effortlessly attractive phrasing, this is a worthwhile CD to have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBECN4YYDHWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GN5IVVG#wasThisHelpful","R3NBECN4YYDHWE","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While not really ""oddball,"" ""Road to Nowhere"" by the obscure (there's that word again!) folk-rock-y harmony group The Hearts & Flowers from 1967 (it would almost have to be from '67 with a name like that!) contains desolate lyrics which (at least subconsciously) may have presaged the impending dissolution of the Goffin-King marriage and professional collaboration.For the newly discovered (by me, anyway) gem of gems here, of which I knew neither the singer nor the song, I would have to go with Henry Alston and his soaring and heart-rending vocal on the Drifters-esque ""So Many Lonely People"" (1964), featuring some of Gerry Goffin's most poignant and empathic lyrics.  Ace Records compiler Mick Patrick's informative liner notes, which provide a thumbnail of all the songs and artists, tell us that Alston had been in a mid-'50s R&B vocal group and was essaying a comeback as a solo act.  Unfortunately this fine record, produced by Goffin and arranged by Carole, went nowhere and Alston was never heard from again.  But a big thank-you to Ace is in order for enabling us to hear this 51 years later.I could go on about the attractive 16-page accompanying booklet with all the photos and realia (in addition to Mick Patrick's liners), but this is a given with any Ace collection.  For those who must know, ten of the 26 tracks are in stereo.  I think the title song/CD opener ""Hung On You"" by the Righteous Brothers was defectively mixed by Phil Spector (rather muddled -- but note, nothing to do with Ace's highly professional remastering process), which might explain why it got flipped by radio stations all over the country and the B-side oldie ""Unchained Melody"" (sung by Bobby Hatfield) became the much bigger hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V96GK9J10QHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2WUEI6#wasThisHelpful","R3V96GK9J10QHE","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This third and final Gene Chandler LP on Brunswick from 1969 (preceding ""Groovy Situation"" and his subsequent stint at Mercury), like its two predecessors, laid a commercial egg, failing to chart at all; and the pair of high-quality singles it produced also missed the national charts, both R&B and pop.  At that point Chandler was thought of as a singles artist - and pre-""Groovy Situation"" was still somewhat in the shadow of his Vee Jay days and his gigantic crossover pop and R&B smash ""Duke of Earl"" [#1 on both charts for multiple weeks] from seven years earlier.The ""two sides"" referred to in the title are not exactly in balance.  Chandler delivers a trio of original soul ballads (that's one side), while his cover versions of mostly recent records (the other side) number seven.  Three of these latter seven are direct lifts from the 1968 Ray Charles songbook, using close to the same arrangements and emulating Ray's vocal style: the upbeat, semi-funky take on ""Eleanor Rigby"" and two ballads from the LP ""A Portrait of Ray"" - the recent French hit by Nicoletta (""The Sun Died"" / Il est mort le soleil) and the 1933 Jerome Kern-Otto Harbach show tune ""Yesterdays"" (also recorded by Sinatra).  The other covers include his credible closing take on Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter Earth""; Bobby Goldsboro's maudlin #1 pop song ""Honey"" (Ouch! Hard to turn this one into soul); the cool opener, Tyrone Davis's ""Can I Change My Mind"" (essentially a twin version); and an excellent reading of Herb Alpert's #1 pop version of Burt Bacharach-Hal David's ""This Guy's in Love with You"" (which Gene sings much better than Herb).It's the three original soul ballads that really stand out, though.  Producers Eugene Record (of Chi-Lites fame) and Carl Davis contributed the majestic, pleading ""If You Would Love Me,"" while Chandler co-wrote ""Familiar Footsteps"" (which has a warm doo-woppy melody and vocal to match, reminding us a bit of his ""Duke of Earl"" glory) and the shatteringly dramatic, exquisitely orchestrated ""Suicide.""  ""Footsteps"" sounds like a shoulda-been hit, but it was out of step with the late '60s; and while the death song ""Honey"" was huge in '68, ""Suicide"" was just too much for a single, despite being a superb record.This Japanese-import series of Brunswick LP reissues on CD features top-of-the-line sound mastering and sumptuous stereo.  This is a well-produced, very well-performed album, with the only problem (besides the inclusion of ""Honey"") being that the remakes don't really bring anything new to the table other than a better lead vocal on ""This Guy's in Love with You.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19N942R1WHNOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHY2MGQ#wasThisHelpful","R19N942R1WHNOY","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time that the twelve singles by the great Southern soul ballad pioneer Johnny Adams recorded for the Ric and Ron labels (same company) have been assembled on one disc with both the A and B sides and all from the original masters.  Add a couple of demo takes unearthed in 2013, and you have the 26 tracks that comprise this superb hour-long CD compiled by Tony Rounce who also wrote seven pages of informative liner notes contained within the colorful 12-page accompanying booklet.  And then there is the usual stellar sound-mastering work that Ace provides.Johnny Adams was a New Orleans gospel singer who by happenstance at the age of 27 in 1959 suddenly found himself embarking on a secular ""soul"" music (before it had that generic designation) career with a string of big local and Gulf Coast hits on the Ric label.  Only one of these broke through to the national R&B charts in 1962, that being ""A Losing Battle,"" a mature Ray Charles-esque ballad co-written by a certain young Malcolm Rebennack (who had been working with him since '59), which climbed to #27.  Malcolm ""Mac"" Rebennack later became known as Dr. John.  Later in the '60s for SSS International, Adams, more in the guise of a country-soul crooner (foreshadowed by his 1964 recording of Hank Williams' ""Cold, Cold Heart,"" found here), had his only major national crossover [soul Top Ten and pop Top 30] hit with ""Reconsider Me.""  From 1984 until 1998 (the year of his death) he had a distinguished run of nine albums for Rounder Records in a mixed soul and blues mode, peaking with the stone masterpiece ""Room with a View of the Blues"" in 1987.From his first secular ballad and original signature song ""I Won't Cry,"" and including his entire 1959-64 run at Ric/Ron, it is abundantly clear that this is one of the finest vocalists of all time, Southern soul or otherwise.  Normally a smoky baritone, he could seamlessly shift into smooth mid-range tenor; and then, as intense emotion warranted, he would go into a bone-chilling high tenor, or even a blood-curdling falsetto soul wail when the feeling so moved him.  His astounding vocal range was used judiciously and never exploited as a gimmick, as Adams remained ever committed to the integrity of each song he sang.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E81YY8Y4H9FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S2VIJD4#wasThisHelpful","R3E81YY8Y4H9FM","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the once great and soulful Ramsey Lewis lost in bland, mediocre and outdated electro-pop-disco-funk land playing mostly disposable musical fare.  The first album (""Routes"") has him drowning in synths, while the second (""Three Piece Suite"") is awash in overprominent electric bass and percussion (and in a few cases, pointless dubbed-in strings).His shining (Ramsey-of-old) moment is the tender, reflective ballad ""Looking Glass"" from ""Routes"" - and wouldn't you know it, this is the only song where he was involved in the writing...and it's a Steinway Concert Grand solo performance.  One can only wonder what it is doing here; or else, why couldn't he have committed himself to a whole album of such worthwhile creative artistry?  (Obviously, we know the answer was a cash-grab attempt by his Columbia-label overlords.)""Routes"" also has the slight advantage of New Orleans legend Allen Toussaint producing and composing four tracks: ""Crystals 'N' Sequence"" is a short-but-sweet pop-soul effort, while unfortunately the melodically gorgeous ""You Are the Reason,"" which could have been prime Ramsey, is instead sabotaged by an annoyingly repetitive, way-too-prominent electric bass line.  (The other two Toussaint productions are of the generally forgettable funk sort that do nothing to enhance his legacy.)From the second LP's title ""Three Piece Suite"" and the cover photo of Ramsey in a black tux, you would expect a classic-jazz result, but what you actually get are songs so forgettable that you'll be forgetting them while still listening to them.  It's Ramsey just going through the motions, half-heartedly, and succumbing to the whole overproduced mess.These two 1980/1981 LPs were pathetic attempts to milk the last ounces of commercial profit out of the pop-funk and disco crazes which had exceeded their 1978-79 expiration dates.  ""Routes"" and ""Three Piece Suite"" limped into the '80s with precious little actual jazz content.  What a waste of talent!  Ramsey Lewis did do some fine work during his Columbia years, but at least a few of his LPs were treated as not much more than mere commercial product, and the artistic bar was appreciably lowered.  Clearly, that is what happened here, and only one outstanding track got through: the solo ""Looking Glass""; plus the very good Allen-Toussaint-penned pop-soul (not jazz) instrumental ""Crystals 'N' Sequence,"" both from ""Routes.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20W83453Q6V6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FG1F65W#wasThisHelpful","R20W83453Q6V6R","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Actually, the 2014 Grammys got two right, both in American roots album categories, a million miles removed from all the commercial junk that dominates the proceedings.  Rosanne Cash richly deserved her recognition for ""The River and the Thread"" for Best Americana Album.  (""Americana"" is country that is not instantly disposable, which is why Sturgill Simpson also wound up in that category); and this present album, Jo-El Sonnier's brilliant labor of love, ""The Legacy,"" which took top prize for Regional Roots Music Album.Specifically, the region (in ""Regional"") is South Louisiana's Acadiana, the heart of French-American Acadian (Cajun) culture (a.k.a. ""bayou country"").  The music is traditional French Cajun, so the accordion (of which Sonnier is a master) and fiddles are prominent, but the sound in this modern era is also filled out by other compatible country instruments, including pedal steel guitar; and the singing is in the region's traditional native language, which is French.  In reality, it's a colorful, tasty (like crawfish and gumbo) independent dialect of French going back hundreds of years.  In the modern-communications era, a bit more of the surrounding American Southern influence has crept in (case in point: Trk 9, titled ""J'ai Gone Fou"" for ""I'm Goin' Crazy""), yet despite much vocabulary borrowing, its grammar and usage remain remarkably intact.  The central question is whether or not the French language at the root of Acadian culture can survive.Jo-El Sonnier's ""The Legacy"" is certainly a mighty contribution to this effort to preserve tradition and language.  Twelve of the thirteen  (one is an instrumental) have entirely Cajun French lyrics (translations available at his website).  In his hands the accordion may be the most emotive instrument on the planet, capable of turning on a dime from joyful to mournful and then back again (since the Cajun spirit is optimistic - which it has always had to be in order to be able to survive through incredibly adverse circumstances).  Cajun music has never been accused of holding back its emotions.Sonnier can also be heard on harmonica; co-producer Shane Theriot plays acoustic and electric guitars and percussion; Kevin Hare is on bass guitar (and he is also responsible for the superb sound engineering on the record); Beau Thomas and the matchless Michael Doucet handle the fiddles; Joe Rogers and Laine Thibodeaux provide steel guitar [it's hard to go anywhere in Cajun country without encountering a Thibodeaux or a Theriot!]; Doug Belote and Brian Brignac are on drums.  Called ""The Legacy Musicians"" on this project, they put up quite the Cajun wall of sound!Jo-El Sonnier was a country-chart hitmaker from 1975 to 1990, with 1988 being his peak commercial year: two Top Ten singles, 55 weeks on the Billboard country chart (he had overlapping hits), and the Top 20 LP ""Come On Joe.""  When commercial country became largely a southern pop-rock hybrid, Sonnier returned exclusively to his Cajun roots; and his talent and integrity have been recognized with multiple Grammy nominations.  This breakthrough winner ""The Legacy"" (which he states ""has been a lifetime in the making"") represents yet another artistic game-raiser for him.  It is absolutely sparkling, intensely immediate and affecting - and is 100% organic and authentic (and made in Cajun country!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118AFRFWYPY1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNAXQ70#wasThisHelpful","R118AFRFWYPY1Q","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album amply demonstrates the degree of diversity that is possible in the blues-rock hybrid genre.  And it certainly doesn't hurt that it features two lead vocalists: guitar wizard/leader Nick Moss who is more of a gruff-voiced rockin' blues guy, and rhythm guitarist Michael Ledbetter who is a convincing and compelling soul singer.  They also combine for the bulk of the songwriting duties - in fact, all but a pair of exceptional covers: a haunting rendition of Son House's ""Death Letter Blues"" (lead vocal by Moss) and a tough-as-nails take on Faces' ""Bad 'N' Ruin"" (from 1971), with Ledbetter assuming the original Rod Stewart lead.There are a generous 14 tracks here and a running time of 77 minutes.  Of the dozen originals we have what I would deem a Nick Moss Band seven-minute magnum opus, nearly a Derek & the Dominos ""Layla"" moment, if you will, in the Ledbetter (lyrics)/Moss (music) co-write ""Fare Thee Well"" (sung by Ledbetter, with superb background vocals by Tina J. Crawley and Lara Jenkins), propelled as much by Bryan Rogers' piano and Patrick Seals' drumming as by Moss's stellar guitar.  But ultimately it's the perfect construction of the song mated with Michael Ledbetter's searing and soulful, spot-on delivery of  his moving words (about trying to hold on to love against the odds), which match the equally soulful melody to  a T, that make this a magnificent track.While ""Fare Thee Well"" is a cut above, there are no slouches here.  ""I Want the World to Know"" has Ledbetter testifying soulfully, and he's again in his tougher ""Bad 'N' Ruin"" mode on ""Tell You Somethin' 'Bout Yourself.""  The intriguing ""Walking on a Ledge"" balances on the edge of rock and soul, while Moss nails the heavy blues-rocker ""No Reason"" and the easy, breezy, Southern-soul-sounding ""EZ Bree Zee.""  There's even a delicious closing jazz-funk instrumental (with Bryan Rogers on organ this time) called ""(Big Mike's) Potato Pie,"" on which Moss executes his fieriest extended guitar solo as he takes us home.There's more, but I'm risking carpal tunnel syndrome as it is.

"Great-sounding Japanese import CD of a 1970 Brunswick soul-jazz instrumental LP (recorded in 1967) by the high-energy organ/tenor sax-led combo the Wildare Express, featuring organist Reuben Wilson before he was signed as a leader by Blue Note.Seven of the ten tracks are covers of pop and/or soul hits from 1963 to 1967 (in fact, five are from that latter year and thus were extremely fresh when this LP was recorded).  The three originals are all very cool (and since it was 1967, I'll say it, ""groovy"") jams of the jazzy R&B or blues sort, with ""Cruising"" being particularly tight (it appears to have been issued as a promo single).  The others, having been recent hits, resonate particularly well for fans of this era's music due to the strong recognition factor, while also offering the fascination of how deftly they were able to be transformed into sparkling soul jazz by young, enthusiastic, and undoubtedly expert musicians.  As it turned out, these songs could not have been better chosen; and the proof is that they all have endured over the intervening 47 years.  One might initially wonder how the Bob Crewe Generation's ""Music to Watch Girls By"" could possibly be transformed into soulful jazz.  The answer is quite groovily, thank you very much.  (This one has to be grabbed for the next ""Austin Powers"" movie!)  It is one of the highlights here.  The Express's ""Walk On By"" (the Burt-Bacharach-Hal David song made famous by Dionne Warwick in 1964 - and the CD's title song) is given an ultra-appealing midtempo Latin-beat treatment.  And speaking of ""treatment,"" the Sweet Inspirations' ""Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?"" is a funky sizzler that I believe surpasses in sheer gusto the Cannonball Adderley hit instrumental cover from that same year ('67).  Two rather serious songs, Percy Mayfield's ""A River's Invitation"" and Lou Rawls's recent ""Dead End Street"" get lively, swinging, carefree workouts.  (""Dead End Street"" was officially issued as a single in '67 b/w ""Why Am I Treated So Bad"" [Brunswick 55343].)  ""Alfie"" is the second Bacharach-David number here, and the Wildares make it this set's most dramatic ballad -- in fact, it is the only song taken at a slow pace.  Stunningly lyrical sax.  And here is something you don't encounter too often in a jazz context: a Motown girl-group song.  In this case it's Martha & the Vandellas' ""Jimmy Mack.""  The sax traces the melody line quite literally, but when Wilson's Hammond B3 comes in, a minute of hip, funky jamming ensues until it closes with a brief recap of that same familiar bouncy and joyful melody.If one could acquire this item in an actual record store, I would recommend you walk on in and buy ""Walk On By, "" the one and only LP by the fabulous Wildare Express.  Express yourself the Wildare way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDOAPZEVQHWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHY2M0C#wasThisHelpful","R1FDOAPZEVQHWN","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Love has to be one of the most obscure artists in a popular music genre (i.e., soul) to have ever received the full-disc anthology treatment.  She only managed to dent the Billboard R&B/soul Top 50 twice (in 1966 and in 1968) and placed no higher than #46.  This is no reflection, however, on the quality of her work during this period, since that #46 record, ""The Hurt Is Just Beginning,"" written by Mary Love herself, is an absolute beauty of a compelling, mature, smooth and exquisitely melodic soul ballad, which based on merit should have received major airplay on all the soul and Top 40 radio stations.  It was one of the great records of a great year (1968) for soul music -- and to think I only heard it here for the first time 46+ years later!  (It was easily better than 80% of the Top 25 Hot 100 songs of the moment, which included ""Little Arrows"" by Leapy Lee; ""Bang-Shang-a-Lang"" by the Archies; ""Chewy Chewy"" by Ohio Express; ""Cinnamon"" by Derek; ""Quick Joey Small"" by the Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestra; and I'll toss in Bobby Vinton's ""I Love How You Love Me.""  I'm making myself sick!)  I will go so far as to say that there was no better singer-songwriter record in the entire Hot 100 during the weeks of November 30 and December 7, 1968 (the two-week period when it was riding the bottom of the soul chart).There are a solid half-dozen other soul gems here, including consecutive 1966 releases on the Modern label that feature her bluesier side, ""Move a Little Closer"" (her other national R&B chart placer) and ""Think It Over Baby""; the hard-charging title song of this CD (""Lay Your Burden Down""), which showcases her astonishing soul-wailing ability during the latter part of the record; the funky but emotive ""Born to Live with Heartache""; the yearning ballad ""There Is Someone for Me"" (the latter two shared the same 1971 45); and ""Loving You"" (from a 1977 blaxploitation film soundtrack, no less), a deeply-felt, dramatic ballad with a Millie Jackson-like country-soul vibe.  These last three songs were penned by the singer.So far so good, but I cannot endorse the final fifteen minutes comprising her later religious recordings.  Besides being utterly inorganic, low-rent productions, they are full of simple-minded, repetitious, proselytizing propaganda I never want to hear again.This being a Kent Soul/Ace Records release, the 1960s/1970s music sounds as fine as anyone could reasonably expect.  (Six tracks are mono, nineteen are stereo, and the 1965-67 Modern label material was meticulously re-mastered.)  The 20-page accompanying booklet is among the most colorful, photo-and-realia-packed of its kind you'll ever see (near the top end, even for Ace), with detailed liner notes that recount the artist's life story (not an easy one; Mary Love passed away in 2013 at the age of 66) by the disc's compiler Ady Croasdell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CN8GFM7XQ6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS95ILM#wasThisHelpful","R8CN8GFM7XQ6F","A2WEH6H5AGO94E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WEH6H5AGO94E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Conductor Anatole Fistoulari was something of a ballet specialist, and over the years I have managed to pick up several of his titles, all enjoyable, on a variety of labels -- Gayne Ballet Suite, Adam - Giselle  (complete ballet) ~ Offenbach - Gat Parisienne ~ Strauss Graduation Ball / Fistoulari, Dorati and Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake [Highlights].  A few years ago the Australian arm of Decca reissued this two-fer in their Eloquence line, and I knew from the moment I saw it on Amazon that it was going to be worth owning.  I suppose the best part of this collection is the variety.  Unlike the aforementioned titles that focus on the work of a single composer, here we get selections from numerous composers -- Verdi, Mussorgsky, Saint-Saens, Rossini, Weber, Walton and more.  As the liner notes relate, ""The music on this pair of CDs falls in to one of two categories: ballet music from an opera, or ballet music that was not originally intended for dancing at all, but that was subsequently adapted for that purpose.""  (The exception is Minkus' ""Don Quixote"".)  Three recordings are in mono from the mid 1950s (J. Strauss II, Weber & Minkus), but the rest of the titles are in stereo from the early 1970s.  Interestingly enough, the highlights here for me are the four ""dance"" numbers -- Verdi's ""Moorish Slaves,"" Mussorgsky's ""Persian Slaves,"" Weber's ""Invitation"" and Rossini's ""Soldier's Dance"" from William Tell (not knowing the opera, a nice companion to that famous Overture). Overall, Fistoulari's feel for ballet music is impressive but I am also consistently impressed by the quality of performances that Eloquence Australia continues to unearth from the vaults.  ""World of Ballet"" is a welcome addition to both the conductor's and label's catalog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWSFDG91N71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B3PEYE#wasThisHelpful","R3OWSFDG91N71","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years back, I spent a great deal of time (and money) tracking down OJC discs before they went out of print, and then critiquing them here on Amazon when no one had yet to offer their comments. While the ""Birdlanders"" volumes did not elude me as a purchase, somehow I forgot to review this title at the time -- well, let me remedy that. These 1954 recordings, originally issued as three Period label LPs then re-sequenced by date as two CDs, were the brain child of pianist Henri Renaud, a visiting French amateur who assembled these groups out of jazz musicians that frequented the club Birdland. As a result, we get a first rate jam sessions from some of the great NYC players of the time. Volume 2 is divided up into two groups -- a March 13th sextet session featuring Renaud, Al Cohn, Kai Winding, Tal Farlow, Oscar Pettiford and Max Roach, and a March 5th quartet date with Renaud, Cohn, Gene Ramey and Denzil Best. I didn't know much about Renaud before this so it is educational and enjoyable to hear his original compositions, ""Marcel the Furrier"" and ""Burt's Pad,"" along with solid renditions of standards like ""Stardust"" and ""You Stepped Out of a Dream."" This isn't essential material by any means, but a worthwhile collection for both the music and the window into the world of Birdland that it provides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ZM9SLVOU51S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SUFK#wasThisHelpful","R28ZM9SLVOU51S","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The other day I was having fun searching around on Amazon and came across this title from EMI's old ""Artist Profile"" series, and it got me reminiscing.  Years ago when I first got into classical music, these were the two-fers -- most of them found in a cut-out bin at Tower Records -- that got me focused on the great conductors and performers of the genre, instead of just the composers.  Granted the Cluytens set isn't as valuable all these later as it was for me then, but along with Andr Cluytens accompagnateur (as accompanist) (see my review), it sent me down a path of discovery for one of my favorite conductors.  While much of the music here appears on a plethora of different reissues, some of it still remains unavailable in any other form save this CD (to the best of my knowledge anyway) -- Pierne's Concertstuck for Harp and Orchestra and Berlioz's L'Enfance du Christ Overture for instance.  That is significant for serious collectors, and for novices, you get one of the best ever renditions of Beethoven's ""Pastoral"" Symphony plus a terrific Debussy ""Jeux"" and a whole lot more.  I would not recommend paying ridiculous collector prices for this dual disc, but more than 15 years since its initial release, there probably aren't a lot of discounted options remaining for truly interested parties.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R2YU8DG3K5TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000025ESD#wasThisHelpful","R3R2YU8DG3K5TU","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past couple of years, I have really enjoyed exploring the recordings of conductor Karl Munchinger.  You can imagine my delight then, when the newest batch of Australian Eloquence reissues featured five volumes of Romantic Overtures, one of which was dedicated to performances by Munchinger.  ""Volume 3"" is a two-disc set -- the first CD showcases works by Weber, Schumann, Schubert, Cherubini and Mendelssohn, while the second focuses mostly on Beethoven, but also concludes with two mid 50s mono tracks, Schumann's ""Manfred"" and Gluck's ""Alceste,"" both with L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. (The other selections are all in stereo with the Vienna Philharmonic.)  For the serious collectors out there, please be aware that the 1975 account of Schubert's ""Die Zauberharfe"" Overture is the very same one contained on Schubert: Rosamunde (see my review), but as that was the title that introduced me to Munchinger, I can't complain too much about duplication.  The real treat here for me are the Beethoven performances -- it is so refreshing to hear Munchinger's light and airy treatments of the ""Leonore"" and ""Egmont"" Overtures, and fascinating to compare the same orchestra on the same pieces under the baton of Karl Bohm or Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt.  One final nerdy note, usually the album art for these Eloquence reissues has nothing to do with the old LP jackets, but here they have used the same painting that graced the Decca original -- nice touch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F19U0399G6W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDSRFCO#wasThisHelpful","R2F19U0399G6W2","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the mid 1970s, Leonard Bernstein had some major personal life changes, the least of which was growing a beard and making a few recordings with the Orchestre National de France for EMI, including a rather eccentric account of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which I enjoy but others have absolutely crushed.  The great cellist Rostropovich didn't seem like the type to tolerate too much tom-foolery, so this rendition of Schumann's Cello Concerto doesn't present too many surprises, though the seemingly average pulse could also stem from the fact that it's a B+ Concerto to the A's that are the Dvorak & Elgar.  (As an aside, it really gets the little brother treatment when paired with the Rostropovich/Karajan ""Don Quixote"" on the Great Recordings of the Century reissue -- now that's a performance!)  On the other hand, this is one of the very best performances of Bloch's ""Schelomo,"" most likely why it comes first in the track listing even though it receives second billing on the jacket cover.  An altogether tougher nut to crack, once the listener gets passed the dissonance, it is one of the most expressive pieces in the repertoire.  It too has been reissued, paired with a Haydn Concerto in the most unlikely fashion, but at least available in a newer form than this title.  However, owning the aforementioned Strauss and Haydn on separate discs, was my reason for purchasing this long out of print, LP length, 1987 produced CD.  Though with prices currently skyrocketting for it used in the Marketplace, you may want to settle on the other editions to hear this fine music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JKW1SN5SQNK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DNJY#wasThisHelpful","R3JKW1SN5SQNK8","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My introduction to this music came via the old budget EMI Seraphim title Handel: Water Music Suites for Orchestra No 1-3/ Music for the Royal Fireworks, so it is only natural that I have an affinity for Yehudi Menuhin conducting these works.

I settled on the Double Forte editions as they were very inexpensive a decade ago on the old HMV Canada website, when the dollar was way up.  Many period instrument purists may object to these performances, but some of them are 45 years old and the stereo still sounds impeccably clean and crisp today.

"If you were on a jazz game show, and the question was name the pianist who recorded a trio album with Charles Mingus and Max Roach as his rhythm duo, you would most likely answer Duke Ellington (""Money Jungle"").  However, if for some crazy reason you said John Dennis, the host would probably have to check with the panel of judges to discover you were also correct!  To my knowledge, the only other album Dennis played on is ""The Fabulous Thad Jones"" so how he was able to get Mingus and Roach into RVG's studio in 1955 may seem like a small miracle.  But after just one listen to ""New Piano Expressions"" it is abundantly clear that this pianist more than holds his own in that elite company.  And as good as the five trio tracks are (plus three alternate takes), it is the four solo selections at the end of the disc which show Dennis' true genius -- an amazing ability to play with both hands a la Erroll Garner, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson or some classical master.  So after listening to this disc, the next question our jazz host could pose is ""Why did John Dennis not make it big?"" and unfortunately that answer doesn't come so easily.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28S8L3RRGRAGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000Z9H#wasThisHelpful","R28S8L3RRGRAGU","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Albert Ayler's ""Spiritual Unity"" and Pharoah Sanders' Pharoah's First (see my review) launched ESP Disk in 1964.  Eight years later when ""Revolutionary Ensemble"" was released, both the company and the free jazz movement were drifting into obscurity.  Despite this, I have always found this trio date to be one of the most exciting things ever produced by the label, or in the entire musical genre for that matter.  During the 47 minute epic ""Vietnam,"" violinist Leroy Jenkins, bassist/cellist Sirone and percussionist Jerome Cooper cover an incredible musical palette -- they are a warped classical chamber group, a rockin' Mahavishnu-like power trio, the ghost of a Paganini Caprice, wild avant-swingers, a horror movie soundtrack, fireworks and explosions, wounded animal noises, everything but the kitchen sink.  It is an amazing tour de force, and rather improbable that there aren't more contemporaneous recordings of this group (or that anyone had ever bothered to review this disc here).  Sometimes this style of music and its subject matter are a product of their period and environment, but when it's on, like it is here, it can transport you across space and time.

"Some jazz fans think Pharoah Sanders' Karma is the tenor saxophonist's best album and an unqualified jazz masterpiece.  I on the other hand, don't really care for all that chanting and singing, so my favorite Pharoah album is Tauhid.  Of course, before Sanders was snatched up by a major jazz label, along with other Coltrane disciples, to cut those aforementioned classic sides, he made this record for ESP -- 49 years ago yesterday in fact -- on September 10, 1964.  While ""First"" isn't as fully developed as his later Impulses, and Pharoah works better without a pianist in my opinion (though Jane Getz plays admirably), it also doesn't have all of the dated hippie trappings of his more ""mature"" efforts either.

"The title of this CD, ""After Hours,"" is misleading -- it makes you think it is a sultry, late night saxophone ballad compilation when it is simply the name of what is the longest and possibly best track on the disc. In fact, this is another in a series of two albums on one CD reissues of Willis ""Gator Tail"" Jackson's 1960s Prestige albums. While other collections have been a fun discovery (see my reviews of Please Mr Jackson, Legends of Acid Jazz, and Nuther'n Like Thuther'n), unfortunately this one is a bit of a mixed bag. The March 26, 1963 session that produced the original LP ""Loose..."" is solid and features some terrific up-tempo jams, along with the aforementioned, quieter CD title track, performed by trumpeter Frank Robinson, organist Carl Wilson, guitarist Bill Jones and drummer Joe Hadrick. It is the second part that disappoints -- the original LP ""Soul Grabber"" recorded over two days in October 1967. To me this just sounds like instrumental R&B, like Sam & Dave without the singing. The tunes have good beats but there is nothing original here, and the short, jukebox length of the songs leaves no room for improvisation.

"I purchased this CD because when checking my collection against the track listing of the new DG Karajan 1960s Box, I realized this was one of a handful of performances I did not already own.  So instead of plunking down hundreds on the set and trading in all of my old discs, I opted to order this CD for under a dollar plus shipping from a Marketplace vendor.  Rossini's String Sonatas were written during the composer's youth, so they are more ear-candy than the orchestral showpieces that are the Overtures.  With that in mind, one could argue that a chamber group may be more appropriate than the Berlin Philharmonic to showcase this music, but my feeling is why not hear one of the world's greatest orchestras, even if it is only their string section, when given the chance for any and all of the repertoire.  A respectable Rossini disc then, if not earth-shattering like Karajan's ""William Tell"" Overture -- see my review of Rossini and Suppe: Ouverturen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HX1OT2L7LJYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4H7#wasThisHelpful","R3HX1OT2L7LJYC","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe that five years after first discovering OJC CDs were being remaindered, and then after hundreds of purchases, there would still be a few titles for me to unearth during a trip to Boston two weeks ago. Sure enough, this Art Pepper title was one of five discs I found at the Newbury Street Newbury Comics, though in fairness I did have it on my Amazon Wish List for some time.  While I love classic jazz of the 50s & 60s and own more than 3000 albums from that era, I probably own only a few hundred jazz albums made after 1980.  Art Pepper is a perfect example of why -- I adore his recordings for Pacific and Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section, but for the longest time I didn't bother with anything past 1960's Smack Up and Intensity.  All that changed a few years ago when I found a used copy of Complete Village Vanguard for less than a buck a disc.  I simply couldn't pass up a bargain like that regardless of how good the music was, but upon listening to it I was not only blown away by Art's playing (and of course Elvin's drumming), but also by a pianist I had never heard of previously -- George Cables.  Pepper said that Cables was his favorite pianist, and considering Art recorded with the likes of Hampton Hawes, Russ Freeman, Carl Perkins and Wynton Kelly, that was some compliment.  It's easy to see why after listening to this disc, and its companion Tete-A-Tete, as the duo have a telepathic connection.  ""Goin' Home"" is also special in the Pepper discography because he plays clarinet on half of the eight tracks.  This would prove to be Art's last album as he died a month after its recording.  While many jazz fans, myself included, can be a bit snobbish and dismissive when it comes to jazz players whose careers span decades, being especially (and often unfairly) critical of the later years, Art Pepper was someone who had something to say musically from the beginning all the way up to the very end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKP6B89Z1S6WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000YW5#wasThisHelpful","RKP6B89Z1S6WY","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sure enough, this Willis Jackson title was one of five discs I found at the Newbury Street Newbury Comics, though in fairness I had seen it previously on Amazon, but thought it was only a compilation.  In actuality, ""Gentle Gator"" is much more than a mere comp.  I like to think of it as a companion of sorts to At Large -- the latter collecting the more upbeat numbers from original LPs ""Shuckin,"" ""In My Solitude,"" ""Neapolitan Nights,"" and ""Really Groovin,"" while ""Gentle,"" you guessed it, showcases the ballads from the same albums.  While I prefer the honkin' soulful Gator to the sultry soulful one, there are some real gems on ""Gentle,"" especially mid-tempo numbers like ""Girl of My Dreams,"" ""Careless Love,"" ""Amor"" and ""They Didn't Believe Me.""

"Tchaikovsky Ballet highlights discs are a dime a dozen, but I've enjoyed learning more about the tendencies and subtleties of a variety of conductors by listening to their performances of such well-known, popular fare.  One such CD is Sleeping Beauty (see my review) -- I hadn't even heard George Weldon prior to puchasing this, but I knew the Philharmonia, and I was impressed by how much the conductor extracted from this orchestra, compared to the likes of Kurtz, Sawallisch and even Karajan in similar material.  Unfortunately, there aren't many other Weldon discs around -- a great Grieg Piano Concerto with soloist Gina Bachauer (see my review on Music of Edvard Grieg) was all I could ever come up with, until I saw this CD advertised in the liner notes to another recent purchase, Symphonie Fantastique (again, see my review).  These IMG reissues don't have extravagant packaging compared to some historical labels, and it would be nice for them to print something (anything) about the recording specifics, but the sound quality is good enough considering they are late mono recordings.  Weldon's Elgar readings fall short of Boult or Barbirolli's, but they are impressive enough, with the Enigma Variations particularly insightful.  This release doesn't do complete justice in showcasing George Weldon's talents, but I suppose with only a handful of titles to choose from, beggars can't be too choosy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I61K4OMRQ1HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CP5O3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2I61K4OMRQ1HW","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leroy Vinnegar's Leroy Walks! is one of my all-time favorite OJC CDs -- see my review.  On the strength of that disc, I decided to take a chance on this trio album, ""Jazz's Great Walker,"" originally issued on the Vee Jay label, but rescued from the vaults by Collectables/Rhino.  Pianist Mike Melvoin, who also played with Vinnegar on Leroy Walks Again!! (again, see my review), didn't impress me then, but steals the show here as he is MUCH better.  Don't worry though, Leroy's walkin' bass still features prominently.  The sound on this 1964 recording is terrific, but the material is mostly standards and none too adventurous.  In all, walk but don't run to get ""Jazz's Great Walker.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38477LA04DJX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005Y7XV#wasThisHelpful","R38477LA04DJX2","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not being a huge fan of opera, I bought this CD for a version of the amazing, but rarely recorded (compared to other Wagner orchestral music) Das Rheingold Prelude.  I first heard this music in the movie ""The New World"" and was captivated by its mesmerizing, interweaving strings, brass and winds.  It was unlike anything I had ever heard from the composer, and light years ahead of its time with its 20th Century sound.  I'm sure seeing Karl Bohm perform the Ring Cycle at Bayreuth was an equally thrilling experience, but I cannot get passed all the coughing and distracting noises littered throughout this two-fer of highlights.  I bought the Solti highlights disc instead, and that studio account is just so much better at allowing me to completely immerse myself in that very special Prelude, and the other brilliant selections as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9EI07LEQRM44/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041EJ#wasThisHelpful","R9EI07LEQRM44","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't collect a lot of chamber music, but I will buy pretty much anything that the folks at Australian Decca see fit to reissue in their Eloquence line, especially when I can find one used for just pennies in the Marketplace.  I have other versions of the Brahms and Mozart Clarinet Quintets (the Philips Duo two-fers are terrific), and these mid 50s recordings by members of the Vienna Octet are equally impressive accounts, despite the mono sound.  The brief Baermann Adagio, formerly attributed to Wagner, was a new piece for me, but it fits nicely between the more recognized works.  This disc is one in a series of ten Wiener Oktett releases in the Legacy series, and I might have to keep an eye out for some of the others, now that I've heard and enjoyed this one so much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MT8QNTTK3RQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043WBZPU#wasThisHelpful","R2MT8QNTTK3RQ0","AQ9T9A5WJXVA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ9T9A5WJXVA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sharon Delarose's firsthand account of her experiences is an interesting work. Her words are compelling and thought-provoking:""I do not possess a single ""waking memory"" of an alien abduction. What I remember are incredibly vivid UFO dreams and the terror that those ""dreams"" left me with. While I refer to them as dreams, it may be more appropriate to call them screen memories of repeated UFO abductions, which is what I now believe them to be.""Screen memories are false memories that overwrite actual events which, if remembered, would be highly traumatic. Some UFO researchers refer to screen memories as 'merciful amnesia.'""Screen memories make it possible to have a lifetime of alien abduction experiences and not be aware that you were ever abducted. All you are left with is a jumble of bizarre memories, vivid dreams, and seemingly irrational fears. You may remember seeing or dreaming about bright lights, UFOs, monsters, floating in the air, or being paralyzed. My dreams took me far beyond that into another world which was sometimes beautiful and other times terrifying.""Ms. Delarose is a brave person. Her book Alien Nightmares: Screen Memories of UFO Alien Abductions is living proof of her courage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDTZY5D8WROF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KPH5QO#wasThisHelpful","R3FDTZY5D8WROF","A9ND166CX91HI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9ND166CX91HI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This large Utility tray works great for my daughter and her tiny toys for easy clean up. I know its not what it was intended for but it is what we got it for! It would work even better if it was flat on the bottom and not bumpy but it was intended for boots. Its large enough so that she can set up a whole play area of farm animals or even tons of legos. My husband cut out a thin piece of wood to put in the bottom so that it would be flat, yet it still made for easy clean up for her. She would just pick up the tray and dump the toys back in the bin.

"The hubby and I had wanted to try a little  bondage when I suggested we try  the Meili Fetish Under the Bed restraint system he wasn't sure what to think. I had a couple of friends who had used something similar to  this item and they swore by it. We had tried some Japanese love cuffs before, and felt that we were ready to move up to something that could restrain both my legs and my hands. When it arrived, the first thing that we noticed was how easy it was to install on our bed. Our bed doesn't have a nice headboard to attach cuffs to, so this set was perfect. All you have to do is place the straps under your mattress and box spring and adjust the arm and leg straps to the desired length and attach the cuffs. From there, it was ready to use! The cuffs are of a soft fluffy material and don't leave any marks on your wrists or ankles no matter how much you struggle to get away.  I love this set because it gives me a feeling of helplessness without hurting me. The hubby loves it because it allows him to watch me squirm and struggle while he teases to his heart's content.

My only issue was I put the bottom battery in wrong and It was hard getting it back out to put it in correctly. oppsie.. But it was my fault for not paying attention to how to put them in. over all its a great mouse for the price.

"My husband has tried many per-workouts over the past few years and since his favorite has been taken off the market he has not found one that has even came close to it. He is still looking for one. This one did give him energy and extra motivation that he needed to work out without that crash at the end like some supplements do.  He does not get the jittery feeling like he has from others and he likes that to a point. He does the energy he gets from the caffeine that's in it. He really likes the taste of the cotton candy flavor and he was pleased that there was not that bad gritty feeling in his mouth while he was drinking it. All in all he said it was not a bad pre-workout and he will use it again. Full Disclosure: I received a sample of this item at a discount in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing purposes.

"This case fits my daughters iPad mini perfect and I love how slim it is. It seems protect her Ipad really well. Now I dont have to worry about the back getting more scratched up (it already has two thats why I am so happy to now have this case) and I can keep my Ipad looking new. I think that the price on this case is really good for how great the case looks, and all the cute styles that it comes in. I would like to get one more just to be able to switch it out once in a while. The shipping was super fast. My daughter was so excited that it came so quickly. I would definitely buy another one.

"I absolutely love the set of Marshmallow Roasting Sticks. they are strong and durable, the wooden handle will not allow your hand to get burnt. They come in four colors which  is a plus in not having the kids fight over who stole who's stick when roasting marshmallows! I  also really enjoyed the fact that that the prongs for roasting are long enough for that extra hungry person to roast more than one hot dog at a time and everyone can sit down together and eat at once. They are steel forks so there is no worry of them catching on fire like they would if you were using a wooden stick. They are made from good quality materials and look like they will last a long time. These come with a carrying bag and a silicon basting brush as a bonus! These will be great for camping in the backyard to camping in the middle of the woods. I received a sample of this item at a discount in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing purposes.

"This is a great Hard case organizer for just about anything that will fit inside. The best part is the inserts are removable so you can make the spots bigger if you need to. I am using this for my jewelry and the beads and trinkets fit perfectly. The lids fits down tightly so I do not have to worry about them falling out or the lid popping off. The snaps on the lid are nice and secure as well. The curved bottom makes it easy to just slide the bead up the side and grab it with out it getting stuck in the corners.

"These iPad mini cases are great for kids. This is the second case I have purchased and that is only because the first one has got dirty and old looking. There are times my daughter will accidentally do so many things with her devices, and every time I cringe thinking that it will be the time it breaks, but this case makes any device truly kid proof. Its great, I havent had a crack yet and it comes in so many colors that kids love. The texture is also kid friendly and the handle makes it nice and easy for kids to carry around.

"I love these reusable food pouches for many reasons. Well I make my own baby food in the processor and what I love about these is that I now have the option to take my homemade baby food on the go, then I can pour it into a bowl when I get where I am going. Its super easy to fill them, pack them, and super easy to clean them. The main reason I love these pouches is because I have a five year old who never seems to say she is hungry until she is in the car and we are on the go but oh my is she prone to accidents and messes. This pouch is big enough that I can put a snack for her such as applesauce, jello or a smoothie in it and it will be enough to fill her snacking needs. The great thing is she has the neat little pouch so no mess!!! I like that I can fill many at a time and put them in the fridge so they are fast to grab on the go and toss in my purse and they dont leak.

"This Lemon Oil is about the 6th different oil I have purchased from Radha and I love it! First thing is first with any essential oil I get.. a few drops went right in the diffuser! and it smells wonderful! I use lemon for all kinds of things.. I use it to kill germs on the counters or my hands.. I use it to make a bug spray because bug hate citrus. we also use it if anyone has a cough.. we just take a little and rub it on our chest and you get an instant relief. Lemon is really a great Oil to have in the home for many reason. I only named a few. This is a very good quality and everything I have used it for so far it seems to work great.

This product is so easy to use, all I did was wash my car and then once it was dry I sprayed the wax on and wiped it around with the microfiber cloth.

"The Naturo Fitness Sports Foam roller feels great while helping work out the deep knots and kinks in your back. It does not have raised bumps or points so its not digging into your back like some of the other rollers on the market. In fact this is a perfect roller for someone who is just starting to use a foam roller. This foam Roller has multiple purposes in my house. For instance, I will use it to warm up my muscles before I start my Yoga and my husband will use it after he works out to massage his sore muscles. The foam rollers are highly recommended by therapists because it really helps your muscles recover faster.

" 2:40 Mins This two toned Leather Executive Padfolio is excellent for just about any need you may have. I personally use it for homeschooling and scheduling for my two daughters. This padfolio is made with high quality materials and excellent craftsmanship so I know its going to last me for a long time. The stitching is great and will hold well along with the heavy duty zipper.  It comes with a build in solar calculator so there is no need to worry about changing or buying new batteries. A spot for your ID and many credit cards or business cards if you would like. I personally have switched my wallet/purse over to this and just carry this around now. It has became much more convenient for me and my family to not have to lug around a big ole purse. I still have room for my cards and ID, a pen, calculator and I can not even take a full size note pad along with me for all my notes. I am an avid couponer so that works great for taking notes and keeping track of what I have spent. I highly recommend this to anyone who usually carries a purse or who just needs a new parfolio.

We have a bird book so we can look up the different kind of birds as they visit us. Its really simple and easy to install and refill. I havent had any squirrel problems yet.

"This is a great double camping hammock to carry along with you for any reason! Camping, fishing or just to set it up in your back yard. Its a thin light weight hammock made from a very strong nylon. Just because its thin it does not mean its cheap, it does not have a problem holding you up. I was in it with both my children with no problems. It says it will hold up to 400 lbs. There is a bag that is attached to the side of the hammock that you can stick your phone or anything else in to keep it up off the ground while you are there relaxing enjoying the beautiful outdoors. It comes with everything you need to set it up besides the trees to strap it to. It comes with the 9 foot straps to wrap around the trees and the clips to attach it with. This is definitely a great investment and well worth it. It comes folded up in a bag and store it back in the bag once you are done using it.

"This Black Box X1S GPS Dash Cam is something really useful to have. If you get into a car accident or are involved in any other incident, it may be hard to recall the details of how exactly everything happened. This makes it easy, the camera catches everything. Never be the victim of a hit and run again, now you can always catch the license plate number of the person as they drive away. This dash cam comes with the mount and the charger. You will NOT need to purchase your own SD card because it comes with a 16GB card. The mount was easy to put on and it says it is heat resistant so when the windshield heats up on those hot summer days, the mount will not fall. The instructions were included in the box and dash cam is easy to set up and use. The instructions are clearly written so that a child would be able to figure out how to use it. The extra night vision feature is great for nighttime driving and the headlights of your car will also add to the visibility of the picture. If the camera gets full, it will automatically delete the oldest file so you dont have to worry about emptying the SD card everyday. You can set the loop feature to rewrite the data every so many minutes or not at all. However when you have a video that you want to save, it is easy to take the SD card out and retrieve the file on the computer. The screen on this dash cam is larger than most cameras. It is easy to see. The picture quality is very good and clear but you can change the resolution depending on how much space you want the files to take up on the SD card. Another feature I like about this camera is that it has a built in sensor that will detect that you have been in an accident and it will automatically record and save the file. This file will not be deleted if the memory card should become full. I really like this product and I do think it is necessary for anyone who lives in the city or anywhere that traffic accidents are very common. I love the piece of mind that comes with having a dash cam, no worries about hit and runs and people will be less likely to rob you at a red light if they see that you have a camera on your dash.

"These Jumbo space saver bags work great. The plastic bags themselves were very good quality, better then I expected. I got these the other day and Immedietly used them with some extra kids blanket I had that were not in use. So I stuck a few in the bag and used the PROVIDED pump to get all the air out. Once the air was out I stuck them in the towel closet and left them alone. I checked today to make sure the bags are still sealed and they are holding great. It's amazing how small these bags shrink down to creating loads of space in my towel closet. They are still holding strong. The best thing about these is that if you use them for travel  you can take along the pump and they when you go to come home you do not need to use your vacuum, you will already have the pump with you.

"This stroller isn't for everyone - there are a few downsides that I'll get in to in a bit. But for someone looking for a well-built travel stroller that is very light and very comfortable, this is the one to get.The most important feature of this stroller is the weight, and it really does make a difference. We initially purchased a different Maclaren stroller that was listed at about 11lbs, and the difference was dramatic - what seemed like a small difference in weight turned out to be a huge difference on a daily basis - not only was it notably heavier it was also bulkier. The Mark II in contrast is both light and compact. The folding mechanism also means it's compact when standing or thrown over a shoulder, so it's great for getting around in tight spaces like a subway, elevator or airport.When unfolded, the unit has a very small footprint, making bit easy to maneuver in stores. The wheels have independant suspension which makes a difference on rough pavement, though it would not be the greatest stroller for dirt or gravel trails. The frame is incredibly well built with a hexagonal tubing, which is very rigid. The handles are surprisingly tall. Which makes for a much better position for the person pushing the stroller - no bent back syndrome for parents. Both me and my wife found this to be true, and she is 5'6"" and I'm 6'0"", and I imagine it'd be true for taller people as well. The small footprint does mean that for people with long strides, it's necessary to take a little care not to step on the back wheels, but that's something you get used to pretty quick. The folding mechanism works very well for a one-handed fold and unfold (with a little practice) and the locking mechanism is easy with one click of the pedal (though for some reason you have to push both of the unit is folded). While it doesn't stand freely like some other mfrs, it does lean nicely out of the way against a wall.The material of the unit is a lighter fabric, perhaps best suited for summer though with the addition of a universal padded seat or one of those zip-up blankets it works well in winter too. The seat doesn't recline but the angle isn't so steep that a toddler can't fall asleep a it might not be the most comfortable for a long nap, but at least for my toddler that doesn't seem to matter much. The seat back is very high, as is the canopy. This means that it will fit a pretty tall toddler, giving you years of service, but at the same time it means that the canopy doesn't provide as much side coverage for smaller kids. There is a caopy extension built in, but again for smaller kids it's not going to do very much. My biggest problem with the design is actually something very small - the buckle is a really strange design that requires holding the two upper part of the buckle together while clipping it in to the lower receiver. It's frustratingly awkward, especially with a squirming kid.The downsides are pretty well described above, but to summarize; there is no recline, it is a lightweight (but durable) fabric best suited to summer, and the canopy is too tall. The seat is somewhat short and unpadded. The buckle is poorly designed. It's not going to fill every need, and we still keep a ""Sunday stroller"" around for longer walks and trips. But overall as a short-trip stroller this is a very good one - easy to throw over the shoulder and whip out when needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVXVDCRPEUCBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00904I1DA#wasThisHelpful","RVXVDCRPEUCBC","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's only been a couple of days, but already I'm loving this vacuum sealer, and can't imagine living without it. Orignally I bought this for the sous vide cooking I planned to do, for which it's great; the bags are large enough to fit at least a three or four pound roast in, and are thick and durable so they are reusable - which is good for the environment as well as the pocket book. The lot comes with a dozen gallon and a dozen quart, all of which are even a little larger than something like a ziplock of similar capacity. The bags are cook and freezer safe, and BPA free (at least the parts that touch food). The vacuum process is straight forward, and easy to get the hang of; after sealing the bag with the little plastic tool (it's not necessary, but it does help), just put the nozzle of the handle over the red ring, press firmly and pull the trigger - that's it. It's best when done on a firm surface and with nothing under the valve, since this gives a better seal. Any liquid that's in the bag will get sucked up a little in to the unit, but it's collected in a removable trap that is easy to clean.Aside from sous vide I found an immediate use for his device when on the same day it arrived, I also got a random smoked, spiral cut ham from a relative (this happens to everyone, right?). Knowing I wasn't going to eat a 10 pound ham in a day, I made quick work of it, and split it up between a few single-serving quart bags and a gallon bag for the bone and some bits that will eventually become soup. I was impressed at how quick it was to do all this, and how much the vacuum bags saved space in the fridge by compressing everything down. Now I look at just about everything in my fridge and freezer and wonder if it really should be in a vacuum bag. Probably it should.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ETZGIE7Y7FU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LW73UY#wasThisHelpful","R2ETZGIE7Y7FU1","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this unit for just a few days so I can't speak to thre long-term durability of it, but so far I've found it to be an exceptional ""consumer grade"" espresso machine.First, the build quality and appearance are quite nice - the all-stainless look fits well in the modern kitchen, and the very compact footprint makes it perfect for people with little counterspace, or those who just want a very sleek look. The thin dimension does mean that it's a little deeper than other units, especailly with the handle in the unit it projects about 17"" from the wall. But still, very compact. That compact shape does have a small downside though - the top cup warmer area can really only fit espresso cups, not larger coffee cups. Not a big deal, but it is always nice to have a warm cup to pour in to.The functionality of this unit also shines. It's incredibly easy to use, with one-touch brewing of either one shot or two. this is great, especially if you are doing other things while brewing your morning cuppa - turn the unit on, pack the handle with some espresso, nd by the time you're done packing the machine is probably ready to brew (it's very quick!). All you have to do then is press the button and you're done. Espresso brews in about 30 seconds, and becasue it shuts itself off, you can use those 30 seconds to get the milk ready for your cappucino, which is also pretty easy to make. To heat the milk, just press the steam button and wait until it stops blinking, and then turn the steam wand on (a little purge of the pre-steam water is a good idea). .The steam wand is really nice - most home units I've owned haven't really had a steam wand that could move around a lot, or give enough clearance between the unit and the pitcher to get a good angle for frothing. Not so with this unit - the wand is fully articulated, moving side to side and back and forth. The steam is powerful enough to get pot of milk hot or frothed quickly, with no signs of petering out at the end. The other thing I really like about the frother is the fact that the covering can be easily removed and rinsed. Most wands I've used end up with a lot of gunk on them after time because they generally don't get well cleaned each and every time. Since it's so easy to clean, I don't see that happening with this wand.The unit has some programmable aspects as well; the brew temp can be adjusted between three different levels, and the unit can be programmed to work with harder or softer than normal water (which affects the time between descalings, which you get a notification about). One thing that is NOT programmable is the length of the shot. This actually surprised and disappointed me a bit - I find the shots are a little on the long side. whereas I like to pull a double a little short (less watery). That does not seem to be an option with this unit, and I wish it were. [EDIT: it's actually possible to interrupt the brew - just tap the brew button again and the unit stops. But it's not programmable, which would have been nice.] The shots are of normal size though, so it's not a huge deal - again, this is a consumer grade machine not a pro machine, so in exchange for convenience you give up some control. You still end up with a very nice espresso.Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a problem getting good espresso - it's full and rich, with nice (not exceptional) crema. It's about what I'd expect from any decent home machine with a 15 bar pump, maybe even a little better since this unit automatically pre-wets the grounds which has the effect of releasing more flavor. Espresso quality varies with a lot of factors, including grind, coffee type and roast, as well as freshness. If you're not getting very good espresso out of this machine, it's probably the coffee you're putting in, or if you're using the absolute freshest coffee ground correctly, it's possible the brew temp is high and you need to adjust it down.Another thing that I am a little disappointed with is the ""basket handle"" aka the ""group"" - the one included with the system is a little long and a little light, which ends up feeling a little cheap in the hand. Also, it's designed around a ""pressurized"" basket which means that while it is more forgiving of vagaries in the grind or the tamp, it doesn't brew as nicely as an unpressurized system and it's more likely to get clogged at some point. Again, it's a convenience/control trade-off. Luckily I happen to have an unpressurized group that works with the system, so I just use that. I believe there are other third-party groups available to buy if you're not satisfied with the one that's included.Overall I'd say this is a great home unit for a person who is just looking for a delicious espresso or latte in the morning. It heats up quickly, it brews quickly and quietly, and it offers a number of consumer-friendly features that make it super easy to produce very good coffee. Those who are obsessed with pulling the absolute perfect shot and having a lot of control over every aspect of the process should probably look elsewhere.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R182MVZ6N6JIWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KA8YC6A#wasThisHelpful","R182MVZ6N6JIWS","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is much to love about the Fire Stick - it's small, and brings Amazon streaming to any TV for a very low price. And Amazons selection for streaming are amazing - I love that I can watch a lot of things for free with Amazon Prime, and get Amazon's own shows too, and also that if its not available on Prime I can rent it easily from the same device and service - no jumping back and forth between different apps just to find something. The remote on this device is basic but straightforward and easy to use, though it would be nice if the buttons had better markings or colors, just to make it easier to use. My issues with the stick come down to two; first, the wifi receiver isn't as strong as it could be, and in my case that lead to some connectivity issues. Nothing that couldn't be fixed with some rearranging of the router, but if your wifi isn't strong where you have your TV this could be a problem. Second, the fact that this requires the use of a wall plug is a little frustrating - it would be nice to have it plugged in to one of my TVs USB ports to draw power, but apparently that's not possible. At least that's what the instructions say. Ymmv. Overall it's an excellent product for people looking to ""smarten up"" their TV at a low price. And for Existing Prime members who have only been able to access video on the computer until now. It's a no-brainer. People who have wifi issues should opt for the speedier and more capable Fire TV unit, which not only has better wifi reception, but also supports more gaming options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1CIF5T6R8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1CIF5T6R8V","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mount is actually incredibly useful. I got it because I often use my iPad (mini) while cooking and wanted something that could hold it upright on the counter and it works great for that - the suction is super tight, and the neck bends at just about any angle. I like that I could use it in the car as well, but I actually think it's so useful in the home, sitting next to my desk, or mounted under a cabinet, that I'm going to buy a second for use in the car. Heck, I might even buy a few of the button-style ones and put them all over the house!My only concern is the strength of the magnet, which holds the iPad mini in place well enough, but it's not so strong that it can't be tipped off with minor bump. I'm not so worried about my mini, but certainly people with the larger iPads or other devices might want something with a sturdier grip. If I were using his in the car, I expect it might slip off if I hit a good sized pothole. Again, this is for the iPad mini, not a phone. Phones are held very firmly and I'd have no issue using this in the car with a phone. This device does come with one large and one small metal plate to put on the back of a tablet or phone, so you get a twofer if you have both phone and tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGR6JQLGSWRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I608BHU#wasThisHelpful","R1FGR6JQLGSWRI","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been buying coffee ground at the store, since my theory is that a better grinder there makes up for a lack of freshness, provided the coffee is never more than a week old. But I finally decided to invest in a decent grinder and I'm glad I did; this grinder elevated the quality of my espresso instantly. Fresh grounds make a big difference in the quality, and his grinder puts out a very consistent grind. It's plenty fine for espresso too, which some of the other, less expensive models, seemed to have a problem with. I like the fact that the grind is pretty adjustable, and that there is a time to grind just as much as you need for your daily dose, if that's how you want to do things. It's not a quiet machine exactly but it's certainly less bothersome than a chopper.There are a few things I don't like, however. First, there are no numbers on the fineness dial - just hash marks that don't match up with the settings exactly. So if you change your grind from time to time (ie do drip coffee one day, espresso the next) you migh find it hard to get the same setting. Second, the container for the grounds is just plain messy. Taking it out of the machine inevitably gets some grounds on the counter, and removing the lid (which isn't hinged) does so even more. By the time I'm done with my second espresso of the morning, there are grounds everywhere. The only solution I can come up with for this is pouring that grounds in a separate container and storing a couple days worth at a time. That's fine, but defeats the purpose of a home grinder somewhat.Overall I'm pretty happy when the grinder and it's definitely a keeper, but I'm going to have to make some adjustments to my mourning routine to make sure I have time to clean up a bit, or get some supplemental storage/scooping equipment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3LGIGK2OPXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LVUHWM#wasThisHelpful","R2K3LGIGK2OPXV","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first these speakers weren't delivering much volume, but I think it was my PC because once I muddled around with the volume settings I was really suprised that these speakers can really pump it out - sitting maybe two feet from my PC, the average video (Amazon Prime Instant Video, of course) is plenty loud between 30% and 35%, and more than that gets uncomfortable. The speakers are a bit muddled, perhaps a little basey. This may favor games and big action movies over more dialog-heavy movies. Anyway, I think with the right EQ settings that can be corrected.The fact that these are USB powered is both an advantage and a deficit; they're easy to plug in to a PC, especially if you've got an extra USB port. But if you've got a hub, you have to split the speaker plug from the USB plug, which makes for bit of a mess of wires. Not worse than with an extra power wart though, so overall I guess it's a plus. Especially if you're hooking these up to a TV with a USB, since it means it's easy to hide the cables.My biggest gripe is the blue lights - they kinda look cool, but they are distractingly bright, especially when the lights are off. There's no way to turn them off, and covering them up is not easy either. It'd be great if there were a way to turn them off. Otherwise these are great speakers, especially for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29WBEXI08Q9SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZ7MATG#wasThisHelpful","R29WBEXI08Q9SS","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My older Garmin GPS was stolen from a rental car, and I can honestly say that I'm at least a little happy that it was. Replacing it with this 2597 has really made a big difference in my driving. First, the old GPS I had promised traffic, but I was never really able to use it effectively. This unit integrates traffic very well in to the whole navigation experience, and it can really improve driving times. The way it works is that it indicates a traffic jam ahead and estimates the delay. If it determines that the delay is longer than taking an alternate route, it automatically offers up that alternative and shows how much time you might save by going a different way. On a recent trip, this meant avoiding a jam of about 20 minutes by diverting to a different road, and I'm pretty sure I saved at least half an hour. I really like being able to see traffic delays ahead (and the distance to them) because it also helps me plan for breaks, fueling up and better knowing the accurate time of arrival.Other than the traffic, this unit also has a significantly improved touchscreen from my previous unit, making it easier to use gestures to scroll or move the map, and less laggy, more accurate typing. The sat recepters and processors are better too - much quicker to fix on location, and reroute in case of a missed turn or detour. The screen is nice and wide, and though there's a lot of information displayed, once you get the hang of it, it's easy to read. The Bluetooth speakerphone is slightly better than previous units, making it easier to hear on the road.On the downside I would say that the menus are slightly more confusing - it's nice not to have to type in city and state every time you enter an address, but the auto-search doesn't always pick the right locations to be searching. The ""lane assist"" is nice to have most of the time, but between that, the traffic and other data displayed, it can be distracting sometimes, and that's not good for a GPS. Better than missing a turn because you were in the wrong lane though, I guess.Overall i""m very happy with this, and would recommend it highly - another great GPS by Garmin made even better by bluetooth, traffic, and most importantly, lifetime map upgrades. Worth the money... just don't leave it in a rental car.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14819L50DJBKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AXX0I88#wasThisHelpful","R14819L50DJBKH","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like a fitbit for your garden, the Parrot Flower Power gives you basic information about the health of your plants. The data that's collected is sunlight, water, fertilizer and temperature, and it records the data continuously. To check in on the plant though, you have to sync the device via bluetooth with your phone, and when the data is synced it is also uploaded to the Parrot (?) servers for analysis, and then notifications are sent. This is overall a pretty good system if you like to check in on your garden on a daily basis, but there are some limitations. Since the device isn't connected to the Internet directly, it can't be checked remotely, and it can't be used with services like IFTTT to trigger other actions or alerts. Having something that is directly connected to the Internet would make for a lot more flexibility with the system, but would probably be more expensive and complicated.As for the data it collects, it's nice to generally know the state of your garden. And because it is set to monitor a particular kind of plant, it is monitoring the health of that plant and doing the analysis for you. I found this very useful to know when I was overwatering or underwating, or when I needed to add fertilizer. One limitation though is that it doesn't seem to corrolate data with things like weather patterns - if it's cloudy one day, it'll tell you to move the plant, instead of realizing that it's just a cloudy day. Also those kinds of alerts seem to be specific to that day, not the overall trend - my tomatoes, for instance, are exposed to all-day sun, but on one cloudy day I got a notice when it should have just realized that the plant is in a good position.Overall I'd say this is very useful, but could be more useful with a few improvements. I'll definitely be buying one or two more to monitor other plants in the garden.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14EKA71OSF1MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOM2YDU#wasThisHelpful","R14EKA71OSF1MH","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There weren't many options when it came to finding a walk-through gate that could fit a large opening (in my case, between a wall and a kitchen island) so I pinned my hopes to this Regalo. So far, I can say I'm pretty happy with it, though there is some room for improvement.First, the design is very flexible, with the base unit covering 27"" (just under a standard door width) and three additional extenders provided, each of a different length to reach up to (I think) 54"". I didn't use all the extenders, but with the right two I was able to get a really perfect fit in my space. That will not be true for everyone - some might find that there ends up being a pretty large gap between the gate and the wall. If you're lucky enough to get the right sizing, it's a snug fit. If it's not a snug fit however, you may be left cranking the threaded bolts all the way to the max, which leads to some floppy instability at the top. This is really the biggest design problem, as these bolts are somewhat loose in the sockets, especially if extended the full length. They would be better if they were threaded sockets and the bolts were thicker.The biggest advantage of this system is the fact that it uses friction and pressure to hold it in place, rather than screwing in to a wall. In my case, that would have meant screwing in to the side of a cabinet which was unacceptable. I appreciate the design of this system, though it is inherently less strong than systems that screw in to place. There are ""cups"" that the ends of the bolts can fit in to reduce the risk that bumping or pushing on the top of the gate will make the pads slide, but these must be screwed in to the wall to work properly. I may try to fix these in place using something like a Command strip removable adhesive, but I can't say whether that will work well or not just yet.For around $50, it's a great deal and the construction is very good. I only wish it were available in wood, or perhaps in another color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAFKN4ZAVORB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNKLHA#wasThisHelpful","R3BAFKN4ZAVORB","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been on the hunt for a good pair of bluetooth earbuds for a long time, and I've tried a lot of the other options. This is by far the best set I've had in just about every way. But there are a few problems, most of them minor, to consider before purchasing.I'll start this review with the packaging. I rarely care about packaging but in the case of these headphones, the packaging was so irritating, I have to say something. The packaging looks like it was designed to be high-end, which one would expect for a product that cost above $150. The cardboard is thick and imprinted with rich graphics, and even has a book-like cover that is held in place with magnets and opens with a cloth tab. But inside the cardboard box is a plastic box which is difficult to open, and then inside that is a piece of foam that holds the headphones in place. Despite all of this packaging, the headphones are taped in place with many layers of cheap scotch tape, which has to be cut with scissors - carefully though, so as not to cut the headphone cords. Finally, the headphone holder is a somewhat cheap plastic box, again held shut with magnets. It's difficult to open, but does seem to hold the headphones securely in place. Overall the ""unboxing"" of these headphones was a bit of a pain and not the quality experience one might expect from the outside packaging. Not that I really need a ""high-quality unboxing experience"" but heck, I'm sure the packaging alone added $20 to the retail price, so it might as well add something.Now to the good part; the headphones. As far as design goes, these things are fine. They're a little big outside the ear, but generally they just look like a pair of oversized earbuds not much different than the $20 ones you get from Sony. I would have appreciated a better finish on the outside - something like the brushed aluminum of say a Vibe Moda would be nice. But looks aren't why I bought these headphones so it's not something I'm concerned much about. The cable is kinda flat - not thick and flat like say the Beats earbuds, but thin and flat in a way that does reduce tangling while still retaining some flexibility. The control unit, which powers the headphones on and off and allows adjustments to volume, and skipping tracks, is again decent but made out of plastic. Nothing great as far as design, but nothing too bad.The fact that they charge via micro-USB is really important for me, since it reduces the number of chargers and cables I have to carry around. Included with the headphones is a very short (9"") flat charging cable which fits easily in the clamshell headphone holder and can be used with a laptop when on the road. It's too short for use with a desktop in most situations, I imagine, but you can always get a longer cord or a separate charger.The fit of the earbuds is where I'm a little conflicted. Generally I like earbuds because they block out ambient noise and until a decent set of noise-cancelling bluetooth earbuds come along, this is probably the next best thing. They do block out a lot of outside noise, which is good for travelling via subway, plane, and other noisy modes. The buds themselves are quite thick though, and even though I'm a big guy, I guess I have tiny ear holes because even using the smallest rubber bud (three are included) they are a little hard to get in the ear properly. The external silicon ""wings"" do hold the buds in place though, so even if they slip out a little they don't fall completely off. Overall I'd say they work well in most situations, including for working out/running, which is the main reason I bought them. I'd like to see improvements to the design including a better wing attachment system so they stay in place better, and a smaller bud offered, but for now I'm pretty happy with the fit.Pairing the headphones couldn't be easier, and is much better than previous headphones I've used. I appreciate the actual voice notification saying the headphones are connected too, which eliminates the problems of having to constantly check the phone to see if the connection has been made. The battery life seems very good - I haven't once run out of juice during a normal day of use which includes an hour and a half commute, a gym workout and some time in between when I just want to escape the noise at work. What helps a lot is the fact that there is a battery monitor for the headphones on my iPhone - no software to install, it just shows up there and I can monitor my use that way.As for the actual sound, I'd say it's exceptional. Clear and crisp, nice and loud (though not skill cracking). I haven't had any dropped ""packets"" as I have with other BT headphones, and there isn't any crackle coming from the headphones. I did notice a few pops when doing things like using Siri, but never during a phone call or during audio playback, so I think this is something that is probably more on the phone side than the headphones. The only real problem I have with the sound is related to the fit; because the earbuds are so tight in the ear, they act as a sort of a ""drum"" and any impact on the cord transmits a sound to the ear. This means when moving (walking, running) there tends to be a constant thumping that results from the cord bouncing up and down. This happens with all in-the-ear buds, but it seems more pronounced with these than others that I've used.I do have a couple other minor problems - there's no indicator LED for when the phones are on, so you have to hold them up to your ear and press the power button to know if they are. The rubberized cord, while durable yet flexible, does have a tendency to grip a bit on the back of the neck, which sometimes means it gets hung up when turning my head. I suppose using the included cord-shortener might help, as would wearing the buds in an over-the-ear fashion, but that's not my preference. I'd prefer to see the cord coated in a fabric wrap of some sort which would be more stylish and more comfortable. But other than these minor problems I'm overall pretty happy with these earbuds. Yes, they're expensive (more than I've paid for any headphones ever, actually) but for me the convenience of going cordless is worth it.* NOTE: this review is based on using these earbuds with the iPhone 5, which has the newer Bluetooth 4 chip. I imagine that some of the features described, such as the battery life, the battery indicator, and the clear connection are the result of this BT4 connection, so these headphones might not be as good when paired with older devices on the BT2-3 standards.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R92SHWL90JE9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIRUOI8#wasThisHelpful","R92SHWL90JE9U","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My only complaint about it is that the USB charger is a mini USB port instead of a full size USB, which means that in order to charge anything you have to keep a collection of adapters around.

"I recently decided to move to a multi-monitor setup and upgrade to this over an older Dell 2409 (I thinnk that's the model number). Sitting side-by-side with that older monitor, it's a world of difference. This Acer is so sharp and so bright, it makes me think I need glasses just to look over at the old one. While the bezel isn't quite as thin as one might have hoped (about .5"" all around, except at the bottom where the ""chin"" is a little thicker) the overall design is sleek and handsome. And while the screen is glossy, it isn't noticible because the brightness of this monitor is so exceptional. Using this at home in a room with a skylight, I don't notice any reflections whatsoever. Colors are great, and the viewing angle is fantastic. While I'm not a monitor connoisseur by any means, it's certainly an improvement over my old one.This monitor comes incredibly well packaged and it's easy to set up. The monitor stand is two pieces - a flat part that's made of a really nice looking brushed black metal (or maybe it's metallic looking plastic) and a glossy plastic column. The column screws in to the base without tools, and snaps in to the monitor quite easily. It has a decent range of motion - maybe +10 degrees up and -5 down. The unit comes packaged with a full array of cables - DVI, VGA and HDMI, which was unexpected.Overall, a very good monitor for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHV2KF8JG1H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZMLIDQ#wasThisHelpful","RDHV2KF8JG1H5","AG9G4VUJB6709","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG9G4VUJB6709?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much of a fan as I am of the genre, I hesitate to even call this ""science fiction"" because it really is a very different kind of movie than one usually thinks of using that term. It's more like The Time Traveler's Wife than Star Wars, though even that comparison fails because Another Earth is far less ""sci-fi"" than even Time Traveler's Wife. In the end, Another Earth is simply a thoughtful, insightful, compelling story of loss and redemption that is based on a premise of the existence of another planet, though for much of the movie the reality of that is somewhat irrelevant.

"Dark painful literary masterpiece.  I frankly found the experience of reading this like being in a nightmare.  But it was exquisitely done, a grim, elaborate, grudgingly moral and profoundly pessimistic piece of fiction designed to make the reader suffer.  It is in its own way powerfully romantic, in that it renders the world in such extreme joyless and dismal terms, and ends with such bold strokes of cruelty. There is nothing of pedestrian realism in it.  In this regard it made me think of ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" by Hubert Selby.  Both novels seem merciless and despairing indictments of a world that has convinced itself it is morally bankrupt. .  I'm glad I read it, but would not want ever to be in it again.  As I'm 74, I do remember the world of the 1960's and I can understand why this novel is considered ""emblematic"" of the times.  There was a deep exhaustion still hanging over the West then, due to the two great wars, due to the Cold War, and it seems our collective culture needed time to regain unapologetic  faith in itself  and in its capacity for joy.  But this novel makes a metaphysical statement about life that is bigger than its story or its time, or its particular circumstances.  I admire Le Carre very much. I recommend this as I do Selby's novel, and Remarque's novel, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" about an earlier time.  Such dark gems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DP536BUCXXQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143124757#wasThisHelpful","R3DP536BUCXXQE","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sixth Gabriel Allon novel that I've read.  I read two recents ones and was so impressed that I went back to the beginning and I'm now reading Allon's adventures in order.  Well, I didn't think Silva could top ""The Confessor,"" but ""A Death in Vienna"" does indeed top it.  This novel takes on an immense theme --- the horrors of the Holocaust, and the immense debt owed to ALL its victim by ALL of us --- if we are ever to recover from the inhumanity and cruelty of the Second World War, and move on  to a world in which such ghastly horrors can never again happen.  And the author treats this immense theme with dignity, feeling, restraint, and wisdom.  The book is beautifully written.  Yes, it's ""a spy novel"" and there are inevitable touches of the romance and artificiality inevitable in good page turning spy stories....and this is indeed a page turner!....but this book is infinitely more.  It way transcends the limitations of a genre.  I recommend it heartily to anyone who enjoys fine writing, a thrilling plot, and who craves a deep vitally important  theme as well as terrific storytelling.  I love Silva's characters, particularly Ari Shamron, and Gabriel Allon, the enigmatic and every human hero.  I love his vocabulary, his phrasing,  his use of adverbs,  his subtle way of revealing the thoughts and feelings of his people.  I love the way he describes the cities and towns and rooms through which his people move.  But I think I love more than anything else the unfolding tale of these Israeli spies and the great historical and religious  legacy that informs their particular struggle.  Just a great book.

"Another superbly entertaining novel from Silva, and a pleasure to recommend on all levels.  Fine writing, lean, often beautiful ---  and appealing characters  always exquisitely drawn and as interesting as they are sympathetic.  There is the deep romance here of many  spy novels or films ---in that  the heroes are presented as noble but deadly,  expert executioners with a profound moral vision.  I like their deep sensitivity to personal loss, and they strong blood and tribal ties.  As in ""The English Girl,"" the locales are glamorous, exciting,  expertly rendered whether we're talking Lisbon and other European capitals,  or the bleak coast of Ireland.  And the Author's Note is compelling and persuasive.  Silva must surely be known as ""the thinking person's thriller writer.""  I don't know of any novelist whose done better in this genre.

"Superbly done historic series about the great British lawyer, William Garrow, at the Old Bailey, and his role in the developing of criminal trial law.  Just loved it.  As so often with these British series, the actors and actresses were perfect, and I fell in love with Alun Armstrong as John Southouse before the third season finished. Also fell in love with Michael Culkin as Judge Buller. Rupert Graves made for a pathetically human yet somehow charming  villain. Lyndsey Marshal gave a very credible performance as an intelligent woman wrestling with matters of honesty, honor and the love of her child.  Aiden McArdle was just marvelous as the prosecuting attorney so often pitted against Garrow.  And Andrew Buchan was very sympathetic and convincing as the lead.  The writing was superb.  I only discovered this series a week or two ago, and I am so sad that it was not continued.  If only it could be revived...

It reminded me of ""Blade Runner,"" but I found ""Blade Runner"" a much more affirmative film.  This presents a bleak vision of the future, but a profound vision of human nature, exploring  the great human need for and the capacity to love.

"The novel is quite an achievement and the adult Jean Louise dominates the pages with heroic stamina as she confronts the complexities of southern culture in the 1950's. I liked her. I liked the novel. I loved her stories of coming of age in a marvelous society of individuals and scholars and people of principle, including the woman of color who brought her up, Calpurnia. I myself think the Atticus of ""Watchman"" is a fine achievement. ----  And I heard nothing from his lips that he might not have said in ""Mockingbird"" had some one asked him. To assume that the hero of ""Mockingbird"" would have believed in de-segregation is a mighty stretch, indeed, and frankly I think a rather unnecessary one is make. ---  And the Atticus of ""Watchman"" does not go unchallenged by his courageous daughter when he voices his views on race and race conflict of the 1950's. ---- Of course we find those views distasteful and dangerous, and rightly so. But then so does Jean Louise and she is the heart of the novel. --- This isn't a sequel to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and should not be read as if it were. It is a novel that died apparently so that ""Mockingbird"" could be born. And the literary mystery for me here is why a vital adult heroine like Jean Louise had to die in the process.. (Note: the character does not literally die in any narrative here. She is replaced by a small child Jean Louise in the novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" ) We may never know the answer to the questions ""Who killed the adult Jean Louise Finch, and why,"" but I'm glad that she has been exhumed --- because her story is very worth reading.

"Powerful performances, beautifully written dialogue delivered beautifully.  This season is as fine as the earlier two.  I cannot recommend this too highly.  Marvelous television.  Matthew MacFadyen makes history.  The entire cast is great. Production values are dazzling.  What fascinates more than anything are the profound moral questions and moral confrontations.

"I just finished this book.  It is powerful, deeply moving, beautifully written.  It immersed me completely in the world of Rawlings' characters, the simple farmers, trappers, hunters and bootleggers  who lived in the Florida scrub early in the Twentieth Century,  struggling against the wild to provide for themselves and their children.  I did not find it as mystical or wise as ""The Sojourner"" or ""The Yearling,"" perhaps because both those novels had more compelling heroes.  But this story --- written before those later novels --- provides a great masterly overview of a family through three generations, and I came to care as much about these people I had about Jody of ""The Yearling"" or Ase, the quiet philosophical hero of ""The Sojourner.""  There is something noble and grand about this novel.  It suggests a truly great ambition on the part of the author,  not simply to chronicle the harsh and beautiful world of particular people, but to extract from the tale  the most profound lessons that the earth has to teach.  And ""South Moon Under""  can be seen as a step on the way to the deeper concerns of Rawlings'  later books.  There is great care  here, great  restraint, as always,  with Rawlings ---  who lets her characters talk in their compelling and often savagely poetic vernacular.  And the physical descriptions of the people, the trees, the animals, the river, the fires that burn the scrub, and the rains that descend on it --- are priceless.  I really loved this book.  It filled me to the brim with  fresh images, fresh considerations, and fresh ideas.  It left me with a feeling of sadness,  but a kind of muted joy as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GSIHGWTU0O3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0891907734#wasThisHelpful","R3GSIHGWTU0O3B","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most beautiful novel I've ever read.  I cried when I finished it.  It is surely one of the more nearly perfect novels I've ever read, word for word. The pace of it and the structure are perfect.  The hero is irresistible.  The language is poetry. ----  It is the story of a man who feels unloved, and who loves with all his heart the good earth of the farm on which he was born and the wife he marries, and a few beloved souls  with whom he makes a profound connection over the course of a lifetime.  The spiritual scope of the novel is magnificent.  -----  A huge amount of time is taken up describing life on a farm in the northern part of the country in the early years of the Twentieth Century, and for many this might not prove interesting, but for me it was positively enthralling.  To see apple and peach orchards, livestock, barns, woodlands, wheat fields, the glory of spring and the harsh cold menace of winter through the eyes of a sensitive man who loves all living things  with his whole soul was breathtaking. -----  I had the feeling more than once of how much common knowledge of farming and farm animals has been lost in this country in perhaps less than three generations, and how invaluable a document this might be in terms of practical things that for millennia had been part of the lives of most of the human species.  But it is the wisdom and compassion of the author that makes this a great work, and the great spiritual hunger with which Rawlings endows her humble hero. ---  I love this book so much I wish I could tell the whole world about it.  I really do wish that.  Simply beautiful.  ----  I'm going on now to read ""The Yearling"" but it impossible at this moment for me to imagine anything surpassing this book.  To read that it was not all that successful when it was first published puzzles me and hurts me.  I guess I have to find out why or how.  But I'd rather just buy copies of this novel and give them to friends.  I purchased my used hardcover on Amazon and it was a fine old hard copy, quite clean and intact.  I will always cherish it.  Now to order paperback copies for those to whom I want to give a precious gift, with rare pleasure. -----","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GM25RXV8KDPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110552843X#wasThisHelpful","R2GM25RXV8KDPT","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the finest author biographies I've ever read.  The author gives Margaret Mitchell the full scholarly treatment, immersing himself and us in the subject matter on every level.  As a lover of author biographies, I treasure this one for all that it tells me about Mitchell personally ---  her upbringing, her education, what books she read and loved, her correspondence, her health, her marriage, etc and how she approached the writing of a novel that would make literary history.  In highly readable prose the author takes us through the unique and record setting publication of the most popular novel ever printed in English, its transformation into one of the most popular movies of all time, and explores how all of this impacted Mitchell right up to the end of her life in a tragic car accident.  I don't think one could ask for a better written, better documented life of any creative artist, or a better written more entertaining book on any  popular culture legend.  And the book is fun.  Pyron's style is accessible and inviting.  Just about every question I ever had about Mitchell and the whole ""Gone With the Wind"" phenomenon has been answered here.  This is indispensable for lovers of GWTW, and certainly a very worthwhile read for those who are merely curious about this remarkable novel and its unique history in America.  For writers who want to know about what other writers experience from the beginning to the end of their careers, this is fabulous.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39W7AMOFUXHD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195052765#wasThisHelpful","R39W7AMOFUXHD2","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is simply brilliant television with dazzling understated and subtle performances and skillful muted  direction and exquisite  cinematography ------- all of which adds up to  pure delight.  Costumes, settings, all the small details  ---  sheer perfection.  I have never seen Henry VIII material done in this way.  Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell is riveting.  What he achieves without saying a word is incredible.  What he achieves when he speaks in magnificent.  This is  one of the finest performances I've ever seen on television.  Though it is much smaller (so far) in scope, I rank this series with Neil Jordan's ""The Borgias.""  A shining example of the new golden age of television.  ----  Frankly, I was reluctant to begin watching this.  I thought, ""Can I really go Henry and Anne yet again?""

"The recent television mini series ""Wolf Hall,"" based on the novels of Hilary Mantel, has  sent me looking for a good solid  biography of Thomas Cromwell.  This book fills the bill.  It's beautifully written, very accessible and very enjoyable, and extremely well documented.  Just what I wanted.  I have long believed biography is one of the most rewarding ways to study history, especially when the biographer gives ample context, immersing the reader in the period, as the story of the subject unfolds.

"This book does the job.  Having just watched ""Gone With the Wind"" again after re-reading the book word for word,  I wanted to know about Hattie McDaniel, who she was, what it was like for her to be the first African-American to receive an Oscar for best supporting actress, and how this impacted her life.  The book told me pretty much all I wanted to know.  It's simply and directly written, enjoyable and well documented.  Recommended for those who want to know the story, as I did.  I wasn't surprised at all to discover how much the world loved Hattie McDaniel.  When I was a little girl growing up in New Orleans, in the days before television, I well remember the evening radio show, ""Beulah"" and the way the announcer always said the name of its star:  Hattie McDaniel.  ----- The whole family loved this nightly entertainment.  -----  Later on when I saw the film, ""Gone With the Wind,"" I didn't connect the lovable Mammy to that old radio show, but I found Mammy  one of the strongest forces in the film, her performance profoundly impressive by any standard.  But it came as no surprise to me, as I read Jackson's book that McDaniel and other black actors who played servants had been criticized for it during their careers.  And this book seems to me to present this controversy with  objectivity.  I think it is difficult for people today to realize the prejudice these black actors confronted, and how limited were their opportunities.  Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen (Prissy) could not even attend the Atlanta premiere of ""Gone with the Wind"" due to segregation.  The life and achievements of Hattie McDaniel  are  part of the history of Black America, and the history of Hollywood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIZ4F7EFQ9X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BF8MDPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WIZ4F7EFQ9X2","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I honestly don't know where to begin. This is a truly great novel.  Years ago, I read this book but I did not, at the time, fully appreciate the consistently high quality of the prose, and the depth of the writer's insights into human nature and the world she describes in such detail for us.  A few weeks ago I sat down and read it word for word from beginning to end and I was enormously moved by and impressed with it.  The writing is rich, precise, brilliantly restrained and immensely satisfying.  Francie is a true heroine, struggling to fulfill her dreams as a sensitive and creative young person in a harsh and often brutal environment.  Her imagination and intelligence are  beautifully revealed in pages filled with brilliant and wise observation, and simple incidents that can move you to tears.  In many respects it's a heartbreaking novel, filled with suffering, and often deeply sad; but it's always enormously inspiring and somehow always entertaining.  That some critics when it was published dismissed it as ""sentimental"" is hard to believe.  It is anything but sentimental.  ----  It is realism at its finest.  Highly recommended.

"This is an exquisitely photographed and beautifully acted film that is amazingly faithful to the novel.  The story of Kitty and Levin is much neglected, but that seems to be the case with many adaptations of ""Anna Karenina.""  I thought Leigh's performance was tender, restrained and heartbreakingly  lovely. She comes across as gorgeous, magnetic, and unconsciously seductive and makes Vronsky's infatuation with Anna wholly believable.  All the casting was superb.  I first saw this film on late night television decades ago in the very early seventies, and it was what prompted me to read the entire novel cover to cover, introducing me to one of the greatest fiction accomplishments in literary history.  Now, having watched the film again, I find it in many ways as compelling as I did years ago.  Some might say it is dated, even a bit creaky; but I was again deeply moved by it, and marveled at its fidelity to the personality of Tolstoy's characters and his major themes.  Highly recommended.

"This review is for the Rosamund Bartlett translation of ""Anna Karenina.""  ----  For years, I rejected new translations of this great novel when they came my  way.  I tried them.  I simply couldn't sink into them.  I compared them all in my heart of hearts to the great Constance Garnett.  But I've decided now that I do want to explore the latest translations and I've begun with Rosamund Bartlett.  Well, I'm loving this.  I have spent considerable time moving through the novel focusing only on the passages that pertain to Kitty and Levin, and I am swept up in prose that is so beautiful it has moved me more than once to tears.  -----  I am not equipped really to access a translation from Russian into English except subjectively and emotionally.  And I am weighing in  to say that I love Bartlett's language.  It resonates with my concept of Tolstoy, and my concept of this magnificent novel.  I recommend this book.  -----  I'm hoping to approach other translations in the coming days.  But I don't think a new reader of ""Anna"" could go wrong with Bartlett.

And I am also reading her recent translation of ""Anna Karenina.""  Studying Tolstoy is an education in itself.  I'll never tire of reading about him, how he wrestled with his immense literary gifts, how he managed somehow to write two of the greatest novels I've ever read, novels that brought the depth of Shakespeare to a form that was not necessarily known in English for such depth.

"""Emily Climbs"" is the sequel to ""Emily of New Moon"" and follows the highly imaginative and creative Emily on her journey to high school in Shrewsbury along with her beloved and also highly creative friends, Else, Perry and Teddy.  ----- At first I was a little disappointed in the form of this novel, in that it plunged into diary entries by Emily, and I longed for a direct pounding narrative, but very soon, I was totally at home with the author's experiments in form and swept up once more in Emily's journey to becoming a professional writer.  Once more, the natural world sustains Emily and restores her when the world of relatives and schoolmates is oppressive or hostile to her, and the descriptions of woodland groves, hills, flowers, and views are breathtaking.  I know of no writer who describes the natural world any better than Lucy Maud Montgomery.  ---- This novel has many extraordinary moments, including Emily's emotional reaction when a poem of hers is finally accepted for publication in a periodical; and also a strange adventure for Emily and Ilse in the countryside in which they encounter a marvelous old  storyteller from the ""old country"" and Emily's psyche ability, her gift of ""second sight, "" manifests itself in a surprising way.  I hated for the book to end.  ---------  The ""high school"" of Emily's time is vastly different from high school today, and I enjoyed very much the immersion in the period, in its attitudes, expectations and the pressures it put on young women.  Once again, the chief value of Montgomery's ""Emily"" novels for me is that Emily is a gifted writer who must battle discouragement at every turn.  But I loved everything about this book, absolutely everything, and I think many a reader will be enchanted with it.  I recommend reading ""Emily of New Moon"" first.  This book does give much information to ease a new reader into Emily's family situation and her many problems, but it also presumes, I think, a knowledge of what has transpired with Emily before.  -------  I'm moving on now to the third Emily book.

"This review is based on a hardcover edition of this novel which I believe to be unabridged.  I came to the book due to the recent Canadian Television Series,  and though I've enjoyed that series very much, I find the book is altogether quite different from the series.  It held my interest from the first page, and I was deeply moved by the entire achievement.  Little Emily in this novel is a writer,  a child with the heart and soul of a poet/prose writer who is immensely sensitive to the beauty around her on Prince Edward Island where she is growing up.  Her closest friends, Teddy and Ilse, are also highly creative; and the soul of the novel has to do with the passion and courage of Emily in a world where vulnerable creative personalities meet with general bias as well as specific obstacles to their development every day.  For me, the strongest and most arresting passages in the book have to do with nature as Emily sees it and moves through it.... trees, woodlands, coastal areas, gardens both natural and created, and the neverending panorama of changing skies.  It is worth noting that Emily sees as much beauty in winter around her as she sees in spring or summer; and  when she feels deeply, her joy is mingled with pain.  Her soul opens when she is given opportunities to write down her thoughts; and the act of writing is therapeutic for her; and over the course of the novel she grows in insight and strength.  ----- ------- There is much more to be said about this book.  It is part of  group of novels of the period that dealt with appealing orphans placed in homes where they had to win over the unsympathetic guardians who burdened with their care.  And much can be said about the metaphor of the orphan,  and why these books attained such popularity. ----  Another key aspect of the novel is that it takes the mind and soul of a child completely seriously, and does not shrink from strong condemnations of those who are rude and abusive to children.  It is not written per se for children; but it is written by some one for whom the child is a full human being. -----------  I do want to explore those aspects of the book (and others)  as I continue to read Lucy Maud Montgomery but the primary value of this novel for me is that Emily is a writer; and I think there is much here to comfort, encourage and inspire writers of all ages.  The novel rings true.  The novel is not just for children. The novel transcends time.  I recommend this to anyone interested in the dilemma or the adventure of the creative child, the child who is a dreamer, the child who sees miracles in the physical world all around her, the child whose soul longs to write or paint or make art in any form.  This is lovely novel, and it is a strong one and reading it was a rare pleasure.  ------  One last note.  When I finished it I thought at once of ""Martin Eden"" by Jack London.  That is a book about an adult, and a much darker book.  It is wholly different book, and it provides a deeply disturbing ending that many might find disappointing.  But ""Martin Eden""  also about a writer, about the anguishing struggles of a sensitive soul who longs to be surrounded by beauty and to make beauty.  -----  I recommend both books very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP2SM5QE6RV3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055323370X#wasThisHelpful","RP2SM5QE6RV3M","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well written, and comprehensive biography of an author whose novels moved millions.  I welcome the immense scholarship here, the attention to Lucy Maud Montgomery as a female writer, and a wrier of her time, the research on the books she read growing up and the early experiences that shaped her as the voice behind ""Anne of Green Gables"" and other internationally popular books.  I also welcome the excellent exploration of Montgomery's reputation and the negative effect of academic attitudes towards her and her work.  This is a valuable book, I think, not only for those intrigued by the woman behind the novels, but for aspiring writers interested in the experience of those who have gone before them, and for anyone interested in how a writer copes with and survives great fame in her lifetime, and also how the world regards those hugely popular writers whom ""the academy"" does not want to accept as great.  Like many a fine biography, this one describes in great detail the physical, religious, political and evolving  world into which the protagonist was born and I cherish all that information.  The scope here is simply wonderful.  Mary Henley Rubio has done a superb job here.  I'm grateful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CN4D1IYZSH7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385667604#wasThisHelpful","R3CN4D1IYZSH7J","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is of the First Season of ""Emily of New Moon"" offered on Amazon Instant.  I loved it.  The direction, acting and cinematography struck me as outstanding.  The costumes, the look of the houses, the interiors, fabrics, wallpaper, china, myriad details --- all very well done. And I loved the poignant portrayal of a little girl who wants with all her heart to be a writer, and will not be silenced no matter how often people try to do it.  The actress playing Emily is enchanting, but then the whole cast is excellent.  ----  I love that Emily is poetic by nature, and that she  sees ghosts and the ghosts are benign or helpful.  This did more than whet my appetite for the remaining seasons, and also for the Emily novels which I've ordered.  I cannot compare the series to the novels, as I have only just begun to read them.  I can say that  I found the series entertaining, delightful, engrossing and in some way soothing. I liked being in the world of the series.  I felt safe there.  I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R337OI2BLNSR9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003Y17K4G#wasThisHelpful","R337OI2BLNSR9L","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is certainly one of the finer books I've ever read on the Near Death Experience (and the Spiritually Transformative Experience.)  NDE studies is one field where you absolutely cannot judge a book by its cover.  The field is overrun with all kinds of approaches and responses to the Near Death Experience, including small vague religious books, books that claim people went to the Christian Heaven or Hell and have come back to save souls,  long thoughtful personal accounts which are deeply examined in terms of spiritual and physical implications, and  scholarly books that address the entire range of Near Death Experience research worldwide and its implications.  Many of the finest books are written by medical doctors.  This author is a medical doctor. And many excellent entries ---  truly fine books --- have been packaged with simple art and sometimes annoying simplistic titles..involving ""the light,"" or ""Heaven"" or huge claims of proof of the ""Afterlife.""  This can be off putting. ----  So one must approach each and every book with an open mind, aware that the cover art, title, publisher, etc., may not be a determining factor as to the quality of what you will find inside.  -----  And what I found inside of this book is profound and compelling writing.  Pamela M. Kircher's style is simple and accessible, but it also extremely precise, richly detailed, and what I would call authentic.  --------------------------Kircher has had her own Near Death Experience as a child, and she has worked in the field of Near Death Experiences for years, including her years in hospice work which gave her immense access to all kinds of ""experiencers"" and their stories.  --------- She has much to say here about the near uniformly positive and transformative effects of the NDE.  And she is not speaking lightly or hastily when she declares her belief that the NDE teaches many people that we are in this world to love others, and that learning this can and often does transform a life completely.  She does not gloss over that there may be grave adjustment difficulties for those who have NDEs.  But she is, in my opinion, on very solid ground when she reports her experience of the great positive effect of the NDE on human beings and the increasing awareness  of NDEs among today's population.  ----  The book's strongest point, in a way, is it lack of embellishment --- as Kircher tells story after story, regardless of how repetitive they might seem, in sharing what she has learned from experiencers.  She talks convincingly of the differences between the NDEs experienced by dying patients in hospice, and those more traumatic NDEs experienced by younger or healthier people.  She records valuable details as to how hospice patients frequently appear to see and to be talking to deceased relatives.  She offers simple yet fresh stories told to her by Near Death Experiencers.  She offers all that she has observed, and it is quite a range, and she is unquestionably inspiring. ---  I am now rereading the book, underlining, studying, pondering much of what she offers.  ----  It is my belief that the NDE experience is the most significant mystical phenomena of this period in human history, and that no matter what one believes about an afterlife,  NDEs involve patterns worldwide that should command serious attention.  ----  One of these patterns, as Jeffrey Long has pointed out in his book, is that when the NDEr sees people on the other side they are invariably dead people.  Hallucinations show no such pattern.  And another pattern of course is the one this book emphasizes, the positive transformative effect. .  Neither of these two patterns can be explained away as the effects of oxygen deprivation or drugs.  These patterns are far more significant to me than the hasty, shallow ""scientific"" efforts to explain away the NDE, none of which has ever accounted for the many features of the NDE, and yet are so readily accepted by skeptics to dismiss the entire phenomenon.  --------Unlike some who follow this literature, I do believe there are profound religious implications for people today coming out of NDE research.  And I continue to derive great personal inspiration from following this material.  Myself, I've never had an NDE that I can remember; and I have never been with anyone dying who appeared to have an NDE or spoke of having one.  But the more I explore the field, the more intrigued I am, and the more convinced that the message.... we are here to love.... is vitally important.  ------  So I recommend this book heartily.  In fact, I find it one of the best I've read on the topic. -----","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZVEDXRZWZN6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615818641#wasThisHelpful","RZVEDXRZWZN6Q","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a compulsively readable biography of a fascinating life, and like any fine biography it takes one on a colorful tour of the period in which the subject lived.  Raleigh's life was beyond remarkable; his achievements as a poet, prose writer, favorite at the Court of Queen Elizabeth, adventurer and explorer, soldier and sea captain are simply beyond amazing.  And this book opens up that enormous story in such a way as to make it more exciting than a novel.  I'm not qualified to judge the authors' conclusions on controversial points about the life of Raleigh, but I do want to say with great enthusiasm that this is beautifully written, and great fun. It's as solid as any academic biography and the prose is easy and accessible for the common reader.  Highly recommended.  It's answering every question I ever had about Raleigh and has me searching for biographies of those who lives intersected with Raleigh's.  A marvelous achievement.

"A finely crafted, suspenseful and deliciously dark mystery.  Superb acting, writing, directing and cinematography.  Quite an achievement.  And I think the film did an excellent job of conveying the dark, alienated prose world of author, Gillian Flynn.  Rosamund Pike was convincing and compelling as ""Amazing Amy,"" and Ben Affleck equally so as Nick Dunne.  Affleck brought a likable quality to the role that was perfect for it.  ----The film put me in mind of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and ""Double Indemnity.""  ---- Certainly it had that hellish noir quality throughout.  Conveying the subtleties of Flynn's vision is no small feat.  Enjoyable, with more than a few hints of disturbing truth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUQJE7PS16XM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4USLK8#wasThisHelpful","R2WUQJE7PS16XM","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this novel beautifully written and engrossing to the last word.  Why is it out of print? I hope it experiences rediscovery, and a revival.  The author boldly chronicles the experience of her heroine, Virginia Cunningham, a gravely ill woman in a mental hospital, from the point of view of that woman, as she struggles with the violent side effects of shock treatment on her memory and her capacity to make sense of where she is and what is happening to her and why.  The writing is uncompromisingly profound throughout.  The effect ultimately is a triumph for the author in revealing a Hellish world in which institutional treatments for insanity come across as brutal and sadistic, and enough to drive any sane person crazy.  Hunger, extreme cold, poor hygiene, neglect, bullying by other patients, forced feeding, forced baths, forced binding of patients  and of course shock treatments  ---- all this is presented in gruesome detail.  What the heroine endures and suffers is terrifying.  -----  Sources indicate that when the book was published, Ward denied that it was based on personal experience.  But apparently it was indeed based on her own experience, and we are told that ""The Snake Pit"" played a role in getting reforms to mental health care in America.  ------  I'm in awe of the novel's power.  I'm in awe of the sustained experiment of telling it all from Virginia's point of view, no matter how disoriented or confused or delusional Virginia becomes.  And I left the novel comforted by the author's achievement.  I do hope this book will be republished and recirculated.

"This is a magnificent film --- brilliantly directed by Frank Pierson, with an unbelievably great cast, including Eric Roberts in his first film role,  Susan Sarandon as his unforgettable mother, a young and beautiful Brooke Shields, Annette O'Toole, the ever delightful Annie Potts, the great Judd Hirsch, the great Sterling Hayden and the great Shelley Winters.  Over the years, I've seen it any number of times, marveling at the performances, and the exotic and often bizarre world it reveals  --- that of the urban gypsies in America in the mid 1970's.  Just recently I hunted down and found Peter Maas' non-fiction book of the same name, which inspired the film, and it does seem that the film is faithful to the book.  But the film goes way beyond a glimpse into the lives of the gypsies.  It is  beautiful and engrossing and brilliantly done, and can be valued on its own as a gem --- regardless of whether one is interested in its historical dimensions.  If you love movies, don't miss this one.  If you love virtuoso performances, enjoy the many in this story.  The cinematography is dazzling; and the writing superb.

The movie based on this book,  ""King of the Gypsies"" with Eric Roberts and Susan Sarandon (among other great actors and actresses) is a favorite of mine and I must have seen it five times over the years.

"The film is worth watching for Marlon Brando.  He gives an absolutely remarkable performance as the deeply conflicted Christian Diestl, a German soldier who comes to be horrified by the war in which he is participating.  And I found his German accent flawless.  As a picture of war, I feel the film is limited and dated.  It cannot compare to films of later decades, in my estimation, films such as ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Enemy at the Gates,"" at depicting the horrors of war; and even compared to other popular yet serious movies of the same period,  such as ""On the Waterfront,"" it lacks both the sophistication and the raw power.  However  ""The Young Lions"" is a film of noble ambitions. And it is never a boring film to watch.  Dean Martin and Montgomery Clift are appealing.  So is the rest of the cast.  -----  Irwin Shaw, author of the famous novel,  did not approve of Brando's take on the role and said so publicly to Brando.  And as much as I deeply respect Shaw as the novelist, the original creator of the character, I have to affirm that what Brando did do with this role is quietly magnificent. (It seems to me the director  and screen writer must have been behind the shaping of the character of Diestl.  But Shaw's public argument was with Brando.)  Did the movie do justice to the novel on other levels? I don't know because I have not yet finished the novel.  Again, I recommend the movie for Brando's performance.  I wonder if some one will attempt a remake of this film in years to come.  Irwin Shaw was a mightily respected writer in his time, and he was successful with mass audiences right up until his death.  College kids of my age (early 60's) may remember his short stories, including ""The Girls in Their Summer Dresses"" which was in my English textbook.  He wrote for The New Yorker for years.

"Irwin Shaw, author of numerous short stories, and a sting of successful novels, including ""The Young Lions"" lived an amazing and exciting life.  I first encountered Shaw when I was college.  His story, ""The Girls in Their Summer Dresses"" was included in our English class textbooks and I never forgot it.  And now over fifty years later, I'm reading Shaw's stories for pleasure, insight and inspiration, and I'm also tackling his great post WWII novel, ""The Young Lions.""  I am finding this immensely readable and wonderfully detailed biography of Shaw very helpful in providing a picture of a complex and remarkable author,  considered both literary and popular,  whose life brought him into contact with the other major writers of his time.  Shaw came to success early as a playwright in New York, became a successful short story writer for The New Yorker, went on to write scripts in Hollywood, experienced the Second World War first hand and offered his own great novel based on it, and lived  a glamorous  and productive existence right up to the time of his death. His 1969 novel, ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" became a hugely successful television miniseries in 1976.  This biography gives a vivid and fascinating picture of Shaw's world.  I'm grateful that Michael Shnayerson wrote this book and wrote it so well.  It's for me an informative and inspiring document.  And I think the book might be of great interest to many authors, as well as fans of Shaw's work, and students of American literature, especially those interested in the literary giants of the Twentieth Century, and the few who attained popular success.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSH2DM78HO9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399134433#wasThisHelpful","R3HSH2DM78HO9B","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marvelous entertainment on every level.  We're in a new golden age of television now, especially for fans of sci-fi, fantasy, and historical drama.  And this show with its great production values and seductive cast, is outstanding for the more playful and fun approach it takes to historical romance.  It's light, fast paced,  and beautifully done. Of course the older Musketeers movies always delivered comedy as well as action, but this version  is just serious enough and intelligent enough to make the wit and humor all the more appealing.  The violence and inevitable cruelty of the period is never overdone, and moments of triumph often depend not on brutality  but on cleverness.  The villains or antagonists --- Milady de Winter and Cardinal Richelieu --- are quite complex and truly interesting characters, and that adds considerable depth to the whole offering.  I am delighted that a second season is in the works.  ---  For some one who grew up in the forties and fifties as I did, reveling in Errol Flynn movies like ""Captain Blood,"" ""Robin Hood,"" or ""The Sea Hawk,"" this is a great treat.  It's entirely safe for an audience that might find the gore of ""Game of Thrones"" too much, and the sadism of ""The Borgias"" simply overwhelming.  ""The Musketeers"" is not striving to be as serious as those and other shows, yet at the same time the sets, costumes, and the cinematography are superb, the writing is consistently excellent, and the use of historical figures is extremely well done.  Every episode is profoundly  emotionally satisfying.

"Excellent book.  Highly readable.  Entertaining.  What this book offers is not a grand theory of spirits and spirit contact so much as a  secular overview of the evidence for humankind's involvement with the ""spirit world"" since its earliest beginnings  through the present. Myself, I do not subscribe to any comprehensive theory as to whether spirits are real, or what their nature and goals might be, etc.  But I deeply value books like this which draw together so much evidence with regard to spirit contact in all ages and explain and reflect on the evidence  in simple and often elegant terms.  The book is very well researched and very well documented and contains a lot of interesting references for further study in the field.  I felt Brennan's criticism of the ""skeptics"" (those who discount the paranormal out of hand) were sound.  The last few chapters of the book I found particularly intelligent and persuasive.

I commend the author for his thoroughness, and his restrained and polite writing, for his research and for giving me so much basic information here about Renault --- about her early life, her crucial social decisions, her commitment to write, and her career experiences.  ------  It positively broke my heart to read here that the editor/publisher made Mary Renault cut huge portions  of ""The Last of the Wine.""  Renault's pain over this is so understandable.  What I wouldn't give for a restored version of the novel with all the edits put back.  --- And thank heaven, Renault did not take the advice of anyone who urged her not to write anymore historical novels!!!!  -----  I would have welcomed a lot more in depth discussion of her  plots and characters  but that is not really the responsibility of the biographer of a novelist and can be found elsewhere.  I'm really enjoying this book.  And I recommend it to others. --- The more I read, I wonder if Renault's life wouldn't make an excellent motion picture or TV film. She broke ground in an age when people were afraid to be gay, let alone publish ""gay"" books. She was principled and courageous --- and wrote beautiful prose always.  Her achievements and her immense influence are worth remembering.  ---  And her ability to tell the story of Alexander the Great through the eyes of his gay lover is just remarkable.  As to why her novels have not been made into films I do not know.  Surely this is the time for ""The Persian Boy.""  What a great quality cable series it would make, if not a big time motion picture.  I recommend this book to all Renault fans ---- and to struggling writers who are inspired as I am by the lives and example of writers who went before us.  Renault is a great writer, and at the moment is a bit neglected. But I trust that will change in time.  Her accomplishments are too beautiful, too profound, too entertaining, and too dazzling on all levels for her not to be rediscovered over and over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB15D76CPQJEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151931100#wasThisHelpful","RB15D76CPQJEL","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The fictional village of Portwenn (beautiful St. Isaac in Cornwall)  is a real character in the ongoing drama with its winding streets, and views of the blue sea ---  and the unique  Ian McNeice is especially captivating as Bert Large, a lovable though fallible pillar of the community.  Stephanie Cole as Doc Martin's Aunty June is unforgettable  and so is Eileen Atkins as yet another loving and interesting aunt.  Claire Bloom does a great job now and then as Martin's ghastly mother.  But I love all the cast truly.  If you haven't tried this series, it's a pleasure to marathon it, let me assure you. There's something safe and comforting about it, though it is always surprising and entertaining.  And I so hope we will see a season 7.  We must have a season 7!!!!  Makes me want to get on a plane for Port Isaac and rent a little house overlooking the bay, and never return to the real world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKPXZCUM32JQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCNGM2I#wasThisHelpful","RKPXZCUM32JQC","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those light, really fun movies that is clever and suspenseful and altogether engaging while including some excellent and delicious satire.  Loved Craig Ferguson in this.  And Brenda Blethyn was utterly winning.  It's set in Port Isaac in Cornwall which later became the fictional Portwenn of the Doc Martin series with Martin Clunes (he's in the movie too), and this adds to the charm of the picture.  Delightful and also rather touching.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFY8O422SJR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00003CXMY#wasThisHelpful","R1HFY8O422SJR8","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm thankful we have Ehrman. I don't know of any bible scholar who is more humble, polite and patient in putting forth his views, who takes more time and patience than Ehrman to offer a perspective on a question.  This book is a joy to read.  I'm finding one brilliant insight after another. ------  Ehrman does a marvelous job of bridging the gap between the popular reader (people like me who study on their own) and the latest thinking of the finest biblical scholars (skeptics and believers) in the academic world --- as he offers his own informed and documented findings and opinions.  Just a wonderful book.  -----  Years ago I read a great deal of skeptical biblical scholarship that disappointed and offended  me.  Some of it came across as pompous, some of it snide, much of it unsound,  and a lot of it came across as fanciful and utterly uncontrolled, filled with alternative ""theories"" about Jesus, the gospels, the origins of Christianity, etc.  It really was some of the poorest scholarship I'd ever read in any field.  -----  But Ehrman's scholarship simply doesn't fall into that category.  He does not run rampant with wild speculation. He talks about the text, the text, always the text and what the text is telling us, and what kind of problems and questions  we face when -- say-- the text of Paul offers one point of view on the nature of Jesus and the text of the Fourth Gospel offers another.  But I'm just scratching the surface here with this example.  I'm trying to describe why I trust Ehrman on this topic, and why I look forward to his books, and why my personal experience as a reader with this book is so pleasurable.  Ehrman is an honest scholar, an ethical and careful scholar, and I recommend this book highly to everyone.  It has much to offer the believer and the skeptic, much to offer anyone who is obsessed with the mysteries surrounding Jesus Christ as I am.  It's a terrific book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6YW1OBA6RCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061778184#wasThisHelpful","RR6YW1OBA6RCK","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was reading the novel, ""Martin Eden"" that prompted me to come to this book. ""Eden"" was my first experience of London's prose, and I wanted to know all about the man who could create such a rich, sensuous and disturbing fictional portrait of the writer as hero.  Well, this extremely well written biography of London answered all my questions. I also found it entertaining.  It gave me a full and fair picture of  the author of ""Martin Eden,"" who, even more than his fictional creation, was indeed a writer who was a hero.  ----  I can't compare it to other biographies except to say that when I examined  a few, I found myself coming back to this one for intense study and I have not regretted the decision.  Haley provided plenty of context for the key people in London's life, and the key events.  And as so often happens with a good biography, this one taught me a lot about the period in which London came of age, became famous and eventually died.  In sum it gave me a deeper understanding of American history, of the conditions of the working class when London was struggling to earn ten cents an hour,  and of the literary world in which ""Call of the Wild"" was a huge career making event  and the darker haunting ""Martin Eden"" was not perceived as a success.  I come away from this book loving Jack London, loving his great appetite for life, his unbelievable personal stamina, his unending curiosity, and his beguiling combination of faith in himself and what I can only call enduring humility.  I want to read more of London's works.  I'll keep this book on my shelf.

"I came to this biography of George Eliot knowing almost nothing about her.  Recent study of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Louisa May Alcott (as well as on going study of the Bronte sisters and Dickens) led me to want to know something of this great writer. Well, I am enjoying this biography as if it were a novel.  Style is for me the circulatory system of any book; and here Hughes' style is marvelously readable and enjoyable and brilliantly insightful.  I will re-read the book after reading some of Eliot's novels.  The book gives a vivid picture not only of this giant of a woman and giant of a novelist but of the remarkable times in which she was born and came of age and the literary London in which she was such an enormously important  figure.  Frankly, the details of Eliot's life --- her agnosticism, her courage in having a long affair or  outlaw  marriage with a man who had a legal wife and children --- her deep dedication to moral principles and a great moral vision in her writing, all this dazzled me. I wonder who will eventually make a mini series of Eliot's remarkable life --- which might unfold in episodes as exciting as those of the BBC four part ""Daniel Deronda"" based on her novel.  As so many good biographies are, this one is a rich history of the times, filled with moving portraits of those who knew and were known by Eliot, of those who loved her and those whom she loved.  Immensely satisfying, and always entertaining.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QKO45K1U5U0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374161380#wasThisHelpful","R2QKO45K1U5U0Y","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have only praise for this exceptionally well written biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe.  It gave me a rich picture of Stowe, her writing, her family, and the remarkable period in America in which she lived and wrote.  What I loved best was the deep critical engagement with ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as a novel --- what it attempted, what it accomplished, what was revolutionary about it ---  and the similar profound discussion of Stowe's moral and theological struggle with Calvinism as it was preached and understood in her time.  For these critical discussions alone, I recommend the book; but there is infinitely more here.  Stowe lived and wrote for decades, and the book embraces her entire life and public career and the tumultuous years in America during which Stowe's writings influenced so many.  ---  The book is beautifully written, extremely readable, and very well documented.  Quite a treasure for the permanent library in my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WR28U3KH11E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195096398#wasThisHelpful","R2WR28U3KH11E6","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not recommend this book to everyone. Far from it.  However if you are interested, as I am, in Victorian flagellation erotica, and if you are not offended by its endless repetitions and fetishistic focus, and if you believe as I do that some erotica offers authentic glimpses into the human soul --- well, then you might find this interesting as I did.  How authentic is this really?  Was it written for the market? Or is it a deep personal confessional fantasy in which a writer somehow opens his soul?  I can't say.  But I can say it comes across to me personally as authentic, and I do trust that it provides profound insights into the workings of sado-masochistic imagination.  I have never reviewed anything quite like this before, but I have felt compelled to do it, finally.  Something this mysterious, this well written and this bizarre --- something this excessive --- has a purity which borders on poetry or art.  ----  Let me also add that the Birchgrove Press reprint of this book is of good quality.  ---  Is this effective erotica? Well, I would say for those who share the fantasy most certainly it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35R9IN4NHSRKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098709565X#wasThisHelpful","R35R9IN4NHSRKD","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It captures for me the very moments in a writer's life that interest me most.  I greatly admire the scholarship behind this, and the depth and sympathy with which this author explored the influence of Abigail on her brilliant and resourceful daughter.  There are lessons in Alcott's life for any aspiring writer, and for any creative person determined to fulfill his or her dreams.  This book also paints a vivid picture of the times in which Alcott lived, and the amazing society in which she and her family moved, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.

Also the discussion of Simeon Solomon, his family, his friendship with Swinburne, his remarkable paintings --- all of this I found extremely valuable. Lutz calls Solomon our first gay painter.

"This is a sensitive and exquisite remake of the timeless classic.  Certainly better in every respect than any earlier version that I've seen. Unlike some earlier versions, it is robust, deeply engaging and fully satisfying.  This movie delivers Louisa May Alcott's novel to new generations.  Roger Ebert was right when he praised the film as ""surprisingly sharp and intelligent.""  This is absolutely the case.  Winona Ryder's radiant and appealing portrayal of Jo is the very heart of the film, but all the cast is superb.  Susan Sarandon is flawless as the mother of the family; Kirsten Dunst is delightful as little Amy; Claire Danes gives a heartrending portrayal of Beth; but all the sisters are marvelously portrayed; Christian Bale as the neighbor Laurie is lovable and endearing; Eric Stolz is memorable as Laurie's tutor, and Gabriel Byrne is perfect, absolutely perfect,  in his role as the wise and gentle German professor Jo meets in New York, who becomes a a mentor and friend.  This is a wonderful film to watch during the holiday season.  If you've been disappointed in overly sweet Christmas films, take a chance on this one.  The production values are high throughout and even if you know nothing of Alcott or the novel, ""Little Women,"" this film may likely engage you and delight you.  I saw nothing in this film that would date it, though it is now almost twenty years old.  On the contrary, I think it's destined to be a classic.  DVDs would make great gifts for Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JMDDTDX5I9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008Y72OW8#wasThisHelpful","R5JMDDTDX5I9W","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I know this is film comes closest to the original books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but only in the first half.  It's a beautifully photographed film, well directed, and with an outstanding cast.  And it is very enjoyable.  Christopher Lambert is appealing as Tarzan, and the boy actors who play him growing up in the jungle are excellent.  The attempt to portray the apes as characters works well.  Ian Holm is marvelous in his role as an educated European who discovers Tarzan in the wild, and Sir Ralph Richardson is unforgettable as the grandfather(Lord Greystoke) whom Tarzan comes to meet in England.  Andie McDowell is appealing and lovely as Jane, though it is a tragedy that her voice was removed from the film and the voice of Glenn Close was dubbed instead.  In the novels, Jane is from Baltimore, and undoubtedly Andie McDowell's sensitive and tender voice would have been very effective.  That being said, the dubbing is very skilled; I doubt anyone who doesn't know the voice is being dubbed would even notice it.  I certainly didn't know the first time around.  And I didn't notice anything false about the dubbing a couple of nights ago when I watched the film again.  The second half of the movie involves an original story on the part of the movie people as to what happens to Tarzan on his return to England.  It's well done.  But it's not Burroughs.  And it's really not ""Tarzan of the Apes"" either.  ---  I recommend this film for Tarzan aficionados because of what it does attempt and achieve, and see no point on missing out on the fun of it due to what it doesn't attempt or achieve.  BUT some day I hope some one does attempt a great Tarzan movie truly based on the first two books of Edgar Rice Burroughs' series.  ----  In those books, Tarzan is a super hero, a man of the jungle with such strength, skill, cunning and intelligence  that he can adjust to any society --- including that of Europeans or Arabs, as well as the society of the apes in Africa and the natives in Africa.  In this age when there is so much attention to the super hero, and we have so many stunning films exploring super heroes with high productive values, we could really use a great ""Tarzan"" film.  I hope we get it.  I hope some one does for the franchise (?) what Kenneth Branagh did for Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ---  In the meantime, I like this film very much for what it does offer.  I admire its productive values, and its cast, and its cinematography.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31445GGEGSABM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00124L23W#wasThisHelpful","R31445GGEGSABM","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since Amazon has not moved the seven reviews originally appearing on the site of the hardcover, I'm re-doing a review here for this new edition:This two-volume work is one that I keep right on my desk every day, year in and year out, as I study Scripture. What astonishes me is the sheer scope of Keener's knowledge, and the clear and engaging way that he presents his conclusions. He treats the skeptics with the requisite generosity and patience to which I've become accustomed when reading the brilliant scholarship of a believer, and his knowledge of ancient Greek, Roman and Jewish writers is breath-taking. This and his work on Matthew are immense contributions to the field of New Testament Scholarship. I find all Keener's work to be accessible for mainstream people such as myself, who cannot read the ancient languages. The comprehensive nature of Keener's approach, the way he truly does explain just about every conceivable interpretation of a passage is simply amazing. I turn to him constantly for insight, and go back over material again and again discovering something new each time. Make this part of your library.I wrote the above in 2008.  It's now 2013.

"This is a small book, only about 161 pages long, and the writing is simple and straightforward. It is for Christians.

And for all I know there is one out there already.  But there is no doubt in my mind that this intense, focused effort here will effectively reach thousands who might well be put off by a larger in depth study.  ------  The field of NDE studies is growing all the time.  And books like this which seek to give a brief overview for a new audience are badly needed.  ---- In fact, it is amazing how much excellent bibliography is included here.  The author clearly knows the field. --- The book makes some radical moral claims, and no doubt some Christians will take exception to these claims. Others might welcome this as truly good news.  And  I applaud John W. Price for offering this radical information.  But for many Christians this will provide a bridge over which they may cross to enter into the truly amazing body of knowledge being accumulated from NDEs all over the world.  --- Obviously many Christians are already embracing the NDE and we are seeing more and more books about individual experiences from Christians, Catholics and Mormons.

"This is an excellent book for anyone new to NDE research and reading.  It provides an eloquent and very easy to understand guide to the history of NDE research, the major books in the field, and the many sources of anecdotal evidence about NDEs.  ----- The book is beautifully organized to make all aspects of the NDE phenomenon accessible.  And for anyone who has had an NDE and been unable to confide about it, this may be quite a gift.  ---- I've been following the field for years, fascinated by the classic accounts by Howard Storm and George Ritchie, and  intrigued by the seminal studies of Moody, Rawlings, Sabom, Morse etc. and the more recent books by Chris Cox and Jeffrey Long and others.  ---- And I know from painful experience that one of the difficult things for those interested in this field is the contemptuous dismissal of NDEs by those who know almost nothing about them.  Trying to talk to a ""skeptic"" who has not done the research is not only frustrating but usually pointless.  Trying to avoid a ""skeptic"" while discussing NDEs with others can be maddening and sometimes impossible.  A book like this explains well why none of the so called ""scientific"" or ""biological"" explanations for the NDE can really adequately explain away the data.  --- And of course there is a marvelous discussion here of the PATTERNS that emerge from NDE reporting worldwide and this is the very heart of the whole enterprise for many of us. The patterns.  We're intrigued by these patterns, by their undeniable recurrence and by what they might mean about us as humans and about the possibility of an afterlife. ------  I recommend the book wholeheartedly.  ----  Again, if you're new to this field, this is a perfect introduction.

"Tatha Wiley does a wonderful job in this book of describing the origins of the doctrine of Original Sin and the problems faced by theologians today with the earlier ideas of Augustine and Aquinas, etc.  I greatly value the entire book and especially the discussion of Bernard Lonergan's theology.  This is obviously a faith affirming and orthodox endeavor.  --------  However ----- My subjective  response which may be of little or no value to anyone is this ---  There was no Original Sin; there was no Fall; and we are not born alienated from God in any way.  We don't need magical rituals to ""restore"" anything that was lost.  ---The biblical texts used to support these ideas cannot bear the weight of the theology built on them. .  Not at all.  ----  And there is no real biblical source of a revelation about Fallen Angels, the Devil etc.  This ideas aren't good ideas. ------ We are moving forward morally in a biological world that is unfolding in time.  And as Teilhard de Chardin indicated, evil is inevitable in any biological world unfolding in time (not his exact words.)  ---- And only when we cast aside the doctrine of Original Sin and the Fall, and all magical thinking about sanctifying grace and such, will we be able to really address the moral challenges we face.  -----  Obviously many  Christians and Catholics are unable to do this.  They simply can't.  They can't abandon a doctrine affirmed by the Reformers, or by the Council of Trent. So books like this struggle with an immense burden.  They are trying to move forward, but they carry all sorts of cumbersome baggage with them.  Such is the nature of writing Catholic and Christian theology, I presume.  It is a highly conservative enterprise in which you ""conserve"" as much as you can as you inch towards something new.  ----- But sooner or later theologians, I feel, are going to have to cut this baggage loose.  -----  They're going to have to accept full responsibility for what they are actually saying in many books today ---- that the old ideas are no longer useful at all.  ----- I would like to add that the entire Christian Belief System as we know it today is founded on these old and bad ideas.  And I respect the gravity and scope of the problem.  But surely this can and will change.  Affirming one's love of God, one's devotion to Christ and His example and His teachings,  one's consuming desire to live a good and moral and loving and constructive life ---- all this must be possible without the idea of Original Sin, and the Fall, and the need for magical grace.  -----  Anyway, for some one struggling with all this, the book is superb and let me affirm again, that it is orthodox.  It does not reflect my radical views here. Not at all.  ----  But I am looking for the theologian who will say outright: all this old stuff is bad and it has to go.  If I have offended anyone here, I ask for their patience and forgiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TEHBJ39W5ZFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809141280#wasThisHelpful","R3TEHBJ39W5ZFU","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sad to see that this book is apparently out of print and only used copies are available and at a high price.  I did pay the price for a used hardcover and have read this book with keen interest and inevitable sorrow.  I recommend it to anyone interested in the Catholic Child Abuse scandal.  ----  The book contains many first person accounts of boy and girl victims of cruelty and neglect; and is very well written and comprehensive as it addresses all aspects of the scandal including the shocking indifference of government authorities to the complaints they received about the suffering of the child victims.  -----  I recommend in particular the description in the book of  the great American hero, Fr. Flanagan (founder of Boys Town and famously portrayed in the movie by Spencer Tracy) who was deeply critical of the cruel treatment of children in Ireland's Industrial Schools, and hoped to do a lot to help the Irish  children -- when he died of a heart attack at only 61 years of age.  ---- --- So many questions remain to be answered:  in particular, how did religious orders in charge of these children and women develop such cultures of cruelty? ---  Survivors of these ghastly institutions and the general public deserve explanations and answers.  ---- And surely historians will be studying this period of Ireland's history for decades to come, trying to determine the fuller ramifications for the horrors chronicled here.

"I recommend this book.  I think it needs to be read.  I hope people will read it and review it, and spread the word about it.  ------  This is one of many books on the horrors of life in Ireland's industrial schools.  But what makes this account so compelling is that it is a straightforward and detailed account of one boy's memories of what he suffered at the hands of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in one of the notorious  of these institutions. --- St. Joseph's in the town of Glin.  ----- In the 1950s, while Americans in this country were going to malt shops, dancing to rock and roll and crowding into Elvis concerts, this boy, Ben Franklin and his younger brother were being subjected to conditions in Ireland that would have made Charles Dickens roar in anguish.  ---- The beatings were merciless, humiliating and downright vicious; the sexual abuse was insidious and inescapable;  and no less horrifying was the utter filth in which these boys were forced to live, wearing unwashed clothes day in and day out that inevitably stank of urine and dried feces, as they were bullied by the Christian Brothers who totally controlled their lives and answered to no one for what they did to their charges.  These children were also starved.  They were perpetually hungry in an age when food ought to have been plentiful and in fact was.  Their bodies, their minds and their souls were utterly neglected.  Often they were not even educated but made to work like slaves. ------  I have read many accounts now of cruelty and abuse in the Irish industrial schools.  And again and again, the victims ask what Benjamin Franklin asks in this book.  How did this happen? Why did these people treat children this way? ---- Thousands of survivors of this unspeakable abuse are living today with memories of this unconscionable treatment and they need answers. How could this happen in a Catholic country? How could religious people do these things? --- How could the government ignore complaints? --- The survivors deserve answers.  ---- But there are millions of us out here who demand answers too.  ---  How did the culture of cruelty develop within the Christian Brothers (and the Sisters of Mercy and other orders) in Ireland? What sort of people lived in these institutions where to beat and kick and punch a child was totally acceptable behavior?  Why did these people do this to their helpless charges? What was the idea behind the hell they made for those under their care? ---- And make no mistake, other accounts indicate all these things happened to girls as well.  ------  The Catholic Sexual Abuse scandal will never be over until the public receives more information as to how those in charge created and perpetuated these systems.  ----- We need interviews with the surviving nuns and brothers as to ""what they were thinking"" when they supported and enforced these systems.  And there is nothing to be gained by ignoring all this, by keeping silent about it, by pretending ""it's all past.""  It is not all past.  It is something that begs for exploration, study, thorough investigation on all levels ---- so that it will never, never be allowed to happen again.  ------------ Be aware the book is inexpensively published.  And there are gaps in spacing on some pages.  ---  But this is an important book.  This is a book that should not be ignored.  Read it, pass it on, talk about it.

"I've been searching for this kind of book for years.  I read almost all of it in one sitting, enthralled by the unfolding story of the invention of gaslight and electric light, and marveling at the wonderful details about how Europeans and Americans responded to these totally revolutionary inventions, and how both helped to transform the world in which we live.  I hadn't realized gaslight was invented largely to light factories, that it was an immediate product of the industrial revolution in England on the most basic level, or that its ""heyday"" (1850-1870) in the cities of the world was so short.  The details about arc lamps and attempts to illuminate cities from high towers also surprised me.  But the book also contains a wealth of information about the use of light earlier ---  how well to do people only used candles up to 1800, for example, and how oil lamps developed afterwards,etc.  The descriptions of early shopping streets starting  in the 1700's and how they used light, mirrors and eventually (by 1850)plate glass to display their wares were enthralling.  ---- The in depth discussions of the psychology of light also fascinated me --- how people respond to flickering flames, how an oil lamp became the focal point of a family gathering much as the primitive hearth had once been the focal point; how people clung to candles and oil lamps in drawing rooms even when they had gaslight in other parts of the house, etc.  ---- But I cannot do justice to the richness of this book by listing these things here.  This is a brilliant study of people and light on many different levels, and beautifully written and engaging from start to finish.  Highly recommended.

"This book arrived today and I spent several hours with it, reading, underlining, making notes.  It's well written, well reasoned and very well documented. I'll be studying it for quite some time.  ------  I will be purchasing copies of this book for some Catholic friends.  ------  This is exactly the kind of deep exploration of Catholic beliefs that I welcome with all my heart.  I welcome the effort here of a scholar to go back to the biblical passages upon which a seemingly crucial belief is supposedly based, and examine those passages carefully, moving on then to the Didache, and to the work of the Church Fathers who supposedly influenced the evolution of the belief.  (I myself in my own unscholarly and amateur way feel drawn to do this.  And long ago, I searched my New Testament diligently to try to find a justification for an anointed all male Catholic priesthood and I could find none. )  ---  This book goes much deeper than I could ever go into the concept  of the Eucharist and the concept of Transubstantiation, and into Atonement theory,  and into many other related vitally important theological matters as well.  The scope is immense.  The implications of Wills' questions are immense.  I found the discussion and the documentation to be a great gift.  ---  I wish I were able to describe in greater theological detail why I find this so valuable.  For me this is fresh air.  This is bright light.  The 2,000 year old complex and multi-layered Catholic Belief System needs this.  This is an honest and timely and illuminating pursuit of truth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGYJ8RYW0CMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670024872#wasThisHelpful","R2EGYJ8RYW0CMT","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled on this book several days back after watching Ann Todd in the marvelous black and white classic film, ""The Seventh Veil.""  This powerful romantic film had had a strong influence on me when I was young.  I was inspired by the world it revealed (of European art and refinement)  in which the heroine, a concert pianist, is dominated and cherished by her mysterious and sometimes cruel Cousin Nicholas (played by James Mason) who trains her to be a great musician while at the same time denying her evidence of his love.  ----  I expected this book to be of passing interest, but found myself reading it page by page right through to the end.  It is a simply marvelous story, unfolding with restraint and elegance the story of a remarkable life in the arts.  Ann Todd acted not only in films, but with the Old Vic in England, and in many many plays.  She met and made friends with many fascinating people --- second husband David Lean, and actress Ingrid Bergman to name but two- and she went on to become a maker of documentary films, traveling the world in search of beautiful and exotic subject matter and inspiration.  I was sad when the book came to a close, but deeply touched by the writing, by the author's humble reflections on the meaning of life, on her many spiritual experiences as well as her travels.  Just a beautiful book really.  I'm thankful there are many used copies out there, and I hope somehow this book is taken up again, reprinted as an attractive paperback and made available to a new audience.  There is much here to interest many.  Now I must go in search of Miss Todd's documentary films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5H9GS2I7DQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399126627#wasThisHelpful","R2E5H9GS2I7DQR","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very readable and excellent study of the Gospel of John in relationship to the Gospel of Mark and also in relationship to Matthew and Luke.  Just about an believer and any biblical scholar might benefit from reading this book. It's not surprising that some find the book deeply disturbing.  I suspect the book is going to upset ""born again"" Christians in particular, especially the sort who post so often in the Amazon Christianity Forum arguing for the ""born again"" approach while they insist they are not religious and not Protestant, and that their ""born again"" approach to Jesus is the only valid one.  But a book like this might shed considerable light on the development of their particular brand of belief, and a brand it is. ---- I welcome more studies of the gospels like this one, studies which delve into the distinct possibility that gospels writers might have been  responding to one another when they wrote their individual gospels.( I've always thought that the authors of Luke and John were in active dialogue and argument with one another; but I am not a biblical scholar and cannot write a book long treatment on the subject. )  The writing here is careful and clear and the research is excellent.  A good work of biblical scholarship, and a highly accessible one.  And like any good book of biblical scholarship, the book draws you deeply into the biblical texts and you come away with new insights, whether you agree with the author or not.

"To say that this book is important is an understatement.  Sadly, too many today don't know that there are in fact thousands and thousands of gay Christians, and many churches in which gays are welcomed, and where gay clergy are welcomed, and where same sex marriage can be celebrated.  In spite of tremendous hostility and prejudice on the part of some Christians, gay Christians are not about to give up on their faith in their God or their faith in their churches.  Gene Robinson made history when he became the first gay bishop appointed by the Episcopal Church in America, and in this gentle, and beautifully written book he makes the case for the Christian acceptance of Same Sex Marriage, in the name of love.  Very well worth reading.  This is an excellent book to give as a gift to gay Christians who may be struggling in hostile communities,  and to Christian parents of gay children who are not finding support in their churches.  ---- It is my opinion that gays are winning the battle for acceptance in America on all levels,  and soon the persecution they are suffering now will be a thing of the past.

"Books like this have to be beautifully written. If they weren't, I doubt anyone would read them.  What the book offers is an interpretative overview of history that is well documented and makes for compelling reading.  There is a wealth of material here and great bibliography.  A book like this prompts us to put in coherent form what we know about thousands and thousands of years of history.  And I think our minds long for this coherence, long to make sense of the tons of data we have accumulated in modern times about our past,  and the wilderness of specialized studies published every day that are too numerous for any one reader to ever fully examine. ---  I found this highly readable and entertaining, an excellent book for the scholar and a delight for the mainstream reader who loves history and has wondered about many mysterious cultural developments and whether they are at all related.

"I recommend this book highly.It's true that no one can prove whether or not Paul was a Pharisee, and onecannot prove which parts of the gospels were written early and which added later,and which parts are honest reportage and which passages might have been added laterto make a point.  But a lot of skeptical and speculative biblical scholarship involves these sameproblems, yet brilliant contributions are made by such scholars.And really none of the author's speculation or conclusions in speculative matters undercut his basic theories: that Paul is the inventor of Christianity, and that he did it by fusing three different kinds of belief: gnosticism, Jewish belief, and pagan mystery religion belief.Frankly, I think Maccoby's explanation of Paul --- his explanation for the absurdities and contradictionsin Paul, and for the sum of Paul's assertions --- is best I've ever read.I admit for me the Christian belief system does not work.  I pursued it for 12 earnest years (I also grew upCatholic)during which time I devoted myself to faith based biblical scholarship, devouring the works of many great scholars.But in the end it all fell apart for me; and no small part of it was that I could not make sense of the O.T. and N.T. together.  The assertions by Paul in the N.T. simply were not supported by the O.T. --- and the supercessionist theology,  and supercessionist cliches I confronted from Christians,, apparently built up on the basis of Paul, were not supported at all by the O.T.I left the belief system confused, disappointed and disillusioned. And for quite some time I've ponderedquestions like ""How could Paul just throw out God's law from Sinai?""  or ""How can anyone say that the O.T.and the N.T. together are inerrant when Paul throws out the law of God Himself?""  Well, this book by Maccobyaddresses this issues in the best and most complete way I've seen to date.  --- It confirms me in my conclusions thatthe Christian Belief System is founded on falsehoods, contradictions, and absurdities.  But it goes much further than Icould on my own in explaining how this might have come about.I recommend this book highly --- very highly.  I hope that it is not out of print now, and that if it is, that it willvery soon be reprinted.  The scholarship here is excellent; the writing is clear; and the book is profoundly illuminating.I do not agree with every single assertion or conclusion of Maccoby, but the book overall is a mighty achievement.  It is tremendous in scope as it addresses the birth of a religion and the problems inherent in that religion. It's concluding chapter alone is worth the price of a copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HY2VDU6UEV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0760707871#wasThisHelpful","R36HY2VDU6UEV7","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid, substantive, and beautifully written book on the topic, which seeks to separate out what we can reliably infer about ancient times from archaeological evidence, as opposed to what we might learn from fanciful and speculative material written about ancient times.  We are also asked to take a hard look at early literary source material about ancient religions, with a view to understanding the complex context in which many such sources developed, and the inevitable pressure of social bias on the writers or historians.  ---  Frankly, after years, of reading Sir James Fraser with great relish and drawing tremendous inspiration from The Golden Bough, I welcome this solid study that discusses what has and has not been ""proved"" about ancient religion and customs by solid archaeological findings.  I welcome the careful critical evaluation of  early Christian writings about pagan beliefs and customs.  ---- This book doesn't diminish the value of The Golden Bough or speculative and intuitive writings about mythology and what mythology can teach us about ourselves.  It underscores a different emphasis.  I really want to know what can be known about ancient religion.  And so for me this is a breath of fresh air.  Will I throw out Robert Graves' The White Goddess or Frazer's The Golden Bough? Certainly not.  I will continue to value them for the genius connections that can be made by the intuitive mind, and I will continue to weigh their conclusions and insights against meticulous scholarship like that of Ronald Hutton.  -----  Lastly, I want to the praise the writing skills of this author.  His text is organized, well reasoned and beautifully laid out, which makes this a scholarly approach that can be accessed and enjoyed by readers of all levels.  And make no mistake, the book is enjoyable.

"Yes, we all know him and love him for Sherlock Holmes.  But Doyle published a great deal of other fiction, including brilliant historical novels, and tales of the supernatural which have inspired film and fiction since his day.  This collection aptly titled Tales of Unease provides an excellent introduction to Doyle's speculative short stories and will reward any lover of Victorian fictional prose with treasures a plenty.  ""The Ring of Thoth"" is a marvelous tale and so is ""Lot No. 249"" and both inspired me personally in the writing of my own novel, The Mummy or Ramses the Damned.  I find in all Doyle's  work the same rich vocabulary and vivid descriptions I savor in so many 19th Century English writers, but what distinguishes Doyle's work is his great love of action, of pounding narrative full of high incident as well as unforgettable characters and images --- which is why, undoubtedly, Doyle's work has inspired so many films.  Again, this little volume functions as an introduction.  There is a great deal more, much more, of Doyle to be re-discovered, studied, enjoyed.

"The prose of Amelia Edwards is often on a level with Charles Dickens, so much so in fact, that for years many of her supernatural stories, published anonymously in Victorian periodicals were thought to be his work.  She writes with such sensitivity, such vision, and such an immediacy that she ranks as one of the finest writers of the period.  Loving ghost stories as I do, I put her in company with the great Sheridan La Fanu, M.R. James and Algernon Blackwood.  Her descriptions are breathtaking, the moods she creates are engulfing, and her voice convinces you that she is the man so often telling the story in her tales.  Highly recommended.

"The more I read about the abuse of teenagers in the ""troubled teen industry,"" the more worried I become.  This book strikes me as solidly researched and solidly written; and I look forward to new books on this topic.  Clearly many abusive corrective schools, both religious and secular, still exist in this country, and in others.  And teens sent to some of these places continue to be at risk for cruelty and deep psychological damage.  It is frightening to think that young people can be subjected to isolation, starvation, unproven and destructive psychological techniques, and even physical beatings and torture in these institutions.  It is frightening to see that well meaning parents may be deceived into sending their kids to these hellish institutions by deceptive advertising, staff and supportive authority figures; and that often money is involved, the parents paying huge sums for a corrective ""education"" that may not be an education at all.  My heart goes out to the teenage victims.  What can we do, other than  spread the word,and encourage more and more scrutiny by the media and the public? I don't know.

"I found this show to be much better than most cop shows offered on television, and I am a fan of cop shows, without doubt.  Poppy Montgomery was terrific as the ""star,"" a detective who can remember almost everything that has ever happened to her. For me, she showed greater range in her acting than she had on Without A Trace where she'd never been given the opportunities that she had here.  She was certainly strong enough to carry the show. The scenes in which she travels back mentally to review a scene, tapping into her infallible memory for detail, were always enthralling.  However the  supporting cast was exceptionally good as well; and the writing was fresh and unusual.  I couldn't predict where the stories were going and I found the resolutions satisfying.  I became more and more interested in the supporting cast, as well as the star.  I was very disappointed when CBS cancelled this show.

"The new golden age of television continues with this absolutely spectacular HBO series, based on the brilliant writing of George R.R. Martin.  You cannot help but be drawn into the bleak, yet richly colorful world of these fantasy/medieval style characters when the writing is this good and the actors so unforgettable.  The sets are often exquisitely beautiful, and the costumes dazzling.  At times the whole looks like pre-Raphaelite painting. ----  Having not read the books, I was now and then  confused as to who is who.

And one has the feeling, no matter how fantastic the kingdoms and their warring monarchs, that one is delving into our history and our evolution as a moral species.  Speculative fiction at its best --- which this most certainly is ---  is always about us and always about us now as well as ""long ago.""

"We are in a new golden age of television today, a time rich in historical, science fiction, speculative and fantasy drama.  And this series, Pillars of the Earth, is a perfect example of the fine fare being offered to us now regularly. Right up there in production values with The Tudors,  this is a fast paced and suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining drama. It is leagues beyond the older slow moving and often poorly conceived historical dramas of yesterday's television.  Beautifully written by John Pielmeier, and lavishly filmed with excellent cinematography and art direction, this series carries one back to the great age of cathedral building --- inviting us to surrender to  a brutal yet fascinating world where good fights against evil in spite of endless defeat.  Matthew MacFadyen is superb in this, as is Rufus Sewell, Donald Sutherland and Ian MaShane and just about every other member of the large cast.  This is dark, yet always fun, and the glimpse we get into the making of cathedrals is tantalizing and enthralling.  Highly  recommended.  If you've given up on historical series in the past because of the poor quality, by all means give this a try.  As I said above, we are in a new golden age of television now.

"When confronted with this beautiful and brilliantly conceived  series, one has to confess that neither historical accuracy or the limitations of television much matter.  The brilliant Neil Jordan who created, wrote and directed these episodes has made this his own rich and meaningful and unforgettable material.  You don't go to Shakespeare's Hamlet or his Macbeth or his King Lear  to learn history;  you go to them to be with Shakespeare in his world and see how he uses history to construct his universe.  Well, that is what is happening here.  Jordan has made The Borgias his own mad universe in which he can talk about good and evil, humanity and cruelty as he wants to do it, and his dialogue and staging and vision is what matters.  I find the series (I have now seen all of season two which will soon be released on DVD if it isn't already) horrifying and mesmerizing. I cannot look away from it though it drags me to places I don't want to go.  And I sense without even thinking about it that this is like no other programming on television at this time.  It is so extreme, so fully realized, so uncompromising, and so intelligent  that it is in a class by itself.  Of course the actors and actresses are superb.  The cinematography and art direction surpass anything I've seen on the small screen; and the entire look of the series is Renaissance in its colors and proportions.  It is entertaining?  I honestly don't know. When something is this riveting and contains this much cruelty I don't know if it's entertaining.

"If any film comes close to topping The Innocents with Deborah Kerr, as the ultimate haunted house film, it is this mastery film with its fascinating and original ""take"" on the haunted house genre.  Nicole Kidman gives a genius performance as the woman at the center of the mystery here, and her two children, a boy and a girl, are perfectly cast.  The other cast members are remarkable;  and every single person in this film looks extraordinary, and their behavior is carefully choreographed to be tantalizing and ultimately frightening.  The old house itself is magnificent, both inside and out.  But the true genius of the film is the original twists and revelations it brings to the genre. The ending is profoundly satisfying, making sense of the many chilling scenes throughout.  And make no mistake, there are chilling scenes here of such subtle horror that they take your breath away.  If you have not seen this, I would say most definitely see it.  it is my opinion that this film did not get the accolades it should have gotten when it was released.  But surely its fame is growing among those of us out here who treasure this kind of beautiful work in the genre.  This has to be on its way to classic status.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTWFETLFIF5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058ZPNUE#wasThisHelpful","R1LTWFETLFIF5X","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I studied Henry James' ""Turn of the Screw"" in college, and I saw this superb and unforgettable film when it was made, and have watched it many times since.  It is brilliantly faithful to James' novella.  It has never been topped at the ultimate haunted house film in which the horror is beautifully sustained with masterly cinematography  and flawless responses on the part of the governess who sees the ghosts and is terrified for the fate of the two children in her charge.  It just doesn't get much better than this.  The old dark house is engulfing and beautiful; its spaces are perfect backdrops for its four lonely and vulnerable occupants; the grounds are as haunted and forlorn as the structure itself.  And two of the scariest ghost scenes take place outdoors in broad daylight.  What drives the film of course is the governness, and her extraordinary bravery (if that is what it is) as she confront the horrors she is seeing and their threat to the boy and girl in her charge.  Is she mad? Or are there two powerful spirits seeking to commune with each other through the hapless children?  ---- James himself would never reveal whether this was a story about psychological breakdown or an actual haunting.  One dead give away, that it is about madness, for me, is that there is no good reason for the ghosts --- if they are ghosts --- to be revealing themselves to the governess.  But then again, perhaps they cannot help it or have an agenda involving her that I have not understood.  ----- But for me, this film and the novella itself work best as classic ghost material.  ----  There is not only terror here --- which is so common today in such movies --- but true horror.  And I recommend this to anyone who wants to be royally entertained by all the classic elements we expect from English ghost stories.  Deborah Kerr gave a magnificent performance in this; the supporting cast is perfect; and the children exceptional.  This will be around as long as movies are around.  It is indeed a masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MVMFOAJYJF7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009X75EC#wasThisHelpful","R2MVMFOAJYJF7S","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to believe this film was made in 1996 as it seems absolutely contemporary and, I suppose, timeless.  --- The cast is exceptional, the script flawless and the pacing something of a miracle.  Essentially it is about death and illness being an integral and inescapable part of life, and what love can achieve for us when we approach tragedy and loss with love.  Meryl Streep is a marvel at the unloving sister who has chosen selfishness rather than love; and Leonardo de Caprio gives his usual top quality performance as a child who has learned to trust no one.  Diane Keaton, for my money, does the heavy lifting as the one who knows how to love, but is fully human at the same time, vulnerable to fear, vulnerable to panic, vulnerable to emotional and physical exhaustion.  ---- The humor in the film works wonderfully, and I wonder if the film wouldn't have been unbearable without the humor, because it so accurately depicts the horrific burdens life can put upon us, and the crippling effects that illness can have on anyone of us at any time.  Ultimately the film uplifts, reassures and essentially shows the wisdom of love and that altruism isn't just a virtue that some enjoy when they can afford to enjoy it, but rather a very valuable coping mechanism for everyone.  Life is better, this film says, for those who know how to love, and for that reason it is a practical virtue as well as a beautiful one.  The film looks beautiful, the camera never being cynical about the small house in which the drama takes place, but revealing instead the coziness of the dwelling and the vibrant personalities in it.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7C18JPXHY5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SUDPXM#wasThisHelpful","RE7C18JPXHY5I","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I hope we get more books like this from members of Sister Teresa's order.  And well written stories of the personal spiritual quest, whether from nuns or lay persons, Protestants or Catholics, atheists or agnostics, often teach us a great deal.

"When I was new to Amazon several years ago, I reviewed this book (below) anonymously.  Well, I no longer have the means to edit that review, but I can copy the contents here:  This is a startling book, and well worth a detailed read. If Trobisch is right in his conclusions about an early edition of the New and Old Testament, we have much to investigate in this new light. I was persuaded by his carefully reasoned and extremely well documented arguments. And I find the material intensely exciting. What more can Trobisch point out to us, using only the text of scripture itself as he has done here? I can't wait to see response from the academic community to this excellent and compelling work. Anne Rice, New Orleans, La.Let me add now, years later, that this book had an incredible impact on me.  I tend to think that Trobisch's idea: that theNew Testament as we have it was an ""edition"", carefully edited and compiled and distributed with the thought of unitingthe early Christians makes an enormous amount of sense.  His scholarship is simply excellent. He's using internal evidence andexternal evidence. He's consulted the manuscript evidence; he's knowledgeable about the nomina sacra and other stylistic elements,and his thoughts on N.T. identifies its own authors are very thought provoking. I'm mightily impressed with this book.  I'm surprised that it did not get a great deal more attention in biblical studies.Maybe it will yet be re-discovered.  Or maybe it's better known than I think.  Anyway, I think it's a power book with powerful insights.It might be unsettling to some to have to see the N.T. in this light; but this author has laid out the reasons for his conclusions herein persuasive and responsible terms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1USZRXA4KFHBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195112407#wasThisHelpful","R1USZRXA4KFHBE","AB4F6UHL20U95","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB4F6UHL20U95?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm in the midst of reading this book  and looking over and reading the author's other two books.  I'm amazed at how eloquent, accessible and insightful this author is.  And he puts forth his priceless observations in a gentle manner, which really shouldn't offend religious sensibilities at all.  Just about anyone might benefit enormously from reading this book.  It seems to me that it is vitally important for people to study and come to understand something of the evolution of religion, something of the evolution of religious and theological ideas.  No matter what you believe or don't believe, it can help to know something of how religious history developed.  --- Right now, religion is a divisive issue in American politics.

While the Mophie has a little bit larger capacity, I think the Skiva is a better product. The rubberized feel of the Skiva EnergySkin is good for grip, where my gold Mophie is far to smooth and slippery. The slimmer profile of the Skiva is easy in the pocket and more manageable in the hand than the Mophie as well. Also, the Mophie requires a special adapter for the earpiece where the Skiva does not.

"The commentaries published by the Kregel Exegetical Library continue to impress me. The Commentary on Exodus by Duane A. Garrett is another strong volume in the Old Testament Series.One of the many things that I particularly like about this series is there are no compromises where scholastic excellence is involved. The volumes in this commentary series are the pinnacle of academic excellence in my opinion. This can be an intimidating attribute for some, but I would say there is no reason for intimidation. In addition to academic excellence, the commentary is among the most readable that I have experienced. I am not a language or textual criticism expert and I still find the writing conversational and understandable. The marriage of readability and scholasticism is what moves me to rank this series so highly.Duane Garrett has done an exceptional job with research and exposition of the Exodus narrative. Beginning with an incredibly comprehensive introduction addressing geography, archeology, Egyptian dynasties, socio-political circumstance, textual criticism and so much more, Garrett lays a solid foundation from which he works the major themes in his Commentary on Exodus.No matter what commentary or commentaries you may have in your  library for this key book from the Old Testament Scriptures, Kregels Commentary on Exodus by Duane Garrett is a worthy addition and compliment to your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29U0OL9MX6F5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825425514#wasThisHelpful","R29U0OL9MX6F5K","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have appreciated the communication skills of Andy Stanley for years. Personally, I think he is one of the great communicators and teachers of our day. I have often marveled at his ability to repackage timeless teaching and contemporize it for the present audience. Enemies of the Heart is another sterling example of this gift that Stanley has.While Enemies of the heart touts Four Emotions That Control You, the primary teachings that it draws from seems to come from Evagrius and Pope Gregorys teaching on the Eight/Seven deadly sins. Stanley addresses four major challenges to the Christian life (five if you count lust from the final chapters in part four), guilt, anger, greed, and jealousy. The original Deadly Sins codified by Evagrius and Gregory the Great follows: Lust, Gluttony or waste and over indulgence, Avarice or Greed, Sloth or Apathy, Wrath or Anger, Envy or Jealousy, and Pride or vanity and narcissism. The teachings of the ancient fathers of the church stated that guilt was the result of culpability to these major sins. I think you can see the parallel of Stanleys premise from Enemies of the Heart and this ancient treatise on the sins of man.In part three, Stanley addresses the sins by offering counter disciplines and attitudes to change the behavior of the persons plagued by guilt, anger, greed, jealousy, and lust.  This is not unlike the disciplines introduced by the church fathers to similarly deal with the issues of these core sins. They offered the following pursuits to eradicate the deadly sins: chastity to overcome lust, moderation to control gluttony, charity to counter greed, diligence to abate sloth, patience to smother anger, kindness to temper envy, and humility to sate pride.I am thankful for people like Andy Stanley who can repackage classic teaching and help to expand the audience of such. This is a great introduction to the issues of sin and classic spiritual formation. Those who would like to delve deeper might consider the writings of the Philokalia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4POP41TH12FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601421451#wasThisHelpful","R4POP41TH12FM","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are solid headphones, most definitely not in the realm of the better ranking for sound and comfort, but they are good.The first thing to remember, at least I told myself to remain objective, is that these are gaming headphones. This means they should not be judged by the most discriminating audiophile for top sound quality against the most sensitive and dynamic of headphones. I had to remind myself of this on several occasions...these are gaming headphones and they are designed for different purposes.Next, with consideration to form and function, these are a bit cumbersome. They feel clunky, heavy, and bit awkward on my head and around my ears. Having had a taste for better fitting and more comfortable headsets, these have been difficult for me to get used to. They do have some nice features, the inline volume adjustment is nice and I love the detachable mic.Finally, my thoughts on the sound quality, are a mixed bag. I've not tested the full dynamic range of these headphones and I'm not sure I've gotten an accurate depiction of 5.1 or 7.1 sound just yet, but what I've experienced is promising. With a flat EQ, I think the headphones are slightly heavy in the mids and bass response. There also seems to be a bit of chorus or delay effect built into the sound reproduction...not too much, but a little. I think this is helpful for music listening, but with voice reproduction, it sounds a little echoey...All in, these are a decent consideration as gaming headsets go. If music is your primary reason for searching headsets and you landed here, I would move along. If you think your headphones should pull double duty, then these are a cost effective option and worthy consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWLD8QUEXLH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01133CPMI#wasThisHelpful","R1HWLD8QUEXLH2","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I conducted a couple small tests, and even with very fair skin and light hair density, it took several treatments for the hair reduction to be noticed, but the results were satisfactory.As a previous commentor/reviewer stated, it is important to shave down the existing hair for the most pleasant results and best experience.

"I've been taking Curcumin supplements for awhile now and these are a smaller dosage than what I am used to taking (former 1000 mg vs 500mg). Like my last supply, I have not found these irritating to my stomach or causing me any IBS issues. I do take them after a breakfast meal. While I  take them in conjunction with a Glucosamine Chondroitin supplement, it is difficult to determine if my minimal joint pain (I suffer from gouty arthritis) is related to one or the other products...or if it might be a combination of the two.I have only been taking this brand for a few days now and I feel no difference in the results from my last brand. I can say the 500mg capsules are easier to swallow, but the increase in dosage makes this product pale in comparison for value with the last supplement that was packaged in the same quantity, but in 1000mg dosage.

"Beautiful screen and plenty of Ooomph with the Intel i3 chip and 4GB of RAM. All this for a ""Cloud""book is more than enough and then some.

I've not had to time to fully investigate the best way to approach this challenge, but I have a couple options I wish to explore. Option one is to replace the current SSD with a larger drive. Option two, involves a less permanent solution of utilizing the USB 3 and external SSD or the SD CF option for a boot partition. We shall see how this experiment works.

"Corel Painter is an outstanding software program. Truly, the capacity of this ""painting"" software is only limited to the skillset and creativity of the person using it. I have used various iterations and versions of Painter through the years and continue to be impressed with the advancements and capabilities the new developments bring.Do not be deceived or misled, this is very powerful software and the learning curve can be steep. Yes, basic applications and functionality can be realized with a few clicks and drags, but tutorials and use exercises will be the path to full enjoyment of Painter. Likewise, while a mouse can be used, the best use will be a stylus and pad like the Wacom line of tools. In this new 2016 version there are a number of new features and brushes. At this juncture of my introduction to them, I cannot honestly describe a real world application for them, but I'm sure this is where creativity of application reigns. I will look forward to seeing some of the work produced with these new brush sets and have my own creativity inspired.The usage of this software and the art work that can be produced is limitless with Corel's Painter. If you don't believe my words, check out some of the online galleries and see for yourself. I hope I can realize even a tenth of the potential of this software and I'll be creating gallery quality work. Why then only four stars??? I rank it four because I really think using a mouse to interface with the software is a significant limitation.

"This is truly an all-in-one body (hair) groomer. I've owned a few sets of clippers, trimmers, and ""groomers,"" but this setup by Panasonic is in an entirely different league. I think one thing that really appeals to me is the approach to the comb attachment. Each comb attachment is designed for a specific application and the depth of the cut is facilitated with a micro-adjustment wheel (up to 39 settings) on the groomer itself. No more fumbling through my bag of ""blade guards"" to find the right guard for the depth of cut I desire!Another great feature is the detachable blade (for a good deep clean). It simply snaps off and snaps right back on. No more screws to remove for blade cleaning or replacement! Oh, and it is also able to be cleaned under running water.The groomer comes with three specific grooming attachments (body hair, beard, and head). A charger, cloth carry case, and smaller container of lubricating oil make up the kit.

"Pretty sweet little setup with the starter kit...and you'll have ""fun, fun, fun till grandpa takes the Groundshock away."" I grew up with slot cars and the problems inherent with that design (cars slipping out of the slots, flying off the tracks in turns, bad electric connections in the tracks...). NO MORE! This is one cool setup! And setup is a breeze with capability of building multiple (8) tracks with the initial startup kit.Controllers are your smartphone. I did not check iPhone compatibility, but Android smartphones were no problem. A quick download of the Anki OVERDRIVE app from the Play store and you can be up and running.One thing I have noticed in the short time of play and research for the gaming system is the great support from Anki. These folks seem to be on a continuous mission to upgrade and enhance the play experience. Each email and comment appears to be individually and personally answered. This is a very good sign in my estimation.One drawback is that this might be crazy addictive. The starter kit is exactly that...a starter kit, and it seems the additional track pieces will be something to seriously consider in the future. There are also a total of six cars in the Anki line-up, so this adds another four exciting elements to the Groundshock and Skull cars that come with the startup kit.Lots of fun to be had here ...and if you're a young grandpa like me, you can also become super cool to your grandkids by breaking out this toy this next time the kids come over.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18NDHZ40SZK3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6951I0#wasThisHelpful","R18NDHZ40SZK3C","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is much to commend in this Bible, and still...there is much that does not answer my own needs, requirements, and hopes in a study Bible.First, a few things to commend... It has colorful maps, graphs, and tables. I'm not being cheeky here, I really do like the addition of color and the maps are great. Most of them are in context, so you are not required to turn to the end of the book to look at the map and turn back to your reading when you're done with the map exploration. The book introductions are adequate in most cases, sometimes better for some books and sometimes not so better...adequate. Book outlines, text references, and most of the ""study notes"" are fairly standard and what you'd expect from most study Bibles. While the concordance is not exhaustive, it is substantial having almost 5,000 word entries.Where I felt the Bible was lacking is strictly subjective and should not be a reflection of the Bible specifically. I am part of an evangelical denomination, but I don't want a strictly evangelical study Bible. I would like an ecumenical and objective study Bible. I don't care for Scripture being notated and indexed according to an evangelical perspective. I would prefer objectivity and inclusiveness where it relates to the Christian faith. I am capable of making my own judgments based on the information, but this is or can be difficult where the information has been skewed or completely omitted.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWP70HDF4WF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310438330#wasThisHelpful","R3NWP70HDF4WF5","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The design of this mug is ingenious in that the lever latch covering the drink spout is also a plunger hinge that prevents both leakage and opens the spout for liquid pass-through.

"My two stars express it best, ""I don't like it.""In my opinion, the book is rife with problematic posits. I should begin with the disclosure that my tradition holds an egalitarian view for women and ministry. I also agree that the male and female relationships, when most healthy and God honoring, are practiced with a spirit and attitude of mutuality. Having said that, I do believe there is a divine sense of order that is bent in the direction of patriarchy by God's design and not exclusively by nature of the Fall of Humanity.The opening chapters of James' Malestrom begin with tired stereotypes of male masculinity; men are brutes, violent, ""impregnator-providers,"" aggressive, and more...it got exhausting for me very quickly. Then, there was this statement that I believe is a false premise; ""If men must rule--whether in government, on the streets, or in private homes--then anything that threatens a man's place of authority also jeopardizes his manhood."" This is what James calls the ""Malestrom,"" which is the foundation of her thesis...if I understand correctly. The strawman was building. Even with this disheartening early build-up, I tried to keep my reservations and bias neutralized, trying to read with some modicum of objectivity.Following the thesis statement, she goes on to exaggerate her premise with this statement; ""The malestrom poses one of the most serious historic challenges to the gospel..."" Then in the same paragraph of this statement she drops in a comparison with ISIS; ""This is not simply an internal church issue. We have ISIS to consider."" Oh. My. Jesus. Have Mercy.James has offered (in my opinion) hyperbole and excessive drama to hook her reader and build her premise, so she sets her stance to begin the journey of building the case for her thesis and unleashes this bomb; ""...Two major problems confront us before we even begin: first, that a chapter is missing from the Bible that is most pertinent to our quest, and second, that the men in the Bible best equipped to help us have gone missing too."" I kid you not... (see pg 33). I heard the words in my head, ""Are you serious???"" After delivering such thesis defining rhetoric in her opening salvos, she now suggests her case is going to be built on ""missing chapters and missing men"" from the Bible she is using to define and prove her case. I think this is more aptly called personal opinion and conjecture.Personal opinion and subjective interpretation of the texts cited by James continue to spiral in a direction of her own choosing, by the end of chapter one, the reader is completely caught up in the swirling whirlpool of James' feminist theology...and it never stops. Rest assured, if is smells like an agenda, looks like an agenda, and talks like an agenda...there is likely an agenda.I will say again, I think the right alignment of men and women is mutuality. Regardless of how James wills to present her case, we all have roles to fill within the context of society, civilization, and relationships. There is no way, at least functional way, everyone can play the same role or be the same character. However, we can coexist with mutual love and respect for one another and place equal value on the place and role that each individual will assume as we live out our lives with one another. I don't know if I agree with a defined-in-stone hierarchy in anything, but I do believe there is a place for leadership and authority and that should be assumed by the best person, male or female, for a given time and duty.I think overusing and resurrecting tired metaphors, even if they were born in some measure of truth, is unhelpful if we are to move forward, so I'm left unconvinced by James' thesis and her conclusions...and it seems, that she is unconvinced as well. She writes beginning pg. 202:""The final chapter of a book is supposed to bring the subject to a conclusion. But any sense of closure to the subjects raised in this book evades me."" She continues; ""As I reach the end of this literary journey, I must admit I have more questions than answers, and those questions deeply trouble me..."" I think the reason for this unsettledness hearkens back to my earlier comment that much of the case built by James is conjecture and personal opinion rather than real exegesis of the text. To her credit, I believe she ends the book on a very positive note. She writes; ""The way forward is challenging. The problems are complex, and we have only begun to grasp the remedies God provides. But we are not walking into the darkness, for Jesus knows the ways and is still saying, 'Follow me!'"" In my opinion, these are the best sentences of the book and found on the last page.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18YKWWEFCQAST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310325579#wasThisHelpful","R18YKWWEFCQAST","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very handsome watch. It's also a very heavy watch.I stopped wearing a watch several years ago when it seemed a little redundant with carrying a smartphone with me all the time. Personally, I don't wear a watch as a fashion accessory, so functionality and practicality are the determining factors for wearing one. When I was offered the opportunity to review this Invicta 17313 model, I figured sure ""it's been awhile.""Out-of-the-box the watched seemed much more expensive than its MFRP. It's sturdy, stainless steel, and has quite a bit of heft (did I mention its heavy?). Mine is the speedway chronograph and I find the function mostly useless for my world, but its there if anyone needs it. I tried to play around a bit with the stopwatch and chrono and wasn't very impressed with the action of the buttons. The buttons all have screw-down water-tight fittings that must be ""unscrewed"" to gain access to the function...kind of  hassle, but understandable I suppose to stay true to the water-resistance side of the build. Other than this particular chrono feature the watch is pretty straight-forward in its design. There is a day counter to keep track of what day it is...The bezel has markings set for time splits when using the chronograph, but my aging eyes had a tough time distinguishing the markers, also the nice looking black finish contributes to the difficulty of making out the hash marks on the bezel...at least it does for my eyes (I do wear progressive bifocals).I wrestled a bit with what ranking I would give this watch. Based purely on my impressions, I rank it a 3-star, but I'm thinking I might be a little harsh and were it not for my poor vision and the fact that I'm not used to having what feels like 2lbs of metal dangling on my wrist, I might rank it a 4-star watch. It is truly built well and it is a very nice looking watch.

"I've had the printer installed and networked to my LAN for a few days. Installation out-of-the-box was relatively trouble free and took less than 30-minutes from unboxing to software installation to final setup and ready state. I had no problems connecting the printer to my wireless network and all my networked devices found and connected to the XP-830 with no headaches.Print Quality: For regular text documents, printing is fast and the font readability is very crisp. A+ or 5-stars grade. I had a couple of minor details to work through for the photo printing as my first couple photos delivered issues relating to print head alignment. During my initial setup, I accepted the default maintenance settings and allowed the installation setup software as my benchmark. I printed a photo and had lines across the image. I went back to the printer's maintenance mode and performed a nozzle cleaning and print head alignment. A couple of passes through this maintenance app and I am now printing premium quality images. So, recap, for photo images BE SURE to run the nozzle cleaning app and the printer head alignment function.The software interface is a little clunky for me and I've not figured out the desktop app or if there is one. Also, the Epson App for smartphone (I'm using Android) is pretty good and fairly intuitive. I did successfully print wirelessly with no hangups from my Galaxy S6 immediately after downloading and installing the app from the Android App Store. Be aware that images d/l from the web or Facebook might print out pixelated due to a lower image quality.Other than the normal learning curve frustrations for new hardware/software, I have one little complaint.

"I am a longtime supporter and user of Paintshop Pro, dating back to the days it was coded by JASC. While there have been some ""clunky"" updates and bloated packages through the years of its development, the last few versions have been pretty good. I note that  some of my problems with slow processing and system crashes with previous versions may have been related to older computer hardware, inadequate system memory and failure to perform clean installations (removing previous versions of Paintshop Pro). This is to qualify my complaints of other earlier versions, so with adequate system requirements, I say, version 18 is another step in the improvement direction in my opinion.The package is a quick installation (i'm using Windows Version 7). The interface has a few changes (I was currently using Paintshop Pro 15), but those changes are intuitive and easily learned. The program operates smoothly on my computer, but I think it should considering I have 12GB of RAM. I appreciate the many presets and these will be handy for first-time users or newbies to the world of digital image manipulation, I like to have a closer hands on approach, so the manual controls are my preferred method.There is no shortage of features in this package and one should not limit their creativity to photos alone.

"I've been a Linksys product user and supporter for well over a decade now and I've come to depend on the consistency and durability of devices in their home networking product line. The WRT AC1200 is a continuation of current technology and proudly joins a lineage of dependable networking devices.Like previous devices, this router is very user friendly with ease of setup for the LAN neophyte and equally sophisticated configuration choices for the network Guru. With a click-through wizard the newbie can literally have their network up and running in a scant few minutes; likewise, for the network admin types, there are manual options to vary the levels of security, create QOS standards, and various options to allow port pass-throughs (VPN tunneling, gaming, server technology, and etc.). This is truly a very capable router. Additionally, the latest technology for radio broadcast is incorporated for very fast data transfer. If you are a ""super tinkerer,"" this device provides open source technology for those inclined to write your own firmware scripts. (This is way over my head, so I cannot speak to this feature).I live in a smaller apartment, so my signal strength out-of-the-box is full power anywhere in my apartment.All in all, I am very satisfied with performance and support of another fine product from Linksys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PE99J51J3MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","R12PE99J51J3MI","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent Bed! Very comfortable and solid support.Comfort and expectations thereof are certainly subjective, but coming from a superior innerspring mattress (Serta's top of the line), I was very surprised to experience the firm, but plush support of this memory foam mattress. It is, in every sense, as good a mattress as my Serta innerspring was. It is certainly too early to speak about long term support and stability of firmness, but I remain hopeful.Set up is easy. Simply and carefully remove packaging and unroll the mattress allowing time for it to recover from it's vacuum sealing. This happened for me in less than a few hours (between 2-4 and it was relaxed enough to sleep on). Full recovery can take up to 24 hours. There is also a bit of ""new car"" smell to the mattress, but that gasses out after a couple-few days. I do not notice anything unpleasant to my senses anymore.At present, I have no immediate concerns. The mattress sleeps well, and the Cool Gel Ventilation does what it is intended, at least to my experience...I do not sweat or toss and turn during the night due to reflected body heat. I do wonder about edge support, but that doesn't seem to be a problem at this juncture. Sheets fit well over the 10.5 inch thickness and I've added a protective topper/cover for my own peace of mind.Great mattress and perfect alternative to the ""big brand"" memory foam mattresses.

"I absolutely loved this book!I've been a Christian for a long time and I've participated in ""Seder"" meals from an Evangelical perspective and interpretation... On those occasions I been left with a feeling of incompleteness, confusion, and a sense of possible devaluation of the intent and purpose of the Seder because of missing context. I understand my feelings now after having read What Every Christian Needs to Know about Passover.Rabbi Moffic has brilliantly and eloquently laid out the background and the ritual of the Passover for people challenged by the culture and the history of this ancient meal (like myself). While no expert by any means, I most definitely feel more equipped to participate with respect in the service of this yearly ritual.The book is masterfully written and very easy to understand. Beginning with a sufficient background of the history of the Seder and Passover, the Rabbi proceeds with detailed steps through every aspect of the Passover meal complete with attention to every dish, every ritual, every question, song, and response. As I said earlier, ""Brilliant.""It was even more fortuitous that I was able to obtain this book during the Lenten Season as my curiosity was piqued because of my personal engagement with this very holy time of the Church calendar. I look forward to continued study of the book and accompanying ritual with hopes of possible participation of a Seder among my own family and closest friends.

"No, monitor calibration is not only for professionals.Who needs it? That depends, but if you want your photos to reflect the accuracy of what you see, then monitor calibration is important. Digital photography has radically changed the photo imaging game. While many folks may only display their images through social media and digital displays or slideshows, some people still get prints done. Whether you print your photos at home or you outsource through an online service or local big box outlet store, calibrating your monitor for accurate color reproduction will help ensure what you see and photograph is what you get. This is where monitor calibration is important and the Spyder5Pro makes it easy-peasy.The S5P100 is a quick setup. Downloading the software from the online link and activation is just a few minute task and you're up and running. A quick calibration for ambient light and you're calibrating your monitor for accurate color representation. There is nothing close to rocket science with this task. The software wizard makes the calibrating process as easy as a few mouse clicks. Depending on your monitor (desktop or laptop), the start to finish time is 5-10 minutes at most.If you take your photography seriously, even if you're not a professional, you might consider this an invaluable tool.

"So far, so good!This air fryer has  a lot of good things going for it. It is quick, it is efficient, and it is easy to clean up and we haven't even gotten into the talking points about how it cooks. About that...I haven't run this unit through all the paces yet, but for what I've experimented with it performs very,very well. I'd likely give it an excellent if I were being completely fair, but I've pushed it pretty hard on a couple of occasions to find its limits. I've ""fried"" frozen precooked wings on three occasions now and the fryer has done great with them considering overall performance. There has been some experimentation with cooking time duration as I came close to overcooking one batch and undercooking another, but those are user issues and no fault of the fryer. Now, after a few batches, I feel I have a fairly good handle on amount of wings to cook time ratio and things have been fairly consistent with excellent food quality results.I have also experimented with uncooked chicken breasts and a light coating of seasoned flour (no oil). Results weren't as good as I expected, although the chicken was evenly cooked and tasted exquisite, the appearance wasn't uniformly golden brown and appearance is important. I believe I was in error here again and not the fryer. I may have overfilled the basket and not allowed for good convection flow around the chicken pieces. I think my results will be better on the next go around.I look forward to sampling more recipes and feel that this will be an oft-used appliance in my kitchen.

"Pilgrims Progress is likely one of the greatest works of literary allegory that exists. I realize how bold that statement might be, but one only read the book to find the truth steeped in that boldness.While Pilgrims Progress charts the arc of the Christian journey, I dont think it is limited to the Christian experience. Truly the brilliance of John Bunyan is realized in his astute understanding and the following portrayal of the human journey as seen through Pilgrims (Christian) eyes.Originally written almost three hundred fifty years ago, the version I review has been updated to include both the actual Holy Bible Scripture verses and the Scripture references in line with the text of the story. This is a great benefit to the reader who may want to understand the theological reference from whence Bunyan develops his story (an example follows).What does this mean? Christian asked.The Interpreter answered, This is Christ who continually maintains the work already begun with the oil of his grace in the heart. By this grace, in spite of what the Devil can do, the souls of his people still prove to be gracious. (My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, I will rather glory in my weaknesses that the power of Christ may dwell in me. -2 Cor. 12:9)Other than the Scripture helps and modernized language, the book remains faithful to the original writing published in 1638. Although  some of the concepts may be a bit complex for very young children, I wouldnt hesitate to read it to those even as young as second grade. In fact, I read the story to my children when they were between the ages of seven and twelve years old. Even if some of the ideas and situations found in the story or big, it can serve as conversations starters and discussions about the nature of lifes journey. This work should be on everyones must read list perhaps to revisit and read again and again.I received a complimentary copy of  this book with no obligation to post a favorable review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FENK51MI29I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622452399#wasThisHelpful","R37FENK51MI29I","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice! I ordered this because I have an expensive quilted mattress cover with memory foam and I wanted something to protect it, since it is not so easy to wash. This cover is PERFECT for my use. There is a waterproof liner, which is important to me, but the liner isn't ""crinkly"" and is only on the one side... the side of the cover that is closest to my sheets almost has a flannel feel to it - soft and not stiff or ""crunchy"" the way most waterproof covers can be.As mentioned, I have a thick quilted cover over my mattress already and it too is quilted and rather thick. The overall thickness of my mattress and existing cover is around 13-14 inches. The Perlux mattress cover has deep fitted corners that easily fit over my mattress and memory foam pad with room to spare. The fitted edges are stretchy so there's not a jumble of loose material around the mattress once the cover is in place. Another plus for me and my OCD self.Most importantly, this cover is easily maintained in house. It is machine washable, but there are specific cleaning care instructions to follow, so there is no damage done. (Do not dry on med. or high heat, no ironing, no bleach, and no dry cleaning) Following the instructions should ensure a long and satisfying life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARCZCXFGWYNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2W7WJA#wasThisHelpful","RARCZCXFGWYNT","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Extremely nice sink, very nice to look at with its clean and modern look, but also very nice functionality. How Kohler has managed to incorporate such a high level of scratch resistance to this finish is beyond my technical understanding (check out the videos!), but it seems almost impervious to scratching. Note that I have not attempted this same level of testing, but under normal use conditions I think expectations can be realized that the finish will remain in close to pristine condition for a long, long time.The undermount design adds to the clean and modern look and the deep oversized capacity of the sink provides plenty room for cleaning large pots and pans. This is a huge plus for me when it comes to washing baking pans and roaster inserts that aren't dishwasher safe or are oversized for placing in my dishwasher.If there is any negative critique from me, it is solely directed to the price of the product. I don't know what the scratch-resistant coating costs, but other sinks of comparable size and features (sans scratch-resistance feature) cost considerably less. I think I could swallow the disappointment of a scratch or few to save a few hundred dollars. Cost aside though, this is an excellent sink.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQFPRSI5KXTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N10OLI8#wasThisHelpful","RSQFPRSI5KXTR","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, how I wish all partially assembled or assembly-required products went together as easily as this Thule Sport Stroller. Out of the box and ready to jog-N-roll in about 15-20 minutes. Seriously. Most of the unit is already assembled and collapsed in folded storage mode. This means assembly is restricted to popping on the tires...and that is, literally, a snap.The stroller has a number of very cool features: a hand brake, a foot brake, a lockable front wheel, cushioned shock-absorbing rear wheels, a reversible canopy hood and ample storage for baby bottles, water bottles, toys, books, change of clothes... a high quality and very thoughtfully designed product for sure. These points and the fact that this is almost a single-handed operation for collapsible storage and preparation for use, as well as compact storage (easily fits into the rear storage of your minivan or hatchback SUV/CUV) make it a perfect choice.While ideally designed for jogging, it should not be restricted to only those considerations. The lightweight design, ample storage, and comfort ride of the Glide Stroller makes it great choice for almost any use.

"This Skiva Cloud Wifi Router offers a lot of features for the invested bucks. The price of $25 is very fair for a basic N300 router, add the features offered with the Skiva RT001 and you have a winning combination. Initial setup is a breeze, almost plug and go for your wireless devices to connect. Personalized configurations are relatively easy too with the setup app or direct config via the web interface.The USB port provides a connection point for NAS storage by USB thumbdrive or any HDD equipped with USB connection point. I've not tested or attempted connection with the cloud storage feature, so cannot comment. The router does work as an access point or network extender. As I stated at the beginning of this review, you get a lot of router for $25 bucks. There are competing devices on the market with more features and more bandwidth, but you'll pay upward of 4X the price.

"I've tried quite a few car chargers and most of the dual port designs were not adequate for my needs. The Skiva PowerFlow Duo 4.2 Amp charger has proved to me that it is a capable challenger to the chargers I've tried before. The problems I've experience with the other designs is the ports have not equally distributed the power output. The Skiva design does not follow that architecture and each port output is 2.1 Amp. This allows my Android S3 or my Nexus 10 to be in use and continue to charge. This meets my needs!

"What's not to like? This is a basic network router with better than average coverage and functionality for its price point.

"I'm loving  this shower caddy! I must admit it was a little bit awkward with the first steps to assembly, but it all came together after a few moments of laying out all the pieces and thinking through the process. Not to worry, but the assembly instructions are a bit on the minimalist side of things. Granted, it's a fairly simple design, but I still had some questions about what piece went where ...and the compression spring tensioning section was giving me a fit. While this is a newer component in the Grayline lineup, I was still able to find a YouTube video that was helpful to me in figuring out how the sections went together. Once assembled, installation in the shower was a snap. It was literally a 2-minute job.Functionality so far has been good. I have some concerns over the strength of the shelves themselves and what the maximum weight load is, but I've not found any problems yet. I've got a 12oz bottle of liquid soap and a 16oz bottle of shampoo on one shelf and there's no sag. We'll see if the unit holds up long term, but no complaints for the moment.The corner placement is not overly obtrusive nor is it a space hog in the shower.

"This is a very nice bedframe for its price. As other reviewers have noted, it comes disassembled and there are quite a few parts, but don't let that deter you. The package comes with all its parts including a small hex wrench and nut wrench; no other tools are required.

All time counted, from unboxing to complete assembly to disposal of the packaging materials was one hour exactly for me.The frame is very sturdy and has ample room for storage underneath.

The mattress really adds another layer of stability to the foundation/frame, tying the whole together for a rock-solid and restful experience.My ""con"" list isn't very long, but there is no point of attachment for a headboard.

"This book is mesmerizing, fascinating, and absolutely brilliant.Allow me to say from the outset, the work presented in this volume far exceeds relevance to insight toward child development. It is not only a window into the mind, psyche, and soul of a child... No, it is a portal peering into the great mystery of each of us.Be advised, this book is not a book about religion nor does it purpose an agenda. This is likely, in my opinion, one of the most object treatments of the concepts relating to human spirituality that I have encountered. I have appreciated the science behind Lisa Miller's (author) observations as much as I have appreciated her ""real-life"" observations and anecdotes. As I have read through The Spiritual Child, I have been aware of my own thoughts getting carried away with considerations and critical reasoning of the thoughts presented to me. In other words, I am being fully engaged by this book. I am engrossed and invested...I'm considering my own upbringing as well as the raising of my own children and I'm considering the implications of my involvement as I prepare for the welcoming of my first grandchild in the coming months. This, to me, is the sign of a well-written, well-researched, and well-presented book. Honestly, I was hooked even from the introduction.It is evident from dialectical flow of this book that Lisa Miller is a scientist (Clinical Psychologist and Director of Clinical Psychology at Columbia University). Do not let this revelation lead you to consider the book is written in academic speak; it is not. Dr Miller writes as a parent as much as a scientist and presents her thesis and findings in a conversational tone. As I mentioned earlier, I was drawn in to the discussion as early as the introduction. I appreciated the hard data from biological studies that helps to move this subject from nebulous subjectivity to observable, tangible, objectivity. Chapter two, ""The Science of the Spiritual Brain,"" was a helpful introduction and foundational piece for the remainder of the book.Chapter seven, ""The Six Spiritual Strengths,"" is exceedingly thought provoking. This chapter continues to stir thoughts about my own childhood and moves me to consider how I will engage my grandchildren relative to their developing spirituality. The results of avoiding the relevance of these findings and information is revealed in the following chapter eight, ""Window of Awakening,"" where Dr Miller presents some disturbing statistics and correlates-connects ""data dots"" with real life.The final chapters of the book (chapters 10 through 13) offer many helps and much hope with practical suggestions for engaging children in the development of their spirituality ...their development as human beings. I think, these chapters are just as helpful for the adult who might be reading them and still working through their own self-awareness. I'm convinced the information presented in this book can be the first steps for much inner healing for many people and likely holds the possibility of a second awakening and second chance for better life for them as well.I am looking forward to reading and rereading this book, hopefully in a group of people, so I might glean from the insights of others.

There is no over-ear hook or other retaining device, but the  contents of the shipping package include a couple pairs of rubber ear bud sleeves in various sizes that accommodate larger/smaller ear canals. I've tested the snugness of the fit by jumping around and turning my head from side to side at extreme angles and the headset and ear buds stay in place fine for me. the around-the-neck design of this unit is a little awkward for me and it's taken some time for me to get used to it, but it does seem to work and after a few days of use, it does seem more comfortable and natural. The controls are easy to find by feel and intuitively located. I'll have to note that the first time I received an incoming phone call, I was a bit freaked out by the vibration buzz around my neck...almost thinking I had on a shock collar. Suffice it to say, I didn't miss the call.Fidelity of sound for my music listening is very good in my opinion. I own several pairs of high quality headphones, both over ear and in ear styles and this headset holds its own with them. I think perspective is important, so it should be said that these in-ear buds will likely not compete with your higher end over-ear headphones... not in comfort, not in style, not in sound quality, but for $75 they perform admirably. I have found bass response much higher than expected and the mid-range is crisp with no ""muddiness"" in the tones. Trebles are okay for my taste, but I would like to hear them a bit cleaner. I should note that the headset has an equalizer feature for bass boost -> normal -> treble boost, but I did not discern a noticeable difference when toggling through those settings. Likewise, there is a Ambient Noise Cancelling feature that I did not notice any discernable difference.All the audio streaming functions (Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous, FFwd, and Back) worked perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy S3. There is an additional feature for reading your SMS messages, but I have not downloaded the Android App to test this as of yet. As noted, this is a very feature-packed headset and a great value for the price point. I'm please with it and become more attached to it the more I use it. I still prefer an over-ear headset and the around-the-neck design is still not my favorite (although it is growing on me). It is these two reasons I'm rating the HBS-800 four out of five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL0E7ZCW0X1FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2CRXKI#wasThisHelpful","RL0E7ZCW0X1FX","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the opportunity to run this 12-cup mill and brew coffee maker through it paces after a few weeks with it now. I think there are several very positive things about it that I really like and there are a couple of minor frustrations, but overall with the cost of the machine considered, this is a very satisfying coffee maker.For those who might be less experienced in working with whole beans and grinders, there are no worries. This brewer is very intuitive and the instructions included with the machine are very clear and easy to understand. You can seriously expect to be up and running almost from the moment you unpack the maker from its box. There have been a few reviewers that have been a bit disappointed about the quality of the machine parts, most of which are high impact plastic, but that doesn't seem to present a real problem with function. I've noticed not warping from steam and/or hot water.The all-in-one process is convenient, but this is where some of the frustration comes in to play. The ""grinder"" is not really a grinder, its a chopper, and the ""grind"" will be inconsistent with this type of process. There is some trial and error involved in getting an acceptable consistency to your bean grind, but this is an eighty dollar all-in-one machine we're talking about here and not a commercial grade device. Likewise, cleanup is a bit of a pain as other reviewers have noted. It would be nice to be able to separate the chopper blade from the brew basket, but it is something one can get used to. I have yet to try, but I think I could get away with top rack cleaning in my dishwasher. If I mess the brew basket up, it can be purchased separately (part# CM5000 03).Other than the minor inconveniences I've mentioned, I think this is a very nicely made unit for the cost. I can certainly vouch for a good cup of coffee... not a magnificent cup of coffee as made from my Breville burr grinder and my French press, but a good cup of coffee nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OA6QCNX95DVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HZFK#wasThisHelpful","R3OA6QCNX95DVN","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two people in our household using this cream... my wife has been using it since it arrived and I've been using it for the past two weeks. She reports that she cannot tell a significant improvement over her ""wrinkles,"" but that is not my reason for use...First I should report that with this product a little goes a long, long way. It is expensive, but I think it might last through a year...or more, which makes the cost much more bearable (it's relative). Second, it smells ok (not bad not good) and it is greaseless. It absorbs quickly into the skin too.For me, I suffer from Diabetes Type II and as a consequence I have very dry skin on my face, my nose and eyes in particular. I have used several major brand facial creams and lotions with minimal results for re-hydrating my skin. this Scalisi cream has worked wonders with my skin and the blotchiness I've had for a couple years.

"I received this very nice LED flashlight for review and after giving it a go for a couple days can say I'm very pleased with it. It has three primary light functions (1) a precision focused beam that is VERY bright--do not shine this light directly in the eyes of someone. (2) a sidebar illuminating spectrum light--think lantern, but still very bright if you look at it directly (3) flashing red LED caution or emergency light.The light functions are all very helpful in each respective use, but I see myself using the ""white light"" focused beam and spread bar lantern the most. This would make a great backpack or automobile emergency light.I tried the magnetic base on several surfaces and was a little disappointed with my first results as the light would stick securely to some of the metal surfaces I tried. I tested on some other metals like paperclips and noticed a very strong attraction, so I went outside and tested the light on the side of my car. The light stuck securely standing on its side as shown in the company provided photos.I have no complaints about the light, but do wish the magnetic was a bit stronger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPIZHSATRZ1UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAES5EO#wasThisHelpful","RPIZHSATRZ1UD","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This TP-LINK RE200 AC750 was super easy to setup. I was literally under 10-minutes from unboxing to connected with my LAN and online. The included instructions and the internal admin webpage were intuitive and easy to navigate; I have no qualms or critique about any of this.I ran the TP-LINK for almost two-weeks and didn't experience any dropouts or other network hiccups. I had several devices connected through the range extender (wireless printer, desktop system, notepad, and cellphone). This past week my son returned home for college break and another son arrived for holiday visit. The load on the system increased by 5 additional devices and I suddenly started experiencing disconnects and intermittent bandwidth issues. At this juncture, I'm not entirely convinced it was the AC750, but after removing it and reinstalling a Netgear range extender my aforementioned network problems ceased. My router is a single channel older D-LINK DIR-601, so it might be the source of the issues too. I will need to do further testing and troubleshooting at a later date.At this juncture, I'm not inclined to place blame on the AC750 and feel that based on my earlier experience before the influx of visitors on my network, it is a solid device. I plan to purchase or procure a new router following the Christmas holidays (a dual-band AC router) and will do further testing once this is in place. I will update my review with my findings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQKIIVS7Q7MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR2VMNC#wasThisHelpful","R1GQKIIVS7Q7MC","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hand size may be an issue for some, but I love these oven/grill gloves! I've only had the opportunity to use these in the kitchen, but they excel at every place and use I've employed them. Whether it's stove top cooking, removing pans from the oven, or using these for washing dishes, my expectations have been met time after time. I plan to use these as my exclusive ""grill gloves"" when the next grilling season rolls around and can't wait to see how awesome they will be in that arena...I think they'll be great.I don't have any real critique, but as I mentioned small hands or big hands may have a bit of trouble with these silicone mitts.

"NOTE::: This review represents an ongoing case (beginning 12/05/14 and running through 01/09/15). My review began with a defective console and quickly degraded into a very poor customer service experience. After a few days of frustration with the technical support and customer service depts., I was able to be connected with someone within the DELL-Alienware organization who pledged to see my case through resolution. Since the day my case was ""owned"" by this or these individual(s), my experience has been the stuff customer service awards are made for. The case isn't fully resolved or closed just yet, but I am including my experience in the full in the following review. Updates as they are received are posted at the close of this review.UPDATE 01/09/15 see near the bottom of this review of the Alienware Alpha ASM100-2980 Console (2.9 GHz Intel Core i3-4130T Processor, 8GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, Windows 8)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Begin: 12/15/14I have put off writing any review for my Alienware Alpha until now for two reasons. Reason one is the limited experience of use I've had with it due to equipment malfunction. Reason two is my reluctance to post a review based primarily on the customer service experience. I've thought that the CS aspect of my experience is potentially part of any owner experience and worth reporting, so I'll share my experience thus far with the promise to update my review as the case is resolved...or not.Unboxing experience: All is good with adequate documentation, but I got the most helpful information for installing and connecting the unit to my TV and network from online reviews and illustrations. Most of this information I studied before the unit actually arrived at my home and I attempted my first connect and power up.Powering up: This was my first indication there was something wrong with the unit. The power supply has a bright blue LED that indicates it is receiving power, so my suspicion was it was ""good to go."" When I pressed the console power button (a little button in the shape of the Alien head) there was nothing. No power up. I checked the connections to the console and jiggled the unit around while pressing the power button repeatedly and at some point the unit powered up.Running through the paces: Initial setup was mostly a breeze and I was aware (from my online pre-research) that there might be updates and driver installs before the unit completed the first use start up. This was exactly what happened, but following the various driver installs and updates, I followed the onscreen prompts to complete setup. I chose to set this unit up in desktop mode as I intend to use it as a media server as well as a Steam console. Everything went great. Following the setup, I started to map network drives in my LAN and installed PLEX Server to manage my movies. I have a lot of music and movies so I let the console go as it processed and indexed files. This step required leaving the console powered up and online for the next 24-48 hours.Powering Down:  after a day or two, my media files were fully indexed and I ran through PLEX server paces, played some music and started to roll a movie. I connected to the STEAM server and was thrilled at how everything was working and enthusiastically looked forward to the coming days to start really enjoying the possibilities of entertainment this little Alpha unit promised... I powered down the unit and went to bed for the evening.Powering Back Up: A couple days later and a day off work I attempted to power the unit back up. Nada. ""Oh no,"" I thought. The unit was doing the same thing I experienced from the first time I tried to turn the console on. I checked connections, PSU, and jiggled the console while pressing the power button. Nothing. This time I could not get the unit to turn on again.Service Dept and Technical Support: I contacted Dell/Alienware for technical support for the first time on Dec. 4, 2014. I followed all the instructions for over-the-telephone troubleshooting and the CS Agent determined the unit needed to be replaced. The CSA advised me of escalation of the service order to a specialty resolution team that would call me within 72 hours to advise me of whether my unit would be approved for replacement. I waited.After 72 hours I had not rec'd the promised call from the resolution specialist but waited two more days (120 hours) before I contacted Technical Support for a follow up. At this point the CSA returned my inquiry with an email that I cut and paste the following:""Let me tell you it's been cancelled but because of a good new the workshop is ready for your computer and I'd like to send send you the box so that you can send it in to get it repaired, Could you please tell me this information for me to create the dispatch?""??? Did you all get that? I think I could read between the lines, but you might guess I was a little confused as to what was going on. The end result was this: The CSAs request for replacement was cancelled. No resolution specialist contacted me. The CSA was now advising that the repair dept was going to ""fix or diagnose"" the problem with my console...and a box with RMA would be sent to me in order for me to return the unit to Dell/Alienware directly. I was bummed out, but okay...at least we were headed toward resolution. The promised box was estimated to arrive within two business days.6 Days Later: Today, four full business days have elapsed and no return box. I contacted Alienware/DELL again to follow up and the CSA advised that my ticket could be found, but there is no information indicating the return box was shipped to me. The agent was kind and profusely apologized for the error, but they would take ""ownership"" of the ticket and would ensure that a ""resolution specialist"" would contact me within 24 hours to see that my ticket is resolved. Is it wrong to sound skeptical?At this juncture, I am extremely dubious as to the resolution process. Regarding the console unit itself, I'm very positive about the potential of providing huge amounts of entertainment. My hopes and prayers for any prospective owners (in light of my present experience), is that you do not experience any mechanical malfunctions...or really have any need of technical assistance.My review is subject to change and upgrade based on the resolution (or not) of this case. Stay tuned.Update: 12/16/14 [1:30pm EST] Some interaction today with various CS agents. I received an email from an agent that told me I would have to wait until parts were available to fix the unit. No box would be shipped until parts were available. I responded with an email to inform the agent this was an unacceptable solution. I attempted to engage a chat agent to help me find an escalation point to locate a supervisor and was advised a supervisor would contact me shortly. Approximately 2-3 hours later I have heard from a supervisor who has advised me they will be handling my case from this point and a box has been FedEx'd to me for return/repair of the console. I was advised I would receive a tracking number for the box, which should come to via my email. Updates to follow.Update: 12/17/14 [4:00pm EST] A little over 24 hours since last update and I've received the RMA return box, dutifully packaged the console unit and power cord for it's trip back to DELL Austin, TX. The estimated deliver to the warehouse and ""fixit"" shop is around 5-days FedEx Ground. I have been advised, if I understand the email communication process, the entire process will incur 5-7 business days. In any event, the communication I received stated I could follow the status of the process with a tracking number as well as the promise to provide me with status updates when the unit is fixed and ready for return shipping. Updates to follow.Update: 12/18/14 [8:00am EST] Received a phone call this morning from a resolution specialist who has taken ownership of my case. We talked some over the issues surrounding my complaint. I advised the agent that my issues at this juncture were not with the console as I understand things may happen. This being an electronic device, it may not even be a quality control issue, but possible damage during shipping. Stuff happens. The problem occurs when stuff happens and it is not resolved in a timely and professional manner...this is my complaint. At this juncture, despite the frustration of the last two weeks, it seems we are on track for some kind of equitable resolution. My resolution specialist has assured me they will walk with me through completion of this process to ensure that my experience is a positive one. I will continue to update my review as the case proceeds. For the moment, the console is in route back to Texas for repair or replacement. It is expected to arrive at the warehouse early next week. I expect there may be some holiday delays for which I am forgiving and understanding. Updates to follow.Update: 12/22/14 [3:45pm EST] Things seem to have taken a decided turn for the better. I received an email follow up over the weekend to let me know that the resolution specialist was tracking my console on its return to the DELL warehouse in Texas. Today, I received another email to inform me that the console had arrived in Texas and would be undergoing diagnostics as quickly as possible. We still do not have resolution, but this is the kind of customer service support that I had experienced with DELL before and what I expected from the outset with this experience. We are definitely moving in the right direction and I am hopeful that I will be conducting a full review of this console very soon. Updates to follow.Update: 12/23/14 [2:00pm EST] Contact with the case manager continues to be regular and informative. I was emailed today to advise that diagnostics have begun on my console with expectations that resolution would soon follow. I continue to have expectations that this case will be resolved and have a very happy ending. The interactions and experience of the past week are serving to reinforce my expectations. Updates to follow.Update: 12/31/14 [08:00am EST] Over the past few days I have rec'd a couple emails from the CS Resolution Specialist to advise me that my  console repair is in process. We've not rec'd any description of the process or the findings, only that the console is in diagnostics and repair. The last update (yesterday midmorning advised the console was with the testing engineer...). Last night I checked the Depot Online Status that updates where the console is in the diag/repair process to see that my console has been updated to ""repaired"" status and is now in the FedEx pipeline on the way back to me. Still no further update as to the diagnostic and repair itself, but I am hopeful to hear back from the resolution specialist at some point ...maybe today. The system is scheduled to return to me by end of day on Jan 02, 2015 and I am hopeful to complete my review. At this juncture, I've officially been in process (from opening the box upon original receipt of the console to today) for four weeks.Update: 01/09/14 [08:00am EST] I received my repaired console a little over a week ago. The unit now operates as it was intended with the power button having been repaired. The repair order stated the power button was improperly seated. The repair from start to finish was just under a month counting for the headaches of the initial poor customer service. Once the issue was handed off to a ""resolution specialist"" (Andrew), I cannot offer anything but sterling kudos. Andrew was superb, keeping me updated (as he promised) every step of the way with phone calls and emails. This was through the middle of the Christmas / New Year holiday mind you. So, some expected delay was expected from my part.Since having the unit online and the physical function of the equipment operating as designed, I have had the opportunity to run the console through its paces. I've fully integrated the Alienware Alpha as a centerpiece in my entertainment system, serving as a server for multimedia (movies and music) in addition to gaming entertainment via Steam Server. I'm using PLEX to serve movies and music throughout my LAN and my HD TV. PLEX and the LAN service works perfect with no stuttering or other problems and my music rocks with my surround 5.1 sound system. NETFLIX, Amazon Prime, HULU, VUDU and several other streaming services work perfectly through this unit. Also, while it's not my prefered browser, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube videos are also available with the click of a mouse. This is the great advantage of the combined desktop / console gaming platform approach here.I'm not nearly the gaming connoisseur as my 20-something sons, so I let them be the discriminating voices for the Steam side of things. Both of them gave the system 5-star ratings for game play and responsiveness (from a system hardware perspective as well as online bandwidth). Their gaming choices were Dragon Age and Civilization IV for their tests.I have not found any glitch in any aspect of my testing and evaluation since having the system repaired. I do recommend that a user/owner purchase a keyboard and mouse for the most satisfactory experience if  you intend to use the system outside of just a gaming platform. Honestly, I think the keyboard and mouse are more functional than the handset for most RPG games as well, but that is a user experience preference.I have more things I intend to test and hopefully will further integrate the console into my multimedia uses. I rate the console itself as 5 STAR but on the basis of the initial poor experience with customer service I have to rate an overall experience to 4 STAR. While unfortunate, it was a part of my experience and must be counted. If you should encounter issues with customer service for any reason, be persistent. A few bad eggs do not reflect the whole organization or the product itself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4QT5AL3IEJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7AF74#wasThisHelpful","R2K4QT5AL3IEJL","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well-made, solid little interface box. Installation was relatively easy with my Windows 7 laptop recognizing the device and installing drivers automatically. There was one driver failure, but I went to the Tascam site and downloaded the updates for firmware and drivers and after they were installed my device manager showed the US2X2 device properly installed and ready for action.If there is any complaint about this package, I point to the included software (Sonar LE and Ableton Live). I admit I have limited experience with advanced audio software, but it seems to me that it should be at least intuitive enough to capture direct line-in sound files. I accept the responsibility for my failure in capturing audio with either of these softwares, but I'm disappointed I was unable to use either of them successfully. I was able to use Audacity (freeware), Soundbooth (Adobe) that I already had installed, and Presonus Studio One. In these software applications, I was able to verify that the problem wasn't hardware installation, but likely my lack of understanding the proper settings and input selections to capture my audio files.The two line inputs are more than sufficient for my purposes, I play acoustic guitar and sing, so two inputs are more than adequate for my needs. I rate the hardware as five-stars and software as two-stars. My overall rating is 4-star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FDJUV81VYBHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIXF2RS#wasThisHelpful","R3FDJUV81VYBHS","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not expecting what I got when I first ordered this book for review from Kregel Publishing. I ordered the book based on the title Elders in the Life of the Church: Rediscovering the Biblical Model for Church Leadership and after reading it, I think the original title should have remained intact (Elders in Congregational Life).I was hopeful this book would speak more generically to the structure of church leadership from a historical and early (ancient) church perspective. I admit that I did not read any reviews or summaries of the book before I ordered I should have. Before I proceed with my review, it is only fair for me to state the book is well written and engaging. The writing is full of references, both Scripture and bibliography, and contains many personal anecdotes. It is in these regards that I offer my highest praises for Elders in the Life of the Church.My criticisms for this work are not related to the information presented or the experience of the men who have written it. My criticism is directed to the narrow focus of the subject framed in a very restricted context. There are multiple facets and forms of church government and some of the oldest forms of that government, while not congregationally driven, can be identified as benefiting from the leadership of elders. I do not feel that this subject was addressed sufficiently. The authors framed their thesis using Scripture and interpreted those texts almost exclusively for their particular model of government, almost as if to say, This is the most accurate understanding of what the Scriptures intended. The framework of this model is also decidedly from a Calvinist perspective, which once again, alienates other traditions and models for Church government.  Once the original thesis is established the authors choose to follow the experience of a particular church (a Baptist Church in North America) to illustrate their findings and support their model. As I stated earlier, this particular context is very limiting; consequently, I felt out of my context and quite alienated in understanding how this was rediscovering the Biblical model for church leadership.Personally, what I found most prominent in this book was an institutional model and not truly the role of elders in a church. I was disappointed that the scope of this book was so limited. I think there was an opportunity for more inclusivity of other traditions and a broader look at the role of elder leadership in the body of the Church regardless of the form and function of administrative governance.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Kregel Ministry Publishing to read and post a review on my site. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255 Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMYF44MVCCSOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0825442729#wasThisHelpful","RMYF44MVCCSOQ","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a short book, but very dense; this is to say, it might not be for everybody. When I was first offered this book for review, I was excited and looked forward to learning more about the Jewish perspective on the writings of James or Ya'akov from the collection of Scripture known as the New Testament. My goal in ordering this book was to hopefully learn more about the actual intent of these writings and perhaps understand more clearly, what may get lost in English interpretation.Truthfully, there are some gems to be gleaned from this little book, but it was a difficult and cumbersome read for me. I'm not a Biblical languages scholar, nor am I a Biblical history expert; consequently, I struggled with finding a rhythm while reading through James the Just. There are many references to the original languages of Hebrew and Greek throughout the texts; likewise, there are quite a few transliterations of the texts that also added to the slowing down of my reading. These details contributed to my inability to digest approximately thirty to forty percent of the book. It is for this reason that I refer to the ""mining of gems."" It was, in a very real sense, my experience. I would read, skim, read, skim... find a nugget that piqued my interest and then try to understand and polish up the nugget I had found. The ultimate end of this experience was that it made my level of enjoyment minimal; I felt my reading was more inclined toward work than anything else.The book is well-annotated, complete with bibliography, reference tables, endnotes, and glossary. My experience will likely not be the average experience. I expect that most persons ordering this book will have a better background with the original languages and the socio-political history of the Jewish people. This is a very academic book and not something easily understood by the average Bible student.As I have already said, there are some wonderful gems to be gleaned in this book. I particularly enjoyed chapter five, which seemed most like a commentary for me. I do caution you, before you order, evaluate what your purposes and expectations are for this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTEU3AZI4QHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936716445#wasThisHelpful","R1HTEU3AZI4QHP","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year I had the fortunate opportunity to read and review Sybil Macbeth's Praying in Color, which I loved dearly. When her latest book, The Season of the Nativity, arrived to remind me of the upcoming Advent Season, I was sure it was going to be packed with joy-filled activities and insights. I was right!This little book, published by Paraclete Press, is a delight on so many levels. You can ""hear"" the exuberance of the season in every word Sybil writes. Not only does MacBeth tell the Advent-Christmas-Epiphany story in her words, but much like her Praying in Color books, she makes the season a full-body experience including ideas for crafts, visual tools, memory-making opportunities, songs, and smells...all of these ways of entering and living into this beginning of the Christian calendar and celebrating the birth of the Christ child.The opening chapters of the book provide background and give insight to the reader who might not be familiar with the Liturgical Calendar. I know my Christian tradition did not practice the seasons of the Christian year and the information sections here in the early chapters of the book can be helpful for those persons who aren't familiar with these ancient practices. Another thing I enjoy so much about Sybil's books, she is mindful of the learning styles of people. She doesn't simply ""shoot from the hip"" with a bunch of dry information and fact spewing to tell the story; no, she is also a visual and tactile learner who includes beautiful full-color illustrations as well as suggesting physical sensory aids to help inform and tell the story.As I've alluded, the book is an appeal to every facet of the human experience. I liken it to the idea that we are invited to enter into the season with all our ""heart, soul, mind, and strength."" Likewise, the appeal isn't just to specific age groups, but spans the entirety of the seasons of life... no child is left behind, from the youngest soul to the most advanced soul, there is something to be experienced and something to be shared.Just this past week, as my church was preparing to enter into this Advent-Christmas season, we used The Season of the Nativity to frame what we called The Advent Prayer Encounter. This was our opportunity to teach and introduce this deeply moving and very important time of the year to our church family. We used a number of ideas from Sybil's book to engage people from five years old to seventy plus years old in the telling of this story. I believe the evening was a huge success, in part because of the wonderful diversity of styles and activities for telling and actively inviting participants to experience the story with all their senses through words, songs, art, sights, smells, and the invocation of memories.This is another delightful addition to my Advent resource shelf and I'm sure it will be for anyone who is interested in living into the intimacy and mystery of this Yuletide season. Young or old, new to the season or seasoned veteran in all things Advent to Epiphany, you'll find something to engage and freshen your perspective. Thanks to Sybil Macbeth and Paraclete Press for another delightful read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIYX4L4Q7Z5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612614108#wasThisHelpful","R1MIYX4L4Q7Z5Y","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DE Lipstick Style Powerbank and Flashlight is an excellent quick pack charger for your phone. I have several batterybank chargers and this is the ""lightest"" (pun intended) of them all. I think, when evaluating products and writing reviews, it is important to keep perspective and expectations in balance. While I have been testing this product, my perspective has been filtered by what this powerbank will be used for, the relative cost of this product, and feature/benefit set.This is a low cost device. There are similar lipstick style powerbanks on the market, but this one does feature a multi-function flashlight. I'm not sure that the functionality of the flashlight is adequate compensation for the price differences in other similar products, but this feature does add function to the flashlight/charger. The flashlight itself is bright, very bright... likely one of the brightest I've ever used. This is a benefit on my scorecard. The brightness of the flashlight ensures that I will be using it.The charger seems to work well for the task that it was created (remember perspective). This powerpack charges my phone. It charges it relatively quickly and it charges my battery (Samsung Galaxy SIII battery 2100 mAh) completely, which is an adequate expectation for this device measures at 2600 mAh. I do not expect this tiny lipstick charger to recharge my tablet (Nexus 10) or recharge any other large capacity battery. I see this as an emergency backup with the added function of an emergency flashlight. Considering my uses, this device is a great choice for my needs.As I mentioned, there are competing devices that are available at lower cost. I've not tested those and cannot comment on the build quality or the test results, but the prices are lower than the DE device. Likewise, I noticed a couple of design features missing that I would have loved to see at this price point. The first think I would have liked is an addition of a connector ring on the body of the light, something I might have used to hang this from a keyring for instance. Secondly, it would be nice if there were a rubberized fitting that covered the charging ports to lessen the possibility of contaminants.All things considered, I offer a solid 4-stars for this device.Thank you, GE and Filltech  for the opportunity to review this much appreciated Powerbank/Flashlight combo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L60Y5TWOCBRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","R3L60Y5TWOCBRO","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive appreciated the writing of Fr Thomas Dubay since the first works that were recommended to me. It seems odd to me in the context that his books were recommended, I was studying for certification in the field of spiritual direction, that this very book wasnt one of the required readings. I was fortunate to have stumbled upon it in the library of a monastery that I frequent and I am so very, very glad I found it.What sets this book apart from others I have read on the subject of spiritual direction is the straight-forwardness of the conversation. Fr Dubay is very clarifying in setting foundations, establishing definitions, and clearing up blurred lines and misinformation with regard to this neglected and needful gift to the Church.All of Part One addresses various aspects of spiritual direction and clarifies definitions. It is appropriately called A Foundation for Spiritual Direction. A couple of the more pertinent topics dealt with in this first section are What is Spiritual Direction? and Do I Need Spiritual Direction. I like that Fr Dubay is very direct, yet his answers and points made seem very thorough.Part Two of the book is a unique departure from the format of the first section. The questions presented, Practical Questions and Problems, are considered and responded to in an interview format. This worked very well for me as I felt myself drawn into a conversation; it was almost as if I were in the room with Fr Dubay and some anonymous interviewer. My attention was rapt and I learned much while topics such as Key Concerns in Spiritual Direction, Self Direction, and Problem that Come up in Spiritual Direction were discussed. Again, the content of the answers was very direct, but no lacking in detail and thoroughness.Part Three, Making Progress, returned to the same format of section one; instead of questions, there were bulleted discussion points, which Fr Dubay shared insights. This section spoke to measuring spiritual growth and discernment in the process of spiritual maturity.A very detailed notes section and an index are included helping the reader to have additional resources for follow up study and/or finding particular topics of interest in this book. It should be noted that the book and accompanying paradigm with which it is written is decidedly Roman Catholic. Let me state unequivocally that this fact alone should not deter reading if your background is that of another Christian tradition. There is a wealth, a cornucopia of spiritual wisdom in this book, Seeking Spiritual Wisdom. My background comes from the Protestant Evangelical stream of Christianity and I will continue to recommend this book with highest regard as one of the best books to clarify what spiritual direction is and the importance of its place and practice in the life of the Christian.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NR393S43WLWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0892838108#wasThisHelpful","R1NR393S43WLWX","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was first introduced to Sadhu Sundar Singh through the Devotional Classics (Richard Foster) around ten years ago. Reviewing my notes and highlights in my copy of Devotional Classics reminds me of how impacted and awed I was by the deep wisdom of Sundar Singh.Sadhu Sundar Singhs dramatic encounter with the living Christ, his refusal to clothe his faith with western trappings, and his absolute devotion to the way of Jesus make for compelling reading. I highly recommend this book. (Richard Fosterfrom the back cover)Im a big fan of devotional writing, so Im left with a big question mark to the reason Ive never added other works from the Sadhu to my personal library. Regardless, that omission will no longer be the source of questions for me as Ive added this latest compilation, Wisdom of the Sadhu: Teachings of Sundar Singh to my library. Not only has this volume inspired me since coming into my possession, but it has encouraged me to purchase more works produced by this profoundly spiritual and incredibly wise man.Wisdom of the Sadhu is a beautiful and delightful collection of sayings, parables, interviews, articles, and teachings from Sundar Singh. These collections are organized into themes and edited by Kim Comer. I feel Comer has done an excellent job with the collection and editing process; as Ive said already, this is a remarkable book and it will give the reader a fabulous introduction to the breadth and depth of the Sadhus teaching.So many people are impressed by human ingenuity and our ability to tap the power of lightning, wind, light, and all the other myriad forces of nature. Yet, to overcome the passions and seductions of this world and to gain mastery over oneself is truly a much greater achievement. By leading a life of prayer, we receive from God the gift to dwell in the spiritual realm even while we remain in the material world. If we live in prayer, no force of evil or temptation can overcome us; we remain in safe communion with God without any fear. If we abandon the gift of prayer, we become like well-trained animals and no longer recognize our own imperfection, our relationship with God, or our responsibility for our neighbors. -Sundar Singh; oneness with God, pg. 100As much as I enjoyed this book, I do have a small nit to pick. While there is a source listing at the end of the book, I prefer a more extensive citation and bibliography section. Perhaps this source list is enough, I havent researched it yet. Aside from this tiny peeve, I feel this is an excellent book and will enjoy dipping into the Wisdom of Sundar Singh again and again.I was provided a free copy by Plough Publishing House for a fair and honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U1Z8KPWCKFJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874869986#wasThisHelpful","R3U1Z8KPWCKFJC","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a pastor and a teacher in the ways of the Christian faith, I am always interested in the materials that can be helpful with my efforts to lead others in following Christ. This latest book from the Anglican Church in North America is a wonderful addition to my list of favorite resources.About the Book itself:Made of bonded black leather and embossed with gold lettering, the book is handsome with a clean aesthetic. It has dimensions of approximately 6 X 8 and weighs in with about 160 pages. It is not a thick book, but the weight of the paper and quality is such that it leaves me with no fears that I must handle the pages with a delicate touch to keep them from tearing. This book is meant to be used. There is also a single ribbon marker.Content and Instruction Philosophy:I love the premise for instruction and the flow of material presented. Truly, there is nothing new here and that is (in my opinion) part of the beauty. Likewise, I think there is an ecumenical bond when we hearken back to our most common denominators of the Christian faith. I believe this spirit is evident in the work produced in this Anglican Catechism.The primary teaching tools included in this work follow: Part One begins with the Gospel and the primary teachings of Christ concerning salvation; Part Two proceeds with Believing in Christ and enlists the Apostle's Creed as the center of focus for teaching ""what we believe."" A format of questions and answers following each line of the Creed helps to detail and explain the essence of each belief statement. Part Three introduces what it means to belong to Christ, Being Christ's, and teaches the basics of the Christian Life through the Lord's Prayer. The same line-by-line format of Q&A used with the Apostle's Creed is utilized in this section devoted to the Lord's Prayer. Part Four, Behaving Christianly, ventures deeper into the lifestyle of the Christian and continues the very effective format of line-by-line question and answer, this time using the Decalogue or Ten Commandments.  While not novel, I think this ""common denominator"" approach is brilliant in simplicity and consists of the most basic foundations of our Christian faith. In a day of consumeristic zeal for newer, fresher, better, and improved... I think there is a beauty and a grace for this approach to making disciples of Jesus Christ. It has worked for two millennia; there is no reason to attempt to reinvent the wheel.The Anglican Church has produced a beautiful and well-constructed catechism (discipleship tool). There are more exhaustive volumes available, but for the sake of simplicity and thoroughness as well as faithfulness to the core teaching of the Christian faith, I do not think you will find a better resource. You may find equals, but I am doubtful you will find better. This is a winner and I am blessed to add it to my favorite discipleship tools.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNXI16462CLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986044121#wasThisHelpful","R1BNXI16462CLL","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pictures, charts, maps, graphs, stories, details and more make up this beautifully bound edition of the World Atlas of Coffee. What's not to love about one of the world's greatest beverages? This book covers it all from berry to bean to brew and every point in between. There is no ""bean"" left uncovered as Hoffman (the author) journals the beginnings of the brew and teaches about all the variations of how the beverage is consumed. This edition is truly a global tour that leaves no question unanswered.The quality of the book is exceptional. The paper grade is very heavy and a semi-gloss finish. As mentioned, there are ample photographs and graphical details to appeal to the visual learner as much as the reader who loves their words.

"So far, this one is very good! There are some significant positives about this pillow (natural filling, hypo-allergenic, memory foam), and all of them seem to be right on spec. and I have no serious qualms or complaints. There are, however, a couple of small nits that keep me from ranking this pillow with 5-stars. First, it came with a acrid smell. It seems to be dissipating, but it lingers yet. It is possible that a washing and air dry will resolve this odor issue. Secondly, I wish the pillow had more fill. It lies a bit flat for my personal preference.

"I'm still trying to squeeze more love out of this very pretty, but minimalist watch/activity tracker.There's plenty here that I want to like, but *yawn* it's a bit boring. Quite honestly the novelty wore off almost before I finished the initial setup. It seems to me with the technology available (and inexpensively so), this watch could really excel with functionality. I think it misses the mark on several levels.First, my ""pro"" comments, I think it is a pretty watch. It is sleek and attractive in a minimalist design aesthetic. Construction is top quality. Ease of use is fairly intuitive, but borders on frustration with the two-button menu operation.Now, on the not-so-exciting side of the Wellograph Wellness Watch are these thoughts: (1) more practical functionality could be built-in at little or no additional cost. It's a digital watch. Why not a calendar or reminder alarms? (2) So far, the estimated distances and ""activity monitor"" have been way less than accurate. I'm not convinced that I will be able to trust the counters. It seems, again, that with a watch of this build, it would not have been too much difficulty to add an onboard GPS to help with the accuracy of distance traveled.I think my expectations might be skewed by my interactions with other technology and software. I believe a partnership with Wellograph and Android might have positioned this watch to really become a market force. Unfortunately, in my opinion it falls a little flat in everything that it tries to sell itself as.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTMSPWJTMOQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K74ZSD8#wasThisHelpful","R1GTMSPWJTMOQF","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based upon what I've experienced thus far, this is an exceptional printer for all that it offers and at this particular price point. I believe a buyer would be hard-pressed to get more performance and value for the buck. Seriously.My out-of-the-box experience was average. I think every experience is likely to vary, but from unboxing to setup on my WiFi network and actual print time was approximately 45 minutes. The majority of that time was spent during auto-setup when the printer was doing a ""head alignment"" (this took 15-20 minutes). Once the setup was complete, I have had nothing short of exemplary experience.I confess that I have not put the printer through all of its paces, there will be several functions that I will likely not use. I know I won't use the FAX feature, and it is unlikely I will do any printing from the cloud services, but scanning, copying, printing from USB devices and general document printing will be my mainstays. In all of these services and functions, this machine flat out excels. I have personally never owned a home or small business sized printer that is as fast as this one is. The first exercise of copying a document, I actually thought I had made an error in feeding the document...it was almost instantaneous. The printed document was printed almost simultaneously with the document being scanned through the ADF. Seriously. I was incredulous.Letter clarity and color reproduction seem very good. I think I'll see a significant improvement on photo print quality when I use photo grade paper, but I don't have any on hand to evaluate that just yet, but photo imaging on regular paper is quite good.As I mentioned, this system has many, many features and possibilities and I've not even begun to scratch the surface. The manual is in .pdf for and measures a whopping 41mb in size and over 900 pages!!! I do not know what the output of prints will be for the inkwells, but if they are anything like my MP560, I'll be a happy fellow.I've enjoyed Canon print products in the past and still have a MP-560 in service at this very moment.

"I'm generally a little skeptical of energy/protein bars as they are often confused about their identity. Some think they are ""candy"" bars and others think they are nutrition bars disguised to taste like candy (and often failing).

"I appreciated reading Preston Yancey's Tables in the Wilderness. I also respect his articulation of his spiritual journey. There are certainly differences in interpretation and experience of encountering God...and I didn't expect his journey to necessarily align with my own. It was with this openness and acceptance to listen that I ""listened and heard"" Yancey's story.Tables in the Wilderness is the story of a ""package"" unraveled and then reassembled. So many people who have a Christian belief system assume to have God figured out along with all the nuanced postures, rites, and religious doo-dahs in place to function as a member of their specific Jesus tribe. Yancey proceeds to share his systems, the worlds that formed them...and the worlds that were their undoing, and ultimately when they were deconstructed, how his understanding and experience of God started to be reconstructed.I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this book. Yancey seems to write from a very bare and vulnerable place. It is difficult for me to accept the harsh criticism of some of the more insensitive reviews concerning details of Yancey's Christian views in his memoir, especially when the subject of this book is a ""personal experience"" and confession of sorts...and not a theological treatise. Every Christian's journey is going to be a personal experience, often born out of corporate interactions, but personal nonetheless and this is what Yancey reveals in his memoir. Some of what is written is ""heady"" and perhaps comes across as being over-thought, but this is the personality of the writer being revealed. I very much appreciated the authenticity.It is possible the fond connection I have to Yancey's story are the similarities I found with my own story. I understood precisely what he was trying to convey when he was confronted with his false self and judgemental views of other Christian pilgrims when I read the following words:""It happens slowly, the way it becomes about us and not about God. It happens when we change our email signatures to include that we are pastors, when we sit a little straighter in our chairs when we talk about the Bible, when we look at people like they should defer to us because we are the ones who know. We aren't a Family anymore. We are two people and those other people. We are us and they are them. It happens before you realize it has happened. It happens the moment you believe that your spirituality has surpassed that of someone else, that you can be their Holy Spirit."" (pg. 85).Similarly, as Yancey begins opening himself to the undoing of the false self and allows God the Holy Spirit to transform his own mind and heart, his perspective of others begins to be a revelation of grace, compassion, patience, and love. I connected with this maturing grace and Christian love when I read the following:""If we get tripped up by the words about God, we miss God in the process. It took me a long time, but I eventually gave up the need to always call the Eucharist the Eucharist and instead use the words Communion, Lord's Supper, and Eucharist with an interchangeable grace. I let circumstance dictate my word choice, I let context determine my response. Because there was a time there where I and The Church of the Windowless Resurrection were essentially one and the same. We were both fighting, clawing, thrashing to prove who we were not."" (pg. 225).This is a book about grace. This is a book about self-knowing. This is a book about seeking and searching. It is not systematic theology and it is not about articles of faith. It is the soul of one man baring a personal experience and inner conversations with the Triune Godhead. If Tables in the Wilderness is read from this perspective, it is likely you will find connections with your own journey and even more likely you will enjoy the conversation as you get to know Preston Yancey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S77TUC3V5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310338824#wasThisHelpful","R2S77TUC3V5H","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is for the Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Amplified Stereo Gaming Headset for Xbox One and Mobile Devices... catch those last words ""and mobile devices."" Understand from the outset that all the nifty features of this headset are specifically targeted to the Xbox One and you'll be delighted. If, on the other hand, you think any of those features will be cross-platform (eg., ""and mobile devices"") you will be let down.I was most hopeful I would be able to use the detachable mic for Skype calls and phone calls with my Samsung S3.

"I was a little bit skeptical at the time I ordered this phone mount. I was unsure if it would be secure in the vent, I was unsure if it would hold my phone securely, and I was unsure of its longevity and durability. I've been using if for almost a week now and I'm confident about 2 out of 3 of my concerns. It holds securely in the vent of my car (Ford Taurus) and it holds my big Samsung S3 in its Otter Box case just fine...over bumps and my fiddling with it pressing buttons and generally putting the phone through its paces.I'm not sure how it will hold up in the long run, but I'm more confident about the build quality now that I've had it in my hands than I was before I actually knew how this little grip was put together.

"I'm a long time user of the George Foreman Grill line. My older grill continues to see service in my kitchen despite the non-stick coating on it failing in various spots. I was pretty stoked when I was given the opportunity to review one the newer GF grills, especially when a couple of the selling points like ""new and improved"" non-stick surface and easier cleanup were revealed.One of the minor issues I had with my old grill was some leakage from the grill top to the drip pan. Right away I noticed an improvement in the new grill drip pan. A tiny design change has made the drip catcher much more effective. I count this a win before ever plugging the grill up.I think the effectiveness of the non-stick coating will take awhile before knowing how much better (if any) it is, but my first uses show that it works just fine. I was making panini last night and the grill functioned fine. My sandwiches started out 2-2.5 inches when i put them on the grill and the grill had ample range of motion to ""sandwich"" the panini with even pressure all around.If I have any critique, it would be in the advertisement of this particular size being a 4-serving surface. Serving size might be subjective, but I'm not sure I could fit two sandwiches on this grill side-by-side. Nothing negative to say about the machine though. It works perfectly and looks to be a little improved over the previous models I've owned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQJECGL5H6R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP3ZPVK#wasThisHelpful","RJQJECGL5H6R4","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spiritual wisdom can come from almost anywhere if one takes the time to look closely and listen deeply. This little book is a prime example of this timeless advice to slow down, look closely, and listen deeply.Using the example and metaphor of the vineyard and vinedresser (one that is used in the Christian Bible quite often), Judith Sutera, with illustrations by Paul Soupiset, help their reader to see the work of God in spiritual lessons found in the nursing and care of vines and grapes. This is not a difficult book to read and the terms used are not hard to understand. Each devotional thought is only a couple pages long (not counting the illustrations), and a single topic reading will only take a matter of minutes. The beauty of this simplicity is the depth of reflection and personal application that comes from the insight gleaned from the  vinedresser's care and feeding of his vineyard.Wisdom doesn't always have to be hard-earned. Sometimes it can be received as the gift it is. The Vinedresser's Notebook is one of those gifts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NUH2RLITFIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426773838#wasThisHelpful","R16NUH2RLITFIL","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really handsome french press. The brushed steel, glass decanter sleeve, is very clean looking as well as functional, helping to keep the contents hot/warm much longer than if the glass were exposed.Functionality is good and the press lives up to the claims of OXO as long as you observe their instructions. French press coffee is normally made with a coarser grind of the beans. Finer grinds can escape the plunger screen and get into the final pour, but with a little experimentation you'll find the right grind blend and those problems will be resolved. I have found no loss in taste quality with a coarser blend, although a slightly longer steep time may be necessary. Again, experimentation is encouraged to find the right mix of grind consistency, steep time, to taste expectations.The silicon grounds holder is a nice feature and works mostly as advertised. I wonder how long the little ladle will last as I'm not convinced that repeated use under the high heat conditions won't warp or disfigure it otherwise. For now, it works fine, but time will be the determining judge of this design feature.I've long thought cleanup of french press coffee makers was a pain, this unit is no different except that OXO recommends NOT using a dishwasher. I may disregard those instructions just to test whether or not it really effects the function of the parts. I suspect placing the pieces on the top rack of my dishwasher might prove that all works just fine, but this also is test I've yet to try.My summary is that this is a good Press. As I mentioned, a little experimentation can go a long way to help ensure a pleasant experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQHVS1PNSYK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYL4MOA#wasThisHelpful","R1KQHVS1PNSYK2","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow! Am I loving this little grater! I must admit that starting out (due to my own inept setup) I struggled a bit with this very simple and effective kitchen gadget. I failed to ""snap"" the handle into place securely, so turning the drum was a bit cumbersome with the handle slipping off the gear. Additionally, I did not fully secure the vacuum suction seal, which made the grater slip along my counter top. I was a little concerned about these things and wondered about the build quality, but after slowing down my setup and reassembling the unit after its first cleaning I realized the mistakes I had made.Once I secured the handle and figured out I was only turning the ""suction ring"" halfway, my problems were a distant blur. I have had nothing but delightful experiences with this little guy since my faux pas during the first encounter.I usually use a flat hand-held grater from most of the tasks I am using this drum unit (and it has not been uncommon for me to cut or scrape my fingers in the process). What a world of difference! Cheese grating? A snap! root vegetables? No problem! Clean up? A breeze! Cut fingers?

"These are nice in-ear headphones. They do everything that they advertise very well. Sound quality is near the best I've experienced for in-ear devices and the assortment of earbuds for comfort fit is impressive; there should not be any problem for anyone finding the ""right fit"" for their ears. I happen to have a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone, so this headset should work flawlessly with my phone, since it is listed as a compatible device on the Samsung product page. Unfortunately, I am unable to get the remote to advance tracks and have only been able to adjust volume and pause. The S-Voice function works with advancing tracks or skipping tracks, but that's a bit cumbersome for me as I don't want to ""tell"" my phone what to do, I'd simple like to quickly skip a track (and without taking my phone out of my pocket). Also, I wish the remote was not located so high and close to my chin.I've owned and tested quite a few sets of headphones: in-ear, over ear, and on ear. These are not the best. They're good, but not worth the price point.

"I've been running this little WiFi extender for about two weeks now. It has been absolutely flawless in performance and function.To start, this device is ridiculously easy to setup and install. From unboxing to online and extending my LAN was under 15 minutes. The setup was as easy as plugging the extender into a powerstrip next to my router and waiting for the device link light to sync (this indicates there has been a connection between the LAN router and the extender). Once the extender connected to the router, I simply selected the extender from the list of available WiFi connections on my laptop, typed in an admin address in my browser and followed a very simple little network setup wizard, which totaled maybe four clicks of the mouse. That's it. Setup complete.Following setup, I installed a Netgear WiFi Analytics app on my Android smartphone, which helped me locate the best possible placement of the extender in my home. This app is available for free in the Android App Play Store. This is a cool little app that measures Router signal strength, conducts throughput tests from various rooms and locations in your home, and shows other networks that might be competing on the channel spectrums around you. It does some other helpful stuff too.I placed my extender in the best place for my network and connected a couple of devices to it. I've experienced zero down time and no reported dropouts. Signal strength to both devices that are connecting to the extender are showing 100% and throughput is showing 39Mbps and 54Mbps respectively. This is certainly not hardline speeds, but gaming and video streams are solid as a rock after initial buffering.I've had other extenders operating on my LAN (Namely the Linksys N300) and this little wonder beats it like a drum. Count me one very, very happy network extended camper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CB4W0XBHEOPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0YLRUW#wasThisHelpful","R1CB4W0XBHEOPA","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't our first Bissell vacuum; in fact, this 1322 Model is upgrading our present Powerforce 6579 model... and it is an upgrade in almost every measurable sense.First, the vacuum required some minor assembly, which was a literal snap to put together with the exception of two small screws used to secure the handle. The remaining pieces, hose and accessories ""snapped"" right into place in various fitted spaces on the vacuum itself. While there is an instruction manual with images detailing the assembly, it was so intuitive I did not even need it. Total assembly time including opening boxes and disposal of boxes... maybe 15 minutes.Next, was the basic sweeper test over standard pile shag carpet. As I mentioned, we are moving from a Bissell bagless upright, so I liken our comparison as apple to apple. I read one review that stated this machine was loud. I'll have to report that review claim as subjective because comparing to our 6579 model this 1322 is MUCH quieter, so we count the engine noise as a noticeable improvement. Ergonomics as reported by my wife was not as much an improvement in this newer model. She complained that the weight of the new 1322 unit was substantially more than the older vacuum and it tired her arm out before she was finished with the living room floor. I should note that physically, the units are almost identical in build form and size...I'm not sure where the additional weight comes from, but when I picked them up to compare heft, the 1322 did feel heavier.Continuing with our actual test, the 1322 proved itself a clear winner in the cleaning department. I was amazed at the amount of dust, dirt, lint, and stuff that this thing brushed and sucked out of the floor carpet. I'm not sure where to attribute this noticeable improvement in capability from, but I think the brush design is likely part of the reason. This vacuum features a Triple Action Brush Roll in its PR write-ups and it is very different than the brush roller on the 6579 model we had before it. The write-up says ""it improves cleaning performance."" It most definitely did for us!A couple of additional bonus finds with this new unit was 2 more foot of power cord. The length of the power cord in the older unit was 25ft. and this unit comes in at 27ft. Also, the self rewinding feature of the cord and its internal housing make it super convenient. The ""wow factor"" that had my wife squeeing and smiling was the turbo brush attachment that can be used for stairs and close in cleaning. This little attachment head has a rotating brush head similar to the main brush roller on the primary unit! Not only is this a great idea, but it works great! As the saying goes, it's the little things that matter and these little things added up in a big way.All things considered, this is a great upgrade for us. I'm sure there will be some reviews that might not be as glowing as our experience, but I'm sure it depends on what you're comparing this unit to. Our comparison is to another Bissell of similar build and capability. This newer unit seems to have added some enhanced features that truly make a difference. We noted that it cleans much better, it is quieter than our older Bissell, the retractable cord and the turbo brush attachment are both improvements, and the cost factor at $120 is very reasonable for this vacuum. Our only negative comment is minor and that would be the weight of the unit, but with all the other positive improvements this is a minor issue we'll easily get over soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MRCNGJHD3DF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KR5UMM4#wasThisHelpful","R2MRCNGJHD3DF4","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been working with this NAS device now for a little over a week. I've devoted somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 or more hours of actual time invested to get it operable with the basic functions I would expect (which are advertised) for my needs. Let me state that (1) I am not a neophyte when it comes to WAN/LAN operations (2) I'm not a hardware tech newbie (3) I have networking experience across several platforms and operating systems. I should also qualify that I'm not an expert in these areas, but I have vocational experience that has been adequate for all my technical needs.Spec details: On Comcast Cable, DLINK Router, Primary OS's Windows XP, Windows 7, Ubuntu Linux, Android 4.3 and 4.4 (Samsung Galaxy S3 and Nexus 10)I've read quite a few of the reviews for this device and while I won't say that this device isn't ""plug and play,"" I will say that has NOT been my experience. I think each user might find a different experience with the out-of-the-box set up. There are simply too many variables to consider for this to be a one-size-fits-all device. My experience has been rather frustrating to finally arrive at the point where my WD My Cloud NAS is working to my reasonable satisfaction. I have spent a number of hours on the http://community.wd.com/t5/WD-My-Cloud/bd-p/mycloud forum seeking information for setup tweaks and workarounds to get this device up and running. The tone of the reviews states that this has not been everyone's experience, but from time spent on the WD community forums, I am not alone.General headaches experienced is stablilizing the DHCP assignment so the device remains constant (you can do this by statically assigning an IP Address or reserving a DHCP address in your router). This step will be necessary to prevent drop-outs or intermittant connectivity issues. Another is minor conflict with Antivirus Software and Firewall system (slowing data transfer speeds and disappearing NAS from network).One of the primary roles I wanted for this NAS was for media streaming (movies and music). The promotional information pushes this feature rather prominently, but I had problems from the get go. First, the WD My Cloud uses the Twonky Media Server DLNA software (embedded in the firmware I assume) and this software does not play well with the formatting of my movies. I admit that I have movies in multiple formats (AVI, MKV, MP4, XVID, and DiVXX to name a few), but I have no problems streaming these movies with PLEX media server. I also have a ROKU device that should be able to work with DLNA media servers, but it does not like the Twonky Server very much either. This created quite the headache for me. I was able to eventually get the push the movie files through my ROKU, but in order to do this my computer (where the PLEX server is hosted) must be on and it is necessary to run the movies through the PLEX channel on my ROKU.Another headache is that the NAS does not simply ""show up"" in my network across all the devices connected. I'm not sure why this is, but I have narrowed it down to firewall protection on some devices (by disabling the firewall, the NAS shows up), but I'm unable to figure out yet why this happens on other devices... I'm still troubleshooting and working through this issue. It is curious to me why this occurs, it might be easy to blame my firewall, but the problem doesn't occur with other UPnP devices like my wireless printers or even another NAS (Buffalo 1TB NAS). Both of the aforementioned devices showed up immediately when connected to my LAN.Still another headache came with mobile connections. The implied understanding of the software for the mobile apps (I have an Android Smartphone Galaxy S3 and Android Nexus 10 pad) is run the software, send a assignment code to the mobile device and you're up and running. Simple enough right? No. I was able to connect with ease across my network, but when tested outside on the 4G/3G network I could not login. Back to the forum for answers and I found multiple persons with the same issue. The fix turned out to be port forwarding assignments in the router config. This was not a big deal, but I point it out for people who might not be comfortable messing with this type of config in their router. Even more on point, this was not a plug it in and go ordeal either.I'm not overly satisfied with data transfer either. There is no way that I've figured yet to plug directly into the NAS for device to device data transfer. The recommended ""hardwire"" transfer config is to go with a hardwire connection to the network (direct CAT5 connect to your router) and of course the direct CAT5 to the NAS WD Cloud device. Reports from other owners state this is a fast connection; however, it is inconvenient to set this up for my setup and my wireless transfers havee been between 3MB and 7MB at best. I do not understand why the engineers did not enable the possibility of a USB3 direct connection to the NAS from your transfering device. Seems like a neglectful oversight to me.There are still some applications I've yet to setup and test, like an auto backup schedule, but for the most part I do have the system operational and meeting the most of my needs...albeit much headache. I think the device is suitable for the needs it meets, but it is not universally plug and play. If you lack tech savvy, you might be gambling whether this will work for you out of the box. If you've got some tech savvy and don't mind the possibility of some legwork to get this thing up and running... it's a decent answer for you personal Cloud Storage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285E37A8M94LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVVGAC6#wasThisHelpful","R285E37A8M94LE","A24FG2MW7O8JWP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24FG2MW7O8JWP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After receiving this book as a gift some weeks ago and reading it probably several dozen times, I came to amazon to write a glowing review about its content and was pretty surprised to see the number of negative reviews concerning the book's ability to ""teach your child to whine"" or the ""lack of punishment"" for the young main character.To sum up the book, young Bella describes all the ways in which she was a major brat on a particular day. You got everything in the toddler arsenal here: refusing a certain food, taking shoes off randomly, complaining about crap that doesn't amount to a hill of beans, yelling in public, etc. etc. Then (SPOILER ALERT!), Bella apologizes to her mommy at the end of the book and said it was a rough day, to which her mommy replies, ""We all have those days sometimes."" Then, Bella is shown as being ""CHEERFUL ALL DAY LONG!"" the following day.I love this book because the pictures are really entertaining. The text changes places on almost every page and varies in size. When Bella's words are HUGE and in bold black text, I scream them and my kid laughs uncontrollably. Bella's baby brother's name is Bob, and a toddler pointing to a baby and saying, ""Bob!"" is hilarious. I can't stress enough the entertainment value of the way this book is composed. It is lots of fun for kids and lots of fun for the adult reading it. You can be as subdued or as outrageous as you want when you narrate this book to your child.Now, all my personal additions:If you're on the fence about the book, allow me to pull you off to my side. This book is HILARIOUS. I am 32 years old, I have two toddlers, and I am sick. to. death. of reading some of these books in my kids' room. I mean just sick. Like if my kid pulls out the ""Let's All Share and Be Kind to Everyone!"" book one more time I'm going to scream. ""My No, No, NO Day"" is a breath of fresh air from the usual ""if you read this to your kids surely they'll be perfectly behaved little robots, no?"" fodder that eats up my children's bookshelves. This book is about a real kid, and her real mom, on a real bad day. This book is real life down here in the trenches of parenthood, and stay-at-home parenthood in particular.Look, children are simply small adults. In fact, they really have it worse because they're small yet have all these feelings and urges that they don't understand. I have long taken exception to the idea that children will be (or even should be!) perfectly-behaved all the time. Decent human beings and decent citizens of their community? Yes. But taking off their shoes or complaining that their peas are too hot? Is this really worthy of a poor review? I consider someone who complains about this book to be the type who either does not know how or does not want to discipline his or her child. A book is not going to teach your child to complain about toothpaste. My toddler knows the difference between acting nice and acting mean. But we all manage to have a good laugh together at this funny and entertaining little book. It's just a book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R4L45U9J3BC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670014052#wasThisHelpful","R1R4L45U9J3BC4","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is the case that holds all my toddlers' assorted Little Einstein and Sesame Street DVDs - along with the ones their grandparents keep buying them even though I've said a thousand times they have more than enough.

The plastic sleeves don't seem all that sturdy (and you have to pull the tab out of every sleeve before you use it - see my photo) and I do worry that eventually they're going to start ripping out, especially as little kids aren't typically the most gentle with their belongings.

The colors are simple and not too distracting. I'm of the opinion that a potty seat needs to be just a potty seat: not bright colors, not musical, not making sounds. Just a potty.

Laptops are commonly measured across the SCREEN ONLY, not the entire laptop. This bag would fit a laptop that is 17"" TOTAL size including the  area around the screen. But no, it will not fit an actual 17"" laptop.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123E3N27PKT3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LRU51Q#wasThisHelpful","R123E3N27PKT3M","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My toddler really, really loves this bed. I thought the price was a little ridiculous for a toddler bed, but specialty ones like this are all in this range. We sold a few furniture items around the house to save up some extra money for this particular bed. It was so worth it. It doesn't look like amazon still allows videos in reviews, but I took a video of his reaction when he walked into the room.The bed came in two large, heavy boxes. It was easy to assemble - I entertained two toddlers while my husband put it together in less than an hour. It's big and sturdy and I can see it as a bedroom favorite through our next toddler, too! I'm really glad we ""splurged"" on this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6AT12D6Y8OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYUG3U0#wasThisHelpful","RU6AT12D6Y8OT","A2I0QZID5TQSLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I0QZID5TQSLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works great in my multi-needle Brother embroidery machine.
