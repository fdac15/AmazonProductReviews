"My daughter is now eschewing antiperspirants with aluminum. She shaves her armpits every day. We were seeking a deodorant that works well. Tom's of Maine did not make muster. This EO Organic citris spray allows you to sweat without the associated smell. I don't know how it works but my daughter has been using it and loves it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9YRAMVXOP2X6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J51MCPQ#wasThisHelpful","R9YRAMVXOP2X6","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sparkling fruit beverage and it tasted great - too great for unsweetened, flavored mineral water. One look on the back of the can told me why. It has plenty of sugar in it - as much as a regular soda. No wonder it tasted so good!We use a splash of this in our grapefruit flavored unsweetened seltzer water & enjoy the delicious flavor with only a little bit of sugar. One good thing about this brand is that it contains real citrus juice and real sugar. It makes an excellent mixer with vodka or white wine too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXQ855M4YADW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGMWOFG#wasThisHelpful","R3VXQ855M4YADW","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sturdy cowhide leather belt designed for bigger waists. I've worked with leather in the past and used belt blanks from Tandy leather stores going back to the 1970s, so this belt is much more ""floppy"" than the thick & stiff leather belt blanks of old & slightly thinner than a Carhartt leather work belt. It is made in India.I like the leather sleeve on the outer part of the belt buckle. It will prevent the belt from wearing as much when cinching it for tightness (big men need to do this so pants will stay up). The belt buckle is attached by folded-over-and-sewn leather (no snaps) so it will not suddenly break away. I ordered one size larger than jeans and it fits well. Leather will stretch when pressure or moisture (water,sweat) is applied to it, so you will need a hole punch to put extra holes in it as it stretches. It is best to alternate belts and give each a ""rest"" for a week so they dry out and shrink somewhat. Good price for a leather belt.This is the 2nd belt we've purchased from Timberland. It lasts and lasts but the belt loop came off after two years. We could have stitched it back if I still had my leather crafting toolkit with the special thread & needles, but I don't so we just ordered a new belt. I think any shoe repair place could also have fixed the loop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MQP8F9P0VZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCW829K#wasThisHelpful","R25MQP8F9P0VZL","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased from another online vendor, same exact item. The metal bottom is not weighted, so it is not stable enough to hold the weight in the seat. The higher up you need your seat bottom to be, the less stable these stools become. I tried them out on low pile carpet and also on hard kitchen floors - same result.The faux leather looks nice and is cushioned but screws hold the seat to the metal base and you install the screws. They are not very long or thick screws, which translates into less secure seating. The stools do not easily swivel despite the claim.The metal is thin for the shaft and so is the ring where people are supposed to rest their feet.Overall, I would not purchase these bar stools again or recommend them since I think that they are hazardous and not engineered to withstand the weight of adults over 150 lbs, despite the fact that the weight limit stated in the brochure is 150kg.= 330.693!!  It feels as though the bar stool will tip over any second, that moving around in it creaks and sounds like it will break away, and it is too low for my kitchen countertop/bar if I use the lowest setting. I do not recommend. Save your money and use it toward commercial well-made more heavy duty stools of this design or bar stools with four legs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W0PE877A0O89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVWGC54#wasThisHelpful","R3W0PE877A0O89","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product review is for Jarrow-Zymes for Gluten Digestion. Directions are 1-3 capsules (1 capsule=170mg) before each meal containing gluten. Each capsule is capable of digesting 20 grams of gluten.I had a bad reaction to this product after eating an evening meal that had a 4x4” piece of gluten flour product. I felt as if my stomach was going to explode. I can normally eat & digest gluten without issues. I could not sleep well all night, the pain awakened me repeatedly and the discomfort lasted into the next day and finally subsided in the afternoon. I won’t be trying this product again. I do take a daily probiotic in the morning - either Dr. Ohhira or Enzymatic Therapy Acidophilus Pearls, however.I think my gut is very reactive to fungus and I read that this product contains fungal-derived enzymes. Ten years ago, I was unable to tolerate Florastor probiotic (contains a yeast-based cells) and experienced a similar reaction. Although Florastor contains some lactose, when I consume dairy products, I do not experience this almost-bursting,  painful feeling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MEGFM62KUVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OA57LI#wasThisHelpful","R4MEGFM62KUVA","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book, Unfinished Business, is the expansion of an article written by Anne-Marie Slaughter in The Atlantic magazine - “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.” It is no wonder so many people clamored to read it since its title is almost as socially provocative as the 2000 article in The Sciences journal - “Why Men Rape.” Post publication, there was some negative feedback from working mothers - outliers to the article’s privileged career microcosm - complaining that Slaughter was “perpetuating ‘plutocrat’ feminism” (p. xxi). The outliers were correct.Slaughter’s book discusses the insidious bias & challenges encountered by working caregivers (e.g., Moms/Dads) & she challenges everyone to rethink workplace policies & social orientation to working caregivers, examine caregiving & career expectations in relationships, & reevaluate national attitudes toward the value attributed to caregiving. While these issues have plagued working caregivers for too long, they are hardly new. Including them in a book adds to the squeaky wheel phenomenon however, which may foster the remedying oil of new legislation.This book was a slow, arduous read - the author’s ad nauseam self-aggrandizing distracted from the meat of the matter. Slaughter affirms her inflated concept of self when summing up the outliers’ accusations toward her as “having high-class problems of powerful women like myself.” One of these high-class problems cited in the book was relegating hairdresser appointments & errand shopping to weekends while working for the government in D.C. - a trend most working caregivers take in stride as inevitable.Young [wo]men pursuing careers today will be unable to emulate Slaughter’s career/parental home life success since most will likely witness the abolition of tenure in academia & never realize the numerous perks enjoyed by Slaughter & Co. Slaughter even admits on the first page of Chapter 1 that divulging her path to success may be discouraging to others: “[…]I managed to have a high-powered career [….] was by being a tenured professor at a top university married to another tenured professor[…].”As for Slaughter’s appreciation of the other 98%’s work/caregiving tribulations, she has no notion of what is entailed when new Moms return to work with nursing 6-week old newborns in tow. She abandoned full-time parenting when she began “excellent” daycare for her three-month old babies despite employing a full-time housekeeper, being off-work on paid leave for six months, concurrent with/followed by hubby’s six-month leave, plus both were off for an additional entire semester. While Slaughter may claim that baby bonding & caregiving is of utmost importance & the nation should reorient its mind-set, her own conduct eschewed such convictions when she opted to pay caregivers to watch her three-month old babies & not use the paid time-off given to her. Slaughter has now moved on to running New America. A look at its Facebook page will find many promos for this book.While I balked at the obvious career hubris and sense of entitlement of its author, this book’s message has merit & discusses the pervasive discriminatory issues toward caregivers, which earns it an extra review star. When the D.C. Council recently decided to grant 16 weeks of paid family leave to caregivers of immediate relatives or self, it took a step toward remedying the issues discussed in the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R170MC659XJ891/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812994566#wasThisHelpful","R170MC659XJ891","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inuyashiki Volume 1 is adult manga published by Kodansha Comics for ages 16 & up.  It is a touching story with impressive artwork.The story details the hurt and difficulties the main character, Ichiro, experiences with ageism. Then, something amazing occurs & Ichiro undergoes a metamorphosis and becomes a new, improved person.The art work is clean, depictive and beautiful. The story is compelling although a big extreme regarding Ichiro’s abuse. The book reads like most manga - read from right to left. The story is easy to follow and the prose good. I would definitely keep reading this series. I appreciate that the manga does not begin with the characters introducing themselves, like most manga stories do. In fact, thought bubbles are infrequently used in manga, but I enjoyed them. The images and context are what convey Ichiro’s emotions & inner thoughts, which is executed effectively as I became immersed in the story.

"I was happy to be able to buy this book of old maps that were compiled from actual surveys in 1878. I have seen parts of them online where I could purchase them, but I had no reason to trust these websites.Originally published in 1879, it appears that for some reason the Montgomery County Historical Society was able to gain copyright in 1975 to this Atlas.

"We avoid artificial sweeteners and drink water, almond/coconut milk, and flavored seltzer most of the time. Since we are unused to these sweeteners, we can detect them in everything. After one taste of the SoBe Lifewater, we disliked the flavor. I misunderstood the ""no artificial sweetener"" blurb to mean that it contained cane sugar. I was planning to use these drinks for an extended family gathering.The ingredients in products are listed in the order of amount and Erythritol* is the 2nd ingredient listed after filtered water. Stevia leaf extract is also among the ingredients and we think it adds to its displeasing taste.• Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that is manufactured commercially by fermenting a sugar-rich substance like glucose with a fungus like yeast. Our bodies do not break it down due to its chemical structure, so it can cause digestive issues but most of Erythritol is absorbed by the small intestine and about 90% is excreted by the kidneys.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BL52V4ZALG2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HPRRUG#wasThisHelpful","R1BL52V4ZALG2C","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thie Intermatic IW600K offers numerous applications like random on/off for lighting variations while away on vacation, dusk-to-dawn settings that auto adjusts to daylight savings, and a rechargeable battery backup.I could not install the Intermatic IW600K where I had intended - motion sensor floodlights that turn on via motion sensor & can be set in three modes via the switch inside - steady on all the time, motion sensor (which comes on every time a car drives down the street, or a deer wanders into its path), or off.

"This wonderful moisturizer comes out of the tube like a typical bead of white moisturizer but once rubbed onto the skin, turns color. It is fun to watch!I have very light skin and the foundations that match are typically ivory or pale in color. What is nice about this tinted moisturizer is that the color sinks into my skin. While it looks like a yellowish tan color as I am first applying it on my face, the color quickly blends well with my natural skin tone. It appears as though it disregards of the hue of my skin and blends in anyway.I also like it as a tinted moisturizer for wearing alone on hot days when foundation seems too heavy. I have also worn it under the mousse foundation I usually wear, which is dry & not oily, and it works well underneath that product as well.

"Cellucor NO3 Chrome Solid is a stimulant- & creatine-free pre-workout supplement in capsule form. The NO3 is nitric oxide that acts as a vasodilator which allows greater blood flow (oxygen & nutrients) to muscles/organs. Three capsules contain Vitamin C (83mg-138% RDA), Calcium (83mg-1% RDA) Arginine Nitrate [NO3-T] (1250mg), + Extreme Vascularity Complex (750mg) Nitrosigine Inositol-Stabilized Arginine.**You need to take the capsules on an empty stomach at least 1 - 1.5 hours before working out. My daughter’s 28-yr old boyfriend followed the directions but stated that he felt no changes and his workout was the same after 4-capsule doses on at least four occasions and he took no other workout supplements. However, my son, who has used the powdered version of various Nitric Oxide pre-workout supplements, suggested combining the capsules with a 2nd pre-workout supplement (e.g., Cellucor C4). Yet C4 has caffeine, which is an ingredient that Cellucor NO3 eliminated in its formula.

"This is a sci-fi movie about AI androids who have feelings but are mistreated by humans. One man, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson - son of Brendan Gleeson) a talented programmer (coder) is called upon, under false pretenses, to administer the Turing Test (can a human ascertain via conversation/questions if test subject is a machine) to a particular android. The hard-drinking CEO (Nathan - Oscar Issac) of the company Caleb works for, brings Caleb to his isolated mountain retreat to administer his testing of the beautiful and beguiling android, Ava (Alicia Vikander). Secrets and intrigue begin to unfold and viewers are kept wondering who to believe and just how far genius Nathan has crossed the ethical/moral line in creating his masterpiece.There is a Star Trek reference in the movie that I found telling since one of Star Trek's episodes features a beautiful android female created by an immortal who wanted her to have feelings but she was destroyed in the process. I did not think that this movie was original enough or had enough oomph to sufficiently intrigue me. I lost interest halfway through but watched until the end.

"I am very pleased with this Ocean Waves clear glass pitcher with lid. It is sturdy with a handle the extends out from the body of the pitcher sufficiently to allow my ham-fisted paw to grasp it with ease. It comes with a rigid plastic red lid that has a cut-out slot which, when aligned with the spout, allows a modest flow of liquid. The lid remains in place while pouring a full pitcher half filled with ice cubes preventing the ice cubes from tumbling out willy nilly & accidentally splashing liquids onto tablecloths or the laps of recipients holding glasses to be filled.The pitcher holds almost 1/2 gallon but viewing it side-by-side with a 1/2 gallon carton of milk, it appears deceptively smaller. I wish the red lid was designed with a rubber-like seal so refrigerator odors & pesky flies never reach whatever libation it holds, but the slot, however minimal, prevents such a seal.I like its more petite silhouette since, once filled with liquid, it is more manageable than larger pitchers which can be challenging to hold aloft while filling individual glasses around a table or toting on a tray. My hand can fit inside the pitcher for cleaning, which is a plus.

"I purchased this wheelchair for my mother when she needs to go out to appointments etc. I had a difficult time collapsing it, however.I needed a wheelchair where she could roll herself a little bit if she wanted to. This chair has plastic foot rests and they can be annoying in certain scenarios. If you put them to the side, the wheelchair is too wide for a standard interior doorway. If they are left down and front, you will need plenty of maneuvering room as you go forward. We easily removed them completely, which is a nice feature, but may not be practical for some.I was able to snag this in Amazon's warehouse deals so I paid far less than the current price.

When they arrived I noticed that they were made in China, smelled strongly of plastic, and were not leather.

These clear tubs are small enough that loading them to the brim and lifting them is something that can be accomplished by children and people who do not have much strength.

While she cannot easily lift them when full, I can. I bought the 2nd set for my own displaced desk documents that were cluttering up my kitchen table.

"The Rising, by author Ryan D’Agostino, is the consolidation of articles he wrote for Esquire magazine - “A House on the River” (2013) & “The Survivor” (2011) with perhaps additional details. The book recounts the horrific, real-life events that took place when the spouse & two young daughters of endocrinologist William Petit, Jr. were tortured, sexually assaulted, and brutally killed as the family home was set afire in an attempt to hide evidence. A victim who was attacked first by the intruders, Petit was beaten with a bat in the head. Hooded & tied up in the basement, despite losing so much blood (due to blood thinning meds) Petit survived by escaping just as the house began to go up in smoke & flame.Since an author must rely on the candor of his source - William Petit, Jr. - it does not surprise this reader that the complaints and conflicts of most families are absent in this book. The narrative smacks of Petit’s directives so every Petit family member’s virtues are recounted repeatedly and extolled. Disciplined, brilliant, successful, hard-working, moral, compassionate, generous, & devoted to each other sums up each member of the Petit extended family. The only negative observation about anyone is that Petit usually exercises supreme control over his emotions and often presents a flat affect to others, which may be off-putting to some. One needs to look deeply into his eyes to see beyond his stone-faced demeanor.As a reader, I am baffled as to why Petit, initially so averse to media attention of any kind, has orchestrated this book and made very intimate details of each of his family member’s demise public. How can a husband think that his wife or daughters would want him to ever market such details? Since Petit married a women 20 years his junior and subsequently fathered another child, it appears that Petit’s angst so laboriously detailed in the book together with the graphic details of his loved ones' demise is made public for an express purpose only Petit knows.The book underscores a seldom presented aftermath that survivors of violent crime must face when courts prosecute the perpetrators. The waiting is tedious, boring, & seemingly endless. Some of the more trying aspects include (1) the posturing of the representing attorneys as they build their future careers or make mistakes when they should know better, (2) facing the person who raped & sexual violated and then burned alive your loved ones. How Petit managed to get through the trauma is beyond most mortals. Mention is made of the uncomfortable bare-wooden benches in courtrooms which are punishing to older people and where survivors must sit all day. The long commutes to other cities for trials that take such a toll. Lives are on hold and careers halted, as the focus becomes the court trials. Years go by and the suffering survivors are tethered to the crimes & must relive every minute detail in court, day after day, year after year. For Petit, five years go by as he devotes himself to the trial process ensuring that he has done all he could to promote justice for his slain family. Yet after the 4th year of grieving and agony, he manages to fall in love & begin a new life with his new wife & baby son. He is a survivor - hence the title of the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5XV86WN3S8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140162#wasThisHelpful","R2N5XV86WN3S8A","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I need to submit my review prior to this time frame of one month (two treatments) + three weeks, so I will need to update my review (and star rating) if I notice significant changes in hair loss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1HHSF2XSYDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5WVKKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A1HHSF2XSYDY","A22RIIYSPA3EDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22RIIYSPA3EDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this phone right now. I like a not cordless phone for my major calling on my home phone since I was surprised when I picked up my cordless phone to hear my neighbor having a conversation on her wireless phone, and I also heard a neighbor's baby monitor (and whatever conversation was near it) on my wireless phone (years ago). I feel more secure with a wired phone so I know that my neighbors cannot accidentally hear my conversation.This phone caller ID panel lights up orange only when there is an incoming call. It makes the extra large text of the caller ID display stand out so it is easier to read. It has an ""in use"" bar at the top of the caller ID panel that flashes orange for an incoming call (and the phone also rings if it is set to audible ring). This ""in use"" bar does not light up when another extension phone is being used, but an LCD message ""Line in Use"" is displayed on the caller ID panel so someone knows whether an extension phone is off the hook or not to pick up the phone if someone else (or a fax machine) is using it. It has a built-in answering machine (I do not use), a good speakerphone, mute, flash, audio assist, extra large buttons that are easy to see and easy to use caller ID log list.I purchased this phone for my Mom who has macular degeneration and bought a second one for me. It was easy for me to set up. I replaced my previous phone with this one since I could not read the caller ID very well since it was totally LCD and did not display too well in daylight, and the panel for the caller ID did not tilt toward me. This phone's caller ID panel can be flat or tilt upward if you are using it on a table surface.

"I really like Method detergent and use it exclusively in my HE front loading washing machine, but the shorter bottles of Method are still breaking.The part that breaks is the horizontal hard plastic around the external pumping mechanism, so I cannot repair or fix. I was hoping that the shorter stature of these bottles would fix the issue (that required me to find other bottles to pour my liquid Method in). I assumed that the bottles must fall over or onto the floor (which they have in the past too many times and leaked all over everywhere, ugh!) but this time I stored them in a cabinet and loaded up the top of my washer/dryer & folding counter, so nobody could place them there - only back into the cabinet.

That is good because now they will have two different colors, so they can't take each others & say they didn't know,since they aren't the same color.

"This silicone vibrator is firm but not stiff, you can bend the shaft and squish the bulb a bit. The finish is matte and smooth except for the raised veiny area. It can produce some drag, so lube is good (when is it not?) Requires batteries(not included) before use. The intensity of the vibration (at least the highest of the ten speeds ~I like it strong) is decent for a battery toy. I was a little taken aback with how big it was at first, but it was so worth it since it drives my pleasure spots crazy.

"These mugs, are quite lovely & enjoyable to drink out of. They are really the best kept secret! Want to keep your drink cold? Well these Moscow mule cups can do it. They're even cold with nothing in them! And they don't need to go in your freezer or refrigerator either! Can't beat these cups for everything you'll ever need for your drinks.

"My 19 year old daughter has always struggled with acne & dry skin. They don't go well together, because most acne washes are made to help dry your pores due to excessive oil. She has the worst dry skin on some areas of her face with acne & this face wash helped to clear up her acne without irritating or drying out her skin. It has deep cleaning powers but is gentle on her skin. She uses it twice a day with her cleaning brush & it leaves her skin feeling amazing. We really like that the ingredients are natural....like willow bark, lavender & organic cayenne to name a few. Has a nice texture & a refreshing scent. Also like that it has a pump so that less product is wasted. I recommend to anyone young or old that is suffering from acne.

"My husband installed this shower head in our daughters bathroom. Although, no instructions were provided, he had it up in no time. This may be a problem for some people, as I know it would have been if I, myself had to be the one to install it. I have never seen a shower head as unique looking as this one. It really is cool! My daughters love it. You won't need to buy any other parts for this, it comes with fabric plumbing tape, washers, and hardware. This head has two different flow settings, mist, which is my daughters favorite & rainfall, which is nice as well. Its pretty simple to switch between both, my daughter takes a half mist, half rainfall shower. It is formed from ABS thermo materials suitable for hot showers. Also has 50 nozzles, ideal for superior water flow. This shower head is a hit in our house! Comes with a one year warranty, & that makes me one happy customer.

However, I recently have had a hormone implant put in that caused me to have mild acne occasionally. After one use, my skin felt soft & my acne blemishes started drying up.

With its  high quality metals & strong lace, this bracelet seems very well made. I got it on my own hand to try it out before I put it away for Christmas.

"I am an everyday,all day loose tea drinker. I have a large variety of loose tea & have had an awesome time testing this lead free, glass tumbler out. It is super simple to use. Just open the bottom of the tumbler by twisting, take out the infuser, fill with your favorite loose tea, my very favorite is my loose green tea with lemon rinds, lemon grass & bergamot. Screw the cap back on, fill with almost boiling water, screw the top cap back on...be careful it isn't too hot to sip & if its not....sip away!! What I personally love most about this tumbler is that I can now cut back on the time it takes to make my tea when I am leaving my house. I used to have to do the whole making of the loose tea process in another cup & then I would transfer it into a coffee mug. Not anymore!! This tumbler really is great, it can also be used to take coffee along with you, if tea isn't your thing. My husband took the infuser out replaced the seal, screwed the cap on & filled with his favorite coffee & took this to work with him. He has orders to not do it again, as I want this tumbler for my own outings. I will though try & purchase him his own for the holidays. I am very content with this tumbler & I fully recommend.

"Every winter my husband & son go dirtbike & quad riding every weekend, unless its raining bad or snowing, they don't care about the cold weather. When my husband rides every winter, a  major problem that he runs into, is that his goggles fog up. On days when the weather is really, really cold & wind chills approach, he has to wear a full face mask.

"My son loves anything that goes fast or flies. I gave this to him as a gift, to say he was excited would be an understatement!! He wanted to get it up & flying straight away. It took close to 20 minutes to get a full charge. After charging, my husband & son together took out the remote control & began flying the nano. My hubby pretty much got the hang of it right away, because he has flown a nano quadcopter before. My son took a little teaching from my husband,but he peixked it up soon after. The copter is a bit noisy, & it actually goes pretty high up into the air. If you don't know what you're doing, be careful because my son accidentally flew the nano into my husbands arm & he actually got a little cut, so before you try to fly this in a more public setting, practice in the backyard. After my son got the hang if it,my husband took him to the park & they flew it there. It stays charged for around 5 minutes, then has to be recharged. It provided my husband & son a nice, fun day together. This is a good beginners nano copter. This comes with extra propellers in case some break, we haven't had to use these yet.

"If you are tired of your baby drooling all over everything near their mouths, then buy one of these necklaces & put it on your baby, asap!  When we first got an amber necklace, we realized there was no more drool.  We thought it might have been a fluke, so we took it off our son, & within a few hours, he was drooling, everywhere.  We put it back on him, & surprise, surprise..no drool!  With our daughter, we gave her one before teething ever started, & she has never drooled because of teething.  We have had to use Tylenol in conjunction with the necklace when teething gets really bad, but getting teeth is easier on baby (& mom!) when they are wearing one of these necklaces. I also have one of these for inflammation issues caused by an autoimmune disease. I feel that I am definitely receiving benefits from my amber necklace. I wear mine as a bracelet around my wrist.

"Well if you think you are walking enough or not enough per day, you will be surprised to know either way! AThere are distances that I go routinely  & surprisingly is quite a distance. Then there are ones I thought were about 5000 steps & they ended up only being 3000! This device even though you may think it is not working correctly at times, will set the record straight.

"I know how much men love a remote control. So I just knew my husband would be up for a little playtime with me, if it had to do with him using a remote!! This little gem is the perfect toy for couples, you get the thrill, while he gets control. Just pop these tiny little eggs into your panties within the vicinity of your hoo ha & its surrounding area, then just forget about it. One evening while out in a nice restaurant, just try imagining this scene. A table for two in your favorite place, it’s a weekend night & the place is jammin'!! You have your double egg in your panties & your man has the remote in his pocket. At any given time he could flick the button & the egg will burst into one of its many different vibrating settings. The wait of the anticipation is incredible, you don’t know when he will push that button, or even if he will. Having to not give away what is or is not happening under the table to your fellow diners is also quite exhilarating. Feeling the little eggs on your most sensitive spots, is a real turn on, especially as someone else is in control of your pleasure. This for my hubby anyway, is a real power trip & he loves giving it to me or taking it away & leaving me with wanting more. If you don’t have one you need one. This is great for beginners, because of the multi speed settings.

She was so greatful that she brought it with her, while her friends got all wet & were cold, my daughter stayed toasty & dry. What makes this raincoat extra special & unique, is that it has a connected hood. My daughter couldn't tell me enough how much she loved & appreciated this feature.

I originally wondered if I would have to mess with the sleeves because a lot of the time when clothes say ""off the shoulder"" I eventually have to pull down the sleeves on my own, but this is NOT the case with this dress. I am 5'6 with a thin build, the fit was totally on point!! It's fitted & has a comfortable, soft material. I wore it the day I received it, with sexy heels & a gold necklace. It's in the way you style it, but the simplicity is the beauty. This dress is extremely club worthy! Add a plum lip & a tassel necklace and you have a very sexy, very modern Bohemian babe look.

This whiteboard will be both fun & also educational for her. It comes with two whiteboard washable markers, a nice large sized eraser & also two magnetic pink smiley faces.

"Not only do these bags work great, they are sooo cute looking as well. Since two come in a set, I decided on putting one in my truck & giving the other to my mother that never goes anywhere without our dog, Bailey girl.

We try & dry it & air it out, but it still gets a stale, musty smell every now & then. I had this bag hanging in my truck for close to two weeks now & it even rained hard outside here yesterday & when I got in my truck this morning, the musty odor was non-existant. Score!! My mothers car has also never smelled fresher. She usually uses the tree air fresheners that smell too strong & just cover up the smell with strong scents.This bag doesn't cover the dog smell in her car up...it actually dissappates the smell & gets rid of it all together.

"I was thin my whole life, even after I had my three children. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease & put on intravenous steroids to decrease inflammation present in my body. I gained close to 100 lbs. over about two-three years of being on this medicine. I am now off the meds & lost a significant amount of weight just being off them. I still want to lose @ least 40-50 lbs., but due to my illness, can't do too much exercising. I am eating small portions & dieting, so this combo kit will for sure come in handy for me & my weight lose journey. I have never used a body fat test caliper before, but the instructions & resources I found on how to use this, made it super easy for me (I like easy!). It will determine my body fat. I just simply slid the slider to the right hand side of the caliper. I took a big grab of skin in my right hand & pressed the skin between the caliper & slid over the slider until it stops & that measures the fat. I then used the chart provided with my order, to compare with my age range & also to record my progress. It is suggested that if you are on the heavier side to use the tape measure. It is a nice little tape measure too. It is like a fabric & it comes out of a plastic piece & then after you put it around to measure any area, you can then lock it into position with a clip. I always am searching for a good, quality tape measure when I am being fitted for clothing, or getting my children's measurements for garments. This will definitely come in handy.

"I had planned on sewing something similar, even had the fabric, when I had the opportunity to get these. They are light filtering & exactly what I was looking for. Lets light in, but provides privacy. Love the look & also the feel. Casual chic!! Although, I wasnt positive these would fit our front window, in the end the fit was perfect. I raised the rod up & it elongated the window area. My husband made a bay window rod from purchased brackets, added dowel rods & spray painted them all black. The entire effect came out better than we had expected & the contrast of the dark rod against the light airy, sheer curtains is charming in my opinion. The white sheer color is also nice because my dog can get her nose on them (to look out the window) but you can't see any smudge marks on the curtains.

I love the country style look that this bin gives the room as well. It woukd be a nice added touch to any room. Looks very classic, yet stylish.

"I was referred to try this by a friend & I ran it by my rheumatologist who was on board with me trying this. I have an autoimmune disease & have been diagnosed for 5 years now. It depletes me of energy, gives me anxiety & depression, arthritis etc... I am always searching high & low for anything to help me in this journey of trying to feel normal again. After researching shilajit thoroughly, like I would with anything I put into my body. I found out that shilajit is purest in its resin form, which this product is. It is sourced from ""rock sweat"" at high altitudes & contains over 85 trace elements & minerals that everyones body needs to function optimally & also includes fulvic acid, which helps the body absorb these minerals at a cellular level. With my research done....it was now time to try this exciting, new super food supplement. I decided to take my pea-sized amount of shilajit mixed with a spoon into an 8 oz. glass of water. At first glance, my honest reaction was...NO WAY am I drinking this!! Then, I thought to myself, but what if... What if this stuff, as funky as it looks, can help me?!!? I bit the bullet & just took a huge, quick gulp real fast. Ehh, not too bad. To me, it tastes a bit like black liquorice & I am not a fan of liquorice. If you like liquorice, you'll love the taste, but it isn't my favorite. Not a big deal for me, as most things that are good for us, don't necessarily taste good to us!! It has now been 15 days & I have taken one pea-sized portion daily as directed in the instructions, usually with water, sometimes mixed into juice. I feel that my energy level has gone up, not too much, but a noticeable little jump. Also, I feel that my head has been clearer. My worries haven't been getting to me like they usually do. I'm not 100% sure its the shilajit working, but I haven't been doing anything else differently lately, so I'm figuring it must be. I will continue taking this as long as it continues to make me feel more energized & helps my well-being.

"I have enjoyed reading this entire series and looked forward to seeing how Kim Vogel Sawyer would wrap things up with this third, and final installment of The Zimmerman Restoration series. With this book we get to reconnect with old characters while we also meet a few new ones. I must admit I am glad that the author provided a bit of refresher information so that I could reconnect with the characters and their stories. It has been interesting to see how Suzanne sort of comes full circle in this trilogy. The author tackles several topics such and one is being an unwed mother, Suzanne was a pregnant teen sent away twenty years earlier, now she has come home to take care of her mother.  Paul Aldrich is the father of the baby Suzanne had, now that she is back the old feelings start to resurface. What does God ultimately have in store for this couple.This is a story about healing families and healing hearts.

"I love reading stories about dogs and Jim Kraus has written more than a few that were great, including his latest one The Dog That Saved Stewart Coolidge.Stewart Coolidge works at the local grocery store as a bag boy. When a stray dog continues to come in and steal chew bones his boss isn't happy and demands that Stewart catch him. While he doesn't  catch him, the dog does show up at his apartment building and Stewart decides to let him in, little does he know just how much this dog will change his life!Reading this story was a no brainer for me, after all I love stories that revolve around animals, but it was the  powerful messages woven through out the story that makes this one a stand out memorable read! I certainly enjoyed the small town feel of this book, and the wonderful cast of characters that we meet. The three central characters are Calvin, a young man who is a college graduate working as a bag boy, his neighbor Lisa, who works as a waitress, and a stray dog that they name Hubert. It was neat to see the story unfold through the eyes of the various characters especially the dog.

"99 Prayers for Children is a beautifully illustrated book that youngsters will enjoy looking at while they read, or have read to them the prayers that are included. This is a very sturdy hard back book with a colorful cover that certainly captured my eye. Inside the first thing I looked for was a presentation page, and yes it's there, this book would make a wonderful gift, I could even see giving this as a shower gift for a new baby so the parent could read it nightly to their youngster. The prayers are simply written which is perfect for a new reader because they will be reading along in no time at all. The colorful illustrations are paired perfectly with the prayers. As an animal lover I loved the cats and dogs that were included in the illustrations, and one of my favorite had to be Thank You God which is based on Psalm 106:1 it really  put a smile on my face. Another great thing about each prayer is that the scripture reference is  included at the end so you can look up the scripture the prayer is based on if you so choose. Overall, I love this little book and think it would make a wonderful gift. Perfect for bedtime or anytime your youngster wants to be read to.

"I love books that pull me into a small town setting where the characters are easy to know and care for, making me feel as if I become a part of the town for a short time, and that's just what I found within the pages of The Splendor Of Ordinary Days by Jeff High. Even though the town of Waterford doesn't always embrace newcomers the residents don't hesitate to know what everyone is doing. Typical small town where everyone knows everyone's business, and that among other things makes this story a winner.  Let me begin by saying that I had never heard of this series until I picked up this book to read, and while I was able to follow the story line, I feel like I was have to go back and read the first two books in the series, because I don't want to miss anything about these characters or the town. . With that said, the comparisons to Jan Karon's Mitford series is spot on, there is a gentleness in reading these stories that draws me in, allowing me to become immersed in the day to day lives of the characters, the good the bad and the funny. This story provided more than an few chuckles, while also providing a bit of mystery. There is even an Amish community in the story which was an added bonus for me. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this story, and will be reading the first two in the series.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21C18YXJX6XG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474104#wasThisHelpful","R21C18YXJX6XG1","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catbird Singing is the second book in the Amish Horses Series by Thomas Nye and I really think it's better than the first book if that is at all possible.It's been two summers since Lenny  Gingerich spent the summer on his grandfather's Amish farm,and at that time he was figuring out who he was, and while he has figured that out he still isn't sure where his life is going. He still feels drawn to his Amish family, and misses the farm life, so when he finds himself on the interstate in Iowa during a major storm he decides to  visit his Amish uncle Noah. He finds that his world is still changing when he finds himself drawn to a particular Amish girl, thing is how does she feel? Will Lenny stick around for awhile on his uncle's farm, one things for sure there is sure to be plenty of interesting things going on.Mr. Nye has a way of drawing me into his stories, allowing me to feel as if I have actually stepped into the shoes of his characters. His writing is richly descriptive, bringing his characters and setting to life with such clarity, that I actually miss them when I finish the final page of the book. I really enjoy reading about the Amish lifestyle and we certainly get a day to day glimpse of that. While I considered the last book to be a coming of age story for Lenny, I feel like he is still coming into his own with this book, we see him mature more, but still I feel like he is evolving into the person he will become. I love his sidekick and always enjoy whenever an animal plays a part in the plot. Overall, a great story that leaves me anxious to read more from this author. While this book is the second in The Amish Horses Series it can be read as a stand alone work because I feel like the author provides enough background information that the reader won't be lost, but if you enjoy good, clean Amish stories that capture the essence of Amish living I highly recommend both books.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUFWUP4OEXZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633570134#wasThisHelpful","R2KUFWUP4OEXZD","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katie Vale has just traveled half way across the country with her boyfriend to spend Christmas with his family. Within minutes of arriving, in front of all of his family he pops the question!  Her answer isn't was what expected though, which might make for an uncomfortable Christmas. Why did she say no, and how can she stay for Christmas with his family now? Well she does, and the lessons she learns will change the way she thinks about family.A fast paced, heart touching story that pulled me right into t he midst of the Bender family. It was interesting to see the story unfold through the eyes of Katie, who really hasn't experienced a family like the Benders before. The characters in the family really propelled this novel along at break neck speed, never once did the plot lag, instead it moved along so fast that I found myself rereading some things just to catch what the author was trying to convey. I wondered from the beginning how life would work out for the main characters. The author begins the book with the marriage proposal and then takes the reader back to allow us to see what transpired, giving the story of the characters, making it easy to understand why Katie gave the answer she did. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen with Katie and Micah, and really felt like her staying with the family would be awkward, bu instead it made for a great story. My first Christmas read for the season, and I have to say it was a quick easy read that touches on faith, family relationships, love, loss and forgiveness. While there are a few poignant moments, there is enough humor to make you laugh, which helps to keep the story light. Well developed characters and a page turning, fast paced plot who could ask for anything more!A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3734JTGK15EUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617955876#wasThisHelpful","R3734JTGK15EUB","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A devotional geared toward knitters, but honestly a book that will speak to the heart of anyone! As a crocheter, and sometimes knitter I found myself relating to the devotionals inside this book. First of all  instead of reading the book cover to cover I used the index to turn to devotionals that spoke to me, and some of the titles really caught my eye, such as Sticks and String, I don't know how many times I have had  people ask me what I am doing with my ""stick and string"" and once I explain what I am doing, they either become very interested, or their eyes glaze over and they change the subject. That's the great thing about this little book of devotions, it is easy to relate to no matter what needle craft hobby you might enjoy. I really like the size of this book because it's small enough to slip in a purse, but it's still big enough that the print is very readable. Overall, I think book would make a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys needle crafts. Truly a wonderful way to begin the day.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PFYUJ885ZA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617955760#wasThisHelpful","R32PFYUJ885ZA6","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I saw the cover of this book I knew I had to read it, but I have to say the cover is nothing compared to the story I found inside! I was drawn in hook line and sinker because of the quirky cast of characters and a murder with plenty of suspects that was far from easy to solve!Maggie Crozat comes home from New York to the family plantation turned B&B in Louisiana and is helping her family run the place. It's a full house err B&B because of the summer festival and things are going good until two elderly guests turn up dead. Well you know that murder can't be good for the family business! Maggie decides she will try and and solve the crime, even though the local police chief has pointed a finger at her. It seems the towns  new police detective wants to do a thorough investigation, so with his help Maggie is determined to solve the crime.A fast paced, fun filled, murder mystery that's filled with southern charm, tantalizing food and characters made this a page turning read for me! I loved the family feel of the story and found it easy to be drawn into the Crozat family. I have to say that Maggie's grandmother was easily my favorite character, she was a real hoot! While there was a bit of romance, I felt like it was secondary to the story, but I do look forward to seeing where things progress with the next book in the series. Overall, fans of fast paced cozy mysteries with a southern flair will enjoy Plantation Shudders. I for one can't wait to read the next book in the series!A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2GIPVNZEXVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011IZPRR6#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2GIPVNZEXVD","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In today's world faith and Christianity is more important than ever for our teens. When they are challenged about what they believe or just asked by fellow peers why they believe what they believe they might need a bit of help being steered in the right direction for the answer. With the Apologetics Study Bible they have a valuable resource that will make finding those answers easier. One of the stand out features of this Bible was the numerous articles included that answered a multitude of questions, and those answers included solid scripture reference so the user can look it up for themselves.I am far outside the age range that this Bible is intended for and found that the topics were relevant to me! The twisted scriptures was another feature that I really enjoyed reading, they are scriptures that people often try to twist to fit their own agenda, or perhaps make you question why you believe what you believe. The personal stories feature stories about teens, stories that the user just might relate too. There are so many useful features in this Bible,from the study notes, to the great articles and the easy to use layout making it a great study aid for teens, but truthfully this is a Bible that will appeal to older adults as well, whether they are just beginning their walk in faith or looking to learn more.A complimentary copy of this Bible was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35R7BMIDAH5T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433614847#wasThisHelpful","R35R7BMIDAH5T8","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kingdom Authority by Kynan Bridges is a book that will equip it's readers on how to overcome the enemy, no longer allowing him to hold any authority in their lives. In today's world evil is all around, but as long as we are in right standing with our Heavenly Father we have nothing to fear, because he gives us authority over the devil. When I picked up this book I was amazed at the easiness of understanding what Mr. Bridges was saying. He has a way of writing that makes me feel like he is talking to me, in a down to earth easy to understand way. He doesn't make unrealistic claims, instead he provides spiritually based information that he backs up with scripture that is eye opening to say the least. I have read several books on spiritual warfare, and what makes this one unique is that while the author talks about the devil, his main focus in on teaching us how to claim our power and to break the bondage that he has placed so many of us in. Each chapter opens with a scripture, and ends with a deliverance prayer, and touches on such topics as, exposing the enemy,  called to conquer, dressed for the battle, just to name a few. When i first picked up this book I sat down and read it cover to cover but I have since been rereading it as a few chapters a day using it as a Bible study of sorts, using it as way to dig deeper into the scripture of spiritual warfare.Until Christians embrace and understand the authority over the enemy, an authority that all Christians have who are in right standing with the Heavenly Father, they can never really claim victory over the enemy. In a world with so much lukewarm religion where we are often taught to fear the devil, if we are taught to believe that there is a devil at all, we need to change our thinking and realize that God is in control, and he gives us the authority to be in control as well. It's time to embrace the power we have, but first we must learn about the power we have been given and Kingdom Authority by Kynan Bridges will provide readers with the knowledge they need in order to claim that power.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4NPJI538KBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629113352#wasThisHelpful","R2W4NPJI538KBJ","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I had to describe the Faithgirlz Bible in one word it would be cute! The cover of this Bible certainly captures the eye immediately. With a turquoise and purple color scheme and that owl with those big eyes easily my favorite Bible cover ever! Add to this is the magnetic closure and I think it's a Bible any young lady would look forward to using and carrying to church or Bible study. While the cover is great it's the features inside that are most important and this one has several features that will enhance the users experience with this Bible. Such features include bring it on questions that steer the user to different scripture based on the answers they give. Treasure this are highlighted boxes that have important verses that the user might want to memorize, verses that will help them keep God's word in their heart. Dream Girl is a what if sort of feature that allows the user to imagine themselves in some of the most famous Bible stories. Along with book introductions, a reading guide that will help get the user through the Bible in a year, it makes using this Bible simple. Besides the Bible itself I think one of the most useful features was the section on how to begin a relationship with Jesus, which even provides an area for recording when the user begins that journey with Jesus. The only negative thing I can say about this Bible is that there is no presentation page, something that would be useful because I can see this Bible becoming a great gift for numerous occasions.A complimentary copy of this Bible was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17AREGR3FMHM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310750075#wasThisHelpful","R17AREGR3FMHM6","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a fan of short stories and always enjoy whenever I find a book that allows me to read different authors within the pages, which is what I found Among The Fair Magnolias. Four different short stories by four different authors that have a few things in common. First the time period in which the stories take place  around the civil war era. Secondly they are southern stories. When historical civil war period stories blend together with romance well there is no way that I wont read the story. Each set of characters have their own trials, and while I enjoyed each story and the characters I would have to say that my favorite story in the collection had to be An Outlaw's Heart by Shelley Gray. The characters of Nora and Robert were so easy to like. Their story really packed a lot of punch for a novella. Anyone who enjoys southern historical fiction where history blends together with romance and even a bit of inspiration will enjoy this compilation, I know I did.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJHDI4OTOPC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401690734#wasThisHelpful","RDJHDI4OTOPC6","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to admit I have read a few books on the Blood Moons lately and feel like Mark Hitchcock does a great job of explaining his ideas without scaring anyone into believing that the end is near. He provides solid answers to some very thought provoking questions such as  whether the Bible even say anything about Blood Moons, will America face judgement in 2015 and more. He also talks about Israel,  and the end days.One thing that really stands out with Blood Moon Rising is that the author provides many scriptural references to back up what he is disclosing to readers. Overall an interesting and informative book that is written in a down to earth way that provides fuel for thought, and just may provide the answers for someone who has wondered just what all the hype is around the four blood moons. Another plus about this book is that I learned more about Jewish feasts than I expected. I found the prophetic checklists interesting and the proposed chronology of the end times shares a timeline of what the author thinks might happen during end times.  This is my first time reading anything by this author and I enjoyed his writing style and plan on looking for more of his work.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWFM9X6ARYOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414397089#wasThisHelpful","R2BWFM9X6ARYOR","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I became hooked on the Unexpected Bride series by Melissa Jagears after reading the first book in the series. There is something about a mail order bride story that just draws me in and Ms. Jagears provides just the right blending of drama, romance along with a great historical setting that really makes for a page turning read with a few twists that held my attention from the first page to the last.  The characters in this story really come to life, allowing me not only connect but actually care about how their story would work out. I felt like that characters stories were a bit unique compared to other mail order bride stories I have read because they have  both tried and failed with the mail order bride situation before. While A Bride at Last is the third book in the series it can easily  be read as a stand alone work, actually I somehow missed the second book but that didn't stop me from being drawn in by this story. Anyone who enjoys a fast paced story with more than a few inspirational messages along with a sweetness that will draw you in and have you hoping for the best for the characters will enjoy this story, and if your a fan of the mail order bride genre like me then a Bride At Last will be a must read for you, I will caution once you start reading it you just might not be able to put it down.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JIEYJVQC9ZXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764211706#wasThisHelpful","R3JIEYJVQC9ZXZ","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Is there any hope that she and Isaac will ever have a future together?I have certainly enjoyed each book in this series, so much so that I actually went back and read the books (The Wyoming Series) that this little series was taken from, because I was impatient to know the whole story. In my observation though I felt like the Journey of the Heart series was more polished, and by that I mean unnecessary descriptions and repetitive words were taken out.

"Her Brother's Keeper by Beth Wiseman is the first book in Ms. Wiseman's newest series Amish Secrets, and judging by this book it's going to be one of her best series yet! Charlotte Dolinsky is an Englisher  from Texas who is hurting over the loss of her brother Ethan. You see Ethan  went to Pennsylvania to work in construction and then decided to convert to the Amish faith, and was even actually engaged to be married to Hannah King. Why then would he commit suicide? That's what Charlotte wants to know and so she devises a scheme where she disguises herself as a distant Amish cousin of the King family and heads to Pennsylvania to find the answers she is looking for. She is welcomed into the family and even becomes friends with Hannah, but will they continue to be her friend if they find out who she really is? What about her brother's death, what will she learn about his death?Her Brother's Keeper deals with a few tough subjects such as depression, child abuse and suicide, but does so in such a way that instead of feeling overwhelming and depressing it left me feeling inspired and uplifted as the story unfolded, especially as Charlotte began to find her way.  Speaking of Charlotte it was fun to watch her become ""Mary"" because it was very realistic as well as humorous.I really liked the suspense/mystery of the story and found myself wondering just what happened to Ethan. Her Brother's Keeper drew me in from the beginning pages and made me feel like I had stepped into the life of these characters but that's what  I have come to expect when I pick up a book by Beth Wiseman.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UUX6BXS2F9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140168596X#wasThisHelpful","R19UUX6BXS2F9K","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zetta's Dream takes readers back to 1922, pulling them into the life of a coal camp. Along with the hardships there are also the hopes and dreams of the characters that become so real that you feel like they might of actually lived the life that Ms. Aldrich allows us a peek into!Zetta Berghoffer is a 22 year old mother of two and expecting another baby living on a Kentucky farm. Her husband Asa along with two of Zetta's brother's  have decided to go off to work in the coal mines. Asa wants to go in order to earn four hundred dollars so that he can pay off the family farm and  provide a better life for his family. Zetta follows along with her two young children and begins life in the coal camp, and while she knows they will only be there three months her only wish is to go back home, and soon nightmares start plaguing her, providing a dark omen of what might happen if they don't leave the coal camp right away. Asa won't leave though and as each day brings them closer to home, one can't help but wonder if  Zetta's worries were for nothing.Zetta's Dream is a story that grabs hold of the heart and wont let go, even after I finished the final page I found myself continuing to think about the character of Zetta and how her life might be. To say that she was a strong character is an understatement. Even though she is 22 she seems so much older than that, perhaps because of the hardships of life, but really I felt like it was just an inner strength that the author so realistically captured of what being a wife and mother really is! Ms. Aldrich paints such a vivid picture of Zetta's home and family that I could almost smell the cornbread cooking, and could just imagine the grittiness of the coal dust in the air!  Plenty of secondary characters shine in this story such as the granny woman Claire, who will deliver Zetta's baby, to Dosha and her husband, each character brings their own special voice to the story. My favorite secondary character had to be Julia. In the beginning I found myself disliking her, but as the author allowed me true access to her I found my heart breaking for her, because it seemed that she found something in Zetta that no one else had offered her.I have always been fascinated by coal camp stories and Zetta's Dream certainly gave me that, even touching briefly on the union movement, but more than that I found myself  on an emotional roller coaster ride wondering what might happen to Zetta's family. Hoping right along with Zetta for the best. A story that grabbed me by the heart and wouldn't let go! Easily one of the best books I have read this year!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4MOWE84WCD63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692357505#wasThisHelpful","R4MOWE84WCD63","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have really enjoyed reading this series, and I think that this book A Heart's Betrayal just might be my favorite so far! When Emmie's husband is killed in an accident to say she is devastated is an understatement, but it's the life he never told her about that really shocks her to the core. She decides the only thing to do is to head west to join up with Sarah and Rand, knowing that she will never trust her heart to another again. It doesn't take long though for a kind soldier to begin to breach her defenses. Will she find the new life she is hoping for, and what sort of life will it be?Ms. Coble packs more than a few shocking twists within the pages of A Heart's Betrayal. Emmie's character is easy to relate to, and I couldn't imagine what life might throw at her next! I was rooting for Emmie to find some sort of happiness but couldn't help but wonder about the secret that she carried about her marriage,whether or not it would keep her from finding happiness. The ending leaves me quite anxious to read the next installment in the series!

"Aaron Ebersol is sort of like the prodigal son returned, you see he left the community of Paradise, Pa years earlier and really didn't keep in close contact with his family, even though his family tried. Now though his mother is sick and he goes home to be with her, thing is he isn't sure how he feels about being back, and more than that how he fits in now. He decides to stay at the Heart of Paradise B&B and soon finds himself developing feelings for Linda Zook. Can their growing friendship become more, can they forgive those that hurt them, but more than that can they forgive themselves?Amy Clipston creates in depth characters who face very real problems within the pages of A Simple Prayer. Those characters are paired together with a well written, easy to follow plot that isn't easy to put down.The conflicts within the story really kept me reading to find out what would ultimately happen.I really enjoy reading Amy Clipston's work but somehow missed a couple of books in the Hearts Of The Lancaster Grand Hotel series but honestly this book is a great stand alone read because the author provides enough background information about the reoccurring characters that I immediately understood who they were. With that said I really hope to go back and read book two and three in the series! Fans of Amish fiction are going to love this story, but anyone looking for a well written story filled with well fleshed characters along with real life issues should give this book a try I really don't think you will be disappointed.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JX007UNLALFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310335884#wasThisHelpful","R2JX007UNLALFV","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inspiring and uplifting is how I would describe Bible Touchpoints For Women! 312 pages of insight and wisdom for everyday living, this little book is a perfect size to slip into a purse and the imitation leather feels nice, and the etched cover is eyecatching. I like that there is a ribbon marker included, and the handy table of contents allows for ease of finding the topic your heart needs help with. Speaking of topics this book provides 309 topics and then provides plenty of scriptures to provide Biblical encouragement. One negative thing about this little book is that there isn't a presentation page, because I really think it would make a wonderful gift for anyone who needs a bit of encouragement and guidance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XSVDZKRDEKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496402596#wasThisHelpful","R20XSVDZKRDEKH","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pinecraft, Florida and the Orange Blossom Inn is a delightful setting for The Proposal at Siesta Key. Shelley Shepard Gray always pulls me into whatever setting she places her characters in but I have to admit the setting in The Amish Brides of Pinecraft series really is one of my favorite places to be whisk away too! I really feel like I am sitting in sunny Florida as I am reading this story. Along with a great setting she also creates multi-layered characters that I couldn't help but bond with. With this story we have characters who are dealing with life changing issues, Penny Troyer is dealing with the brutal murder of a sibling and  Michael Knoxx is a missionary who basically lives on the road, going from place to place to share his personal testimony of the twists that his life has taken. Michael and Penny begin a friendship while he is staying in Pinecraft, can the friendship ever be anything more though?Wonderfully written, I found myself drawn in from the beginning.I truly became emotionally invested in the characters, especially Penny and really wanted her to find peace and happiness. I enjoyed the friendship that developed,and felt like it progressed at a very realistic pace. Several life lessons are woven into the story and  ""The Proposal"" that Michael made was something that we all should strive to live by. A great book and a wonderful series but I am not surprised because that's what I always get whenever I read a book by Shelley Shepard Gray!A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPSY6B5ACCQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062337726#wasThisHelpful","R2RPSY6B5ACCQK","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Board games is something I always enjoyed playing with my son, and dominoes was one of his favorite, so to learn that there was a domino game that would help children learn the Bible was great!  What a great way to spend quality time together. Perfect really for any age, although the game is a bit simplistic, it's really geared toward youngsters, I think this is a game that would be perfect for Sunday school, home school, or family game night. While the game indicates that it can be played with 2 to 4 players, honestly it could be played alone using it as a match game, or even lining up the numbers. Along with learning about the Bible this game also encourages counting and matching. The glossy pictures are bright, and the material, which is heavy cardboard should stand up to repeated use. Anyone who enjoys playing traditional dominoes will certainly enjoy this enhanced version of the game.A complimentary item was furnished for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKHUBPVB6FFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781281556#wasThisHelpful","R2PKHUBPVB6FFF","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this series and have been discussing it with a friend of mine and she totally agrees the only dislike is waiting for the next installment of the book, but anticipating what might come next makes it well worth the wait! Truthfully though I actually read the novel Where Leads The Heart the full length novel that this serial story are reprinted from.  The saga between Rand and Sarah continue. It's obvious that Rand still loves Sarah but his fiancee is determined to marry him. Plenty of twists provide keep this story moving on at a brisk pace making for a quick historical read that really does leave the reader wanting more! Anyone who enjoys good clean historical fiction where the ending really isn't assured will certainly enjoy this entire series, and speaking of which The Journey of the Heart series should be read in order to understand the complexities of the characters.

"I was drawn to The Wood's Edge because of the time period in which it took place. I am a fan of historical fiction but it isn't often that I read a book that takes place in the mid 1700's. What I found within the pages of the book was an engrossing story that was rich with history,  and filled with well fleshed characters that captured my attention and wouldn't turn loose! The rich descriptions of time and place really was a joy to read, the author captured the period perfectly making it easy to see that she knew what she was writing about, history really does come to life within the pages. The plot was interesting, after all the suspense of wondering whether a secret would be found out was something that kept me turning the pages, but I really think one of my favorite parts of the story was the way the author wove the faith of the characters into the story. The Wood's Edge did lag a few times but overall was an interesting read that held my attention because I wanted to know what would happen. I will certainly be looking for book two in the series.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSW5CT5UWID2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601427328#wasThisHelpful","R2YSW5CT5UWID2","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think Act Believe Like Jesus is the companion book to Believe by Randy Frazee. I really feel like it is a great book for new Christians but also great for someone who needs to reboot and refresh what it actually means to live for God. This book is broken down into four sections with them being Think Like Jesus and asks the question What do I believe? Part two is Act Like Jesus and asks the question What should I do? Part three is Be like Jesus and asks the question Who am I becoming? Part four is about Transformation and talks about becoming a new person in Christ.  Short easy to read chapters where Mr. Frazee includes snippets about his life make this an easy book to incorporate into my daily Bible routine. I like that each chapter opens up with a scripture verse and then has a key question and application that involves the question. This really isn't a book to read in one sitting, instead I have been using it as a Bible study so that I can absorb the points that the author is getting across. A book that I feel like is a great asset on helping me along on my spiritual journey.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJW1RRT5GM2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031025017X#wasThisHelpful","R3NJW1RRT5GM2P","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading anything by Kathleen Fuller is a guaranteed good read. She has a knack for creating easy to care for characters and as a fan of Amish fiction I feel like she is a top notch writer in the genre. I find it handy that she always provides a glossary for German words used within the story.  A solidly written plot that easily pulled me in made this a very enjoyable book to read. Jeremiah Mullet left his Amish community to full fill his dream of becoming a vet, but now he has come back to fill for the vet who ultimately helped him out while he needs to recover from a broken leg.  Of course in the process he reconnects with old friends. Anna Mae is one of those friends, she has actually been grappling with what to do with her life for the last several years, of course her mother thinks she should settle down and marry, but she isn't sure what course she wants to take for her life. As she reconnects with Jeremiah one can't help but wonder where the relationship might lead. What is in store for them, he is no longer Amish, so a romantic relationship is out of the question isn't it? What does God have in store for them?This was a solidly written story allowing the pages to fly by. There is another couple in the story that also held my interest. Even though this book is part of a series it really can be read as a stand alone story. Fans of Amish fiction will be thrilled with A Faith Of Her Own, but honestly anyone who enjoys a faith based read with solidly written characters and a sweetly progressing story should give this one a try as well!A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RARAFWA9SS3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0529102781#wasThisHelpful","R1RARAFWA9SS3Q","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Heart Of The Amish is a keeper one that has found a permanent place on my bookshelf. I am a huge fan of Suzanne Woods Fisher and her Amish fiction writing so I really had to wonder what this non-fiction look at the Amish might be like. Well I must say it is one of the best books I have read so far this year. The insight into how the Amish live and forgive and in essence find peace in that forgiveness is something that just comes naturally to them because of their faith. The true stories give us glimpses of real people with real Amish folks with real feelings, but it's their faith in God and the lesson of knowing that forgiveness isn't about the person who perpetrated the wrong, but instead it letting go of bitterness and hurt in order to find true peace with themselves. Truly a book filled with life lessons that I only hope that I can aspire to. A book that I will read often whenever I find it difficult to let go and forgive. On a scale of one to five this book really is a six and would make a wonderful gift for anyone who wants to achieve a closer walk with God by learning to forgive in order to find peace at heart.A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L13J6A6JMZJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMSCL38#wasThisHelpful","R1L13J6A6JMZJM","A35YAEKTV8E88X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35YAEKTV8E88X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ubba Done It is a book that held my attention from beginning to end. It's an exciting who-dun- it with a paranormal twist which is actually blended very well into the plot. It really just seemed like a realistic part of who Baxley is and I felt like it enhances the storyline. The southern setting is a wonderful setting for the story, after all the victim's dying words are Bubba Done It and where else but the south are you gonna find more Bubba's than you can shake a stick at!  Ms. Toussaint not only brings her characters to life with rich, vivid detail but also brings the setting to life as well.  I really enjoy the character of Baxley, she is easy to like, as a single mom she is very easy to relate to. Truly a mystery that kept me guessing. While this book is the second in the Dreamwalker Mystery series I feel like the author provides enough background information that it can be read as a stand alone. I haven't read the first book and had no problems diving right into this story. I am a huge fan of Charlaine Harris and Ms. Toussaint's writing is right on par with hers.

"As Holt admits in the interview on this page, the ending of this book is ambiguous.  She provides no answer to the question that drives the main character's journey, but the answer is beside the point.  I think the reviews that fault the ending miss the point of the novel.  Although the end may leave the reader a little cold at first, I came to appreciate the way the novel ends with time.  Not everything in life is tied up with a neat bow and the ostensible conclusion that Holt deprives us of is not actually important to the real story of this novel.Sarah is a fairly typical American young woman, at least typical for her wealthy upbringing in Washington D.C.  Her mother has largely closed herself off from the world.  Although Sarah sees that she is like her mother in many ways, she also strives to break from her fate and explore the world.  Beyond the general plot, this is a novel about Sarah's journey to find herself and decide whether she will be tied down by her past or break free to become the woman she wants to be.Holt is an excellent writer.  I gave this novel four stars rather than five because I wish Holt did more of her writing:  although some of the characters are well developed, others lurk on the periphery being developed enough to intrigue but not enough to satisfy.  I found myself wishing this novel was longer and involving a larger world.  Holt mentions that this book began as a short story and, in the end, that's what it feels like.  I can't fault Holt too much with writing an excellent, slightly expanded short story, but I wish there was more of it.  I will wait with anticipation for her next novel, when I hope she will be more ambitious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KPXO6UYYYEB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205280#wasThisHelpful","R3KPXO6UYYYEB0","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this water table for our 15-month-old twins to enjoy for the summer.  It was incredibly easy to set up, it just took a couple of minutes.  The kids absolutely love it, we have to hide it from their view so they don't stand at the patio door all day asking to go outside to play with it.  It's the perfect height for them and isn't too heavy even when full of water so we can move it back and forth into the shade if needed.My only problems with it are: (1) the little boats do not stay together.

"In this novella, a wise young girl lets the protagonist, a 7-year-old boy, in on a little secret:""Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside... Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups.""As anyone familiar with Gaiman's work will know, he paints a spell-binding glow in all of his novels that can capture grown-ups just as easily as young adults.  Here, he proves that the girl, Lettie, was right: grown-ups can just as easily be pulled into the world he creates and inhabits just as easily as children.In short, this is the story of a man revisiting a mysterious and clouded occurrence from his childhood when a new lodger in his parents' house reveals the depths of ""an ocean running beneath the universe, like the dark seawater that laps beneath the wooden boards of an old pier.""  Although he remembers little, deep down he knows the truth; of how the Hempstock women that live on the farm and the end of the lane saved him from a horrible fate and are keepers of a knowledge that has passed from many in the world.This is a nostalgic novel, told by an adult recounting the events of his childhood from a cloudy distance.  Although the fantastical elements of this book, like Gaiman's other stories, give it a distinct feel, Gaiman touches on themes that most adults can relate to: the emotional uncertainty of childhood, the feeling of a warm home, and the unsettling combination of fear and amazement that accompanies youth.  Once again, Gaiman assembles a modern myth that is impossible to put down.  I read the book in one sitting and was sad to see it end.  I recommend this book for any current Gaiman fan or any reader looking for an introduction to his adult work.  Although this is labeled an ""adult"" book, Gaiman's younger fans will likely enjoy it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VAMO7M93E7XT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062255657#wasThisHelpful","R2VAMO7M93E7XT","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone that enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird will likely enjoy this book as well.  Broadly speaking, both are written from the perspective of a younger girl that is forced to confront the ugly reality of the real world.  Without giving too much away, this novel closely follows the story of To Kill a Mockingbird, a tale of growing up, the pain that crimes can create, and imperfect justice.  The Silver Star takes place in the South of the 70's, a very different place than the setting of To Kill a Mockingbird, but one confronting many of the same issues.Many of the reviews seem to be calling this ""young adult"" fiction, likely because the protagonist is a young girl.  I think this is selling the book short.  If anything, these criticisms are a reflection of Walls' great ability to write in the voice of young women.  Although I am a man, I felt that Walls did an excellent job of portraying the world as it would be seen by a young woman just learning the ways of the world.  I think this perspective can be interesting even if you aren't yourself a young woman.  By writing in the voice of Bean, the protagonist, Walls is able to look at the events from a different point of view, and many of the most interesting parts of this book would appear differently if viewed from the eyes of an adult.  In the end, Walls casts a critical eye on the actions of many adults, and society at large, that can only be captured from a certain perspective.I found myself slipping quickly into this novel and enjoying every minute of it.  I think Walls is a masterful writer and storyteller.  Any adult can enjoy this quick little novel.  Although I haven't read The Glass Castle: A Memoir, I did read Half Broke Horses: A True-Life Novel and found The Silver Star to be just as enjoyable of a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BS629VWAMPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451661509#wasThisHelpful","R4BS629VWAMPK","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Center Holds begins with the mid-term elections in 2010 and ends shortly after Obama's reelection in November 2012.  Although Obama's policy decisions obviously come up, this is largely the story of the chess match between Obama and his allies against the newly emboldened Republicans/Tea Party after the 2010 election and into the 2012 election.Alter obviously had wonderful sources in putting together this book.  Having followed the politics day by day, I think he did a masterful job of capturing the chaotic dealings on the past few years. Although the general strokes of the battles are well known, Alter tells the story based on insider knowledge that didn't always exist at the time these events were playing out.I especially enjoyed the chapters dealing with the 2012 election and Obama's campaign machine.  Obama set out with a highly analytical campaign that Romney ultimately could not compete with.  Alter establishes that Obama was not running the ""hopey changey"" campaign that he was accused of relying on.  Instead, his campaign was data-driven and precisely managed to ensure a victory.  I am convinced that no one that reads with book can remained skeptical of Obama's intelligence or his management skills.  Against this, the Republicans relied on a strategy that has always worked for them with great results: win by any means necessary, calling on every resource available.  As Alter acknowledges, Republicans scored some big victories, although not the biggest.Alter doesn't present a strong political slant in relaying the facts of the last two years, although you can tell that he believes the right side ""won.""  He doesn't present Obama as a radical left-wing socialist, but rather a small-c ""conservative"" that is seeking to hold the center to maintain the current state of the U.S. government.  That he managed to do this in the midst of the conservative tempest that has been whipping around the nation for the past few years is an amazing feat.  And, as Alter recognizes, his victories since 2010 will likely influence the shape of the U.S. for many years to come.  If Clinton is elected in 2016 to continue Obama's policies, the right's dream of radically changing the U.S. really bears no hope in the near term.  On the other side, I think Alter acknowledges that the Republicans have been successful in stopping Obama's agenda in many ways and will likely thwart future change for many years as they continue to hold the House.  Alter is obviously in favor of the liberal side, but I didn't think he was avoiding inconvenient truths or grossly mischaracterizing the Republicans.In short, if you're a political junkie, you'll love this book.  Of course, this is a story about Obama and, ultimately, his reelection.  If you can't believe that happened, you probably won't enjoy this book.  But at the same time, it may be a worthwhile read in a ""know your enemy"" sense.Setting aside politics, this is a well written book.  It is dense with information but Alter manages to write the narrative in a gripping fashion that will keep you turning the pages (even though you already know the conclusion).  Alter is publishing this book in a unique window of time by reporting on the recent history: not exactly contemporaneously in a day-by-day fashion, but also not through the long lens of history.  I believe that these last few years will be viewed with great importance and I think Alter's book will stand the test of time for capturing this chess match.  I look forward to revisiting this book in a decade or so to see how important these battles were to the war over the direction of the United States.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXSPG3A7X5ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451646070#wasThisHelpful","R3BXSPG3A7X5ML","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this ambitious, epic novel, Meyer chronicles the stories of several generations of fathers and sons (and one daughter) as they each seek the American Dream.  Of course, what that means to each is different.Colonel Eli McCullough is kidnapped by a band of Comanche Indians after his family is murdered on the Texas Frontier in 1849.  His father had pushed his family beyond the line of settlement into dangerous territory.  For this, he paid the price, losing his entire family.  Eli eventually assimilates into the tribe, which itself suffers a well-known fate as the settlers take over their territory.  Rejoining the ""whites,"" Eli manages to build a massive empire built on cattle and, later, oil.  Despite his success, his time with the Indians never truly fades from his life.His son, Peter, is never entirely loved by his father, who sees him as weak.  Peter doesn't leave his father's ranch, but he is not respected by either his father or the others that can see he lacks the mettle to be a Texas Man.  After a brutal event carried out by his family, Peter is forever scarred and, when he ultimately has a chance to make amends of a sort, is forced to choose between his family and happiness.Jeanne Anne, Peter's granddaughter, inherits the ranch up to the modern day, dealing with a very different Texas than her great-grandfather.  Despite the modernization of the state, the same principles that applied to the frontier apply to the Texas oil boon: kill or be killed, both literally and figuratively. Jeanne Anne is forced to deal with the same fire of her great-grandfather while being stuck in a woman's body.  Far from being a feminist, she learns when she is young that she belongs only in Texas and, like her family, seeks happiness in all the wrong places.The Son is permeated with themes that are common to the American Experience: exploration, assimilation, solitude vs. society, equality, money, and violence.  Each of the main characters is faced with reconciling themselves with the fates given to them by their families and their own wishes.  While some hew close to where they came from, they are faced with their unhappiness.  Others who manage to break free are able to find happiness, but are left in shame.I read Meyer's first novel, American Rust: A Novel (Random House Reader's Circle), which took place in the Rust Belt.  In both that novel and this one, Meyer shows he is a wonderful writer that can quickly immerse the reader in the lives of his characters no matter the setting.  Showing incredible range, Meyer leaves the familiar territory of the Northeast, where he grew up, to write a novel that takes place in Texas and the early American West.  Although I am no expert, Meyer drew me into an entirely believable story taking place among the pioneers, the Indians, and the Texas oil tycoons of more modern times.Above all else, this is an incredibly entertaining and moving story.  The novel skips between the lives of the three main characters as they move through the world. I found the story of Eli to be the most compelling, but each of the three main stories could be a wonderful novel standing alone.  Setting aside the interesting take of the themes I mentioned above, I simply enjoyed reading the story that Meyer creates.  This is one of my favorite novels I have read in awhile and was sad to see it end.  I'll be looking forward to Meyer's next novel with great anticipation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UW6GRQJY64W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NF6YLM#wasThisHelpful","R11UW6GRQJY64W","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this is not a polemical book with Packer trying to thrust his viewpoint down your throat.  Packer's own voice is largely absent from this book.  Instead, he lets his characters speak for themselves.  Regardless of your politics, you have to agree with Packer that since the 1960's, Americans have ""watched structures that had been in place before your birth collapse like pillars of salt across the vast visible landscape.""  Government no longer consists of genuine politicians seeking to help the people, banks are no longer the staid institutions we once knew, and American manufacturing and the stable union jobs that accompanied it are mostly gone.  As Packer notes, the loss of these institutions has obviously hurt some and helped others to prosper.Packer tells this story by presenting a series of compelling profiles of several individuals: among them a union worker in Youngstown, Ohio, a entrepreneur/bio-fuels evangelist in North Carolina, a D.C. insider, and a Silicon Valley innovator.  These profiles follow the progression of their protagonist from the late 70's to the present day.  Each story is independent, but all share a common thread: as the institutions that provided security to Americans following the New Deal and into the 70's started to fall apart, each person is forced to deal with their new found freedom.  Some thrive, while others struggle to survive.Interspersed in these longer narratives are shorter profiles of key players in the unwinding, from Newt Gingrich and Andrew Breitbart to Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z.  As he skips ahead in years, each new section is foreshadowed by a collage of words - snippets of movie and music quotes and headlines from newspapers - that Packer uses to expertly capture the mood of each year. The genius of this book is that Packer doesn't tell you what to think.  Instead, he presents indisputable facts by way of the stories of real people to show both sides of this ""unwinding.""  At the end, you can draw your own conclusions.  Packer is simply using his amazing powers of shaping narratives to capture this unique time of upheaval in America.  It's easy to lose track of the drastic changes that have taken place over the last few decades unless you read a book like this, which captures the transformation of American institutions to American individualism.  If you are liberal and mourn the loss of these institutions, Packer will force you to consider the opening of opportunities that came with these losses.  If you're conservative and applaud the rise of the rugged individual, he will also make you recognize the price some people have paid due to the loss of security.I would recommend this book to anyone that sees the change that has happened in the U.S. Although it is never stated, I think Packer is asking his readers a seemingly simple question: what does it mean to be an American, and what do we want this country to be?  Is the price of freedom the loss of the common bonds that kept us all together, or is the overriding right to be free paramount to all else?  I can guarantee that anyone who finishes this book will have a lot to think about and will have enjoyed reading these profiles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A6M7CR3R0PR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANI9GIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A6M7CR3R0PR1","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel opens with a parable told by a father to his son, about another father who is forced to give up his young son to a monster, a div.  When the father later confronts the div and discovers that his son has been well taken care of and is leading a happy life, the div asks the father to make a choice: take his son home or leave him to his happy life.  Realizing that to take his son would fill the void in his own heart but ruin his son's life, he leaves the son.  Recognizing the father's selflessness, the div rewards him by erasing the memory of his son.  Despite this ""gift,"" the father is left his a hole in his soul that is never filled.This opening parable is reflected in the rest of the interconnected stories in this novel, all of which involve, to some degree, characters presented with the same choice. Although the main narrative involves the bond between a brother and sister, this novel is actually much broader in scope than a story of siblings.  The common thread, in my mind, is the effect of breaking a bond between two family members or close friends.  When these bonds are broken, often voluntarily and for the good of one of the pair and the detriment of the other, the characters are forced to view the world in a new light.  As young Abdullah notes shortly before losing his sister, he ""felt the true vastness of the desert, and the world, for the the first time.  How easily a person could lose his way in it.""Of course, every broken bond leaves a hole in the lives of the characters, ones they attempt to fill, often with other people.  As one mother explains, she needs her daughter to ""fill these holes inside me.""  Some succeed in filling these voids, while others are left with gaping holes that will never be filled.Regardless of the overarching themes, this is an emotionally moving novel written by a master of crafting stories of relationships between people that we all can relate to.  Hosseini often comes close to treading into overwrought sentimentality that, in the hands of a lesser author, would turn me off.  Hosseini is saved by his remarkable ability to create characters and relationships that do not seem contrived.  I am not ashamed to admit that I teared up during parts of this novel, which, in my eyes, is a sign that it was written by a masterful storyteller.Hosseini is never restrained as he weaves several stories into a tapestry that is cohesive both in theme and in space.  Each story is somehow connected to the others, although the characters themselves are often unaware.  Like his other novels, this one focuses mainly on Afghanistan, but Hosseini spans the globe, placing parts of the story in California, Paris, and Greece.When The Kite Runner was published, not long after 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, many Americans had little knowledge of the people that lived there.  Hosseini has excelled as introducing these people and their heartbreak to a general Western audience, humanizing the people that are eyewitnesses of the most recent war and the atrocious Taliban control that proceeded it.  Now, as our involvement in Afghanistan begins to wind down, this novel shows, in some ways, the effect of our involvement in the country.  This is not a novel about the war in Afghanistan. Many of the conflicts created in its stories, however, are in some way the result of the general upheaval caused by the many wars in that country.  If nothing else, Hosseini's novels reflect the fate of Afghans in the last century: being caught as a cultural crossroads that often results in a mashing of people, some of whom are flung to the far corners of the world.  One can only hope that the coming years bring a peace and prosperity to Afghanistan that allows the heart-wrenching dramas that populate Hosseini's novels to dissipate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUV8UXXKFZLA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159463176X#wasThisHelpful","RUV8UXXKFZLA9","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short review:  If you were a fan of The National's earlier albums but couldn't quite get into High Violet in the same way, you will be very pleased with this excellent album from The National.  The sound you love has returned.I've been a fan of The National since Alligator came out in 2006.  Both Alligator and Boxer are two of my favorite albums of all time.  I thoroughly enjoyed High Violet, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  I found it to be overly dark and hitting on only one note, with lead singer Matt Berninger's deep voice drowning in a sea of heavily distorted guitar that seemed to be missing all the hallmarks of an album by The National.All of The National's albums can easily be described as melancholy.  But with Alligator and Boxer, the sadness was packaged with a certain lightness and clarity.  The drumming in their earlier albums was not pounding, but rather inventive.  The heavy lyrics were counterbalanced with elegant tunes and music that at times could be defined as more orchestral than pure rock.  At their best, The National don't rely on pounding rock to get their point across, but instead craft a complex melody that draws you in.I'm happy to say that Trouble Will Find Me is a return to their old form.  Fans of Alligator and Boxer will find themselves on familiar ground.  Although some of the heaviness of High Violet returns, other songs, like the anthemic ""Graceless"" and the minimalist ""Slipped"" harken back to the earlier albums.  I found as the album progressed I was more drawn in.All of The National's albums take awhile to fully appreciate and I am skeptical of any early reviews.  Avoiding my own advice, however, I can say this is a beautiful album that brings me back to The National's early albums.  The National have matured and this is not an album that reflects the freedom of youth, instead focusing on a man's attempt to deal with growing older.  I am not sure that it will equal Alligator and Boxer in my mind, but perhaps that have to do more with my own changes than those of the band.  I have been listening to Vampire Weekend's new album nonstop since last Tuesday, but this album has replaced it.  I can't wait to get many, many more listens under my belt so I can truly get into it (and hope to update my review later).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Z6E9D87ZVIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRW2066#wasThisHelpful","R3Z6E9D87ZVIZ","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People saying ""LOL"" is often misleading: are they really laughing out loud?  But I can honestly say that I couldn't help laughing and had to try and stifle my laughs on my train commute as I read this book.  A series of short stories of Magary's adventures in being a father of three children, this book will be instantly familiar to any parent.  He doesn't shy away from the honest truth about parenthood: it's wonderful, but those kids can drive you crazy too.  Magary manages to give a voice to all of those little thoughts every parent has but do their best to shove back down into the subconscious.  He also discusses his relationship with his wife, which like any modern parenting relationship consists of both teamwork and combat: who can fake sleeping long enough so the other has to get up and feed the crying baby?The stories are the perfect balance between the hilarity of parenting and the touching moments that any parent will recognize.  Magary is able to discuss his feelings without venturing into the trite or overly corny cliches that other parenting books often fall into to.  If you are a parent that misses the days of childless freedom but still cherish your children, you'll love this book.  He perfectly captures the range of emotions, some that you didn't even know existed, that any parent moves through.One note of warning, however: if you are looking for innocent portrayals of parenthood, this isn't the book for you:  Magary often invokes profanity and ""off-color"" topics to tell his tales.  Of course, in my opinion, this is true to actual parenthood.  He doesn't go overboard, but he doesn't restrain himself either.The hilarity is bookended by an incredibly moving portrayal of Magary dealing with his youngest son being in the NICU after he is born prematurely.  Magary is a skillful writer than can handle both the hilarity, the love, and the tragedy involved in parenting.  As he sums it up near the beginning of the book, ""When you start a family, you're signing up for drama.  You're signing up for worry.  You're signing up for life-and-death.  You're signing up for a life that means something more, even if it isn't as fun a life as when toy were single and drinking shots of Fire Water in the Giants Stadium parking lot.""My one quibble is that the book seemed a bit overpriced for being so short.  The book reads almost like a series of blog posts.  Although I enjoyed every one, I felt like the publisher was asking for a bit more than this book was worth.I would highly recommend this as a Father's Day present for any younger dad.

"I've been on a WWII kick since reading Beevor's The Second World War recently.  Although I am no history buff, I thought I knew about WWII.  Beevor's book convinced me I was wrong.  I loved Beevor's overarching account of the war, but it was just that: overarching.  While it has touches of personal stories of the actual soldiers fighting the war, it was much more focused on a description of the battles and the tactical chess match of the war.  After I finished it, I was looking to ""zoom in"" a bit on the war.  At first I watched Band of Brothers and The Pacific, two excellent HBO miniseries.  I enjoyed both, but they are definitely centered on the American soldiers.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but after reading Beevor, I was looking for something that focused a little bit more on other nationalities.  In no way am I trying to discount the sacrifice of Americans or the large role they played in bringing Germany to its knees, but WWII was really about Europeans than it was Americans.  This is often lost on the U.S. audience.When I saw a description on The Last Battle, I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  It almost seems too good to be true:  American soldiers pairing with German soldiers to defend an Austrian Castle and the French VIP POWs housed there in the waning moments of WWII in Europe.  It fit exactly what I was looking for: a book that, like Beevor, made me rethink WWII.  As reflected in the German soldiers that aid the Americans, not all Germans were evil Nazis, especially by the end of the war.  Likewise, the numerous other nations that got swept up into the Nazi empire were not necessarily all evil.  Throughout the horrors of the war, sparks of humanity and morality shine through.This book was the perfect combination of an amazing tale that seems too good to be true with a story that makes you think and opens your eyes.  It's a pretty quick read, both in the number of pages and the pace of the story once the battle starts, you'll want to keep reading.  If anything, Harding goes into a little too much detail about ancillary matters, like the history of the castle.  Although some of the book seemed like it didn't need to be there, Harding writes in a way that doesn't make it seem dry and boring.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it seems this story has been optioned for a movie.  That doesn't surprise me at all.  This is a story that more people should know about.  Get ahead of the crowds and read the book before the movie comes out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22L6RVYW985RR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0306822083#wasThisHelpful","R22L6RVYW985RR","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The short version: this is an excellent, beautiful album that is one of the best I've heard in a really long time.  I've had it on repeat since I downloaded it.  Although it's a new direction for Vampire Weekend, fans of the old albums will likely enjoy this one as well.  UPDATE:  After another day of having this album on repeat, I can honestly say that it is my favorite album in years.  There is a depth and range to this album that is unlike any other single band out there.  I loved Vampire Weekend's earlier albums, but with Modern Vampires, they have matured into a really amazing band.This album reflects a new sound for Vampire Weekend. With their self-titled album and Contra, there was a definite Kwassa-Kwassa, Graceland-Inspired Pop sound.  Although they could never be characterized as immature, their albums reflected the youth of the band.Modern Vampires is a more mature album.  The end of youth, the passage of time (or trying to stop it) and, ultimately, death figure large in this album.  Many of songs are stripped down and more pure, if somewhat melancholy.  Others contain the frenetic energy of VW's earlier albums, but presented in a deeper way.  As I saw written somewhere else, VW's earlier albums were written for the party at the beginning of the night, and Modern Vampires is the album of the songs they play once everyone but a few stragglers have gone home.This is a wide and deep album exhibiting the amazing range of VW.  Some songs invoke the synth beats I loved in LP.  Other songs are haunting, including the standout Hannah Hunt, tracing a cross-country journey.  Others, like Worship You, are nonstop and frenetic.  Step has an infectious rhythm that will be stuck in your head for days.  Every song, no matter the style, however, presents a new sound for VW.  The harpsichord is toned down, the beats are more prevalent, but through it all the sound is tighter and more focused.That's not to say that fans of the past albums will not enjoy Modern Vampires.  Lead singer Ezra Koenig returns with his brilliant lyrics and masterful flow.  Once again he manages to weave a thread through songs making references you'll be lucky to understand half of, yet it doesn't come across as condescending.  Regardless, this is a beautiful album that I can tell will be in heavy rotation for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BR5TFXY7ZSTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB22GQM#wasThisHelpful","R2BR5TFXY7ZSTJ","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got the new My First Green Toys Shape Sorter, and we have had this Fisher Price sorter for awhile.  After only a short period of use, we put this toy away and the kids now are playing with the Green Toys model.  Here is where the difference was:1.  Functionality:  as other reviewers have mentioned, the lid on this sorter just comes right off.  If the kids tip the toy over, it falls off.  Or they can just grab it and it comes right off.  For young kids just learning to play with toys like this, that means they spend no time sorting and a lot of time just taking the lid off to grab the pieces and fling them around.  It also means that it's more difficult to store all the pieces inside the box and know they will stay there.  Our sorting pieces get scattered around the house and then we have to wander around to find them before the kids can play with it.  The Green Toys sorter screws together, meaning the kids can't easily take it apart and ruin the purpose of the game.2. Sustainability:  I don't know that the Fisher Price toy is toxic, but it is your standard shiny plastic toy made in China.  The Green Toys sorter is made from recycled milk jugs right here in the USA.  With the amount of time that these toys spend in our twins' mouth, I feel more comfortable with using the Green Toy made in the USA.  I'm sure this Fisher Price toy is fine, but the peace of mind is worth it.3. Size:  Especially when our twins were under a year old, this Fisher Price sorter is a big box that can only be used by sitting in on the ground in front of the kids to play with.  The Green Toys sorter is smaller and better shaped for small hands to hold, meaning the kids end up playing with it more.Hands down, both we and the kids prefer the Green Toys model.  This one wasn't horrible, but the other sorter is much better!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E0Y1CMGE6PQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LSZVKA#wasThisHelpful","R3E0Y1CMGE6PQ6","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is a new product, but we are already convinced it is the best affordable shape sorter out there.  We have young twins and this is the fourth Green Toys toy we've gotten for them.  I love that they are made from recycled plastic and made in the USA, not China!  But that's not the only reason to get these toys.We got the Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks a little while ago and it is a similar concept to the Green Toys shape sorter.  The problem with the Fisher Price model, at least for us, is that the lid just sits on top of the box.  That means that our kids can easily pull the lid off and it even just falls off if the box is tipped.  With the Green Toys sorter, the two pieces screw together and stay in place.  This means that our 14-month-olds spend more time sorting shapes than just taking the lid off to fling the pieces around.  This toy is also small enough that they can hold it and manipulate it better than the big fisher price box.Off all the toys we have gotten for our kids, the Green Toys are consistently both our favorites and our kids.  There may be a slight premium for them rather than the mass-produced toys from China, but they are still affordable and high quality!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5N46LZEN2G1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN6QAWM#wasThisHelpful","R5N46LZEN2G1A","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I started Pacific, I had trouble getting into Drury's staccato prose of carefully-honed short sentences.  Each sentence stands on its own, expressing a pointed observation or a short snippet of dialogue.  Ostensibly, this is a story in two towns: Los Angeles and Stone City, a small town in the upper midwest.  A group of interconnected people in these towns, each somewhat of a wandering lost soul, all seem to be seeking comfort despite not knowing where to find it.  Micah Darling moves to California to live with his absent actress mother, Joan.  Micah's father, Tiny, becomes lonely without him and resorts to thievery to entertain himself.  Micah's sister, Lyris, lives with her boyfriend Albert in an apartment above a store owned by Louise, Tiny's ex-wife and current wife of the ex-sheriff, Dan.  Dan, as a private investigator, trails Jack Snow, a fraudster, and his crazy, mystical childhood friend, Sandra.  As these and other characters lives' collide and interconnect, there at first seems to be little method to the madness.Despite the slow start and meandering storyline, however, I was quickly sucked in.  Drury's terse prose is rhythmic, carrying you from one sentence to the next as if they were waves.  The plot itself jumps from one character to the next with little apparent logic, yet, as a whole, it blends together to tell a story of people dealing with their problems, often by seeking solace in others.Having some experience in both places, I thought Drury captured both the depravity of Los Angeles and the earnestness of the Midwest beautifully.  Although it reads as a quiet novel, it is full of craziness: drug-addled teenagers, insane women, murder, robbery, adultery, and rebellion.  Despite what would sound like too much for such a short novel, Drury manages to embrace the characters more than their actions to create a moving portrait of these characters' lives.  Don't come for a riveting story, but stay for the powerful observations of a masterful writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSM4UHO38B7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AUZSA66#wasThisHelpful","R1QSM4UHO38B7T","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on other reviews, I bought this book as we were preparing a bathroom remodel.  I was expecting a book that would be highly informative and help me design the bathroom.  In the end, I didn't get much out of this book.  Sure, there are some good general thoughts about different styles of bathrooms and things to think about, but I didn't end up having a revelation on how to design a bathroom.  I got more out of just looking at the pictures of beautiful bathrooms and thinking about what I like and how I could incorporate that into our remodel.  Most of the ideas, however, were luxury ideas for huge bathrooms that I would never be able to implement.  When we finally completed our remodel, I found that I gained more from simply looking at pictures of bathrooms on home design websites than I did from reading this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NFZ1UWU3K0DY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1840913576#wasThisHelpful","R2NFZ1UWU3K0DY","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Going into this book, I had only a general idea of what the Americas were like before Columbus. Honestly, I can't say I cared that much or could see why it was too relevant.  After seeing several rave reviews of 1491, however, I decided to give it a try.This book is not simply a history novel about the Americas.  Although Mann is careful to say that many of the ideas expressed inside can't be considered more than theories at this point, this book changed how I think about not only the native Americans, but also Western Culture as a whole.  In the U.S., and I imagine in Europe as well, children are educated about that 'savage"" natives living in a pristine environment and the ""cultured"" Europeans.  Of course, Mann is not the only writer to debunk this general theory.What I took away from this book was quite deep: but for a few germs and other unfortunate circumstances, the world today could be a much different place than it is.  As they say, the victors get to write the history, and what we consider today to be the ""proper"" way to do things and what signifies culture is shaped by the narrative written by the Europeans as victors.  But in reality, the Europeans were nothing if not ""savages"" themselves in the 15th century.  Had the Americans succeeded in beating them back, we could live in a world with very different societal norms.  Getting into this takes much more than a simple review, but I loved this book because it changed how I view the world.The added bonus is that Mann does this with gripping writing.  There is nothing dry about this book.And one final caveat: once you read 1491, you have to read 1493 as well.  They complement each other and complete the story.  In 1491, we learn that the Americas were much different than you think.  In 1493, you learn how much of our current culture was shaped by what was found in the Americas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDG36DZVCIL01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JMKVE4#wasThisHelpful","RDG36DZVCIL01","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Olmstead writes this novel using sparse prose that leaves the reader with a feeling matching that of the book: cold and lonely, yet achingly human.  The protagonist, Henry, is young when he is hearbroken and ends up in war.  Although Henry suffers, Olmstead excels at letting the humanity and love shine through.  The portrayal of war is one of the best I have read: nothing is romanticized; rather, the war is brutal and miserable.The comparisons to Hemingway are warranted: Olmstead captures the warmth where it is needed and lets the reader feel the chill where warranted.  Overall, the style matches the story.  This is no happy tale, but I still enjoyed reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V57WEHJMS6QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074QGHUK#wasThisHelpful","R3V57WEHJMS6QN","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have twins that are now just a little over the year.  And I am not generally a fan of the electronic toys for the kids with lights and sounds and songs.  But of course we end up with a lot of those toys and the kids love them, so I'm not going to stand in their way based on some antiquated idea of what toys kids should play with.But that doesn't mean I don't get annoyed by the singing toys.  When your kids are young and hit the same button over and over, the songs can wear on your nerves.But not with Potsy.  After just a few days of receiving this toy as a gift, I think my wife and I had all of his sayings and songs memorized.  Not only that, we started to jokingly say them all the time.  (""I got five foods, gonna make a pot..""; ""cream it, steam it, eat it on the cobb...corn!"")  The voice is not the usual voice you hear on kids toys, but rather a man's voice that just seems to be having so much fun.And the kids love it too.  They love throwing the food, or really any of their toys, into the pot and stirring with the spoon to make it sing.  Even with the sound off they like to put things in the pot and put the lid on.  Although they aren't really learning from it yet, the songs are all about eating your vegetables and how much fun it is, so there is at least something educational about it.I'm sure the novelty will wear off, but this is the least annoying singing toy that our kids have.  For that reason alone, it's worth getting for your kids, or as a gift.  The fact that the kids love it to is only icing on the cake!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF32419RZCZ47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038APAZO#wasThisHelpful","RF32419RZCZ47","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this case will scuff quickly and not look so great.  I eventually ditched mine and found that the hard metal case of the MacBook itself is more than enough of a ""case"" for the computer.  Whereas the scuffs on the case are noticeable, a light scuff on the MacBook isn't really visible.Likewise, this case really doesn't add much protection for the laptop.  With a phone, a good case will protect it if you drop it on the floor.  With a laptop covered by this shell case, it's not going to protect your computer if you drop it, the shell will just snap off.  In my opinion, that doesn't add much ""protection,"" it's really only for looks.  But like I said, it scuffs up easily and doesn't look so hot.  So what's the point?Instead of using a shell case like this, I suggest leaving your MacBook naked (come on, it's beautiful!) And then get a larger sleeve to transport it in.  I guess it takes a little longer to open up the sleeve than just using a shell case like this, but a sleeve will actually help protect your computer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3NAZPMR8L55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00937H1OO#wasThisHelpful","R2K3NAZPMR8L55","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me start out by saying that although I do like computers and tech-related topics, I was never a gamer.  I am not a video game fan.  I did not play role-playing games when I was younger.  Given that, I skipped over this book despite the buzz I kept hearing about it.  Finally, I gave it a read and was so glad I did.  I don't think I have been so absorbed in a book as I was with this one, I could barely put it down.  Although this book is heavy into the world of gaming, it didn't get caught up in esoteric knowledge or focus too much of incomprehensible technology.  In the end, this is a book about an adventure and friendship, not gaming.Cline writes brilliantly and creates characters that you can't help but identify with. RP1 proceeds with a spell-binding pace and builds a level of suspense that it very rare in modern fiction.  Sure, you could say this is just a silly fun book and not ""serious,"" but I think he touches on some important questions and presents a future that is entirely imaginable.Ready Player One combines the exuberance of young people on an adventure immersed in an alternate reality set in the bleak future (i.e., Goonies + E.T. + Matrix).

"We got these for our twins as they started to outgrow their simple baby toys.  Although they aren't consistently stacking them yet, they still seek out this toy.I actually prefer the recycled plastic in Green Toys to the new plastic in other toys.  This plastic is nice and durable and has a matte finish.  They really are beautiful, it any plastic toy can be called that.  Each stacker fits into the other very precisely, this is no junk toy!The middle of each stacker has a large knob that the kids can easily pick up. (they really remind of or air hockey pucks).  Our kids love to grab two of them and use them like cymbals to raise a racket.  The edges of each are also wide, allowing our kids to roll them down the hall, which they also love to do!  The ease with which they can be handled, combined with the chew-proof durability, lead to these being played with often in our household.  I think these will be around for awhile!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWJRTFEZ7EHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036WSVQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1RWJRTFEZ7EHG","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My parents got us this Cuisinart for Christmas after our cheaper, smaller food processor died after a couple years of use.  When I first opened the box, I thought the 14-cup size was overkill.  But since we started using it, we fell in love with it.  One of the nicest features is the three different bowl sizes: if you just need it for a small job, use the small bowl and that's all you have to wash.  This thing takes care of all foods with ease and will drastically cut down on your prep time and open up a whole new world of cooking if you aren't used to having a food processor.When I was reading the manual, Cuisinart said that they recommend that you just leave the food processor out on your counter and adopt it as an everyday cooking tool.  Boy, a bit presumptuous! But they were right: by leaving it out rather than putting it in a cabinet, you end up realizing how often you can use it.This is a high quality product and you can tell from the first time you use it.  In my opinion, it is worth spending a little extra on an appliance that is going to last a long time rather than spending half as much on one that you will have to replace in half the time!And one little extra bonus: our twin babies love the sound of the Cuisinart and can't help from laughing when they watch it go!

"Although this juicer makes good juice, we don't really use it anymore.  It's not difficult to clean, it just takes too much time for everyday use.  There are several parts that need to be cleaned after every use, and then they take up a lot of room to dry.  We weren't hard-core juicers, so for some people I am sure it will be worth it.  But if you just have a passing interest in juicing, my guess is you won't end up using it that much.  Instead of juicing we started to just use the blender, which leaves the pulp in so its not as smooth as pure juice, but it has more fiber and is a LOT easier to clean up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4SV4NMB0YXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MDHH06#wasThisHelpful","RT4SV4NMB0YXZ","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very hesitant to give Mark Bittman's VB6 only three stars.  I have closely followed Bittman's writing in the New York Times for several years.  I own two of his cookbooks, How to Cook Everything and How to Cook Everything Vegetarian, and use both constantly.But perhaps that is the problem.  For anyone that follows Bittman or other similar food writers, there is really nothing new in this book other than collecting all of his recent ideas in one place.  I actually read about Bittman's ""VB6"" diet over a year ago in one of his Times articles and adopted it for myself despite not having it explained in a book.  I wasn't very overweight, but like Bittman I lost about 15 pounds quickly and, as he notes, noticed that as I ate healthier during the day, it changed my eating habits overall and I continued to eat healthy food at night as my cravings for highly processed junk foods subsided.An obvious benefit for the VB6 diet is its simplicity, but unfortunately this also leads to not having much to add in the actual book.  The ""diet"" is just what the title says: eat vegan before 6 pm, and then you can eat anything you want for dinner so long as you try to avoid processed food and treats.  Really, that's it.  The majority of this book is devoted to explaining why such a diet works, and why you should avoid processed foods.  Although this information is great for beginners or people with no real knowledge of nutritional science, most of this information is pretty basic to most people.  If you want to know the details,  I think you can gain a lot more from watching Robert Lustig's ""Sugar: the Bitter Truth"" video on YouTube or even reading Bittman's own columns about Lustig, without buying a book.The other major portion of this book is the recipes.  Again, while I love Bittman's recipes, I have his other cookbooks and wasn't really needing more recipes by him.Again, I love the content of this book, and my three stars is not a reflection on the VB6 diet theory or Bittman's writing.  By way of analogy, I guess I would say it's like buying a ""greatest hits"" album from a band you really like: those albums aren't meant for the fans, they are meant for people who don't know that band's music.  If you're a fan of Bittman or others like him (e.g., Pollan), you don't need this book.  Likewise, if you're looking for a new ""diet,"" just read the title of this book and you're good to go, perhaps with also reading some of Bittman's recent columns on the Times website.I would only recommend this book to someone who needs to learn the basics and needs some good recipes to succeed.  If that's you, I can wholeheartedly say that this book will explain why you need to change your diet and why this one will work.  A vegan diet can be dangerous if you aren't well informed and work hard to make sure you get the proper nutrients.  If you try to be vegan by eating only potato chips, you'll obviously be in trouble!  Luckily, although VB6 isn't a true vegan diet, Bittman explains everything you need to know in this book.  Additionally, the best feature of the VB6 diet is that it is entirely doable.  Although some sacrifices have to be made, you can spend the rest of your life eating this way.  If you're skeptical, I suggest you give it a try: as I mentioned above, you'll notice your cravings for junk food go away once you switch to better food.  I used to drink multiple sodas a day but now they are too sickeningly sweet to handle more than a couple sips.  Also, I didn't only lose weight, I also felt more alert and calm after switching to a VB6 diet, and some random aches and pains went away.  If you are new to the ""flexitarian"" approach to eating set forth by Bittman, you will be a convert by the end of this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KVZSRUZN16JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385344740#wasThisHelpful","R3KVZSRUZN16JZ","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife uses this simple Kindle and I recently got a Kindle Paperwhite.  With the difference in price, there are obvious benefits to getting the simple Kindle.  Which one should you get?In the end, it really comes down to a difference in two features for me.  Assuming you don't need anything fancy, the Paperwhite is better mainly because of the light.  I don't use this to read in the dark so much, but more because having it on even during the day in full sunlight results in a higher contract screen with a whiter background.  There is no question that the display on the Kindle Paperwhite is much better than the other versions.The simple Kindle, however, has what I consider the best feature of the Kindles: page turn buttons!  It seems minor, but if you read a lot the page turn buttons are wonderful.  You don't have to move your hand from the bezel to turn the page.  Likewise, if you are reading a book with footnotes or links, you don't have to be careful where you tap to avoid hitting one of those links instead of turning to the next page.  The more I use the Paperwhite, the more I am annoyed by this.So which one is better?  It's really up to you: if you read a lot (especially non-fiction with in-text references) and care about convenience that this simple Kindle may be the one for you.  If you care more about how the text looks or read a lot at night, then I would go with the Kindle Paperwhite.  For me, if I was buying a kindle again, I would probably go with this simple Kindle.  Hopefully the next version of Kindle combines the best features of both!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A3V4IV46OB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HCCNJU#wasThisHelpful","R22A3V4IV46OB5","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When we were remodeling a bathroom a few years ago, I was looking for a dual flush toilet to save some water.  I read some reviews online praising the Toto Aquia II and decided to get it even though it was a little more pricey than some.Three years later, we still love this toilet.  Even the lighter flush is strong enough for most visits.  We have NEVER had this toilet clog on us and, contrary to some other reviews, the bowl is almost always cleaned by the flush.  Compared to our other existing toilets, I find the bowl on this one stays cleaner.And my favorite feature is the smooth skirt design.  It's probably just me, but I hate that most toilets look like they have intestines, with the curvy shape running into the ground.  This isn't just a looks problem, as those toilets tend to get dirty in the back and it's so difficult to clean all the curves.  With the Toto Aquia II, it is all smooth surfaces that don't collect dust and grime.A few notes:  this skirted design also requires some extra work to install.  We put this toilet on a concrete subfloor and had to drill holes into the concrete to get it attached.  It wasn't difficult, but it is slightly more work than a standard toilet.  Also, you need to buy the toilet seat separately, don't forget!We are starting a new bathroom remodel soon and will be buying another one of these toilets soon.  I can't imagine using anything else at this point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RU3K9EQZHORY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027WGUZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1RU3K9EQZHORY","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think I've read every one of Pollan's books.  I loved some, especially Omnivore's Dilemma, while others were just good (In Defense of Food).  With Cooked, there were parts I loved, while other parts I was ready to skim over.  In the end, I enjoyed the book immensely, but not as much as some of this others.Like many of his other books, Pollan divides Cooked into thematic sections (Here: Fire [Grilling], Water [Cooking in water], Air [baking], and Earth[fermenting/pickling]) but they seemed a little forced, as Pollan himself seems to acknowledge. You need fire for three of the four, and yeast plays a pretty big role in both beer and bread.  I get what he was trying to do, but it felt like it didn't quite work to enhance the themes of the book rather than merely provide breaking points.His introduction sets the stage for the entire book.  He identifies a dilemma in modern culture: we spend less time cooking than ever but more time watching and idolizing others who cook.  Pollan explains that contemplating this dilemma triggered something in him to write this book, and I think he makes an important overarching observation: although cooking may not be the most efficient use of time, it is an alchemic process that transforms both raw foods and people.  Without cooking, humans would not be what we are today.  The modern trend to remove cooking from everyday life, therefore, is likely to have huge consequences on who we are.  As Pollan notes, our fascination with cooking reflects the deep-seated position it holds in our lives.The book contains long sections with meditations on what cooking is and what it means to culture, both ancient and modern, and for the most part I enjoyed them.  For example, although it is somewhat tangential to cooking, Pollan discusses the role that microbiotics play in our gut and the effect on our health.  Tying this topic into modern cooking, he raises some very interesting questions about the effect of a ""no-microbe"" policy on our health.  As Pollan excels at pointing out repeatedly, the food we eat today is at the long end of the combined evolution of man and food: we eat what we eat and cook food the way we do because it is necessary to our survival.  Removing certain types of food (e.g., whole grain bread, fermented vegetables) without thinking of the consequences is fraught with peril.The meditations are interspersed with stories about masters of cooking and Pollan's own personal experiences. In each section, Pollan seeks out the masters in each particular field to teach him about cooking.  As with his other books, Pollan always finds the philosophers within a certain field that combine their expertise with an ability to discuss their field in a way that opens your eyes.  Who knew that bread baking would be so complex and more of an art form than simple mixing?  Pollan is a masterful storyteller, combining an ability to explain complex issues with a sharp sense of humor and self-deprecation.With Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan changed how I think about the world.  For me, Cooked was different in that rather than changing how I see the world of food, he reinforced ideas I already have and gave voice to some subconscious thoughts I had about the importance of cooking my own food.  Although I have always enjoyed cooking, Pollan helps highlight WHY cooking is so enjoyable and so worthwhile.  I especially enjoyed his section on brewing beer and have been inspired to try to brew my own batch.  As he notes in his afterword, many of these endeavors seem at first glance to be an incredible waste of time and totally inefficient.  As Pollan explains, however, there is a ""satisfaction that comes from temporarily breaking free of one's accustomed role as the producer of one thing -- whatever it is we sell into the market for a living -- and the passive consumer of everything else.""  Over the course of the book, Pollan successfully proves that cooking is special and shouldn't be given up so easily, and there are benefits to slowing down and becoming immersed in something so basic as the food we eat.  So while I can't claim that Cooked is as eye-opening as some of Pollan's other works, I enjoyed it immensely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14GPVGY60GLHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204217#wasThisHelpful","R14GPVGY60GLHY","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've been using two of these mats now with two Inglesina clip-on high chairs on the island in our kitchen for several months now.  There are things we love about them, but also things we don't love so much.LOVE:  These mats are made of a good quality plastic that can take a beating.  They also feature a little catch that fills the gap almost perfectly between the edge of the counter and the front of the seat.  This helps with containing some of the mess.DON'T LOVE: We can never get the mats to lay perfectly flat.  The suction cups are in from the edges so the edges tend to curl up.  Also, the suction cups are so strong that you really have to give them a tug to get them loose.  Although this sounds like it would be a good thing, it's not good when the tray is covered with food after feeding the kids.  On many occasions I have pulled on the mat to get the suction cups loose only to have it pop off and fling food all over the place.  I wish it was easy to take off so you could just fold it up and dump it into the trash.  Of course, then the kids would be able to pull it up, so it's definitely a difficult design challenge.  Regardless, the kids have discovered it's fun to pop off the suction cups and fling the food themselves, so I'm not sure this design dilemma really exists.Also, we stained these mats pretty quickly with some tomato sauce, even though we cleaned them pretty quickly.  This isn't a huge deal, but the stains remain despite repeated washings.  In terms of cleaning, the raised ridges of the design printed on the mats makes it harder to scrub out stubborn bits.  I don't really get why they put the design on, our kids could care less. A flat design would have been easier to clean.We are still using these; I never found anything better.  So perhaps this is as good as it gets, but I wish they worked a little better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2418RRHPSW85Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007F9YPDM#wasThisHelpful","R2418RRHPSW85Y","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Seeing Bill Murray in the first scene made me think there was potential, but after his cameo was over it was all downhill.  Although the casting is great, the show fell flat for me.  I have no problems with making fun of Republican politicians, but it's almost too easy.  Rather than offering intelligent comedy, this show relies on gross caricatures of conservative senators for easy gags.  It's almost as if they spent 5 minutes developing the characters based on the most common stereotypes and then just ran with it.The biggest problem I see with this show is I don't know how it can carry on for an entire season.

"As first time parents, and parents of twins born a few weeks early, my wife and I were always worrying if our babies were eating enough and gaining enough weight.  Going to the doctor once a month, and then less, helped, but we had no way of knowing how the babies were doing in between.  Then we got this scale.  For not too much money, we were able to weigh our babies at any time.  When we weighed them on the same days we went to the doctor, it seems this scale was often off by a couple of ounces.  But really, the scale is helpful to see how much the kids weigh compared to yesterday, or last week, not to determine their actual, accurate weight.  The cradle bed envelops babies nicely and makes weighing them quite easy.  You can zero out the scale after putting a blanket down for comfort, and the ""hold"" button allows you to get a weight reading even when the kids are squirming around.  Although it might not be the highest calibrated scale ever, it served its purpose and provided peace of mind.

"As our twins grew too large for their infant car seats/carriers, I started to research convertible car seats.  We wanted a quality seat that was easy to install and adjust, but also didn't want to spend TOO much.  In the end, it came down to this seat and the Britax Marathon.  After reading way too many reviews and looking at the seats in stores, we settled on the Recaro.  So far, no problems.  We still have them installed facing the rear, so I can't comment on their use as forward facing seats.My wife has a VW Jetta Sportwagen which is roomy, but not huge.  Being tall, I was looking for a seat that wasn't too long so we would be able to move the front seats back far enough to fit in.  The Recaro fit the bill and is slim enough to leave enough room for the front seat.Installing was a breeze.  The LATCH connectors on the Recaro were of MUCH better quality than those on the Graco car seat we had before, and much easier to get in.  We had to place some rolled up towels under the seat to get it level, but this wasn't a problem and is the consequence of our Jetta's seat slope, not the Recaro seat.  I think our favorite feature of this seat is the height adjustment knob.  It offers a continual height adjustment that is incredibly easy to set, rather than other seats that require you to undo all the straps and only offer a few step heights.  With the knob, we can just give it a twist every now and then as the kids grow.  With the ease of adjustment, we always feel confident that we have it set up right, giving us ease of mind that our kids are safe.My pet peeve with the Graco infant seat we had before was how difficult the buckles were to get undone.  The Recaro buckles seem like they are very high quality and don't take herculean strength to get on and off.  Those few saved seconds are crucial when you have a crying baby you are trying to get out of the car.Other simple things make using the Recaro a breeze.  For example, the shoulder straps have a little white stripe on the front so you can easily tell if they are twisted.  It might not seem like much, but these little things add up when you use the seat every day.  Also, as a dad, I'm happy these seats have simply colors and don't look too childish. They also look streamlined and not too bulky.  Their looks aren't a critical factor, but a nice bonus.Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the kids sit up high in these seats and are able to see out the window.  Our kids love this and seem to deal with car rides a lot better when they can see outside.We've had these seats for several months now and have no issues with them.  You can tell they are well built and will last a long time.  Although we didn't try different seats, I'm glad we settled on the Recaro seats.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYK6GARAT2M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I7ITS2#wasThisHelpful","R1FYK6GARAT2M0","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this to give to my little sister-in-law for christmas.  She asked for a sewing machine but we weren't sure how serious she was so we didn't want to get anything too fancy or too complicated.  After looking at reviews both on Amazon and elsewhere, we settled on this machine.  She had it out of the box and set up within a few minutes on Christmas day.  With some scraps of fabric, her older sisters helped her make a simple bag.  This machine was easy to set up and worked well enough for her to start working with it right away and with no problems.  I can't attest to its ability to handle more advanced users, but for someone just starting out on simple sewing, this machine offered a good balance between value, quality, and simplicity.  Also, its small size makes it easy for her to put away when she's not using it and not have it take up too much room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6H0094P2CGTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0021L9322#wasThisHelpful","R6H0094P2CGTS","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's face it: kids are dirty.  And kids outdoor are even dirtier.  This blanket provides the needed protection from the ground and is super easy to clean.The surface of the blanket is a nylon-like material, but soft.  It's not a cozy, snuggle up blanket, but a durable, waterproof mat to sit on.  With actual cloth blankets, any dampness from the ground quickly soaks through and any crumbs or food end up smashed into the fabric.  This blanket, however, avoids both of these problems.  Spilled food can be easily wiped up or swept up.  The waterproof, thick, cover prevents any moisture from wicking through.Maybe the best feature, however, is the ease in folding it up.  One section has a sturdy card built into it to assist in folding it up to the proper size.  Simply fold the blanket lengthwise into quarters (which are stitched into the blanket to help you get the right size) and then roll it up using the built in ""card"" to get the size right.  Then a velco flap folds over to hold it all together and you're ready to hit the road, carrying it by the included shoulder strap.  One person can fold this blanket up neatly in a matter of seconds.  It's a lifesaver when the kids are ready to go!We take this with us everywhere.  Like the name implies, it is an essential for any parent, or really any person, that spends time outside.  It has stood up to a lot of abuse over the last several months and is still going strong!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QY4BR14YMT96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZL22PY#wasThisHelpful","R2QY4BR14YMT96","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this based on the review on The Wirecutter and I'm glad I followed their advice.Let's be honest: it's a toothbrush.  It doesn't need a ton of special features, it just needs to get your teeth clean.  And this does the job.  As the review on The Wirecutter mentions, and as confirmed with a simple search, the sonic toothbrushes are really just a marketing gimmick and all the extra cleaning options don't really add any true benefit.Having used it for a few months now, I have no regrets.  It has a small, powerful head that allows you to reach all areas of your mouth.  Unlike some weaker brushes, I can feel that this is really getting my teeth clean.  It has a very indiscreet ""skip"" in the vibration every 30 seconds, with a ""double skip"" at two minutes to help you ensure a proper brushing time.  This feature alone makes this brush worth the purchase over simple brushes.  I'm sure I often got impatient when brushing with simple brushes and stopped brushing too quickly without some guide to gently remind you that you need to brush for two minutes.  I focus on a quarter of my teeth for each 30 seconds and then move on.  I've actually noticed a difference in the feel and look of my teeth after using this brush.The charging base is also easy to use.  The brush sits on top of the base and charges wirelessly.  The base is concave and ends up getting a little gunky no matter how clean I think my brush is after use, but it's simple to clean.Overall, after my research, I decided this brush offered the best value without going overboard on silly features.  I also have no doubts about it's quality: it's a Braun brush made in Germany and I plan on having it for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34HQQ710WMZZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UKM9CO#wasThisHelpful","R34HQQ710WMZZZ","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I admit that this bottle sits on my desk all day, it's not out hiking all the time.  I'm sure this is true for most people.  After using a wide range of bottles, here is how I settled on the Klean Kanteen:My criteria:  I sit at a desk all day and fill this up in the office kitchen.  I was only looking for a bottle to drink water out of.  I don't like the straw or sippy lids, I just wanted an open mouth design. Also, the ease of cleaning was critical given that I use the bottle everyday and was growing tired of the funk of other bottles.  After researching, the Klean Kanteen stood apart:1.  Perfect size mouth.  Nalgene's are wider, but too wide:  if you're not careful, it's easy to spill out the side of your mouth, especially when walking or in a car.  Also, the threads on the mouth are uncomfortable.  On the other side of the spectrum, I found the mouth of the Sigg bottles to be too small.  The size of the mouth matters not only for drinking, but also for cleaning:  I felt that I could never get the Sigg clean, whereas this is easy to get inside of with a brush to remove any nastiness that may accumulate.2. Just metal, nothing else:  I find that the metal bottles retain less ""flavor"" than plastic bottles.  My Nalgenes and Camelbaks seemed to retain a soapy residue after washing and also the flavor of anything other than water that I placed in the bottle.  The Sigg bottles seem like they are just metal, but actually has a plastic coating inside that started to flake away with time.  This Klean Kanteen is metal and nothing else, which always tastes clean and is also durable.  Although the metal conducts heat more than plastic, this wasn't a concern for me as I don't drink hot liquids out of the this bottle.3.  I would, however, get a different cap if you use this in an office or care about noise.  Inserting or removing the cap causes a loud metal-on-metal noise that is hard to avoid.  Likewise, the loop will hit against the body causing more noise.  Although the all-metal construction (other than a small silicone seal) is nice, it's not worth the noise to me.  Luckily, the lids are interchangeable.  If you don't care about noise, the bamboo lid is quite attractive.My search for the perfect bottle ended when I got the Klean Kanteen.  I can't see going back or switching to a different bottle any time soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKAVOJ7XQ5UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZF8D1K#wasThisHelpful","RMKAVOJ7XQ5UW","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the time for the arrival of our twins approached, I wasn't sure that the idea of cloth diapers would actually be worth it.  They seemed so expensive and just gross.  Who wants to wash off dirty diapers when you can just throw them away?  Other than the obvious ""green"" factors, the idea of cloth diapers just seemed like overkill.Now, 14 months later, I will admit that I was wrong.  These are just SO easy, really!  With the addition of the Fuzzi Bunz diaper bag, we simply remove the inserts from the diaper and put them in the bag after each changing.  then, in the morning, we unzip the bottom of the bag and drop them in the washer, run a couple of cycles, and they come out ready to hang and dry.  The exposure to poop is hardly any more than disposable diapers.And being the pragmatic dad, the best feature of these diapers is the cost savings.  With these one size diapers, we have used them from when our twins for just a couple weeks old up til now, at 14 months, with plenty of room to grow.  I would recommend these diapers for this reason alone.  The cost of disposable diapers is enormous when you add up the cost from birth to potty training.  Although cloth diapers have a high upfront cost, it is well worth it in the end.Also, we've had almost zero problems with diaper rash.  We wash the diapers with Charlie's Soap and the kids haven't been irritated at all.  After hearing horror stories from friends, the absence of diaper rash issues has been very welcome in our house.One final piece of advice:  don't think of it as an either/or proposition.  We still use disposables at night and on longer trips out of the house.  When it comes to diapers, practicality is more important than making a moral stand against disposable diapers.  By using the cloth diapers at home and disposables when out and at night, we do our part for the environment (and our wallet) while still staying sane.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROPE1JN74QUVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SWK6A2#wasThisHelpful","ROPE1JN74QUVL","A26ER7QE4RC38C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26ER7QE4RC38C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this battery online and noticed something odd, it weighs the same as my another brand battery that has a 1300mAh rating. Putting my engineering hat on I was wondering how that could be. I am familiar with the LiPo battery world and I know there hasn't been any major advancement in the technology in this market in years so that leaves one of two things; a) the battery mAh rating is lower than it is rated OR b) it has a horribly lower discharge rating.Putting the battery on the scale it weighs 110 grams while my BASTENS brand 1300mAh battery weighs 100. This is odd because the hard case should weight at least 10 grams, so I took it apart and weighed just the case ... the hard case is 16 grams. Ok, something funny is going on here. The raw parts of the 1500mAh battery weighs 94 grams! Thats significantly less than the 1300mAh *AND* more importantly less than the stock hard case 1000mAh battery!!! I should point out that the Parrot brand AR.Drone 1500mAh battery weighs more than 130 grams .... hmmmm ;)I decide it is time to measure the mAh on the next charge, I have a charger that measure just this. The trick is to put it at a lower amp charge rate to get the most accurate test. My results were as I suspected (see picture to the right in the 'Customer Images' area of this listing) it only took a 1292mAh charge.Now you may be wondering maybe I didn't deplete the battery correctly before charging or my charge meter is wrong. I ran this test on  another brand battery found here BASTENS 1300mAh LiPo battery or here with a charger BASTENS LiPo battery 1300mAh battery upgrade and balance charger for the Parrot AR Drone 1 & 2 type batteries Notice the BASTENS brand battery took a 1272mAh charge. Note that I used both batteries in the drone until I got the low battery warning then measured the cells, both batteries were at about 3.65v per cell. Point being my test was fair and scientific.The question now is why others have such good reviews, its simple. They are comparing to the stock 1000mAh battery and of course even a 1300mAh battery will be better. The point of this review is that this product is falsely advertising the mAh rating of the battery. My guess is that it is also has a low quality discharge rating as a result you will get less cycles.Taking a closer look at the product image, look close at the ""charge at"" on the label. Notice it says 1.3A. This proves my point, again let me explain. In general companies build LiPos to be charged at 1C which mean one times the capacity. In this case if they suggest to charge the battery at 1.3Amps than the capacity must be 1.3Ah (aka 1300mAh) using the 1C rule. Case closed.In summary this battery fails on many fronts:1) not as advertised, its really a 1300mAh battery2) has poor discharge rating resulting in fewer cycles (won't last as long)3) shame on the manufacture AND the sellers who are selling this battery!I don't know about you but I will stay clear of this battery in the future. There is no cheating this weight other than by cutting the capacity or the hard case.

"As the product mentions the battery does provide more flight time, the down side is it takes longer to charge with the stock battery charger and its heavier than the stock battery. The fact is the stock battery only weighs in at about 105 grams while this battery weighs in at over 140 grams! That is enough to affect the maneuverability of the aircraft, a trade off but something to consider. I wouldn't expect using this battery during a dog fight but if you are looking for raw flight time increase this battery will do the job.

"Loads of fun on a small scale. The great thing about small scale RCs is building a course is quick and easy. I own over 20 RCs (I am addicted) and I have lately relized the full of crawlers. Most think that without speed its no fun but with crawlers its all about the chalange of the terrain. This little RC will flex raising one wheel up to 2 inches !! This thing is a great crawler in that is has awesome slow speed to grab traction up rocks. This is great for those bad weather days. Throw a blanket on the floor and you have an instant course. Better yet a couple rocks (rinsed off of course) and even more fun.  How about a book or two ... the possibilities are endless.Now about the car. It comes with everything you need to get running, hense the term Ready To Run (RTR). In all honesty the included batters are a joke. They only last for about 15 min. An upgrade to LiPo type batteries will provide over 50 min of fun with only about 15 min to charge. No joke, its a night and day difference between the included batteries and LiPo. Here is an example battery upgrade kit offered here on Amazon:Bastens LiPo 7.4V 300mAh upgrade battery and balance chargerOther than a battery upgrade this RC will last a long time. No adjustments needed. Though you should keep an eye on the motor temperature. If the motor gets too hot that you cannot hold your finger on it for more than 5 seconds then give it a rest. Over heating motors is the number 1 failure in all RCs and it is easy to prevent.I recommend this RC!Happy Shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RFVU1FR4KVDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090TA8T0#wasThisHelpful","R1RFVU1FR4KVDI","A1IDAKX7OM3QIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDAKX7OM3QIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They are as great as the description makes it sound. I like the rubber like edge which is better for kids. Having a 6 year old still practicing this is important. A kit to the face with a typical Frisbee could cut deep enough for stitches, not with this Frisbee. Surprisingly the rubber holds well and stands up to pavement and concrete. If you can believe it the rubber is soft to the touch but tough enough to handle hard surface direct hits.It fly's very well and is easy to handle. At this price it is hard to beat.

"Loads of indoor fun, will work on pavement. Best in the garage but will work on sidewalks and driveways as long as the cracks are not too big.Being 4WD it is much easier to handle in comparison to the 2WD buggy styles that Losi offers. This truck handles little jumps quiet well, remember the scale of the little car so don't build too big of jumps, resist the urge or you will break something. Since Losi is a well known brand parts are easy to find online. Other small RCs are a one-off design so often parts are nonexistent. Sticking with a well known brand like Losi makes fixing and upgrading the RC possible.For the price it is loads of fun and great when racing with friends. Since it is small it is easy to build tracks and courses.Run time with the stock battery is not that great, only 15 min. If you run a larger LiPo upgrade you will get more than 50min run time and about 15 min charge times.I do recommend upgrading the battery, keep in mind to upgrade to LiPo you have to buy a new charger as well, for example here is an upgrade sold here on Amazon:Bastens LiPo 7.4V 300mAh upgrade battery and balance charger kit for the Losi 1/24 Micro SCT Short Course Truck / SCTE / Truggy / Rally / 4X4 Trail TrekkerWith a LiPo upgrade this car is MUCH faster! so before you hand it to a little kid they should be use to driving at partial throttle. Point being is the user has to be experience with the trigger because it is hard to handle at full throttle. Why have so much speed? really its the punch that is needed.

You will need a cup of water and your motor wired back to your electronics so it works just like if you mounted it in the vehicle. Put enough water into the cup so that you can submerge your motor in it. Next, turn on your radio and your electronics just like you were going to run the vehicle. Run the motor, and hold it in your hand while you turn the throttle trim up until the motor is running at a nice, steady rpm. You don’t want the motor going at full speed but you also don’t want it going too slowly. With your motor submerged in the water, let it run for about 10 minutes.

"A must upgrade to increase performance AND run time. Yup you read that right, it increases run time. Turns out brushless motors are more efficient compared to brushed motors.In addition brushless motors have almost no upkeep. The experts would argue that there is upkeep to any motor but the reality is for the averge user this has no upkeep in comparison to brushed motors. In theory this motor will last for ever ... if you use it right. To make it last longer don't push its limits. This motor is intended for a 1/10 scale (not the larger Summit or E-Revo), more or less for 5 lbs RCs.Don't over gear it, meaning if you put too tall of gear you will over work the motor. Stick to the charts and you will be safe.Keep it cool! The general rule is if you cannot keep your finger on the motor for more than 5 seconds than it is too hot. You can use passive heatsinks to keep the temperature down and keep your motor lasting longer ... like this one aluminum side mount silver heatsink fin fits 540 550 560 35mm brushed brushless 1/10 1/16 RCs Next to take advantage of the power in this motor you need a good battery. I recommend LiPo type batteries. LiPo batteries offer more power and weigh less. In addition LiPo batteries have no maintenance compared to NiMH (such as power cycling) and LiPo batteries will charger faster. Here is an example LiPo battery and charger kit (note you must get a LiPo charger, a NiMH charger will damage the battery and could cause a fire)LiPo 7.4V 5000mAH upgrade battery & balance charger kit factory fit for Traxxas connector 2x4 4x4 VXL Stampede Skully Rustler Bandit Slash Rally Brushless Velinion VXL-3s Brushless ready This motor is of good quality and you will not be disappointed.

The fact is with all RCs you should constantly watch the temperature of the motor. This can be done with a temperature gun and make sure it doesn't get hotter than 180F OR you can use the rule that if you cannot hold your finger on the motor for 5 seconds than its too hot and let it cool.If your driving style is pushing the limits of the motor than a simple heat sink fin will help a lot 540 550 560 can ( 35mm O/D Inrunner) size Aluminum side mount silver heatsink fin - fits 1/10 & 1/16 scale including the Traxxas models ","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIHJDRGZPCNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JLH0NG#wasThisHelpful","R1TIHJDRGZPCNC","A1IDAKX7OM3QIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDAKX7OM3QIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This can be done with a temperature gun and make sure it doesn't get hotter than 180F OR you can use the rule that if you cannot hold your finger on the motor for 5 seconds than its too hot and let it cool.

"Traxxas continues to lead in the RC market and still able to introduce fun changes like with the top on this one and the matching colored chassis.The great thing about Traxxas RC products is that they are built to last with a proven design. Parts are inexpensive and easy to find on the internet and at your local hobby store.By no means is this truck fragile rather if your doing a 20ft jump this truck will take the beating ... its all on how you land. If you land on the wheels you on your way, of course if you drop from 20ft doing a car wheel something may break ;)The fact is this car is fast for its size, almost too fast but that's a good problem to have :)I do recommend a couple accessories that will make the truck even more enjoyableLED lights. Who wouldn't like these?RC Car & Truck 6 LED Kit Set with Snap-In Holder Rings - 2 White Headlight / 2 Red Tail Lights / 2 Blue Fog or Parking Accessory Lights A LiPo battery upgrade. Don't get me wrong with the stock battery that came with the truck is fun but just doesn't last like a LiPo battery will. In addition the stock NiMH battery will not hold a charge on the shelf, so if you grab the truck you will have to charge the battery first ... with a LiPo you grab it and go. In addition LiPo batteries charge faster, take about 45 min or so. Here is an affordable kit that will speed the truck up AND I get run times of over 45 min of fun!Battery:7.4V 5000mAH LiPo upgrade battery and balance charger kit for the TraxxasI don't recommend upgrading parts to aluminum for kids use nor the RPM brand aftermarket plastic parts. If you do upgrade a part to aluminum or the tougher RPM brand parts the part will hold better but usually cause something else to brake that is harder to fix. If you keep the A arms stock than if you take a 20ft jump and brake one it is cheap and easy to fix.The stock servo may give out as they are the typical standard plastic geared servo that comes with any stock RC on the market. Go ahead and run it till it breaks then the trick is to get a metal geared servo. Increased torque is another good idea as well. I have found even the highest quality traxxas brand servo is not metal geared, so look a little harder for 'metal gear' in the description or title of the product. For example take a look at this servo:high torque and fast response servo upgradeIn the end I recommend this truck for bashing in the yard, in the grass, on dirt, and simply for loads of fun!Happy Shopping!UPDATE: One of you marked this review as helpful which motivated me to include one more tip.

"The reason why this will not get good flight time is because its way too heavy. The key is to get rid of it and use one that weighs the same but has higher capacity. This also means you will need to get a charger as well, which isn't a bad thing since the stock charger is slow to charge. Note there are some choices available but be careful, if you buy an aftermarket battery that weighs any more than the stock battery then the added capacity will be offset by the added wait resulting in no flight time gains :(There are higher capacity options that weight the same as this battery. You are lucky if you get 9-10 min of flight with this stock battery. If you are looking for more flight time, around 15-20 min flight times than here is a better solution:Bastens 1300 mAh LiPo battery upgrade for the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 & 1.0 - a high capacity alternative replacement battery  - 15 to 20 minute flight timeYou may want to consider purchasing the upgrade battery AND charger is to decrease charge time.

"I was very happy with the detail in this aircraft, it adds so much to the overall experience. In comparison to the balsa wood type rubber band airplanes this holds up better and provides more adjustments. The key is to tweak the aircraft for longer flights or for fun twists and loops! Of course this is a great way to teach the basics of flight aerodynamics ... and no you cannot just hand it to your 8 year old and expect them to have successful flights. This is a great family toy and eventually your child will pick it up and won't need help.I suggest getting an electric winder for two reasons. One, its quicker to wind the aircraft. Second and more importantly a winder with a counter provides a consistent thrust. What people don't realize if you adjust the aircraft but then wind the aircraft differently than the initial lift changes thus for consistent flight you have to wind the aircraft the same ever time.Here is where to buy an electric winder AA battery powered winder accessory for rubber band propeller propelled airplane Happy Shopping!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37T9DVGG0V3YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C7S60JI#wasThisHelpful","R37T9DVGG0V3YH","A1IDAKX7OM3QIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDAKX7OM3QIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great replacement for your stock setup. On the other hand if you are going to spend money then you may want to consider an upgrade to LiPo as other have mentioned. Let me explain further.

The rub with NiMH is they don't hold charge on the shelf and they require maintenance such as conditioning.

"We have found that this little charger doesn't seem to perform to the rated 1 Amp. The original battery that comes with the AR.Drone can charge up to a 1C rate of 1 Amp. The problem is if the charger only outputs 800mA than it takes longer to charge the battery, hence the performance complaints.The solution is to buy a better performing charger. The charger We offer can output a true 1 Amp rate and even more (remember do not charge the original battery fast than the 1 Amp battery or you will harm the battery or your self). You will get better charge times with this charger: Fast LiPo Battery Balance Charger for the Parrot AR DroneOr go one step further and buy an upgraded battery that will increase flight time and charge at a faster 2C rate of 2.6 Amps. The following battery will not only charge a little faster but it will also increase the flight time to 15-20 min: LiPo battery upgrade upgrade for the Parrot AR.Drone - 15 to 20 minute flight timeOR battery and new charger here: Fast LiPo Battery Balance Charger and 1300mAh battery for the Parrot AR DroneI hope this helps you enjoy your AR.Drone as it was intended!Happy Shopping!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D5B2HFQ61WQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041G5YAU#wasThisHelpful","R3D5B2HFQ61WQK","A1IDAKX7OM3QIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IDAKX7OM3QIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was about as disapointing as the Paderno and was returned right away. Read some of the 1 or 2 star reviews to understand why it was bad. Really never worked at all! Very gimmick-y. Makes me wonder if anyone actually tests these things before manufacturing them!A few months ago, I purchased an OXO julienne peeler OXO Good Grips Julienne Peeler and enjoyed using it for about 4 meals when I noticed the blades (teeth) which score the food before being sliced were all bent at different angles! The blade didn't seem all that sharp and dragging it over a carrot or parsnip was sort of difficult. However it had the widest teeth at 3.7mm making nice fat zoodles.Next I compared the Kuhn Rikon Kuhn Rikon Julienne Peeler with Blade Protector, Stainless Steel Handle and the MIU France MIU France Stainless Steel Swiss Peeler, Julienne Blade peelers. They both worked very well for hand-held tools. (Remember to anchor the base of the veggie, as one other reviewer noted, with a carving or large fork so you don't nick the fingers holding the veggie.)The MIU worked great, easy to use, but a relatively short handle which I found harder to hold on to. Comes with no protective cover for the blade, but I made one out of 3"" of clear plastic 1/2"" diameter tubing slit all along the long side. The teeth are 3.3mm apart which makes a thin spaghetti-type noodle, but thicker than angel-hair.The Kuhn Rikon has a nice long handle which I liked, and a cover for the VERY sharp blade.

"Since these great pillows are getting harder to find, and are getting more expensive, I decided to clean mine before throwing it away. I mean, it was going in the trash anyway so why not?I got a sponge dampish-wet and wiped across the fabric (since it's a knit, I wiped across the ribs rather than ""with"" the direction of the ribs). I was SHOCKED! The soil was coming off! Not that the pillow was disgustingly filthy, but after a year of touching it daily it did get a little grungy. Even a couple of chocolate spots (ok, busted!) came out. The fabric must be stain or spot repellant.Don't get the sponge too wet though. After going over the entire surface I hung it outside. Really it was barely damp. Took about an hour to dry and it looks great.Only then did I examine the big tag on my new one to discover ""TO CLEAN: Wipe surface with damp cloth.""!!!The only reason I can think of to replace the pillows more than every few years is the beads/pellets, whatever, seem to compress. My old one isn't as firm as the new one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1HL5N9U943D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V8RD4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1J1HL5N9U943D","A22NLBSGTF3IPL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22NLBSGTF3IPL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:55 MinsDimension for the large one: length 16.5"", width 8.5"", height 4"" from the ground. Inside bowl: 5.5"" diameter, 2.5"" depth.Bowls are made by durable silicone with hard plastic rim, each one holds exactly 2.5 cups.I bought this feeder for my corgi 10 months old and Its suit him well so for daily home use, I dont recommend it for larger doggies. The pink one is very cute yet brighter than Amazon picture, it looks like bright fuchsia. Legs are sturdy but also open/fold easily.

"The tube I received in Orange/Blue, not Orange/Yellow as Amazon picture. Purchased on August 2014, exp date was 07/16 (printed on top), Made in USA. Its texture blends in perfectly, didnt leave white cast or oily residue and very comfortable to wear. It has light citrus scent, but dont worry the scent isnt overpowering at all and gone in minutes. I like that this suncreen doesnt dry out  my skin yet still protects it well. About the ingredients, I've emailed the company for the difference between THINKSPORT & THINKBABY. They responsed that both have the same ingredients, but one used currant and one used papaya just to mask Zinc oxide smell.

"Before ordering this console, I honestly side eyed a lot of the glowing 5 star reviews that casually mentioned that they received this console free of charge in exchange for a review. Too good to be true right? Curiosity won me over in the end and I figured since the console was Amazon prime eligible, a return would be painless if the 5 star reviews were stretching the truth.The console arrived yesterday and it appears that I'll be eating my hat. Its design is well thought out and nothing short of amazing! We also own the Britax console and have used that for two years now. There's nothing wrong with the Britax console. The design of that is simple and it has worked for our basic needs. I still remember actually hesitating on purchasing the Britax console because it just seemed so simple for the price tag but I was a first time mom and I really just wanted the console brand to match the stroller. Those pregnancy hormones can wreak havoc on one's logic but I digress. I purchased the Britax console 2 years ago for $24 and this console a few days ago for $25. I have to say, this is worth every penny. The Britax one not so much.I'd say the Spark and Bee console is a greatly improved version of the Britax one. The cupholders are deeper so I don't have to worry about drinks pitching or flopping out. My iPhone 6 (in a Speck candy shell case) fits easily in the left mesh pocket. I'd be hesitant to say that any phone/case bigger than that would fit easily though. I love the three zippered compartments: two in the front and one mesh zippered compartment underneath the lid of the middle flap. One thing I've learned about being a mom and organized is that compartments are key in retaining your sanity. My keys fit easily with tons of room to spare in the largest zippered compartment. Credit cards can be slid effortlessly in and out of the zippered mesh compartment. Love that it's mesh so I can also easily see what's in there. Like I said, very well thought out design.Quality appears to be exceptional. Zippers run smooth and don't feel cheap. Seams are clean and tight. The middle flap is secured with a strong magnet. Material feels substantial. I'll update if I run into any problems with durability but as of now, this baby looks solid. The console itself fits easily on our BOB Revolution Flex and looks great. This is definitely one of those products I'll be recommending to all of my friends who are expecting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7SG1JW518SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUFFIQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1L7SG1JW518SQ","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Worked perfectly on our toddler's wooden step stool. We own the KidKraft step stool in the natural wood finish. I really liked the appearance of the natural wood, but the steps were extremely slippery. I hated the idea of covering up the wood with anti-skid tape so I'm relieved that I happened upon this non-skid spray.I followed the directions to a tee and did two, rather liberal coats. The spray dried clear. It is only discernible to me because I know how glossy the finish was prior to spraying the step stool. Feel wise, I'd liken it to a really fine sandpaper - not rubbery whatsoever. It gives my toddler enough traction without being rough on her feet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15DQMGY1JFJTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RHA5KE#wasThisHelpful","R15DQMGY1JFJTO","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stool is built to be very sturdy. The lack of any curse words from my boyfriend while he built it suggests that it was straightforward and easily to assemble. The only drawback - and in my book, a rather big one - is that the step stool is slippery! As in it slides around on our tiled bathroom floor. As in our toddler has slipped while using it, even in bare feet.To remedy this slippery situation, I sprayed Krylon's 3400 Clear Non-Skid Coating on the steps. I initially bought anti-skid tape but was concerned that it'd be too rough on my little one's bare feet. The clear non-skid coat works great and dried clear so we can still enjoy the beautiful natural wood color of the step stool. To keep the step stool from sliding around I used 3M Scotch Rubber Pads, Black, .75-Inch by .16-Inch Rubber Pads. The pads are a little wider than the actual base, but aesthetic wise doesn't look terrible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TG4DL7PNLBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CF4T4#wasThisHelpful","R5TG4DL7PNLBQ","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've purchased sunscreens on all ends of the price spectrum. I've come to the realization that I prefer how higher end sunscreens feel, but I found myself trying to use pricey ones sparingly to save money. Which kind of defeats the intent of buying sunscreen in my eyes.I love this particular Anthelios sunscreen because I feel like it's the best of both worlds. Price won't break the bank and yet it has the finish of a more expensive sunscreen. I have dark, olive skin and I love that this sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast on my face. It goes on a little greasy at first and then dries to a more velvet finish. I prefer to apply it and wait 20 minutes or so before putting on my liquid foundation.My skin is sensitive and acne prone - I actually took accutane at one point to clear up my acne. This sunscreen has never broken me out or irritated me. I've used it on my two year old (extremely sensitive skin, eczema problems) in a pinch and it worked well on her as well. I love that I can carry one sunscreen for the whole family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNXF2D0DECVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097GSSD4#wasThisHelpful","R1LNXF2D0DECVO","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 23 month old loves the movie Brave so I searched for a bow and arrows that were age appropriate for her. In addition to being safe for her (i.e. no pointed tipped arrows, etc.) I wanted it to be gender neutral in style/color and affordable. This set seemed to fit the bill. It's available via Prime so I thought I'd take the chance and just order it despite the less than glowing reviews about quality.I definitely agree that the quality isn't the best. Like another review said, if you had the tools I'm sure you could easily make this set yourself. The handle (??) part of the bow was wrapped with a synthetic cord that fell apart within a few minutes of my toddler just holding the bow. The suction cups of the arrows appear chewed up and old; they don't stick to anything. They also aren't attached or glued to the rest of the arrow. The wire cord of the bow has sharp ends as well.I decided to keep this set despite the initial quality. It just needed a little loving. I purchased black leather cord and re-wrapped the handle as well as the tips of the bow to cover the sharp cord ends. I also replaced the strap of the quiver with a braided leather strap that I made from the same leather cord. The last two pictures that I post reflect these changes that I personally made. I also sanded the set down as it was rough and I don't want my toddler getting splinters. I'll also be replacing the suction cup ends.The arrows do shoot an impressive distance although accuracy is questionable. It has the potential to be a great toy, quality is just lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROWPMBPAFQH3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EFWNRU#wasThisHelpful","ROWPMBPAFQH3H","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I initially got a different brand of snow boots for my toddler but wound up returning them because they were so difficult to put on. I decided to check out Sorel and I'm so glad I did!I measured my daughter's feet right before ordering the Sorels and she's currently a size 6. I decided to order one size up to leave room for growth and thick socks. They are a bit bulky but after a few steps, my little one was exploring the Michigan wintry wonderland with ease. Paired with the wigwam tot socks, these boots kept her feet warm and happy in the snow. We had to practically drag her back inside.Some details about the boots: the shearling trim doesn't extend past the cuff. The boots are lined with some sort of flat, fleece-like material and they do feel padded. The soles are very stiff.

"I searched high and low for something to protect my 22 month old's face from the harsh Michigan winter weather. We were initially just slathering Vaseline on her face whenever we went out. Then we tried Vaniply. Still no dice. Plus I hated how greasy ointments are (albeit they are the best emollient for dry skin), especially since my little girl loves to give me hugs and burrow her face into my shirt. Grease stains galore.We've had great experience with Mustela in the past so I was elated to see that they made a cold weather cream. I couldn't find it in any brick and mortar store within the vicinity so I ordered it from Amazon.The consistency of the cream is very thick. I was actually initially irritated with how thick it was (bit of a challenge to squeeze out of the tube). I haven't experienced any issues of a watery consistency that other reviews have noted. I'd assume that the tubes of watery cream are defective in some way.It does have that signature Mustela scent and it comes across very strong. My daughter does struggle with severe eczema and multiple allergies; I'm well aware of the no fragrances, etc. routine but scented Mustela products have never irritated her skin. If I didn't have any previous experience with the Mustela brand, I'd definitely raise an eyebrow over how strong the scent is. Just a caveat if that's important to you.My little one's face was actually peeling and extremely red the past few days from playing out in the snow several times. We thought it was an eczema flare up from an unknown food allergy but her prescription topical steroids weren't helping the way they normally do. I've been slathering this Mustela cream religiously instead of the steroids and it seems to be clearing it all up better than Vaseline, Vanicream, Vaniply, Cerave, Cetaphil, and even our most beloved Stelatopia.I too have patches of eczema so I tested out this cream on myself before putting it on my kid. I've experienced burning, stinging, and an increase in itchiness from tons of different lotions but this Mustela cold cream didn't hurt or increase my itchiness.I've spent a small fortune on lotions, creams, and ointments. Every brand you see in Target, I've tried it. For whatever reason, Mustela just works for my family the best. We'll definitely be getting more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGYYAPMYF1XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007WX0DK#wasThisHelpful","R1CGYYAPMYF1XL","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the matching Stonz mittz for our daughter and really liked them so I figured it'd be the same for the booties; unfortunately, I just find the booties to be an awkward fit. In theory, the two bungee cords should make putting the booties on a breeze but I felt like I just couldn't tighten them enough to keep them securely on my little one.I ordered the size 1-2.5 years for my daughter that's 22 months old. She's on the petite side, with a size 5 shoe size (give or take, depending on the brand) and I find that these booties are just too big. I'm aware that the booties are designed to be worn with booties linerz, by themselves, or over another pair of shoes. I opted with purchasing the linerz as the thought of putting a pair of shoes and then having to work booties on top of those shoes on my impatient toddler sounded like torture. I find that the linerz shifted around in the booties and that was irritating. Perhaps it's because the booties themselves are really loose on my kid. Ideally, I want boots for my toddler that I can just easily slip her feet into and call it a day.Unfortunately, I don't like the fit and look enough to keep them but it doesn't necessarily mean they're bad shoes. Quality wise, the stitching is great and the materials used seem quite durable. The sole has a rough texture reminiscent of gritty sand paper. They are also much more lightweight than traditional snowshoes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHSXT2GGYUAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTW1GYK#wasThisHelpful","R2CHSXT2GGYUAI","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't even want to think of how much money I wasted trying to find mittens and gloves that would stay on my strong-willed 1.5 year old. How many times I've wrestled with her to put a pair on, only to have her rip them off with her freakishly Herculean toddler strength within seconds. I'd nearly admitted defeat and let her run around in <50 degree weather sans gloves; however, a recent playground stint, where I felt every pound of judgement pouring out of every parents' eyes upon looking at my bare handed child, spurred me in my quest to find some mittens that would stay put.So imagine my delight when I stumbled upon these Stonz Mittz gloves! I love that it cinches easily in two places. I like that there is no thumb so that's one less thing to worry about as I struggle to coax them on my darling daughter's squirmy, angry fists. She's screamed and howled in disdain over my mitten success (strong-willed, remember?), but at least I can rest a little more easily knowing that her hands are finally sheltered from the elements.

"After skimming a few reviews on several Leveret 2 piece pajamas, I decided to order some 2T pajamas for my 19 month old who is currently wearing 18-24 months. For reference, my daughter has pajamas predominantly from Baby Gap, Carter's, and Hannah Anderson. We run her pajamas into the ground with how much she wears them so I'm always on the look out for some quality pajamas that will withstand the toddler tornado.I was impressed with the initial softness of the cotton. The softness is reminiscent of the Hannahs that we own; however, the Leveret cotton is notably thinner than that our Hannahs. I compared a never washed pair of Leveret 2T pajamas with a never washed pair of 2T Baby Gap pajamas and they were identical. They even have the identical stitching style on the bum that allows for more room for a diaper. Upon washing both in the same load, the Leverets shrank considerably while the Baby Gap pajamas stayed the same size. The Leveret 2Ts fit my daughter now without having to fold any cuffs over.

"I purchased this pillowcase to go along with the pillow that I also purchased from A Little Pillow Company. The quality of the stitching and construction is fine. Plus it fits the pillow perfectly and I do like the envelope style. My issue is that the fabric is a huge disappointment. I'm not a sheets snob by any means but this fabric is disappointingly scratchy. Our cheapest cotton shirts are softer than the white pillowcase that I got. Order with caution.**UPDATE**We've had this pillowcase for less than 3 months and the stitching is already failing. I was pretty disappointed to find out that a corner had come undone. My daughter only uses this pillow to lay her head on during naps and bedtime. We haven't used it for travel or even during playtime, etc. I'm dismayed with the quality.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJDRY6J036LY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFZ3XAG#wasThisHelpful","R2KJDRY6J036LY","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the simplistic style of Old Soles petal ballet flats. Unfortunately, my daughter's size was sold out everywhere so I was elated when I came across these flats in a similar style from See Kai Run. My daughter's 18 months and is on the more petite side with a shoe size of just about 4.5. I ordered the 12-18 months as well as the 18-24 months initially. The 12-18 months fit just right with a tiny bit of wiggle room for growth. She can wear thick tights in addition to these flats without any fit problems. I love the way the ankle is padded and the leather is soft. My daughter's a serial shoe remover, but these babies stay securely on her feet.Only downfall is that the leather does scuff somewhat easily. She wore them this past weekend while we visited a pumpkin patch. Now there's already a small nick in the leather around the toe area and we've had the shoes for only a week. It's my fault as in hindsight; I should have just put her in sneakers. I just didn't think twice about babying the leather.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEHYMMKW06L3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3ZR36S#wasThisHelpful","R3UEHYMMKW06L3","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Getting older and going through all the hormonal changes from having a child has really messed with my skin, which wasn't even close to being ideal to begin with. I've always yearned for a gentle cleanser - I have extremely sensitive skin - that is strong enough to remove the liquid foundation that I wear. Paula's Choice Skin Recovery Cleanser is probably my top favorite cleanser of all time. Its price point is cheaper if you were to buy directly from Paula's Choice website; however, they only offer free shipping on orders of $50+. If you're an Amazon Prime member and you're not looking to order anything else from Paula's Choice, I'd say it's priced fairly here.The cleanser's consistency is that of a more milky Cetaphil. It keeps this consistency and doesn't really work into a lather when I wash my face; however, it removes nearly all of my makeup. During the day, I always wear sunscreen and I typically opt to wear liquid foundation that's in the medium-to-full-coverage range (i.e. thick, liquid foundation). The first time I used this cleanser, I was impressed with how efficient it was in removing my makeup. I can tell if a cleanser isn't that efficient because I'll see the traces of foundation on the cotton pads/balls when I use a toner after washing.I never see any residual foundation on the cotton pad after I've used this particular cleanser. It isn't strong enough to remove my waterproof eye makeup completely, but that's why you get a separate eye makeup remover.I've noticed that since using this cleanser, my face stays in the dewy range without going too oily. I love that it doesn't leave you with that super squeaky feeling after washing up. My skincare routine is currently this cleanser, Thayer's witch hazel, Paula's Choice 2% BHA liquid, Paula's Choice C15 super booster, and Paula's Choice moisture boost face cream. I'm still experiencing some breakouts, but the overall texture of my facial skin has improved drastically and it's only been about a month of doing this new skincare regimen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEXFA5RWWBGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AI12LXK#wasThisHelpful","R2XEXFA5RWWBGV","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For reference, I'm shy of 5', 106 lbs, and 32DD. I ordered a medium because of multiple reviews that stated that the swimsuit ran small. The medium was still way too small in the chest area for my taste and I'm generally comfortable with showing cleavage. Because it was a medium, the suit was ill-fitting on the bottom portion so it made it look sloppy. I think the price is fair for the quality of the suit though. I'd recommend this suit to ladies with smaller chests.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHATGAOTHFLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHR7Y3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2RHATGAOTHFLQ","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was torn between the Guava Family (GF) lotus crib and the Baby Bjorn (BB) travel crib. I decided to order both so that I could compare them side by side! Please bear with me as being succinct was never my forte.The carrying cases for both are stylish and subdued.For the BB crib, you can only carry it via two handles on top - much like a brief case. For the GF crib, you have two options: like a brief case or as a backpack. I like how the GF's carrying case gives you two options; however, the quality of the BB carrying case is better. The fabric is noticeably thicker and I suspect may be more durable in the long run if you're rough with your baby gear.The set up design of both cribs is instinctive.I was able to set both up without reading the owner's manual. For the GF crib, the mattress pad is secured via velcro tabs located underneath the pad. You pull the tabs through slots on the bottom of the crib and secure it to velcro tabs there. I was able to do all four velcro tabs just by touch. There's a bit of fumbling but I don't think that necessarily detracts from the ease of set up. I noticed that the mattress pad did pull up at four corners initially, but after a few days it now lays relatively flat.The BB mattress pad is secured via red tabs pulled through corner slots of the crib. They're anchored with a hook-loop mechanism instead of velcro. It was admittedly easier and faster to anchor the BB mattress than it was the GF mattress because I could see what I was doing. The BB mattress pad also initially pulled up at all four corners and is now settling down and laying flat. Neither crib had any discernible odor upon set up.As for the mattress pad, I'd say the BB mattress is double the thickness of the GF mattress. You can order a plush quilted sheet to make the GF mattress softer. I personally prefer the more plush mattress as my child is 15 months; however, I could also see why others would prefer the thinness of the GF mattress. I'd say it's akin to any typical Graco pack'n'play mattress. We have the American Baby Company 100% organic cotton interlock fitted pack'n'play sheet and it fit fine on both mattress pads.I feel that overall, the quality of material is noticeably different. The fabric at the top of the GF crib is not as smooth and luxe to the touch as the BB one is. One review noted that they felt like the former fabric could potentially snag more and I can see that happening. The top fabric parts of both cribs can be zippered off and washed. The mesh material of both feel exactly the same.To take down the GF crib, there are two handles on the top part of the frame that you simply squeeze. The location of the handles is indicated by white circles with upward arrows. For the BB crib, you tug the legs down and fold.Because the GF crib is shaped like a box, its footprint is larger than that of the BB crib. The legs of the GF also stick out further than the BB crib's legs. They're both roughly the same height. In terms of aesthetic appeal, I'd go with the BB crib. It's sleeker and I prefer the all black look versus the grey, white, and black of the GF crib.What I really enjoyed about the BB crib is how user friendly set up and take down is along with the materials used. I feel like the $60 or so difference in price tag of the BB crib is fair given its more apparent quality. Ultimately, I feel like you can't go wrong with either crib. They both have their pros and cons. If I could, I'd engineer a travel crib that had the sleek, luxe look and quality of the BB crib with the side zipper, carrying case, and folded dimensions of the GF crib. In the long run, I decided to go for the BB crib because I felt like it suited my family's needs more.Happy traveling!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298HVSIKRW4GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM8G038#wasThisHelpful","R298HVSIKRW4GE","AL38HEYIOMG9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL38HEYIOMG9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is indeed a beautiful sculpture--- I don't think the pictures do it justice. Heavy gauge metal, beautiful brilliant colors, heavy clear top coat--- it looks like it will last a long time. But ""the slightest breeze sets the bouquet of color into motion"" is not true at all. Winds of 5-10mph, enough to make my lawn flags ripple and leaves on my trees rustle, have zero effect on this sculpture. Doesn't turn even slightly. And it's not because it's not well balanced, but because it's perfectly flat--- there are no curved vane edges to catch wind and generate rotational energy, and so you have to have strong winds for it to move.

"The Coravin is sturdily built with steel components. It works as advertised--- its needle plunges through the cork, and then you can press a button to put in argon gas and pour out the wine.  Since you're pouring through a needle it takes awhile to fill a glass, but it's a simple process once you get the hang of it. It comes in an attractive black storage box with a magnetic clasp. It would be nice if the storage box had dedicated space to hold spare argon canisters but it does not. I think the ideal use for this would be for someone who has a variety of fine reds and enjoys just one glass in the evening, and may not pour another of that bottle for another week or month. If you mostly pour reds at parties or dinners where you'll use the whole bottle in an evening obviously you don't need the coravin, and if you tend to go for inexpensive blends then the cost of the unit and cartridges are more than the cost of wasted wine from a half used bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABX8DDEOGHSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOH28S0#wasThisHelpful","RABX8DDEOGHSW","A1HOLJW15Q5S5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a cute doll and easy for a toddler to understand and play with, by touching the bow, blouse, and skirt they circle through different colors, while Minnie says the colors. So far, so good. But to ""lock in"" your color selection you press the doll's hand and then Minnie starts crooning a really awful rewording of Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors.""  And I mean REALLY AWFUL, the first time you hear it. And guess what, it doesn't sound better the 100th time your toddler plays it either. A little music that didn't butcher a Grammy nominated 1980s ballad would have been so much better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JROUGYHDTWW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKTFA6#wasThisHelpful","R3JROUGYHDTWW4","A1HOLJW15Q5S5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1HOLJW15Q5S5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Pin Art Board is so much fun. I had so much fun with one of these when I was a teenager. So when I saw one I really wanted to get one for my teenagers. Everyone loves making funny things in the pins, fingers and hands and pushing fun shaped toys in it. Its as big as the palm of your hand plus around the edges.

While these are geared more towards girls, my boys didn't care about the colors at all. They just love Doc McStuffins. They each have a twist off lid and a silicone stopper to make them not leak.

"This is a super heavy duty well made glass baking dish. It has a pretty etching on the handles. My husband is a chef and loves to cook and loves to get new kitchen gadgets. He was very impressed with our new baking dish. It's a very thick shatterproof glass and super heavy duty. This could be used in a commercial kitchen just as well as in a kitchen at home. The glass is super thick. We have tried using ours for chicken, and desserts. It works well for anything that I have tried. Best of all I don't have to worry about it slipping and breaking. I am super clumsy so this is a real concern in our house. I have broken so many dishes. This dish is just so well made. It's safe for most uses and almost can not be broken.

"This TENS unit is almost identical to another one I got in July. I have been wanting to get another for gifts for awhile now and so when I realized it was almost the same unit.  It's a great size, perfect for travel or even keeping in your rv or your car. It is about the size of a universal remote control. Batteries are included which is a plus. It comes packaged in a box, nothing rolling around. It includes the remote, wires, pulse pads, batteries, and instructions. I suggest discussing the best use with your physical therapist or pain specialist on the best way to use a Tens Machine for yourself and how long and what strength.To use: Clean the area you will be using it on, then dry. Attach the wires to the remote. One at a time (so they don't stick to something else and get dirty) attach the pulse pads to the area that is bothering you. Do this for both sides. Make sure they are well attached, because if they fall off, your gonna get a shock trying to get them back in place. Once they are firmly in place turn on each side's dial to the LOWEST setting. Move this up slowly one side at a time till you are getting a comfortable amount of pressure. Do not turn it up too high. (Again contact your doctor if you need too) This set like the similar one I use has numerous settings, levels and areas. You should try them out until you see what works for you because it is different for everyone. This TENS machine has an automatic shut off at 15 minutes. As an advanced user that kind of annoys me but this is a good thing for beginners.The LCD Screen has a picture of a human body to show you the area for your session. It also shows you how many minutes are left in your session. If you need to start a new session you must turn the dials off, and the turn them back on. The button settings include Waist, Shoulder, Joint, Hand-Leg, Repeat and Sole. There is a Speed setting so you can make it go faster or slower. Then there is settings for Massage, Beat and Knead. You really need to play with these to see what helps your pain. This is pretty much identical to my last Tens Unit.When your done with your session you should ALWAYS carefully remove the pulse pads and place back on the sheet they came on. If you take care to only put them on clean skin and return to their sheet, they will last you quite awhile. Just like my previous one this is an excellent TENS machine. I have been very pleased with this model. It works just as good for me as the one my doctor puts me on when I go in to their office.I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHZ13V70A7X0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TOJ948#wasThisHelpful","R1IHZ13V70A7X0","A3GPLSN45GJBBM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GPLSN45GJBBM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is such a cute drum set for your young aspiring musician! At first when you open the box, you may think that all the pieces are not there. The drums were safely nestled inside one another for easy packing, and there was cardboard to protect the delicate drums. Then you have your stool pieces, and your cymbals holder and your drumsticks. Also included is a foot pedal to have your little one bang on the big drum at the bottom! The directions were a bit tricky at first but in fact putting it together was quite simple. Your big drum sits at the bottom, you have feet that hold it up. Then your other drums (4) slide into the plastic holders you attach to the big drum. Everything attaches there. Two larger drums slide into the attachments on either side, and the 2 mini drums attach at the top to another plastic piece you insert on the top of the large drum. On the same top setup you slide on your cymbals and there are caps to put on to hold them. The drumsticks are simple plastic drumsticks.I know many people are afraid to buy a drum set for their child simply because of the noise. You'll be happy to know that this particular set is not overly loud. Its a great starter set for a younger 3-5 year old child, and with gentle handling it can last through some fun beats! The stool is a nice thick plastic stool easily put together by sliding legs together and attaching the top. You will not need any screwdriver or hammer to put this together, just a little patience and about 20 minutes!I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OSM45TXBHX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100WRJQ0#wasThisHelpful","R16OSM45TXBHX1","A3GPLSN45GJBBM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GPLSN45GJBBM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I love the fluted rim, it makes my crust look beautiful.I am very pleased with this plate, it has come in handy when I bake.

"I seriously can not tell you how awesome this is. It's super easy to pair with any device. I have used my iPad, my phone, and my kids phones to use it.

Also I can move the lamp around without having to keep taking the bulb out. I however after scanning the QR code with my iPad 2 could not get the app to work. So I honestly have no idea how the colors work. I was sad about that, but honestly even without it this speaker bulb is so awesome.The quality of sound is really good and comparable to my better Bluetooth speakers.

"I love old fashioned everything, but especially bathing suits. They are so much more flattering for women who are not scrawny and have hips or bellies from age or babies. This high waist bathing suit is so flattering. I have a baby belly and larger hips and I just loved how it looked on me. I was worried I would look bad, but it's super flattering. The bottoms are high waist and ruched up the front sides. This is super slimming and flattering to your figure. The bathing suit top is like a bikini top, but with more full coverage, it's also super soft and again figure flattering. It hides rolls and gives you nice cleavage but not over done like if you were 18. It ties in the back and around the neck.This suit is a navy blue color with red polka dots. It's very vintage and retro looking. It reminds me of suits on our grandparents generation. Clothing was so flattering back then for curvy women. I found that this ran slightly big on me. I am 5'2, a size 10/12. I have a 36C chest. I ordered the XL and the top fits perfectly but the bottoms are slightly loose.

It is a very beautiful addition to our decorations.I am very happy with this wreath as it lets us celebrate our faith and brightens up our house. This wreath is very well built, and very hopeful it will survive our toddler. All of the baubles are on securely bring a simple yet elegant touch to the wreath. This one is meant for the hall, but it can go wherever you find a perfect spot for. For those who believe, and those who don't, this makes a great decoration for holidays to come.I received this product free for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8950GLHZZT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178AL058#wasThisHelpful","R2L8950GLHZZT4","A3GPLSN45GJBBM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GPLSN45GJBBM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My boys love to play in their kitchen when I cook dinner. And the love to play hide and seek, so I thought what a great way to combine the two would these eggs be. The boys absolutely loved this idea. The eggs themselves are made out of a durable plastic. So when my toddler tosses them at his brothers, they don't break.These are also great for decorating around the house. They are a natural tan color and look like real eggs. I used some of them to make a wreath and some cute little ornaments. There are plenty in the sack for both crafts and playing.

"This firetruck is loads of fun and what kid does not like firetrucks? Sadly I do not see it lasting long, because of how its built. It has all the cool gadgets and whistles, ladders, and water sprayer guns and flashing lights. Our siren did not work at all which makes me sad. The flashing lights were my kids favorite parts. The truck moves back and forth but does get stuck fairly easy. It has rubber wheels, but most of it is plastic.The best part is that it comes with rechargeable batteries and so can be charged and used over and over. The cord plugs into the bottom of the firetruck from the charger. It's about 2 foot long so has to sit and charge. You can not play with it as it is charging.

"My family just adores this shampoo for babies and little ones. The smell is so great, almost good enough to eat. It makes fun bubbles when poured under the flowing water in the tub. All kids love a bubble bath, and I love one that smells so good. It's also a body wash and a shampoo. I normally am leary of items that are shampoo and body wash but this is excellent. It works very well on both my one and two year old's hair. My one year old has thin, wispy hair, and my two year old has super thick curly hair. This Shampoo worked equally well on both hair types. Using it as body wash has added a good amount of moisture, especially to the one year old who has terribly dry and sensitive skin. He tends to always be broken out, or get splotches and hives from anything on his skin. This did none of those to him. I used it to try it and it feels luxurious and lathers good (I know some people need that lather) I loved this Shampoo/Body Wash more than any baby bath I have tried so far. It greatly surpasses the big name brand J&J baby wash.I received this free for my honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FVZEAYQ3JSDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01672BWHO#wasThisHelpful","R3FVZEAYQ3JSDO","A3GPLSN45GJBBM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GPLSN45GJBBM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have found this product quite useful around our house. We all at one time or another have left the bathroom quite odiferous. Using just a few pumps in the bowl before we go has helped reduce the smells that linger. It now smells like lime and coconut instead of port o potty. I love that it's all natural and non toxic, so my family isn't being fumed out or surrounded by toxins.I also spray a little in the bottom of the trash can in both the kitchen and bathroom to help eliminate odors in there. It works wonders in the dog bed and around the cat litter box. I take it with me to help freshen places like rest stops and public restrooms. I'm eager to try other scents that this company has.

"This is one of the coolest things that I have seen in a while! I have to admit that when I opened the box I was a little skeptical. After I got started, i changed my mind and didn't want to stop playing with it. This is a great way to do art, it lets my creativity run wild. After I had read the instructions, I began to create. The instructions are pretty straight forward and the pen is easy to set up, then you're off and running.I can see my drawings in 3D now and that is awesome! It takes a little practice to get used to the flow of the filament but after that it's super easy. Another thing to get used to is holding it comfortably, the feed button is on the side,not the top.

"We love to have dinner parties with friends. And having a good set of steak knives is  a very good thing. This set fits the bill just fine. They are elegantly crafted and very well made. With a full tang, they are superbly balanced. I love the way the wood handle ties it all together. And the stainless steel blades are super sharp, so I don't have to worry about sharpening too often.When our friends see these beautiful knives, they always say that they want their own set.

"I adore this charm bracelet. It's just so beautiful. Not only is it lovely but it also is a powerful talisman that I like to wear daily. This particular bracelet is a thick silver bracelet with a full closing clasp with heart lobster hook.  It's capped with a pretty silver and black bead on both ends, then is followed by round silver beads,then black and silver beads, blue Murano glass eye beads, silver beads with blue stones,  then there are some hanging silver charms that are blue and white. There is the evil eye charms and a Hamza (hand) charm. This is sure to ward of evil and keep you doing well, not to mention that it is just so beautiful. I have worn mine a couple days a week since it arrived with no wear to the bracelet at all. My grandmother would be so glad to know I felt protected and would be happy to see my following my culture.

"This oil is um-mazing!! I had read about carrot oil being good for your skin and hair, but I had no idea that it really worked. I have found out that if you add some to your shampoo, your hair get a level of shine that inspires envy. And just a few drops on my skin works wonders! I used it on my Crow's feet and after a couple of nights of using, those ugly lines had started to fade some. I also noticed that after using this, because my nails came in contact with the oil, they seemed stronger. I don't know how this amazing oil works, but I'm sold.I most definitely recommend this to all of my friends! They're so jealous of my radiant skin and hair. I'm so in awe of this oil, it is a happy new discovery for me and I have tried a ton of different oils. I am definitely doing more research as to what else this product can do for me.

"These are so pretty. I love how the Tiger Eyes shine and the color moves and changes with the light. They come on a hook earring style, with little Swarovski crystals crystals embedded in them. The floral pattern is a black and silver colored metal and goes all the way around the Tiger Eyes. I can not wear them because I can't wear metal earrings but my mom just loves them and they suit her wardrobe style.

"I love to cook with all different kinds of food. And two of my favorites are truffles and olive oil! Together they have such an amazing flavor combination. The truffle brings a smoky, woodsy taste to the distinctive olive oil. This is one of those things that is best in moderation. Having said that, I would happily use this in a wide variety of dishes from pastas to to soufflés and beyond!Before, I would infuse my own, now I just give a couple of sprays and my beloved truffle is added to my dishes. This is a very handy canister to have in my kitchen. Though I personally have to be careful as I would use it up quickly, I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the truffle like I do! I will be buying  more ,soon.I also got a wonderful basil infusion that is absolutely amazing! It goes great in my salad dressing and gives all my sautéed foods a unique flavor. And surprisingly it adds a tasty flavor to some of my desserts.

"I have wanted a new set mixing bowls for a long time now. When I found this stainless steel set, I was overjoyed! They all have a pour spout and a rubber handle, which is is awesome for pancakes.

The best is that they all stack in one another for easier storage.After getting these bowls, I don't want to use any others. They clean up really quick in the dishwasher. When I looked at the sides, I noticed measurements , this makes baking even easier. If you like to cook as much as I do, then I highly recommend this set!

"I have not been able to attach this yet because it does not fit my style of faucet, so I am just going on the item out of the box mainly. I love that it is BPA free, so that sold me right away.

It's not huge so will not take up much counter space at all. The filter in this can last up to a year which I really love. That is a good amount of time for any kind of water filter.

"As an artist, I love to work outside, but taking large sketch pads is cumbersome. With these two books I get to make art wherever I am. I love that I can keep my drawing flat.

And the paper is perfect for all of the mediums that I use, but it is particularly wonderful for charcoal and pencil as it lets me blend really well. The pages are perforated so it makes it easier to take out my drawings.These books come in handy for quick study sketches as well as more detailed drawings.

"I have tried this brand of Shilajit before. I got the smaller size of PurBlack Shilajit the last time. I will say that I have responding amazingly well. I've experienced increased vitality, I feel well rested, I feel more calm. I also have intense pain in my lower spine, and muscles and joints from Fibromyalgia, Arthritis and Lupus. I have experienced a decrease in pain since I began taking this Sjilajit. I have been using it around 2 weeks now. I started out at one pea size a day, and by around 1pm I noticed my levels would go back up, so I started taking it at lunchtime. Now it lasts all day. There is a lot in this jar and so it will last me, even twice a day for quite awhile.

"First published in 1940, SHADOW OF THE SWASTIKA is a transcript of a six-part radio drama series, originally broadcast on the BBC Home Service between November 1939 and January 1940, charting Hitler's rise to power and subsequent expansionist foreign policy during the Thirties as he sought Lebensraum, or living space, for his chosen German people.The style is what might be described as agit-prop in tone, comprising a series of dialogues between politicians, diplomats, and ordinary members of the population, either commenting on or implementing Hitler's policies.  Hitler himself appears as a driven man, continually making promies - and taking others in as he does so - and subsequently breaking them.  Aided and abetted by faithful lieutenants including Göring as Minister of Propaganda, he not only wins over German hearts and minds, even though he seldom if ever obtained a parliamentary majority, but intimidates the leaders of neighboring countries to submit to his will.  Hence his annexation of Austria was achieved at comparatively little human cost.On the other hand Lloyd and Vinogradoff's script portrays the Führer as somewhat paranoid, perpetually apprehensive of being toppled by his enemies.  Hence his predeliction for wanting to crush them at all costs, even if they have not done anything wrong.  The so-called ""Knight of the Long Knives"" of 1934, when he had his one-time faithful ally Röhm murdered in cold blood is a good example of this.As befits one of the co-authors (Lloyd was a lifetime advocate of folk culture), SHADOW OF THE SWASTIKA gives plenty of voice to ordinary people whose voices matter yet remain startlingly irrelevant to Hitler's overall purpose.  So long as they keep quiet and accept his racist policies without question, then they will not be harmed.  But SHADOW OF THE SWASTIKA shows that their voices do matter, for it is only by listening to ordinary people that the horrific consequences of Nazism come to light.  One sequence where a father criticizes Nazi policies and then worries about whether his son (an active member of the Hitler Youth movement) has overheard, and might report him to the authorities for sedition, is especially chilling.The dramatic style might seem strident, even naive to modern readers; but we have to remember that SHADOW OF THE SWASTIKA is an immediate response to contemporary events broadcast in the first months of the Second World War.  It was obviously designed to apprise listeners of Nazism's true threat to the future of free speech and democratic values and thereby inspire a greater determination to resist, whatever the consequences.

Suffice to say that the source-text's author is Bernard Cornwell, an established writer of historical adventures set in various historical periods that have translated successfully to television in the past (remember SHARPE (1993-2008))?Directed by four different people (Anthony Byrne, Ben Chanan, Peter Hoar and Nick Murphy), THE LAST KINGDOM is basically SHARPE transposed to the Saxon/ Viking era, with the same combination of familial politics, intrigue and rivalry. The moral priorities are determined from the first episode onwards: the Sharpe-character is personified by Uhtred of Babbanberg (Alexander Dreymon) who must negotiate several obstacles before he can assume his rightful place in the formation of a new kingdom. Good guys and bad guys are easily distinguished, chiefly by their hirsuteness; the bad guys have bushier beards and longer hair than their rivals.Each episode has its fair share of incident, romance, and a touch of pathos; the visual style owes a lot to Ridley Scott's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (2005), with its lengthy pans of lonely isolated, almost primeval landscapes contrasted with dimly-lit interiors illuminated by candlelight. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the elements - sunrises, sunsets, storms, wind and rain - making us aware of how difficult life can be for those trying to establish social and political order. Hence their acts of heroism become all the more noteworthy.THE LAST KINGDOM might be hokum, but it is nonetheless highly entertaining: we care for the characters and their futures, even if we are well aware of what will happen in the end. As with most adventure novels, there is little doubt that it will have a morally definite ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LNYMD2LM76PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CRQQ9U#wasThisHelpful","R3LNYMD2LM76PE","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First published in 1952, and here translated into racily colloquial British English by Cengiz Lugal, CEMİLE tells a straightforward tale of its eponymous heroine, a teenager working in a factory spending most of her evenings looking after her family; her aging father Musa and brother Sadri.  She falls in love with thirty-lira-a-month clerk Necati, but the two of them cannot get married due to Necati's poverty.  Hence she is viewed a potential marriage prospect by the much older Pockmark Halil, an oleaginous man with plenty of money who would be prepared to carry her off and wed her by force if necessary.This love-story is set against the background of an emerging industrial society whose factory workers are badly paid and resent the introduction into their midst of an Italian manager, whom they believe is out to swindle them out of their hard-earned money.  Life at the factory is dominated by corruption, with illiterate co-owner Kadir scheming against his more educated partner Numan, and the intermediate managers below them all out for their own ends.Life in Musa's house and its environs is equally complicated, with families living pell-mell on top of one another in a world where everyone knows one another's business and privacy is a quality seldom enjoyed.  Community life has its benefits - especially when someone falls ill - but it has its disadvantages as well, especially for those such as Cemile who are perceived as being less powerful than their elders.Orhan Kemal's novel offers a vivid portrait of a society in flux during the mid-twentieth century at a time when the Republic of Turkey underwent profound socio-economic change.  Rapid industrial growth led to mass migration from the country to the city, with people living in gecekondus (slums) and working for pittances.  The elders dreamt of the past, or of an idealistic future when they could take their earnings and return to an idyllic life in the country.  Yet that prospect was never a serious one; once people had shifted to the city, they mostly stayed there for life.In this newly-emergent world of capitalism, everyone is out for themselves.  Even in a community-based society where family values retain significant importance (insofar as girls are expected to look after their male elders), individuals such as Pockmark Halil believe that anything and everything exists for their pleasure and can be picked up and put down at will.  The fact that he the kind of person prone to spend most of his leisure hours drinking and eating döner kebap, renders him all the more morally worthless.The plot comes to a head when Numan lays off many of his factory workers, rendering them permanently unemployed, once he discovers Kadir's schemes.  Instead he threatens to employ new workers brought from İstanbul and İzmir at much higher wages, even though this will cause further societal chaos in an already uncertain society.  Yet Kemal portrays this development as an inevitable product of capitalism, where money-making is life's be-all and end-all.  Cemile and Necati achieve their desired aim of marriage, but we have no idea whether their relationship will last or not.CEMİLE is written in stark, uncompromising prose, accompanied by a genuine sympathy for the characters who deserve it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUCDX0AZ6GCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6051415939#wasThisHelpful","R2IUCDX0AZ6GCZ","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neil LaBute's work has always been raw in tone, frequently offensive, yet never lacking in punch.SOME VELVET MORNING proves no exception to this rule. Set in a split-level apartment in a big city, is concerns an apparently unstable relationship between middle-aged lawyer Fred (Stanley Tucci), and his twentysomething former mistress Velvet (Alice Eve). Fred claims to have left his wife and returned to Velvet after a four-year absence, while Velvet apparently resents his unexpected appearance in her apartment.Most of the film's eighty-two minute running-time is devoted to a roller-coaster depiction of the characters' relationship as it veers from protestations of love, false demonstrations of passion, and the more obvious depicting of male power based on strength. In the final reel there is an unexpected denouement that calls into question the entire basis on which the plot has been constructed. Some might consider it artificial; others a too-obvious elaboration of the film's basic theme.In terms of style, SOME VELVET MORNING has much of the rawness of David Mamet's OLEANNA (1994), another two-hander based on the clash between a man and woman of varying ages, combined with the destructive potential of Mike Nichols's WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF (1966), wherein the main characters tear emotional lumps out of each other in pursuit of emotional as well as physical mastery.As director, LaBute refuses to let his characters out of sight of his penetrating camera. We feel uncomfortably close to them, especially Fred as he tries to ingratiate himself once again into Velvet's emotions. Yet there is a sense in which the film glorifies as well as condemns male power; Tucci portrays Fred as the initiator of most of the conversations he conducts with Velvet. Until he achieves his desired aim, he will never give up.In truth the plot begins to pall as it unfolds, as we wonder why Fred is so insistent on achieving his desired aim. Is it part of his own feeling of insecurity; that he is an emotional wreck with a pathological inability to articulate his emotions? As Velvet, Eve tends to be too much of a foil to him; in Beckettian fashion she tells us she is going out but never actually takes any positive action.It might be said that SOME VELVET MORNING gives an uncompromising portrait of modern relationships. In truth it actually reveals the bile at the heart of the writer/ director's consciousness, which manifests itself in a consciously sexist piece of work.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HXEM46OE690/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLYNNDU#wasThisHelpful","R8HXEM46OE690","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comedies such as 'ALLO 'ALLO have a lot to answer for. While watching some of the scenes where Violette Szabo (Virginia McKenna) is interrogated by the Nazis, I couldn't help recalling parallel scenes where Herr Flick (Richard Gibson) did exactly the same thing, aided (or is it abetted) by the leggy Helga (Kim Hartman) in the Lloyd/Croft British sitcom. This offers a good example of how time can modify our perceptions of a text.On its own terms, however, Lewis Gilbert's film is a quietly understated biopic of a naive girl with a French mother (Denise Grey) who marries a Frenchman (Alain Saury) in a whirlwind romance. He loses his life at El Alamein, and Violette responds by becoming an agent parachuted into occupied France. Together with her partner Tony Fraser (Paul Scofield in one of his rare screen appearances) they accomplish one mission successfully, but things go horribly wrong when Violette embarks on her second, more dangerous assignment.The film has some good action sequences, shot in and around Pinewood Studios, but Gilbert's principal focus centers on the characters' interrelationships - between Violette and her father (Jack Warner), who knows what she is doing, but agrees voluntarily to keep it a secret. Violette's relationship with Tony could bloom into love, but both know that they could lose their lives at any moment, so they agree to keep it platonic. McKenna portrays the central character as an ordinary woman with an extraordinary inner strength giving her the courage to undertake the missions while remaining determined to resist any attempts to force vital information out of her.Her transition from ordinary homemaker to toughened agent is lucidly handled, as she is at first intimidated by and then learns to cope with her uncompromising NCO instructor (Bill Owen). It is a tribute to her strength that she learns to cope with various ordeals, of being ducked in the river, of walking home on a filthy wet night, and handling a shotgun. The training proves invaluable for her later on, when she has to take on a platoon of pursuing Nazis virtually single-handed.Despite her hopes, Violette Szabo never made it back from the War, leaving her daughter Tanya (Pauline Challoner) to collect a George Medal from King George VI. As Tanya returns to her quiet suburban home with her grandmother and grandfather, we can but reflect that it was chiefly due to Violette's selfless efforts that Britain and the Allies managed to emerge triumphant from six years of conflict.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4T6HF3H08EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009PTW4HY#wasThisHelpful","R1P4T6HF3H08EH","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What to make of this book?  It is important to separate the subject from the biographer in any evaluation.  Michael D'Antonio creates a portrait of a monster - someone so narcissistic that he is pathologically incapable of self-analysis.  Even when Trump does refer to his past in interviews, it is only through a series of carefully rehearsed anecdotes that tell us more about what he is not saying rather than what he actually says.Donald Trump grew up in prosperity; his father was a successful property developer with a gift fot publicity.  He never achieved the publicity heights set by his son, but the father knew how to attract attention.  He was also a strict parent, firmly preventing his children from swearing or indulging themselves in unseemly behavior.  Donald was something of a wild child; hence he was packed off to military school where he evidently learned self-discipline.  After a two-year term at a midranked institution, he finished off his education at the University of Pennsylvania.  From then on the younger Trump never looked back; his skill as a negotiator and his obsessive concern with self-presentation led to considerable success.In assessing Trump's career, it is often difficult to separate truth from myth.  He has always been an obsessive self-promoter, someone regularly prone to exaggeration and misrepresentation so as to present himself in the best possible light.  Mistakes are seldom acknowledged; everything is geared to creating an even better future.  D'Antonio recognizes Trump's abilities as a negotiator, or a wheeler-dealer; but emphasizes the number of enemies he has made in the process.Sometimes it seems that Trump has been so self-obsessed that he rides rough-shod over any objections.  This was especially true in a recent incident where he wanted to build a golf-course and hotel complex in Aberdeen in the north of Scotland.  Although many of the locals objected strongly to the plan, Trump simply brushed aside their objections, mobilizing every force at his disposal - including the Scottish government and the First Minister - so that his plans could be implemented.  Eventually he could only accomplish part of what he wanted, but he made many enemies in the process.As a politician, Trump has often sacrificed sense to sound.  He has seldom been taken seriously, and has often sought to provoke just for the sake of it.  Earlier in 2015 he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination; whether he accomplishes his goal or not, one wonders just why people continue to take him seriously.D'Antonio's biography is a glaring indictment of someone totally ignorant of the notion of community as an indicator of business success.  Trump never listens to anyone except himself, and appears to break every promise he makes if it is expedient to do so.  He might have fulfilled the so-called ""American Dream"" of success, but by doing so he has alienated most of his business colleagues.  On the other hand, as the book coherently argues, Trump remains a prime example of the ways in which style assumes more importance than substance, especially in terms of media presentation.  He rehearses at a grand level what many of us indulge in as we write our thoughts on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAFCKK9G3QXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250042380#wasThisHelpful","RMAFCKK9G3QXP","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED invokes many of the beliefs that really work towards transforming education - creativity, collaboration, ability-based tasks, connection as well as negotiation.  The authors back their arguments up with a wealth of evidence about what is wrong with the US education system and how it might be reformed.  The overall thrust, which is a good one, is for individual educators, boards and groups to initiate change from the ground upwards, rather than expecting any centralized reform.  The more educators embrace change and resist the standardized, test-based formula that dominates education today, the more encouragement will be stimulated for the future.And yet the book is marred by certain assumptions which seem to undermine the very fabric of a good education.  One of the authors is an entrepreneur who has 'made it big' through individual initiative, and desires to put something back into the communities that nurtured him.  A laudable intention indeed; but that does not mean that education as a whole should be geared towards business and/or commercial success.  Learners should be encouraged to develop in whatever way they choose; it might not be fruitful for some people to pursue business related projects, but rather to concentrate on a liberal education, or on the arts, appealing to the imagination rather than the practical side of our brains.  Educators should be encouraged to help learners develop in any way they please, without having any real goals or 'successes' in mind: sometimes people turn out to be late developers in whatever they believe is their particular field of interest.Part of the book's problem, it seems to me, is the authors' assumption that American education has to be 'competitive' with other systems worldwide - Singapore and Finland are regularly quoted.  The implicit assumption behind this is that America has to reassert its position as a superpower in the educational as well as the political fields.  But education is not like that: it is precisely that desire for competition that has led to the introduction of standardized tests, and provoked Presidents to introduce unworkable schemes for everyone.  Education is messy; it should be individualized and allowed to progress in whatever way it should, giving full freedom of thought and preparation to learners and educators alike.  ""Competitiveness"" is a false goal, and one with no real lasting guarantee of success.Perhaps the problem is that the book has an inherent belief in American superiority behind it.  According to the authors, the so-called ""efficient"" systems in Korea and Singapore are based on testing, a form of examination that is not suitable for American learners, as it limits creativity.  It follows therefore that Koreans must lack creativity, especially as the authors claim that parents spend all their waking hours forcing their children to work at test practices.  There are also some comments that might be considered racist, such as the likening of a malfunctioning Harlem school to Baghdad.Sometimes it would be useful for writers to think outside the box and look at the individual in a global rather than a country-specific context.  In that way education can be used to create citizens who can contribute anywhere, anytime and in any way they wish to the improvement of their lives.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RSULLLLOVW6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501104314#wasThisHelpful","R3RSULLLLOVW6Q","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a format shamelessly borrowed from Bill Bryson's ONE SUMMER: 1927 (2013), Robert Winder tells the story of the remarkable sporting summer of 1934, a golden period in English sport when Fred Perry, Henry Cotton, Hedley Verity and Dorothy Round all achieved prominence in their respective sports.  Their achievements offered hope for the huge audiences attending sporting events, at a time when Britain was trying to emerge from the ravages wrought by the Great Depression, as well as coping with the impending threat of war with Nazi Germany.The book interweaves biography and history in a deft combination.  Fred Perry was the son of a socialist Member of Parliament, who achieved prominence in table-tennis, and then switched to the outdoor version.  An obsessive from his youth, he never fitted into the tennis Establishment which - as now - upheld conservative values that inhibited rather than encouraged development.  Perry traveled extensively round the United States, but resisted all offers to turn professional.  After numerous failed efforts to win Wimbledon in the early Thirties, he triumphed in 1934, the first of three straight titles before he finally succumbed to the lure of playing for money.  Winder portrays Perry as someone preoccupied with his own self-image, so much so that Perry deliberately rewrote his life in his autobiography, including certain incidents that turned out to be totally fictitious.  Although ostracized by the Establishment after turning professional, and subsequently taking US citizenship, he was accepted back into the fold in later life.Henry Cotton was an equally obsessive personality, preoccupied with the acquisition of money and the need to show off.  In a sport dominated by Americans in the early Thirties, he showed an almost maniacal desire for perfection: practice meant everything to him.  Eventually he triumphed by winning the British Open in 1934 at Sandwich in Kent, southeast England, on a course full of traps for the unsuspecting player.  Cotton never had to worry about the amateur/ professional divide, and pursued a lengthy career until his retirement in the early Fifties.Verity and Round were more acceptable figures - especially to mid-Thirties administrators - as they tended to remain within the existing organizational fold.  Verity was a great spin bowler in cricket, but remained a gentleman both on and off the field.  He achieved some remarkable bowling figures, and had the distinction of being one of the few bowlers that could flummox the great Australian batsman Don Bradman, as shown in the Lord's Test of 1934 when he dismissed ""The Master"" cheaply in both innings.  Round tended to spend most of her career in Britain, combining playing with coaching, but her sheer dedication to tennis helped her win the Wimbledon Ladies' Title in the same year as Perry; the first and only time that two British players have won the singles titles in the same year.  Verity was to die at the age of only thirty-eight while fighting in Italy in 1943, while Round retired from tennis after her marriage later in the Thirties and spend her subsequent career as a coach.Winder tells a fascinating story, marred only by a tendency to believe that these great figures of the mid-Thirties would not be able to compete with today's legends - especially in tennis.  This is a fallacious judgment, based on the false belief that improvements in equipment and training methods automatically make 'better' players.  Perry and Round were the greatest exponents of tennis at that time, and there is no reason to suppose that they would not be equally successful today.  The book also contains some irritating proof-reading errors - at one point we are told that Cotton won a tournament in 1939 before he won the British Open in 1934.Winder has been handicapped by a reliance mostly on secondary sources (it would have been nice to see him make use of the oral histories and herstories of the period available in many British libraries), but HALF-TIME is nonetheless an entertaining read, a throwback to a more innocent age of sport, perhaps, but one that was still bedeviled by political matters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLGJA4SW3EG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WSSIVLM#wasThisHelpful","R3OLGJA4SW3EG6","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't go looking for originality in Paul Andrew Williams's film.  The plot recycles a familiar thematic chestnut: a curmudgeonly pensioner Arthur (Terence Stamp) resents his wife Marion's (Vanessa Redgrave's) participation in a pensioners' choir, especially as she is dying from cancer.  When she passes away, Arthur shuts himself away from everyone, but with the encouragement of choir-master Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton), he rediscovers his ability to sing.  The choir make it through to the finals of a competition, but they are about to be excluded on the grounds of being a laughing-stock compared to the other, more sophisticated entrants.  Arthur makes a last-minute entrance, strides on to the stage, sings a song accompanied by the choir, and they end up finishing third.More recent variations on this story have included ONE CHANCE, the story of BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT winner Paul Potts with James Corden (2014).  In Williams's film the two protagonists don't have to do much other than provide contrasting characterizations: the perpetually scowling Stamp set against the more optimistically inclined Marion.  There is one memorable sequence where she refuses to talk to him unless he accedes to her wishes.What makes the film touching is the way in which Williams handles his subject-matter.  He does not shy away from the idea that cancer is a killer; however much we like to pretend otherwise, Marion's death is imminent.  Having one's partner cruelly taken away after years of happy marriage is traumatic, as it proves for Arthur - especially as he cannot seem to get on with his son James (Christopher Eccleston).  A group of OAPs in a choir singing Motorhead might seem incongruous, but the experience gives them a renewed belief in life.The film makes some telling visual contrasts between the prison-like suburban life Arthur follows, and the beauties of the sky above.  As he watches the sun rise and set, he understands how there are far more important things in life than sitting in the house.  Marion looks down upon him from the heavens; and it's his duty to honor her.It's a cliché to say that films like this are life-enhancing, but A SONG FOR MARION proves the truth of this statement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSFVUCEJO92B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYM42#wasThisHelpful","R1TSFVUCEJO92B","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FAMILY LIFE concerns the life of an Indian family moving to the United States of America in the late Seventies and trying to cope with a society that really didn't know how to deal with people from the sub-continent.  Hence the novel is about something far more profound than just a ""clash of cultures"" as other reviewers would have us believe; it is about a country that really only thinks along certain pre-ordained tramlines and finds itself unable (or unwilling) to think out of the box.  This applies as much to America as it does to India.The story is a straightforward one: Ajay Mishra comes with his family to the United States to follow his father, who has settled down into a reasonable clerical job.  However things take a turn for the worse when Ajay's elder brother Birju is reduced to a catatonic vegetable as a result of a diving accident.  Thereafter the family have to spend most of their time looking after him, while trying to cope with their inward guilt as if they they believe they were somehow responsible for the catastrophe.  The father turns into a hopeless alcoholic; the mother stays at home endlessly washing and ironing; while Ajay moves through school while realizing gradually that there are far more important elements to life than simply finishing top of the class.At one level FAMILY LIFE contrasts the relatively unsophisticated life in India - where the children play cricket in the street and collect milk from the seller - with the far more urbanized (might one say regimented) life in the United States.  Author Sharma refrains from moral judgments; on the contrary he is at pains to show how growing up in India leads to a certain intransigence when moving to another country, an intransigence that parallels anything that the white American can reveal while trying to cope with Indian immigrants.  One would like to say that the novel follows an optimistic progress, as the two races come to understand one another; but that simply doesn't happen.In the end Ajay passes his exams with flying colors, goes off to college and ends up a as a hotshot lawyer.  However, when he finds a girlfriend for the first time, and begins to experience life himself, free from his family's coat-tails, he finds that it's not quite as easy as he had anticipated.  The novel ends in suspended animation, as we reflect that Ajay will rehearse many of the conflicts experienced by his father when he first came to the United States.  Nothing, it seems, has changed in the direction of cross-cultural understanding.Entertainingly written, with an acute sense of what it's like to be an immigrant, irrespective of one's ethnicity, FAMILY LIFE is the kind of novel that can be easily read in one sitting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRNWTZ93ATXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393350606#wasThisHelpful","RKRNWTZ93ATXA","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Published nearly thirty years ago now, TWENTY STORIES BY TURKISH WOMEN WRITERS is still important today as it shows how women of different classes and ages still lead difficult lives in a country that since the creation of the Republic in 1923 has always advocated equality of opportunity and treatment under the law.  Most of the stories show that this objective, although laudable in itself, seldom prevails in a predominantly patriarchal world.The writers represented include major figures in Turkish literature such as Leyla Erbil, Füruzan, İnci Aral, Adalet Ağaoğlu, Pınar Kür, Erendiz Atasü and Latife Tekin.  All of them have been translated by Nilüfer Mizanoğlu Reddy into clear, fluent prose that nonetheless communicates the strem-of-consciousness style of many of the writers.The tone of the anthology is set in Sevim Burak's ""The Window,"" the story of someone who may or may not be about to commit suicide.  The narrator's imagination runs away with the thought of it, to such an extent that she observes that the woman must ""HAVE NO HOPE WHATSOEVER.""  Yet the story has a surprise ending, especially for the narrator - perhaps s/he is simply projecting her own feelings on to the person observed.  Fürüzan's ""In the Park by the Pier"" depicts a world of down-at-heel gentility where one of the characters observes that her suit is ""getting frayed here and there,"" unlike the (imaginary) past when ""silk noiré was the rage.""  That past might not ever have existed, but it is something to look back on nostalgically.Pınar Kür's ""The Commuter"" vividly captures the hellish ritual of traveling from İstanbul's suburbs to the center, a journey which took as long in the late Eighties as now.  The narrator observes that their life feels ""made up of different fragments"" that cannot be told apart.  Perhaps this is inevitable: the strain of commuting blunts the judgment, leaving the narrator to face the exigencies of ""the sweaty, dusky heat of a summer evening that makes all the bright colors fade.""  No one, it seems, can enjoy the pleasures of the imagination in a world dedicated to money-making.Işıl Özgentürk's ""The Dagger"" focuses more directly on a female protagonist who resorts to prostitution in order to support her family.  This might be considered a dishonorable profession, but often necessary to ensure survival.  Yet what does this suggest about contemporary Turkey, where women have to resort to such a decision?  Ayşe Kilimci's ""The Snail Girl"" considers the issue from a slightly different perspective, as she writes about characters having to make a living by preparing snails in a factory for the delectation of İstanbul's bourgeoisie.  The workers have been deprived of the power of self-determination and have to make do with what they have - in other words, being subject to the authority of an eccentric (male) manager who determines when and if they will finish at the end of every day.Latife Tekin's ""How Dirmit Started Writing"" poems, an extract from her semi-autobiographical novel DEAR SHAMELESS DEATH, describes how a young woman tries to write poetry as a way of making sense of the world around her.  This is not easy: words and phrases do not always come to mine despite strenuous imaginative effort.  When they do, however, they provide a means of liberation from the humdrum world around her.  Yet still she remains a vulnerable figure, especially when members of her own family deride her efforts to write.The collection rounds off with Nazlı Eray's semi-comic tale of ""The Underdeveloped Pharmacy,"" which parodies the way in which the Republic of Turkey is often represented as ""an underdeveloped country,"" by comparison with first world nations such as the United States.  If that is so, then it follows that the standard of medical service should be equally underdeveloped, leading to more and more suffering.  Maybe that's not always the case: Eray suggests that perhaps we as readers should be a little more accommodating in our views of women in Turkey and treat them on their own terms, not as stereotypical representatives of a certain ""type"" of nation.As with any anthology, there are bound to be some stories that appeal more to readers than others.  Cumulatively speaking, however, the collection offers a penetrating insight into the harsh economic realities of living in a capitalist society, whether in the Republic of Turkey or elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AW4LEXD5YFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000D6CGV#wasThisHelpful","R7AW4LEXD5YFP","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jailed for twenty-five years for arms dealing in 2011, Viktor Bout became a media celebrity as the so-called ""Merchant of Death,"" dealing in arms across the globe and thereby contributing to the continuation of bloody civil wars in the Congo, Angola and Rwanda, amongst others. When finally arrested as a result of a deliberately staged ""hit"" operation, Bout was agreeing to a deal that could have resulted in American civilians being slaughtered.Tony Gerber and Maxim Pozdorovkin's documentary profiles Bout, an entrepreneur of quite extraordinary aptitude, who built up his business empire in the wake of the liberalization policies introduced by Boris Yeltsin in Russia during the 1990s. Bout's primary interest, it seems, was in cargo; bringing in hitherto unobtainable commodities into Russia while transporting other goods from place to place. He set up his sphere of operations in Sharjah, where be built up a huge empire. It did not matter what was transported; Bout built his reputation on flying goods expeditiously using his own fleet of airplanes.As the Nineties progressed, so Bout expanded his operations into some of the trouble-spots of Africa. He had a small airport in the Congo in the midst of civil war operations; and enjoyed good relationships with military leaders all over the continent. The documentary works hard to portray him as a business person interested solely in making money, but it seems that he was largely indifferent to the morality of arms-dealing.What makes THE NOTORIOUS MR. BOUT most interesting is the amount of home movie footage Bout shot during his business career. Everything, it seemed, was worth filming, from rebuilding his aircraft to the most ordinary domestic scenes such as the birth of his daughter. We get the sense that his real desire was for some form of celebrity; to be remembered for what he did, regardless of why he did it.In the end Bout achieved his aim as he was deported from Thailand to New York to face a high-profile trial. Through interviews with Bout's wife Alla, as well as some of his closest business associates, the documentary works hard to suggest that Bout was more sinned against than sinning; there are legions of arms-dealers from all countries who are still at large and making huge profits out of other people's suffering. Nonetheless we feel that the prison sentence he received was somehow justified, if only as a means to show what would happen to any arms-dealer, whether great or small, should they be brought to justice.Slickly filmed with the use of voice artists speaking some of Bout's words, THE NOTORIOUS MR. BOUT is an entertaining piece.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36BL0D1LB5B5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCD5ALC#wasThisHelpful","R36BL0D1LB5B5X","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on a novel by Nahid Sırrı Örik, KISKANMAK (ENVY) is a powerful depiction of the ways in which people's lives are hemmed in by class, gender and emotional preoccupations.I cannot comment on the adaptation's relationship to the source- text, but as it stands Zeki Demirkubuz's film, although set in the early Thirties, offers a powerful comment on inequalities within contemporary Turkey.The action opens at a celebration in the Black Sea town of Zonguldak. Couples dance idly round the floor until the band-leader calls them to order and invites everyone to sing the National Anthem in praise of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The action takes place only seven years after the Republic was established in 1923; and we are reminded once more of the principles upon which it was founded - equality, fairness, and opportunity.Unfortunately what follows completely subverts that impression. Mine-owner's wife Mükerrem (Berrak Tüzünata) leads an aimless existence dominated by tea-parties and social occasions. Sharing her house with her husband Halit (Serhat Tutumluer), and her sister- in-law Seniha (Nergis Öztürk), she orders her servants to wait upon her hand and foot. Eventually Mükerrem falls in love with Nüshet (Bora Cengiz), the youthful son of a local society family; together they spend clandestine evenings together, while Halit apparently remains oblivious.Mükerrem's actions enrage Seniha, who hitherto has enjoyed a close relationship with Halit's wife. Seniha ends up taking a decision that ultimately leads to the destruction of all three protagonists.Shot in washed-out colors, with the lighting focused deliberately on the characters' faces, Demirkubuz's film creates a self-enclosed world in which outward show matters: preserving one's honor counts above everything else. Within this world women are kept as virtual prisoners: the film is full of repeated shots of them either looking out of the window from inside, or photographed inside their houses from the outside. The sense of imprisonment is enhanced by repeated close-ups of lattices, grilles and covered lights.The idea of female confinement is nothing new; it is characteristic of any patriarchal society in which men like Halit come home from work expecting their dinner, and prepare for business trips by having their suitcases packed for them. As portrayed by Tutumluer, Halit is a very passive person, despite his apparent power: everyone, it seems, is prepared to do all his work for him.What gives Demirkubuz's film added bite is the way he shows the characters experiencing emotional as well as physical imprisonment. Neither Mükerrem nor Seniha can see beyond their limited field of self-interest; and hence destroy themselves as well as those closest to them. In a highly socially stratified society, they have been brought up to observe certain mores; and when these mores have been traduced, they have no means of coping. Their reactions are almost childlike, but entirely coherent in a society whose inhabitants are almost entirely prevented from thinking for themselves.KISKANMAK is a domestic tale but carries substantial political undertones. In any world that curtails self-determination, few people can survive for very long. The film ends with Seniha photographed alone on a cruise-ship, biting into a sandwich and admitting her faults in voice-over. While understanding that she has acquired self-knowledge, we hardly feel sympathetic towards her, in light of what has previously taken place.The mood of melancholy is cleverly underlined by the use of a musical leitmotif from Albinioni. KISKANMAK is a mournful yet memorable piece of work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FICDM84F1JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PHCCYY#wasThisHelpful","R30FICDM84F1JH","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Translated by Richard McKane and originally published by Seyrek Yayinlari in Istanbul, TEK SEKERLI CINARALTI (TEA WITH ONE SUGAR UNDER THE PLANE TREE) is a sequence of poems, some of which have been translated, others not.  They reflect on the poet's status as as important recorder of life, as well as writing the kind of material that comments on social and political inequalities prevalent at the time of publication and which still exist today.""Byzantine Coffin Nails"" comments on the plight of the poor trying to survive in pouring rain in an indifferent world; but perhaps that world can be redeemed by love - the love between humans irrespective of race, class, and gender.  ""The Satin Flower of Passion"" develops the theme by inviting readers to listen to their inner natures rather than behave according to predetermined conventions.  This is the kind of recommendation that good poets can make; through their ability to create metaphors appealing to the imagination rather than reason, they can affect readers at an intuitive level.  Their work can not only become responsive to nature but can make sense of catastrophe.  Above all poets are fearless: writing very much in the tradition of Nazim Hikmet, Huseyin Avni Dede sees the poet as a political figure commenting directly on society's ills.""Under the Ladder"" develops the themes of the poet's relationship to nature and the worlds they inhabit.  Normally walking under a ladder might be considered superstitious - the kind of thing anyone might avoid if their luck was out.  Dede argues that such traditions are nothing more than old wives' tales.  One should trust in the world and ""smell a carnation without reason,"" or enjoy ""the budding smiles on my lips.""Carnations are a favorite with Dede.  In ""Lament of the Unguillotined Carnations,"" he talks about how the industrial city not only breaks people but destroys its fauna and flora, creating a world in which money counts for everything.  People become so obsessed with survival that they become impervious to the beauties of nature.  In ""Rhapsody on a Dead Square"" he explores the consequences of this dystopian world.  Poets lose their significance; their raison d'etre, you might say.  If such is the case, then they might as well be incarcerated underground for life.  The only way to ensure their survival is to be mindful of the world around us.Richard McKane's blank verse translations represent Dede's verse as akin to stream of consciousness, or a spontaneous outflow of powerful feelings in which sound matters as much as sense.  Definitely worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QEXSACT9BH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMPSX20#wasThisHelpful","R20QEXSACT9BH3","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Halide Edip Adivar was a pivotal figure in the foundation of the Turkish Republic as an activist, educator, and supporter of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.  Born into a privileged family and married young to a much older man, she led a sheltered existence until circumstances forced her into the public gaze.  Thereafter she contributed significantly to the spread of education over the former Ottoman Empire, as well as giving speeches in support of a democratic way of life that would supplant the tyranny of the previous regimes.  She ended her career as a teacher in the University of Istanbul as well as a translator of major works of English Literature into Turkish.HOUSE WITH WISTERIA is the first of two autobiographical volumes chronicling Adivar's extraordinary life.  Written in 1925, only two years after the creation of the Republic, it vividly recreates the author's origins.  She spent most of her early life working out of a small room - at the time (the late nineteenth century) it was assumed that women should be seen and not heard.  She became a writer, but no one would really listen to her.  Her marriage proved dissatisfying - as was customary then, her husband believed in polygamy.  It was only when she secured a divorce and began to pursue her public career that she managed to achieve her ambitions - even though she ran considerable risks by doing so.The book is told as two separate sections.  In the first, chronicling her early life, she writes in the third person, almost as if the infant Halide Edib were a different person from the writer.  This strategy makes it clear that the book is about different selves, which might be described as the public and private.  In public Adivar had to put on the guise of being a reformer; but this was often achieved at great personal cost, especially to her children, whom she had to leave behind as she pursued a peripatetic existence.  Often the two selves conflict with one another - so much so that they are often irreconcilable.  Adivar has to make the best of what she can.In her struggles she often counts on the support of the deity.  The book contains several instances where she recognizes the power of God not only as the Creator, but the only real person who can be trusted.  Sometimes the only way to cope with life's exigencies is to think beyond the minutiae of daily life and consider the importance of completeness - the idea that human beings are at one with the universe, if they listen to their inner selves.HOUSE WITH WISTERIA contains some fascinating vignettes of what life was like in the last days of the Ottoman Empire, especially for women.  Adivar's mother died young, and she was mostly brought up by her grandmother in what might be described as a traditional mode of life.  She was expected to get married, have children, and remain in the home; whenever she appeared in public, she should wear sober clothes and look down at the ground, thereby acknowledging her subordinate status.  It is to Adivar's credit that she challenged such stereotypes by insisting that women should be entitled to a good education and to live their lives according to their own rules,. even if that meant challenging the patriarchal order.The book is often a disturbing read, as Adivar tries to survive in a society which believes in violence first and asking questions later.  Attempts to introduce a more democratic way life are often brutally crushed by the Ottoman despots.  Poverty is rife, and no one in government really wants to alleviate it.  Hence the importance of Adivar's contribution to the Republic; she believed that everyone should be entitled to equal opportunities, regardless of their social origins.Sibel Erol's introduction to this reissued edition gives a good account of Adivar's technique and her place in Turkish history.  HOUSE WITH WISTERIA is definitely worth a read for anyone interested in notions of liberation and free thinking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIKAN1TP0IKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1412810027#wasThisHelpful","R1TIKAN1TP0IKR","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of Miranda July's novel THE FIRST BAD MAN is a fascinatingly ambiguous one.  Most obviously it refers to one of the bad men represented in one of the old-fashioned self-defense videos that the protagonist Cheryl Glickman disinters from a warehouse at her place of work.  In these videos women are shown how to cope with all forms of male sexual assault, with the ""bad men"" portrayed by actors.  The ""bad man"" could also be Phillip, a sixtysomething colleague whom Cheryl believes is in love with her.  It is a humiliating moment for her when she discovers that he is pursuing a sixteen-year-old instead.  The ""bad man"" could also be baby Jack, whose first moments on earth prove harrowing for everyone involved.  Arguably Cheryl's housemate Clee, a twentysomething woman with odorous feet, could also be classed as a ""bad man"" in light of her physique and penchant for martial arts.July's deliberately ambiguous title adumbrates the main thrust of this novel, as Cheryl searches for some form of identity.  Living mostly on her own, exchanging dialogue with her inner self, she cannot really assert herself either personally or professionally.  Exploited at work by her uncaring bosses, who treat her as a convenience; uncertain about her sexuality; and unable (or unwilling) to resist Clee's dominant nature - even within Cheryl's own house - Cheryl is buffeted through a series of emotional peaks and troughs.  She retreats into a fantasy-world dominated by explicit sex involving Phillip and Clee; some of the descriptions are graphic, to say the least.  Yet they prove of little help to her in resolving her mental conflicts, in which actual living has been substituted by vicariousness.Cheryl only achieved satisfaction once she has the chance to look after Clee's baby Jack.  Ostensibly we are led to believe that this is a lesbian relationship; but July refuses to allow us the satisfaction of a definite decision.  Cheryl assumes ultimate responsibility for looking after Jack, and conducts a series of conversations with him - all within her own imagination.  What such conversations do suggest, however, is that sexual orientation is no longer of any real importance to her; the fact that she has a living being to nurture, without anyone to tell her what to do, assumes far more significance.The novel ends with a short epilogue set in China in which Cheryl has found what she has been looking for after a considerable struggle.  No longer influenced by ""bad men,"" she can look forward to at least partial emotional satisfaction.Miranda July is especially good at depicting the inner life of the central character, and how it manifests itself in curious ways - not just through sexual fantasy, but through some decidedly idiosyncratic domestic arrangements.  The fragility of her world is emphasized when Clee moves in and proceeds to impose an alternative lifestyle on Cheryl.  THE FIRST BAD MAN emphasizes the randomness of the contemporary world, in which the best-laid plans for organizing one's life often go sadly awry, yet sometimes circumstances conspire to work in an individual's favor.  This is what happens to Cheryl, and she takes full advantage of her good fortune.Sharply observed, with a distinct sympathy for all of the characters trying to make their way in an indifferent world, THE FIRST BAD MAN is an absorbing read, even if it can prove uncomfortable on occasions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXZCJ6TPF0XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439172579#wasThisHelpful","R3GXZCJ6TPF0XU","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LIVING THE SECULAR LIFE provides an eloquent defense of what author Zuckerman describes as ""the secular life"" - in other words, life lived without belief either in religion or the presence of the deity.  Through a series of chapters, liberally laced with quotations from various sources, allied to first-hand interviews, he argues that the secularist, as opposed to those who embrace religion, have the benefit of choice whether to pursue their way of thinking, without being influenced by received beliefs.  There is no ""supreme being"" that dictates their actions; hence the secularists can learn how to acquire their own beliefs in morality and righteous living.  Blessed with the power of choice and self-determination, the secularist acquires what Zuckerman describes as ""aweism"" - the capacity to perceive life's mysteries unfettered by other people's beliefs.Zuckerman's arguments reinforce the prevailing belief expressed by many Americans in the power of individual self-determination, as well as freedom of choice.  The book is actually rather paradoxical; while opposing the religious beliefs embraced by Republican Presidents such as George W. Bush, Zuckerman actively favors freedom from control by higher powers, whether Gods or governments, a belief that is characteristic of many Republicans.  Maybe this is not actually what the author intended, but it seems to be that his arguments become somewhat confused at this point.This sense of confusion underpins the entire book.  One wonders why the binary opposition of secularism vs. religion has to be set up in the first place - as Zuckerman himself observes, many people might not be actively religious, but they do acknowledge the presence of a God.  Their behavior might be self-determined, but they can also believe in an after-life.  Every person's religious belief differs; and in some communities, this right to embrace one's own construction should be respected.  I understand Zuckerman's frustrations, as he recounts the experiences of some secularists living in overly religious communities within the United States; but perhaps there has to be more give-and-take, a willingness on the part of everyone, religious and secular alike, to listen to one another and acknowledge different points of view.Zuckerman's arguments are also somewhat limiting, in the sense that he does not acknowledge that the concept of religiosity might differ from culture to culture, from religion to religion.  What constitutes the ""religious"" life in a Christian community might be very different from its equivalent within an Islamic community.  Nor does he admit the fact that the issue of religion vs. secularism can be viewed very differently in some Islamic cultures.  He assumes, quite wrongly, that his day-to-day experiences within the United States can serve as a microcosm for those inhabiting other parts of the world.  Perhaps the book could be more accurately re-titled LIVING THE SECULAR LIFE IN SOME PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES.The only way that people of different persuasions can understand one another is to set aside binary oppositions and acknowledge the presence of pluralism.  To do this, we need to set aside the rather hectoring tone that lies at the heart of this book and learn how to listen rather than pronounce.  While LIVING THE SECULAR LIFE makes some good points about the importance of adaptation, both personal as well as communal, its basically strident tone becomes tiresome.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6GNGYN2N9SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205086#wasThisHelpful","RZ6GNGYN2N9SX","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It would be easy to dismiss 41: A PORTRAIT OF MY FATHER as just another attempt by a former US President to cash in on his reputation.  In George Bush's case, that reputation is twice as strong, given that his father occupied the highest office of state before him.  And in truth there are several instances where readers become painfully aware that Bush is not a natural writer; he tends towards the obvious in many of his conclusions, while his language can sometimes be clunkily banal (""a nice soup"" is one of the phrases that lingers in the mind).In truth, however, such shortcomings are redeemed by the heart-felt nature of this volume, an affectionate tribute by a son to his father's life and reputation.  Born to a prosperous family in the mid-Twenties, George H. W. Bush had a privileged education which was abruptly interrupted when he decided to join the US Air Force.  After some rigorous training, he was sent out into the Pacific to fight the Japanese.  The younger Bush is particularly good at recreating the live-or-die atmosphere of the time, when aircrew never knew whether they would survive or not.  The older Bush had to bail out of an aircraft on one occasion, and was rescued by a submarine after drifting alone in a dinghy.  Such harrowing experiences proved character-forming, as Bush learned the importance of maintaining strength of character even in the toughest situations.When he was demobbed in 1945, Bush entered the oil industry and became a successful entrepreneur specializing in offshore operations.  He built up an impressive fortune while remaining loyal to his family.  His son remembers how Bush used to create ""quality time,"" even after the busiest working days, which helped develop strong filial bonds.  The older Bush also inculcated a strong moral sense into all his six children based on respect for God and loyalty to the family.  As a father Bush seldom told his children what to do, but rather encouraged them to pursue whatever careers they wished.As a politician, Bush's career up to his presidential election in 1988 was slow but sure.  He served as Ambassador to the United Nations and head of the CIA under President Ford; and as Vice-President under Ronald Reagan.  He built up a reputation for loyalty and an ability to see another person's point of view; some critics considered this quality a sign of weakness, but it helped Bush establish a network of friends worldwide that stood him in good stead throughout his political career.His presidential career was dominated by one major incident - the Gulf War.  The younger Bush is quick to defend his father as someone who gave Saddam Hussein every opportunity for peaceful resolutions, but eventually lost patience with the Iraqi leader and declared war.  The President, it seemed, was only interested in restoring Kuwait's status as an independent monarchy, not in driving Saddam out.  In retrospect perhaps this policy was a mistake, but it seemed justifiable at the time.  It is one of the ironies of history that what started out as a short, sharp strike has degenerated into an apparently insoluble conflict; but blame for that does not necessarily lie with the elder Bush.Despite his obvious successes, the older Bush was unceremoniously ejected from power in 1992.  His son believes that a series of reversals - most of which had little or nothing to do with the President - had a lot to do with this defeat, as well as the machinations of independent-minded politicians such as Ross Perot.  This might be true, but the elder Bush was part of an aging generation whose world-view did not necessarily mesh in with the prevailing zeitgeist, shaped as it was by the boomers who grew up in the postwar era.In retirement the elder Bush has continued to pursue various activities.  Even at the age of over ninety, and in a wheelchair, he continues to fulfill as much as he can.  He completed a parachute jump on his ninetieth birthday, just to prove that there was life in the old man yet.Readers might disagree with some of the younger Bush's judgments about his father's place in history; but we cannot help but admire the strength, loyalty and person-skills of a man who throughout his long life has placed his family first above everything.  At the end of the book we come to know more about the 'real' George H. W. Bush behind the mediatic portrayals of his life and career.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTHUEM0VDXOBK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553447785#wasThisHelpful","RTHUEM0VDXOBK","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ORDINARY LIGHT begins as an autobiography of Tracy Smith, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet.  Born in 1972 to a father in the military services, and a mother who spends her life as a homemaker, apart from a brief period when she works as a teacher, the young Tracy grew up in a loving family placing considerable emphasis on basic virtues such as love, loyalty and a respect for God.  Her life, at least until she entered Harvard University, was sheltered; Tracy did not have a boyfriend, and spent much of her time trying to make sense of her own identity as an African American and a practicing Christian.  Although well advised by her mother, and following her elder brother Conrad""s example (Conrad has left home and training to work in the medical profession), Tracy experiences a series of identity crises, especially concerning her relationship to the outside world and the (re-)construction of her identity.  She encounters the regular prejudices against African Americans at school, as well as the criticisms of those who believe that practicing Christians spend too much time talking about God and not enough on day-to-day realities.  While such comments do not wound her too deeply, they still prompt her to reflect on herself as someone growing up in California who feels rather alienated when she visits her grandmother in the family home in Alabama.When Tracy enters Harvard, she experiences further crises of identity.  She falls in love with a white boy, and believes that she has truly discovered herself until she finds out that he has fallen for someone else.  She picks up familiar university identities as someone fighting for ""blackness"" and discovering pluralities through exposure to critical theory and cultural studies material.  She changes her style and finds herself - perhaps for the first time - alienated from her mother.  Normally such rebelliousness might be dismissed as ""part of growing up,"" but for Tracy it causes further anxieties.Her quest for that something - whatever it might be - is only brought to fruition when her mother is dying from colon cancer.  The passages where she describes the way in which her mother first conceals the extent to the disease, and subsequently comes to admit it and make peace with her God, are exceptionally moving.  Much of Smith""s prose consists of interior reflection; for the first time, she discovers the power of poetry to suggest emotions and promote empathy not through tangible meaning, but through suggestive combinations of words.In the end Smith""s book proves that the ""ordinary light"" of her life is actually something extra-ordinary.  She discovers the power of the mind to range beyond the day-to-day realities of the tangible and conjure up new worlds.  Although her mother passes away at the early age of fifty-nine, Smith realizes that she can continue communicating with her - not by following Christian doctrine to the letter, but by allowing her mind to wander across the continuum connecting life and death.  Smith becomes a mindful person; someone who, while living a happy life with her husband and three children, can allow her imagination to run its course, to discover hidden meanings and new connections for herself.  Words for her are not just means of communication, but a way of exploring her psyche.  Sounds become as significant as sense.As readers, we are drawn into this extraordinary piece of writing, where subordinate clause follows subordinate clause in a form analogous to stream of consciousness.  I am not calling Smith a specifically 'modernist' writer; rather she is using words to explore her imagination, and her imagination to explore the power of words.  ORDINARY LIGHT is an extraordinary book, one that explores issues of race and religion and ends up transcending them.  God exists for ourselves, in any form we choose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M0MXNIOFDZQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307962660#wasThisHelpful","R2M0MXNIOFDZQI","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Therese Anne Fowler's Z is a fictionalized recreation of the life of Zelda Fitzgerald from her origins in Montgomery, Alabama to the death of her husband in 1940.The novel is told mostly in the first person, from the point of view of an idealistic if naive woman who leaves her traditional family in the South to marry Scott Fitzgerald, and embarks on a dizzying life of parties, social gatherings, chance encounters and drunken revelries in all parts of the world.  The narrator comes across as a sensation-seeking personality, someone who wants to experience life viscerally as an alternative to the roles expected of her as a daughter, wife and mother.  A talented person in her own right, she spends her life trying to express herself while being married to a spouse who, despite his talent, remains at heart a child, unable to move beyond patriarchal notions of gender.Scott Fitzgerald comes off quite badly in this novel - a hugely talented person with major personality flaws.  He drinks to excess; spends a lot of time associating with people such as Ernest Hemingway (whom Zelda does not rate at all); chases women and socializes; in other words, doing anything to avoid the onerous business of writing.  After the failure of THE GREAT GATSBY (1925), it seems as if he lost the will to write; the next novel he published, TENDER IS THE NIGHT (1934), was almost entirely based on Zelda's experiences in various psychiatric wards.  Unable to resolve the psychological demons within himself, he transfers his resentments on to Zelda by accusing her of various faults including disloyalty and irresponsibility.Yet despite the marriage gradually souring, Zelda stays with her husband.  She still loves him in a strange way; perhaps because of his child-like irresponsibility.  There are perhaps two occasions when she contemplates a divorce, but neither of them are really serious.  Perhaps she is looking for something else - not independence, perhaps, but rather to be recognized on her own terms as an artist, not simply Scott Fitzgerald's spouse.The characterization is convincing; the style less so.  We don't get much sense of Zelda's gradually degenerating psychological state, as she suffers from bipolar disorder.  The forces ranged against her are portrayed as indifferent and uncaring: the doctors aren't there to cure her, but rather to keep her away from her husband.  Yet we don't get any sense of her frustrations, or the strategies she might adopt to cope with her ordeal.  We understand how she loses her self-esteem, but we don't see precisely how her conception of the division between ""madness"" and ""sanity"" is gradually eroded.  On the contrary Fowler's language veers toward the banal, as if reluctant to engage at a deeper level with Zelda's complexities.The book ends rather abruptly with a fast forward in time until Scott Fitzgerald's death.

"Published by Boğazii University Press in 2007 from a manuscript given to the university by Alice Berkeley, FLOYD HENSON BLACK: A REMEMBRANCE celebrates the achievements of one of those unsung heroes who helped to lay the foundations of the Turkish educational system.Born in Illinois to a farming family, Black began his career teaching at Robert College.  At that time - the early twentieth century - the college was a cosmopolitan community of Ottomans and other European races, where several languages were spoken.  Black learned one of the educational principles that stayed with him throughout his life; that humanity was the same, irrespective of culture, race or ethnicity.  Although he became mutlilingual himself, he was more concerned with learning both from his learners as well as his colleagues.Black subsequently moved on to the American College in Sofia, where he met his future wife, the daughter of a Bulgarian farming community.  Together with a small group of expatriates he helped to establish a happy educational community committed to equality; even though the curriculum and the ambience was American in orientation (the learners sang American songs on a regular basis), the education was transcultural.  However Black's employment was abruptly curtailed during the Second World War when Bulgaria signed a memorandum of understanding with the Nazis and declared war on the United States.  Black was rather hurt by this, in light of his previous experiences with the Bulgarian people.He completed his career in İstanbul, first as an officer in the American Consulate, and latterly as the President of Robert College - both the boys' and the girls' sections.  By now the curriculum had become more Turkified, but Black reached an understanding with the Ministry of Education (Milli Eğitim Bakanlığı), so that the institution could continue as a quasi-independent concern.  He retired back to the United States, where he continued to receive guests from the Republic of Turkey as well as the United States.  He died aged 95 in 1983.Cyril Black's biography is a little short on interpretation and long on facts.  Nonetheless it provides a valuable record of an educational pioneer in the Near Eastern region.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DN9FEHFB7Z6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9756193735#wasThisHelpful","R3DN9FEHFB7Z6","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gerard Woodward's novel opens with a military court-martial in which Kenneth Brill, artist and camouflage expert, has been accused of various misdemeanors, none of which he believes are actually his fault.  This situation provides the springboard for a Chinese box-like narrative veering back and forth in time, in which nothing is quite what it seems.  Told largely in the first person from Brill's perspective, VANISHING looks back at his childhood days, his turbulent life in various schools, his abortive time as a student at the Slade School of Art in London, and his subsequent itinerant life as an artist until he joined up in the army.The most important aspect of the novel is to understand the implications suggested by its title.  Woodward recreates a now-vanished world in and around the hamlet of Heathrow where Brill grew up.  Before there was an airport there, it was mostly farm-land, fertilized by heaps of dung.  Families lived there for generations - sometimes feuding with one another, but learning in the end how to co-exist peacefully.  Yet this apparently timeless world is abruptly curtailed by a government edict during the Second World War in which all the land was commandeered to make way for an airport.  This draconian decision makes us aware of the mutability of all things: nothing lasts for ever.The same also applies to Brill's artistic productions.  Artists' canvasses record things - impressions, environments, people - for all time, as their work is exhibited in art galleries for future generations to enjoy.  In Brill's case, however, many of his canvasses are either concealed, destroyed, or misunderstood.  No one, it seems, can recognize his talents - least of all Brill himself.  His work, as well as his abilities, simply vanish into thin air.Gerard Woodward vividly recreates a world riddled with hypocrisies, where morality was apparently strict (in its denunciation of homosexuality as something evil) yet people tolerated most nefarious activities, so long as they were kept out of the public eye.  Men like Brill not only remain uncertain about their sexuality, but can never distinguish between their friends and their enemies.  Those whom they trust the most turn out to be working against the national interest.  Living in such a random universe, we wonder whether or not that Brill himself is a victim of a vanished morality; a society that claims to adhere to Victorian values yet understands not a shred of what such values truly are.Reading the novel is a disconcerting experience, as our expectations as to what will happen next are continually frustrated.  It is up to us to piece its various temporal strands together and understand what they tell us about Brill's past, present, and future.  We are in sense victims of another vanished convention; that of the reliable narrator.  VANISHING demands close attention but proves rewarding all the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FH9UZSZMF8U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605987824#wasThisHelpful","R2FH9UZSZMF8U2","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released in 2009, İKİ DİL BİR BAVUL is a low-key documentary that nonetheless makes some important points about the shortcomings of the Turkish education system.  Ever since Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's time, public school policy has been dictated by the Ministry of Education (Milli Eğitim Bakanlığı), which had consciously reinforced the one-nation ideology by insisting that all classes should be delivered in Turkish.  This might work in the majority of schools, but falls flat in the mainly Kurdish-speaking east of the country.Orhan Eskiköy and Özgür Doğan's film explains why.  An idealistic young educator Emre comes from Denizli in the west of Turkey to the village of Demirci in the east.  This is a predominantly rural community whose inhabitants eke out an existence in an inhospitable landscape by tending sheep or growing wheat.  They live a very self-contained life under primitive conditions; most of the mud-brick houses lack running water, and the women mostly use local produce to create their meals.  Few of them can either read or write; hitherto they have had very little need to.Entering this community and trying to teach the learners represents a difficult, if not impossible task.  The children seldom actually come to school; and when Emre encourages them to do so, he finds it almost impossible to communicate with them.  They know very little Turkish, having only heard a few words on television; in turn, Emre speaks no Kurdish.  Hence they are all imprisoned by their respective languages.  The children might repeat the familiar phrase ""Ne Mutlum Türküm Diyene"" (Happy is he who is a Turk), but they have no understanding of what it means.  On the celebrations for Children's Day (23 April), a holiday instituted by Atatürk both to reward children and remind them of the importance of Republican values, the children play games and mouth the phrases they are supposed to do, but the significance of the occasion eludes them.  Try as he might, Emre finds that progress in class is slow, often impossible.Having said that, he is not without his faults.  There is little indication of his being prepared to meet the children halfway and learn some Kurdish during his time at the school; and some of his pedagogical methods leave a lot to be desired.  Merely shouting at the children and/or intimidating them by making them repeat phrases over and over again is hardly conductive to creating a good learning environment.  On the other hand he is a new teacher with little grasp of effective classroom technique, so perhaps we can exonerate him.The documentary takes place over a year, from September to June.  The directors make much of the changing landscapes from the hot sun of late summer to autumn colors, a harsh winter with snow whipping across the barren landscape, and the onset of spring with a duck leading her ducklings across the farm.  They emphasize the unchanging nature of life in Demirci, whose citizens pursue a life that remains immune from any of the major urban and social developments taking place in the west of the country.  In this kind of situation, it's hardly likely that anyone would respect the Ministry's desire for a Turkish-only school.Since the film was made, the government apparently made some moves towards a more multicultural education policy by permitting some lessons to be given in Kurdish.  In light of current events, however, where renewed conflicts have broken out in the east of the country between the security forces and the local people, we might wonder whether such initiatives have any real chance of taking root, or whether the east will remain the cultural and educational backwater as represented in this film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQ72CHJODIJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZTLLUU#wasThisHelpful","R3KQ72CHJODIJ7","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very strange book.  Comprising a collection of essays from academics predominantly from the United Kingdom and Australia, it uses the zombie metaphor to describe what is wrong with higher education in a post-capitalist era where learners are transformed into consumers, research is always measured, staff are transformed into administrators as well as educators whose performance has to be continually measured, and the humanities are perpetually under threat from shrinking government funds and the need to find alternative sources of funding through devising research initiatives.Needless to say, much of the zombie material comes from familiar films such as WHITE ZOMBIE (1932), the Jacques Tourneur cycle of films for RKO from the Forties, and the George A, Romero cycle beginning with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968).  While appreciating the sentiment behind much of the essayists' points - that learners are being reduced into zombies through tests and academic work that depends purely on memorization rather than imaginative empathy; class-sizes have become so large that it's difficult for academic staff to tutor them successfully; while academic workloads have become so large that it's difficult to organize successful research programs - they are made with such wearying repetitiveness that eventually the reader becomes rather tired of them.  We look for solutions rather than complaints: if this is what academic cultures represent at present, how will academics and learners negotiate them?Many of the answers are couched in familiar binarist terms; it is the responsibility of academics and learners to ""challenge"" the existing socio-poitical order; to ""undermine"" the capitalist hegmony; and ""liberate"" the academy from the dead hand of materialism.  Such arguments were popular nearly three decades ago with the advent of cultural materialism, but they hold little sway now in a post-Marxist world.  Alternatively some contributors fall back on the old chestnut of ""crtitical thinking,"" which apparently has a political as well as an intellectual orientation, enabling learners to perceive what's wrong with capitalist-driven education and look for suitable alternatives instead.To be honest, there is only one essay that really departs from this wearying - and clichéd - critical orthodoxy.  Jessie Stommel's ""Toward a Zombie Pedagogy: Embodied Teaching and the Student 2.0"" at least recognizes the fact that in today's connected universe, it's necessary to devise new approaches to learning based on collaborate ventures, i.e. involving learners in the process of co-creation so as to negotiate tasks and reflect on their outcomes.  Even so, I'm not sure that ""teaching"" per se is actually a satisfactory term to use: in any learning situation, all of us should consider ourselves part of a shared task.  So, if universities are becoming peopled with zombies, as many of the contributors suggest, it's the responsibility of everyone within that community - learners and educators alike - to devise innovative approaches to learning that can help transform everyone into active learners.  In other words, rather than blaming others for the state of the contemporary academy, it's time to find new ways of learning that not only meet the standards expected of researchers and administrators, but give learners a sense of why they are doing things, and how such strategies might help them in their futures.Make no mistake - the academy is a political structure, which can influence as well as promote innovation among its staff as well as learners.  But that politics should originate from the ground up, from a willingness to wrestle with zombification (if such a state exists) and find ways of reconstructing it for everyone's benefit.  That means avoiding complaints and adopting innovative strategies that treat everyone equally.  If readers are looking for ideas as to how such strategies might be devised, ZOMBIES IN THE ACADEMY is not for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141FNG9F2MJG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1841507148#wasThisHelpful","R141FNG9F2MJG5","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on a stage musical, THAT DAY WE SANG is a piece that celebrates the city of Manchester through a parallel structure contrasting the life of young Tubby (Harvey Chaisty) growing up in 1929 with that of the older Tubby (Michael Ball), living a humdrum life four decades later. In 1929 Manchester is full of terraced houses, cozy back- streets and cramped living-rooms; when Jimmy goes for an audition to join the city choir, he does so in an oak- paneled, poorly lit school-room. Forty years later the cityscape might have changed somewhat, with functional maisonettes replacing the old terraces; but the major landmarks remain such as Piccadilly Square, a testament to the city's Victorian confidence.In terms of plot, THAT DAY WE SANG focuses on the humdrum lives of Tubby and Enid (Imelda Staunton), both of whom have reached middle age without actively doing anything. They both work in anonymous offices, bound by routines and finding visceral pleasures where appropriate (Enid has a squalid little affair with her boss Mr. Kirkby (Daniel Rigby). The two protagonists meet, and together reminisce about the time when they were members of the choir and sang ""Nymphs and Shepherds"" for a gramophone recording. The memories help to stimulate their imaginations, and they look forward to a brighter future together.The musical has plenty of what might be termed Victoria Wood touches - the lyrics often involve complicated rhymes; whenever we can hear them, we understand just what a talented artiste she is. The dialogue contains plenty of references to domestic products (hand- creams, bathroom cleaners, etc.) reminding us of just how comic brand names can be. There are also intertextual references to some of Wood's earlier hits, such as the appearance of dinner (or should it be tea) ladies wheeling their trolleys around the office building.The songs are mostly upbeat, giving plenty of opportunity for Ball and Staunton to show off their vocal prowess. In truth, however, the most memorable number is a specialty piece set in a Berni Inn - a long-forgotten chain of steakhouses, all red plush and prawn cocktails. Enid and Tubby are taken to dinner there by their social climbing neighbors Frank (Confeth Hill) and Dorothy (Sophie Thompson), who take the opportunity to show off their social advantages, accompanied by a bevy of dancing servers. The number is extremely funny with an unexpected dénouement.THAT DAY WE SANG may be slight, but its sheer joyousness and the zest of the performances render it a piece of memorable entertainment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJ0JH6VNW04X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH9E012#wasThisHelpful","R1HJ0JH6VNW04X","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first in the rebooted series of HABABAM SINIFI movies, based on the books by Rıfat Ilgaz.  It is basically plotless, providing the excuse for a series of comic sketches involving the gulling of a succession of educators including Bülent Kayabaş, a gender-bending love-interest plot involving Arzu (Nehir Erdoğan) and her beloved Kete (Mete Ekener), and the return to the school of one of the original HABABAM SINIFI learners in the guise of an educator (Halit Akçatepe).Basically there's not much more to say about the film, apart from the fact that the cast includes luminaries such as Hülya Koçyiğit (as an harassed educator), Zeki Alasya (as a janitor), and Mehmet Alı Erbil giving a characteristically overstated performance as Behri the headteacher.  The messages are clear - despite the continual trickery, the school upholds the core values of nationalism, family and tradition.  The best moments occur when Necmi (Akçatepe) returns to the school, and the soundtrack plays extracts from the original HABABAM SINIFI movies of the Seventies.  The camera then cuts to a shot of the original cast, including Kemal Sunal, and a large photo of Rıfat Ilgaz, the author of the source novel.  Traditions certainly matter as a means of promoting unity.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERN47GLF5YU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VDQ83E#wasThisHelpful","R3ERN47GLF5YU0","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a curious book.  It is excellently written, with a fine understanding of the philosophical problems arising from transformative decision-making - in other words, those decisions we come to that will eventually change our lives.  Through a series of case-studies, partly friviolous, partly serious, Paul makes us aware of how difficult such decisions are, both philosophically as well as emotionally.  The case-studies include deciding to become a vampire (or embracing the vampiric spirit), deciding to have a child, and (for deaf people especially) deciding to have an implant so as to restore the power of hearing (or to make profoundly deaf people hear for the first time).Paul writes in the second person, addressing all arguments to an imaginary reader.  This gives the book a personal, intimate tone that perhaps works against the complexity of the ideas advanced.  Sometimes the ideas are a little difficult to follow, especially for readers unacquainted with decision theory.  Maybe the book can really only be appreciated by philosophers, rather than those seeking to understand what kind of decisions or ideas help to inspire transformative thinking.What really undermines the book is the emphasis on rational thinking.  Personal experience has revealed that many transformative decisions represent a leap in the dark: we decide to change our lives without really knowing what the consequences might be.  Such decisions can be bold in the extreme, but they help us develop strategies of coming to terms with new experiences and developing new ways of thinking that are not always based on previous knowledge, as Paul claims.  Sometimes that previous knowledge proves unhelpful, especially when we compare the new experience with our previous experiences.  These normally turn out to be value-laden comparisons that perpetually change over time.Sometimes the human mind is ""unreasonable,"" prompting us to make decisions which we cannot explain, either to ourselves or to others.  We either answer ""I don't know,"" or ""it just seemed right at the time.""  Such responses undercut the basic thrust of Paul's argument that we can find a rational justification for transformative thinking.  We tend to let our emotions rule our brains, especially when these kind of decisions need to be made: sometimes we regret them, but on other occasions we are grateful that we set aside our reason and jumped off the emotional cliff instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D2HKEK7I70IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198717954#wasThisHelpful","R3D2HKEK7I70IA","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the modern reboots of a classic series, based on the novel by R'fat Ilgaz, that first appeared in the late Seventies. The material will seem extremely familiar to non-Turkish viewers, with strong echoes of chaotic classroom comedies such as the ST. TRINIANS saga, and British black-and-white National Service satires such as ORDERS ARE ORDERS (1954) and most notably CARRY ON SERGEANT (1958).The comedy opens with Bedri the Lunatic (Mehmet Ali Erbil) being outwitted once again by his anarchic group of mature learners. He has acid placed on his head teacher's chair that burns through his pants and leaves his bottom bare. He walks out of school to a chorus of laughter. In revenge he decides to send the whole class on National Service, even though technically they should have left school before they are eligible for this.There follows a series of gags based on the familiar theme of the incompetent squaddies bossed about by their sergeant (Erbil again). The chief comic conceit is that the learners think the sergeant is actually Bedri the Lunatic in disguise, and cannot take him seriously. They only learn to do so when Bedri unexpectedly turns up at the barracks, claiming that he has missed his class too much.The comedy is quite old-fashioned, with several gags based around the squaddies ogling their female counterparts in a fashion reminiscent of Benny Hill. There is also a battle-of-the-sexes theme, as the sergeant resents the presence of female squaddies in the barracks under the command of Major Zehra (Hülya Av'ar). His antediluvian prejudices are soon put to shame, however, as the girls outwit the boys in a night exercise.HABABAM SINIFI: ASKERDE is nonetheless interesting, if only for its underlying nationalist preoccupations. We see several shots of the Turkish flag in the background, as well as the portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Right at the end a soldier is seen in medium close- up giving the kind of cheer-leading speech that would encourage soldiers to fight in their country's cause, and thereby fulfill Atatürk's vision of a great nation.The film ends with a surprise twist, but this does not undermine its underlying emphasis on the importance of everyone forming a community so as to ensure their future irrespective of gender differences.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYWC6K1EX2JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001418EBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3FYWC6K1EX2JP","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TO RISE AGAIN AT A DECENT HOUR is set in contemporary New York.  Narrated by a dentist Paul O'Rourke, it dramatizes his impressions of a world with which he is fundamentally at odds.  Addicted to his smartphone (which he describes as ""a me-machine""), watching the Boston Red Sox on television and videoing every game, and looking out over the balcony of his apartment at the Brooklyn townscape, he finds it almost impossible to relate to those around him.  He retells his previous love-affairs in exhaustive detail, notably with Connie Plotz, who now works as his practice manager.  But nothing actually emerges from these recollections; it seems as if he is unable, or unwilling, to reflect on the consequences of his actions.Paul's life becomes irrecoverably disrupted, however, when he discovers that someone has apparently stolen his personality and compiled a practice website, a Facebook account and a Twitter feed in his name.  He starts by writing a series of abusive letters to the practice website provider, but at length becomes involved in a complex plot involving his past, a mysterious and elusive figure now based in Israel, and a religious group calling themselves the Ulms.The novel begins as a light-hearted satire of contemporary life in New York, whose people are so addicted to virtual communication that they find themselves almost pathologically incapable of relating to one another.  Things have got so bad that Paul's hygienist has turned to God for salvation and berates Paul for his inability to understand the power of religion.  Paul attributes much of his myopia to a disturbed family life when he watched his father watching Red Sox games, but had to come to terms with his father's suicide at an impressionable age.As the narrative unfolds, however, the tone turns distinctly somber.  We learn how Paul has embraced both Catholicism and Judaism in a futile attempt to ingratiate himself with his girlfriends' families.  In essence, this is no bad thing - anyone should be happy to cultivate inter-faith awareness.  What Paul does, however, is to ape the rituals of each religion without actually believing in God: an atheist playing at being religious.  At the end of the novel he hears the story of someone else who did this, and turn to the Ulm religion instead.  Yet we get the sense that Paul is at heart an empty vessel; someone who tries to belong to a variety of groups - social, religious, or whatever - but lacking the conviction to do so.As a first person narrative, TO RISE AGAIN AT A DECENT HOUR is relentlessly narcissistic, but eventually the reader tires of it.  Maybe Paul cannot cultivate self-awareness, but at least he might have learned something about the people closest to him, especially his employees.  But no -- when Connie chooses to leave the practice, he almost adopts the chlidlike pose of saying: ""What did I say?""  ""What did I do?""  The answer is a straightforward one - nothing.Joshua Ferris writes well, with penetrating insight into the mind of his fundamentally unlikeable central character.  But I do wish that the structure could have been less relentlessly concentrated on internal reactions; it would have been good to have worked the other way from the outside in rather than inside out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTY2E3TIY08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316033995#wasThisHelpful","RCTY2E3TIY08","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the novel by Muzaffer İzgü, ÖĞRETMEN (Teacher) is a sentimental tale of a dedicated pedagogue (Kemal Sunal) who travels from a village school to İstanbul to take up a new post with fifth-graders.  The move is not an easy one - although accompanied by his family, he suffers from grinding poverty.  He has a lengthy commute from the suburbs to his school, involving one dolmuş journey plus three bus journeys; on several occasions he turns up late, including his first day.  When he returns home, he is usually so tired that he cannot look after his family.  Inevitably he suffers; he wears out his shoes and hurts his leg.The only way he can survive is to take up street-selling.  This is a risky occupation, as he has to watch out for the police, who will invariably arrest him for illegal hawking.  He ducks and dives; for the most part he is successful, but there are occasions when he suffers as a result.  On one occasion while selling simit (Turkish bread sticks), he falls down a hole in the ground and injures his leg.  Inevitably he finds it difficult to reconcile the two sides to his life - the street-seller and the teacher - which affects his future life.The story of ÖĞRETMEN may seem familiar, but Kartal Tibet's film offers a fascinating series of snapshots about the Turkish educational system; its insistence on order and discipline, with learners having to repeat what they have learned in class, while conforming to a rigid set of rules that limit creativity.  Sunal's Hüsnü (the teacher) challenges those rules and earns the learners' respect as a result.  When they learn of his grinding poverty, they arrange for a surprise to be given to him on Öğretmenler Günü (Teacher's Day).  Hüsnü is touched as a result.Inevitably Hüsnü comes into conflict with the bureaucracy at his school - one of the flash-points involves a stray dog.  For the most part he can deal with such conflicts, but in the end the need to conform to a rigid set of rules affects him.Normally associated with comedy films, Kemal Sunal gives an affecting performance as Hüsnü, alternately serious yet charming in front of the learners.  He never seems to lose his temper with them, which is something to be admired.The world of İstanbul might have significantly changed since this film appeared in 1988, but the educational atmosphere has hardly altered.  Life in today's high schools is as difficult for today's educators as it was for Hüsnü.  All we can do is to admire him for his determination to adhere to his humanist ideals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P3DS59YBY9Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CB01F8S#wasThisHelpful","R1P3DS59YBY9Y0","A1E6JS6C205VZD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E6JS6C205VZD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The more I read, the less I knew, and by the end, I was left with more questions than an unsolved episode of Dateline.

Charlie and Silas have no idea what happened to cause this, but they discover that although they are strangers today, they were very much connected yesterday.  As they try to figure out what happened to them, they also find out that the person that they are today is not the same person they were, and they are as much a stranger to themselves as the rest of the world.  As parts of their past are revealed, both good and bad, the race is on to uncover what has happened to them before the rest of the world unearths their secret.  Looking forward to the next installment.**************************************************************************************************Not a biggie, but I'm a reader who pays attention to details.  At the beginning of the book, ""Miss"" is spelled as ""miss"" twice, and I wasn't sure why.  Also, Charlie mentions that she doesn't have a smartphone, just a regular phone, but later in the book she mentions that she can tell that her texts are being read by read notifications.  I don't think that's possible unless it's on a smartphone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PS8JNTRTZ651/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZVNDSS#wasThisHelpful","R3PS8JNTRTZ651","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Spoiler Alert- I don't know how to discuss this without spoilers, but I tried.********************************************************************************************Ahhh, so I'm enjoying this story that focuses on two best friends who have been dancing around ""what-if"" they were to become more than just friends. There is a pact made that if they reach the age of 30 and still single, they will get married. So we follow Stephanie and Linden for the next five years falling in and out of relationships, wondering if anything will come from the pact. Suddenly towards the end of the story, Linden does something so spineless, so douchey, that I want to rip off what's remaining of his genitalia , and have him go sit in the corner with Bruce Jenner, so they can share lipstick and nail polish and talk about when they used to be men. I'm serious, I'm so pissed that this Scot-turned-wuss, that I can't forgive him, and I've forgiven a lot of antics in the book world. What's the matter Linden, are you still having mommy issues, didn't get hugged enough, wasn't breast-fed? Linden is a spineless coward, and if I could get this book in Word format, I would rewrite Linden's fate. I'd have Mateo from Love, in Spanish to pay him a visit and explain to Linden all that he gave up to be with Vera. Then Mateo laugh in his face and tell Linden that he purchased him a subscription to Harlequin Romance and Nicholas Sparks' books, because Linden's man card  has been shredded into a 1000 pieces.  I want to bring in Javier from The Artists Trilogy , and Javier seduce Steph on the bar, not giving a crap who watches or gets mad, because good sex is worth butt-hurt friends. I want to send Linden and James to Bad Book Boyfriend prison and have Nadine as their prison guard. Yeah, I might be slightly angry at Linden.The rest of the book is well-written, and the Halle does a wonderful job of writing eclectic characters, but Linden...screw him and Jack.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMY1X1KJOZFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RJD8LOS#wasThisHelpful","RMMY1X1KJOZFW","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I began reading Beautiful Oblivion last week, and normally it should have taken me a couple of days to finish this book, but it took several days.  I would read so many pages, and then for the sake of my sanity, I would place it aside and do the things that I normally try to avoid doing.  Usually I procrastinate housework, but this time, I found myself procrastinating finishing the book, but on the bright side,  grease spatters under my stove are gone, the rim under the toilets cleaned, hell I cleaned out the vegetable storage drawer in the fridge and I think I tossed out fruit that I purchased in 2002.  I did everything that I could possible do to avoid reading more of Beautiful Oblivion, and why?  Because the story was going nowhere quick.  Why didn't I stop reading the book?  Because there was a secret that kept being flaunted, and I just HAD to find out what that secret was.  The way that the secret was touted, it had to be a good and juicy MISTAKE, alas, the only good and juicy mistake was me taking the time to finish this story.  The secret is discussed more below the spoiler line.The relationship between Trenton and Camille was lackluster, she is seeing him daily although she says that they are ""just friends"", and her long-distance boyfriend accepts this.  Then there is the relationship with Camille and her family.  Her brothers are constantly yelling and bullying her, particularly about not showing up for a weekly dinner with their bullying and abusive father.  Although they are in their 20s, they argue and fight as if they are twelve, and they hold themselves accountable to their parents.  Of course Camille is the martyr and the one responsible for all the family angst, and she is also the one responsible for fixing her brothers.  There wasn't one scene when they were together that I didn't want to scream because of their adolescent behavior.The bit with the names, what the he!!  is up with that?  This wasn't a case of the worst name in history; this was a case of all the characters in the two families given names that begin with the same letter.  It sounds stupid with the Kardashians and it sounds twice as stupid in this book.  There is Camille, and her brothers and cousin: Coby, Clark, Chase, and Colin; then there are the Maddox Brothers: Trenton, Travis, Tyler, Taylor, and Thomas.This story left such a bad taste, that I can't even move on to read a new book.******SPOILER***************SPOILER**********************POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW*********************SPOILER***************SPOILER**********************POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW*********************SPOILER***************SPOILER**********************POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW***************The bottom line is that the author achieved major success with the Abby and Travis story, and she attempted the same formula to make the story of Camille and Trenton as successful, but it doesn't work, it reads like a watered down duplication.  It's also a repeat of males who sleep around are just being boys, but females who sleep around are whores.  There isn't a real plot to the story, I couldn't figure out why they weren't together as a couple, yet they work, eat, and sleep together.The secret was actually an insult to the intelligence of readers, were we suppose to buy that they live in a small town, they all belong to the same fraternity, and Trenton doesn't know.  And why didn't Camille tell the secret in the beginning when Trenton first introduces himself?  I see the phrase ""When a Maddox Brother loves, he loves for life"".......uh....no.....I don't think so in this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29RKUJ8WB86Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBHSB8M#wasThisHelpful","R29RKUJ8WB86Y1","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Possible Spoiler Alert*** I try to only discuss the basics of the story without giving away any spoilers.Anders Ellis is not only a Hollywood’s box office star; Anders is also the epitome of a Hollywood playboy and one of the biggest a$$holes that you’ll ever meet. Seriously, look up “a**hole” in the Oxford dictionary, there’s a photo of Anders. Everything that Anders does, it’s for him and/or his career. His ego is as massive as the line of women who have bedded him or dying to bed him. So why does this story appeal to me, because I love watching a badboy getting his just deserts.Anders has slept with so many different women, and that’s easy to do considering his “no repeats” policy (yeah, total jerk), that there comes a time when he can no longer match a familiar face with the vagina he has banged. Now imagine being one of his sexcapades, and running into the guy that gave you the best sex that you’ve ever had, and he smiles and says “Have we met?” Yeah, not only do you deal with feeling promiscuous, but now you have to face that the night of your greatest orgasm was so vanilla to him that he doesn’t even remember. You would be mortified or humiliated, right? Not Josie, see Josie starts off being a honey badger, Josie doesn’t give a sh*t. Well maybe she does just a little in the beginning, but she gets over it rather quickly the more time that she’s around Mr. Badboy. Josie’s indifference is like waving a red flag to a bull, thus Anders’ interest and pursuit begins. I was expecting Anders to turn over a new leaf at this point, but this is where the story pulls me in, because Anders is still very much an conceited jerk. He tries to cover it up in front of Josie, but the reader gets a glimpse into his thoughts, and what Anders says and thinks are two different things. At times he is repulsed by the way he is attracted to Josie, especially when she isn’t in his presence, but then his plans not to give a sh*t about her are thwarted when he sees her on the movie set. There are times when they are together and the story shows how his douchiness is freaking out internally, I love how he struggles to conceal what a pr*ick he is, but it often comes back to bite him.To further complicate matters, Anders and Josie spin a web of deceit, but the lies they created in order to be together, are the very lies that are pulling them apart.This story appealed to me because it was like climbing inside the mind of an a$$hole and watching his wheels spin. I liked that the author kept Anders true to form, instead of an immediate change in character.**Disclaimer--I received an ARC of this story, but I wasn’t asked to give a review in return; in fact, it was only after I had finished that I discovered that the story was going to be released as a book. I’m not part of a blog tour nor acquainted with the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234BVEPYHVNME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMVNVFC#wasThisHelpful","R234BVEPYHVNME","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to be vague in discussing the story so that I don't reveal any spoilers, other than to say that the story follows a family trying to recover from a fatal car accident, and a sister trying to save her brother who is suffering from mental illness.  The book is good, but there were a couple of items that kept me from loving the story.  The first one being that this book lacks a connection, a connection between the characters, and a connection with the reader.  Even though the family is isolated and doesn't have much interaction with the outside world, I don't feel a relationship or bond between the family members.  Calla says her most important concern is to take care of her twin brother Finn, yet when they interact, I didn't sense that bond that she mentions so often throughout the book.  There isn't much communication between the rest of the family members; most of the book is based on Calla's thoughts.  Dare is the mysterious stranger who Calla encounters, and Calla is immediately drawn to him.  But even as they spend more time together, I didn't get a sense of any intimacy growing between the two.  Calla and Dare talk, but I felt that Dare was as much a stranger to Calla towards the end as he was in the beginning.  In fact, one of the problems that I had with this story is that I knew as little about the characters by the end of the book as I did when I began reading it.  I realize that this book is a mystery/thriller, therefore ambiguity and secrecy is part of the scheme, but I needed to have a connection or understanding of Calla.  I have to say that Calla saying that her ovaries might explode whenever she turned on by Dare is weird.  Instead of the story pulling me in and making me feel  as I'm experiencing the scenes unfold with the characters,  I'm left with a lackluster sensation that I'm reading this story as if it were a magazine or newspaper article.Possible Spoiler Alert*****  Please do not read past this point if you don't want to know anything about the ending.******Besides the distance or lack of closeness, another problem for me is the cliffhanger.  I am not opposed to a cliffhanger in a story, but usually a cliffhanger is in addition to the main storyline/plot or an epic moment in the book.  Nocte  reads on an even keel, it doesn't have moments of angst or drama, so I am expecting when I get to the end that the plot will be revealed, unfortunately , the plot is the cliffhanger.  I would have been satisfied with the plot being revealed, and then the story ending with a cliffhanger, but I'm left feeling that I wasted my time reading up to this moment, and discovering that I still don't know the purpose for the story.  I think there were a few scenes that could have been epic moments, but there was as much emphasis placed on those scenes as the ones where they are standing in line for coffee.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QQ5XSN088ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OM34YE4#wasThisHelpful","R30QQ5XSN088ZY","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*Possible Spoiler Alert**Yawn*  Was there a purpose to this book?  Unless the purpose behind this book was an attempt at driving this series into the ground, then congratulations, it was a success.  This book is similar to ordering a box of candies from a company that you've trusted in the past, and they send you  a huge box, and you think that it's going to be filled with all sorts of goodness, but then you open the box, and it's filled with nothing but packing peanuts, and you keep searching thinking that you're going to find something, and finally after going through all the packaging, you find a caramel.  The packing peanuts in this book are the sex scenes, and try as you may to search through all of them, but you aren't going to find a caramel, maybe a piece of butterscotch candy.  Because I enjoy erotica, it pains me to say ""Enough with the sex"", please, we get it, we also get that they need each other to survive, Gideon is the yin to Eva's yang, he can't breathe without her, his body hurts not being inside her,  they feel each other's presence before they see each other, their skin aches when they part, WE GET THIS, IT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER IN ALL THREE PREVIOUS BOOKS.  Seriously, they have sex before work, while on the way to work, while at work, and then after work, at this point I would be happy just to see either one standing at the water cooler talking to a co-worker about the last episode of The Walking Dead, effing anything but the two of them effing.  It would be nice to read one of having an independent scene without the other waiting in the shadows.  It would be interesting to see Eva going to California without Gideon trailing, as it would to read about Eva going to lunch without Gideon waiting a table close-by, it would have been interesting to read any scene without them together, because as we all find out, they can't be together without engaging in sex.  That's is all there is to this book is the sex, and although I like sex scenes, it would be nice to have a little storyline to go along with it.  I skipped through dozens of pages because the sex is a yawn fest.This series began with beautiful, wealthy, interesting yet flawed and damaged people, but has turned into a series about beautiful co-dependents that I seriously doubt can take a p*ss without the other one holding his/her hand.  I now loathe Cary, instead of him being a supporter and friend to Eva, all he thinks about is how her every move is going to impact him.  This book is essentially the three of them discussing sex, making each other miserable, whining and complaining, but can't be away from each other for longer than an hour.  C'mon, how ridiculous is it that Gideon wants Cary to move in the penthouse that he and Eva are having remodeled so that Cary doesn't feel deserted.  Gideon has turned into a pansy, frantic schoolgirl, but instead of passing notes of ""Do you like me, yes or no?"", he sends texts.  Corrine having sex with Angus would be more interesting than to reading this,  watching paint dry on the walls would be more interesting than this story.As with book three (Entwined with You) in this series, nothing was resolved, nothing new occurred, it was basically a repeat of book three.  The name of this book should have been: Entwined with You Version 2.0, or Gideon Has Sex With Eva Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again.Save your money folks, nothing new going on here.  I included a ""Possible Spoiler Alert"" because I wasn't sure if saying nothing new occurred would be a spoiler.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NDUR8EF45ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEQRNVG#wasThisHelpful","R30NDUR8EF45ZZ","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is simply beautiful, and by beautiful, I mean it shows the stark-naked-ugly- hairy-a$$- truth about two people who fall in when they weren't supposed to fall in love.  If you are looking for a sweet love-conquers-all fairytale, please allow me to show you the exit door, because $hit just got real in this book.Before I plunge into my review, let me just say that I want to take a hard copy of LiS, grind it into powder, pour it into a spice jar, and slap a ""Mateo"" label on it.  Eggs tasting a little bland, sprinkle a little Mateo on them, having a bad hair day, sprinkle a little Mateo on your head; not feeling so fresh down there, sprinkle some of that Mateo powder on the cooch.  MATEO MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER!  I think that the author should contact me so that we can get a plan in action.  If you see a 3 a.m. As-Seen-On-TV infomercial for Mateo powder, you can thank me for improving your life.  Okay, okay, let's talk about the story.***Warning:  Possible Spoilers Below***Love, in Spanish (LiS) picks up where Love, in English (LiE) ended, but this time the story is told from Mateo's POV.  The story is NOT a rehash of the first book; it's a continuation of Mateo's and Vera's life after their scandalous affair.  This book is as important IF not more important than LiE, because it tells the story of  the aftermath left once news of Mateo and Vera's affair goes public, and Mateo leaves his wife and home to be with Vera .  This story is so remarkable and powerful because it shows that  love, sometimes it's downright ugly, and just because two people love with all their heart and soul, even that isn't always enough to sustain the relationship.  Love, in Spanish gives a big dose of reality; it brings to light what often occurs when a person leaves one commitment/marriage to be with the one who brings him to life, who breathes air into his soul.  Before Vera, Mateo was the man who had everything and nothing at the same time; and now Mateo is the man who has nearly nothing and everything at the same time.  Vera made Mateo realize that he was living the wrong life.  However, just because Mateo makes the huge decision to choose Vera over his lifeless marriage in LiE, that doesn't mean that the worst is over and that they get to live happily ever after.Mateo choosing to be Vera is like an earthquake, and just like a real earthquake, sometimes the most damage is not brought on the quake itself, but by the aftershocks or a tsunami.  Have you ever wondered about a real-life affair that was so powerful that it caused the demise of another committed relationship, yet the couple fell apart afterwards?  LiS shows us that the hardest part of a forbidden affair isn't the decision to leave significant others so that the two people can be together; it's living that life afterwards that's the toughest.Mateo soon learns that his affair wronged not only his wife, but every wife in in their social circle, school, and city, and none of them are going to allow neither him nor Vera to forget that pain and humiliation. Mateo also discovers that when he divorced his wife, he ended up divorcing his friends and supporters.  He planned on losing his house and wife, but  he didn't plan on losing a majority of parental rights and decisions, friendships,  loyalty, respect from others, his image, admiration from his countrymen, and social status;  his wife got custody of all that and more from the divorce.  This is why so many affairs end; people don't foresee all the other losses.  Mateo does gain a few things, but nothing like he anticipated; he inherits ruthless media, negative publicity that plays out his private life in the tabloids, scorn from the other parents, disrespect from former friends, a big pile of guilt, insecurities and doubts.  In addition to all the losses, Mateo recognizes not only the age gap, but the language barrier and cultural difference between him and Vera.  Mateo prefers swilling scotch in his apartment, whereas Vera enjoys getting drunk and dancing all night.  Mateo is a man of traditions, Vera is very much a free spirit; Mateo is rooted, while Vera is the star in the sky.  But like Mateo said, ""You don't keep your eyes on the ground once you've seen the beauty of the stars."" At times I found myself irritated with Vera, some of her behavior brought embarrassment to Mateo, as well as hardship.  Then I remember that Vera is only 23 y.o., and also a free-thinking, inked-up,  non-conformist, who is living in a foreign country where she is vilified, and not only does she not have any family connections, but she doesn't even speak the language and could be deported any day from the man that she loves.  How the hell do I expect her to behave?My heart ached for this couple, how long should they have to carry around that big bag of guilt and shame, and how long should two people be punished for falling in love?  They deserve family and friends who love them, instead of choosing to judge them.  Never has that old adage, ""Nothing worth having comes easy"", been truer than with Mateo and Vera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRRA1NFJEI2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJVPNIQ#wasThisHelpful","RKRRA1NFJEI2V","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Spoiler Alert****Spoiler Alert**What the f**k did I just read?! Seriously, what the f**k did I read? My mind is reeling from this mess of f***ed up characters. I don't even know if I liked, loved, or hated the story? The only thing I do know is that everyone is talking about this book; I have 6 different PMs and a book blog discussing this story, and I've never seen so much rabid conversation going on. I don't even know how to rate this, but if a book has this much discussion and conspiracy talks going on, I have to rate it high. Here's the thing, I want to give the book a 5 because of all the buzz it has generated. However, I can't get past the fact that she was only 15, and that Grizz and Grunt had been wanting her since she was 13 years old. That is really messed up, and the story would have still worked had Kit been written older. Then at the end, when we see that Kit caught Grizz's eye when she was only six, even though it wasn't sexual, if was too over the top.I can't tell you one good thing that I liked about this book, I can tell you that I despised that Kit was underage when she was taken, I bloody hated the brutality, there wasn't one person that I felt some sort of empathy or connection, and yet I can't stop thinking about what I read. My kids came up to me after I read this telling me that they are hungry, I slid a box of Captain Crunch and told them that this was dinner, and that mommy has a headache. Don't worry or call CPS, my husband came in a few minutes later and prepared dinner. Stupid stupid book.This book did not make me a better person or bring some freaking happiness to my life, it messed with me. I almost loathe myself for finishing this book. The dang author dropped clues left and right, and feeling like the superior reader, I had it all figured out; yeah, I had it all figured out, until the author, Beth Flynn, gave it to me up the ess at the very end. Let me just say that I don't enjoy being taking it up the ess without any lube. For the record I am neither Team Grizz nor Team Grunt; I am Team No One, no, I am Team Get-your-butt-out-before-they-kill-you. I disliked Grizz because he is totally messed up and brutally violent, but I can't stand Grunt, that sneaky rat-ess ba$tard. It's like choosing Ted Bundy or Charlie Manson. Oh my god, I hate myself for feeling anything for these characters.To Beth Flynn, you may have gotten me at the end, but I'm onto you. Here's what I think will happen in book two.1. Grizz is alive.2. Kit's parents were in on the kidnapping and possibly still alive. What, Kit didn't see a body.3. Grunt was involved in Moe's death and possibly Kit's rape.Ms. Flynn, do me a favor and kill each and every character in book 2 so I don't have to feel my soul tortured or comprised with book 3. Just get out of my freaking head and leave me alone, my kids need to be feed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAXSNI6ZWYQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3350MK#wasThisHelpful","R2HAXSNI6ZWYQ5","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two and a half stars***May contain spoilers***I chose to read Sweet Addictions because it was nominated in the GR Choice Awards and several readers in various groups raved about it.  The book's description is  ""Sweet Addiction is the story of one woman's struggle to keep things casual, and one man's desire to never let her go"", a better description would be ""Sweet Addiction is the story of one woman who says she wants to keep things casual, but does just the opposite over and over"".The story takes place at the wedding of Dylan's ex-boyfriend, no they didn't remain on good terms, Dylan is a baker and has been hired to bake her ex's wedding cake.  Within minutes of arriving, Dylan falls into the lap of the gorgeous Reese, CPA extraordinaire.  Immediately she is filled with the thoughts ""Oh God, I want those lips on me"".  Following the ceremony, Dylan and her gay friend Joey, have no problem meeting up with Reese and his gay friend, each couple engaging in mind-blowing sex, and Dylan experiences her first orgasm ever with Reese in the bathroom stall.  Afterwards things become awkward, and Dylan's best friend, Juls, informs Dylan after she reappears from the bathroom romp that Reese is married.  Dylan flees the wedding, but not before her ex grabs her and propositions her.  There is more sex going on at the wedding reception than honeymoon suites at the Poconos and Sandals Resort combined.The next day Dylan's friends try to convince her that it doesn't matter if Reese is married, he is hot and so romantic.  Really?  Although Dylan denies that she has any feelings for Reese, and it's tough considering that they spent all of 30-40 minutes talking and having sex in a bathroom, but 30-40 minutes in this book equates to 2 weeks in the real world.  Dylan decides to confront Reese about him being married and having sex with her, although she hadn't planned on seeing him again.  So Dylan does what every mature adult female *cough-selfish-crazy-psycho-cough*  does, no she doesn't call him on the phone or ask to meet him anywhere, she goes straight to his workplace , because that's what mature adults *cough-unstable-people-cough*  do.  When she sees Reese, this gorgeous CPA sitting behind his desk with his oh-so-big calculator, that she loses her train of thought, but once she has regained her composure she does what every mature female *cough-crazy-psycho-cough* does and slaps him.Okay, I have to address the multiple slappings that goes on in the story, I am zero domestic violence, but if a female doesn't want to be slapped, then she shouldn't hit.  Slapping became Dylan's way of dealing with Reese, and at one point I wanted him to retaliate and give her a dose of her own medicine.  Instead of being shocked or abhorred by Dylan's behavior, it was considered ""HOT!"".  Everything that this group does is hot and convenient, so much that the book could have been ""Little Caesars"".  How convenient that everyone is able to pair up with someone in the other group, how hot that these partners at a CPA firm are able to engage in sex with the doors unlocked when the women show up,  I repeat they are CPAs!!!Dylan and Joey waffle so much, that I was craving a serving of Scattered, Smothered, and Covered hash browns to make this story complete.  In one sentence she won't allow herself to become serious about Reese, and the following sentence she is ruined for any other man, and this is while they're on their first date.  Dylan says she wants a casual hookup, but then she suggests that they be ""monogamously casual"".  Speaking of first dates, it is time that the scenario of a couple getting ready to engage in sex, and the female says that she is on the pill, has been tested and cleared of any STDs, and would like the guy to go bareback because she trusts him, and the guy replies, and I repeat ALWAYS replies, ""I've never done it without a condom before, EVER, but I will with you"".  That scene has been done in so many stories that it needs to be retired to the Smithsonian Institute.  I've seen that same scenario in at least 10 books this year alone; that scene has earned its retirement, now let it collect Social Security and rest in a rocking chair.Getting back to the story, there is plenty of angst, but it's angst brought on by Dylan's thinking.  I'm sure if Dylan was to receive some anger management therapy, Ativan, or Prozac, she would be a lovely gal.  Also, I have to point out that it took Reese eight years to achieve his Master's degree in Business Administration, that's about the same length of time that it takes for someone to finish medical school, so something tells me that Reese may not be as stellar as Dylan thinks or maybe the company's CEO isn't that selective who makes partner.  Also, it takes two years working under a CPA before a person is qualified to be a CPA, just throwing that out there.This book was all over the place, it felt like a Disney princess film meets the 90210 crowd; the characters' behaviors were more of middle or high school students than adults.  It was a make out session whenever they all got together, and everyone sitting on each other's laps,  true love as soon as they meet,  making out at the office in front of co-workers, always angst, but no real plot to generate all the angst.  Bryce Roberts' character, what was that about?  It felt like he was going to become a fixture for some angst, but he just fizzled away to oblivion.  Big thumbs up to the wedding scene when Dylan's feet wouldn't move, that was pretty original and sweet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WM8HXJLGCEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2GAUC0#wasThisHelpful","R20WM8HXJLGCEA","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If Sempre was that unknown horse that no one has heard about, yet wins the Kentucky Derby, ""Made"" is the Triple Crown in this trilogy.  J.M. Darhower just gets better and better with each book in the Sempre series.  Sempre introduced us to the story of Haven and Carmine, Sempre Redemption showed  us  a side of Corrado and Vincent that we didn't get to see in Sempre, and Made brings everything  full circle.""Made"" tells us how The Kevlar Killer is made, not just how Corrado Moretti became a ""made man"" in organized crime, but how he came to exist.  Organized crime has always been a part of Corrado's life, even when he didn't know it, it was there.  Corrado grew up knowing enough of the rules, and how a person could became dead when the rules were broken.  Author Darhower  writes beautifully how the Mafia is much like Hotel California, as you can check in, but you can never leave.  ""After they invited you in, after they embraced you, there was no walking away.  It's a beautiful web of glorious silk, intricately woven together with deception, which draws you in like moths to a flame.  But as soon as you're close, as soon as you approach, the web snatches a hold of you and refuses to let go.  And once you're stuck, the black widow comes and f**ks you good before eating you alive."" If you think that Corrado is cold, compared to his mother, he is a ray of sunshine.  When a stranger asks Corrado ""what made you this way?""  Corrado's explanation is "" The world treats me like I wronged them, when really, the world wronged me.  The world made me this way.  And maybe they all hate me, but still, they need me.  Because without villains, there would be no superheroes"".  At one point in his childhood, Corrado had to consider the fact that his own mother might try to kill him one day.  If Joan Crawford was able to read Made, even she would cringe and say ""That is one cold-a** mother"".  Corrado learns early in life the rule of not to get too attached to anyone, because eventually he/she will disappear, and one thing that Corrado is good at, it's following rules.  People have a way of disappearing in Corrado's world, and he grew up knowing that ""it's cruel, but it's unavoidable.  If the shark didn't eat the man, the man would eat the shark.  That's just how it goes"".  That rule works out perfectly for Corrado, until he meets Celia DeMarco.  Celia is a total enigma for Corrado, growing up in a house of ruthless women; he doesn't know how to handle this strong, passionate, yet caring female.  Corrado has lived in a world colored only in black and white, just obey the rules, follow orders, and don't never ever ask ""why"".  Celia brings color, fire, and passion to an ugly ruthless world, and although Corrado fights to keep her away, Celia isn't used to obeying every rule like Corrado.  These two are meant for one another, Celia keeps Corrado on his toes, and brings a small trace of gentleness to Corrado, even as Corrado fights these conflicting emotions, he is no match for Celia determinedness.  Celia really is an enigma, because even though Celia brings some change to Corrado, she also aware of the world in which they live, and she knows when to be supportive and just let Corrado do what he has to do.  Celia compliments, yet contrasts Corrado, but one thing is for sure, they belong together.Made comes full circle for the Sempre series, we learn not only of Corrado's and Celia's past, but we get to read about Vincent's past and how he found the woman who would eventually shake up  his world, but also the world of  La Cosa Nostra.  Darhower stays true to form in not making a flashy story romanticizing the criminal underworld, instead she shows the reader once again beauty found in an ugly world.  Corrado, you are wrong, you and Vincent showed sacrifice and loyalty to the ones you love, you'll always be my superhero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PMNL31KLRGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9YYP7W#wasThisHelpful","R26PMNL31KLRGN","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three and a half stars, spoiler-free review.Torture to Her Soul is the follow up to Monster In His Eyes.  This was one of my most anticipated releases because I loved Naz in the first book.  In MIHE, Naz was mysterious and dark, he admitted that he wasn't a good man, and his actions led me to believe him.  I loved him in spite of this, because he didn't make any apologies nor did he try to change to please Karissa.  In Torture to Her Soul, Naz fell off the pedestal that I created for him.  For me, Naz turned from this dark, take-charge, always in-control tiger into a brooding puppy.  In the first 1/3 of the book, Naz is basically following Karissa throughout the house trying to figure out what she's thinking, how beautiful she is, or how much he loves her.  For me the author made a common error that most female authors make when writing a male's POV once he has fallen in love, she wrote the words that females want to believe that the male is thinking, not what an actual man would make, especially a man such as Ignazio Vitale.  His world outside of Karissa basically comes to a halt while he focuses every minute on Karissa.  Naz drops everything he is doing, stays at home with Karissa, even though she refuses to talk to him and ignores him for days, and waits patiently for her to love him once again or just smile once again.  TMI was the downfall to this part of the book; Naz's POV is giving me too much information.  I don't need or maybe just don't want to know that he's eagerly waiting for her minute after minute to toss him a bone, like a puppy.  I don't want Naz to be a puppy; I want Naz to be the Naz that he was in the first book.Fortunately the couple begins venturing outside the house around the 2/3 of the book, and the story starts to escalate.  The last 1/3 of the book gave me the adrenaline and excitement that I loved in Monster In His Eyes.  The ending was climatic; both thrilling and chilling.One part of the relationship that the author absolutely nailed, or at least it worked for me is that Naz and Karissa did not completely trust one another.  I loved this concept, because this isn't a couple that met through a mutual friend, fell in love while sharing unlimited bread sticks at an Olive Garden.  Karissa knows that Naz is a bad man, and Naz knows he committed acts that have turned Karissa's life upside down.  In a scenario like this, you don't roll out of bed, kiss each other on the cheek, and make coffee; no, you wonder if he'll kill you if you try to leave, or did she put poison in my coffee.I loved the ending to story, however the first 1/3 of the book had me wondering if Naz had grown a vagina, and I almost didn't finish it.  I look forward to reading more stories from J.M. Darhower","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EYL77RWRV182/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NP4U422#wasThisHelpful","R3EYL77RWRV182","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so excited to be writing a five star review for a Kristen Ashley book, to be honest I didn't connect with her last four releases, and it left me feeling odd, as if I were book impotent, or that I had to watch out for a Cantu sister cutting my brake lines.  In her latest release, Deacon, Ms. Ashley brings her A-game,  and I love the end result.  I suspected that Ashley was writing outside her comfort box when I read the disclaimer warning readers that the book was dealing with a dark romance, erotic scenes, anal sex, bondage, and ..........wait did I just read ""anal sex"" ....... in a K.A. book......SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!Also another indicator that this book was going to be different is that the heroine, Cassie, is 5'5"", that's petite in a K.A. book where nearly every female role is 5'7""-5'11"".  It isn't just Cassie's stature that causes her to stand out from the other K.A. female characters; Cassie is in charge and attempting to live her dream.  Cassie doesn't need to be saved or rescued from a situation or a man, she is independent, capable, down-to-Earth, and I connect with her character.  She doesn't lose herself in a man, and she doesn't lose her feminine qualities while being independent, she's as tough as nails when she needs to be, and she isn't scared of being alone.  God, I can't tell you how much I love her character.Deacon rolls in, and he isn't the typical alpha-male that I'm used to seeing in a K.A. book, he's dark, mysterious, and foreboding.  He doesn't step in and immediately take over Cassie's life; in fact, it takes years before they are comfortable with each other.  Deacon is enigmatic, he rolls into town every few months, and the reader knows that he has shadowy secrets, but just how dark is the question.  Cassie knows that on some level that this isn't going to work out, yet she enters a relationship cautiously, and I have to give her credit that she prepares from the beginning that he is going to leave.  I love Deacon, he's able to recognize Cassie's strengths and independence, and he compromises....COMPROMISES....he doesn't go all alpha-male and control every situation.  Let me just say when his secret is exposed, I felt his pain to my bones.  His past is brutal, K.A. doesn't spare any details in giving the reader an insight to Deacon's pain and what causes him to die inside and become this tortured soul.The sex, Holy Mother of Fornication, was so explicit, and hotter than any other Ashley's book.  I don't know what brought this out in K.A., maybe she got a subscription to HBO After Dark or Cinemax, but holy hell.  There was bondage, anal sex, butt plugs, but it wasn't just used on the female; yeah, you read that right, Cassie had her some fun too.  It isn't that I can't find these scenes in other erotic books, but I was unprepared to read it in Deacon, and K.A. wrote it passionately and tastefully.  I loved it!I adore Cassie's best friend, Milagros.  Milagros was always looking out for Cassie, and she wasn't swayed by Deacon's good looks, and she aired her suspicions with Cassie.  This is the kind of best friend that every gal wants in her corner.Deacon is at the top of my favorite 2014 reads.  I embraced everything about this book, and I loved that Ashley allowed one of my favorite Rock Chicks' couple make an appearance.  I read this on a Kindle, and if the scene at 93% doesn't move you, then you are a serial killer who likes to kick around puppies as a pastime.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PZ8GV8IASL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8T7P86#wasThisHelpful","R26PZ8GV8IASL1","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I reviewed this book when it was originally called ""Break Me"", and my review received a lot of support because fans of the UnDeniable series could see that Kate Stone had used character names, dialogue, and storylines from the UnDeniable series.  Now the book has been re-released with a slightly changed title and author name, not only has Kate/Katie re-released this book, but she has released a new book titled ""Hell's Horsemen"".  Doesn't that sound familiar?! Don't worry, I reviewed the new book, and I can honestly say that it was one of the worst written stories that I've ever read.  Below is my review of the first release titled ""Break Me"".************************************************************************************************************************************************************Let's pretend that Chef Gordon Ramsay prepared the most succulent dinner, a meal so delicious that you'll be telling your grandchildren stories about it. Hours later after the food has entered the stomach, the gastric juices break down that most decadent meal, and eventually it is turned into excrement. Folks, meet Kate Stone, the gastric juice in the literary world. Kate has taken a 5 star book, UnDeniable, broke it down and attempted to copy it, and Break Me is what was pooped out.Did Kate think that no one would notice the similarities between her story and UnDeniable? I'm willing to bet that she will deny ever reading UnDeniable, the book that is highly favored by fans of the MC genre. If you think my review is harsh, let me point out some facts.1. The Break Me story centers around a character that has been in and out of juvie since his teens and called ""Crazy Evan"", and introduces members of the MC called Mick, Ripper, Danny, and ZZ, a red-head that cleans the clubhouse, and a young girl that wears tattered jeans and t-shirts. UnDeniable's list of characters include ""Crazy Frankie"", a young man that's been in and out of jail since his teens; other characters include Mick, Ripper, Danny, ZZ, Dorothy (a red head that cleans the clubhouse), and Eva (a young girl that wears torn jeans and t-shirts).2. Break Me's club prez is an older man with one syllable first and last name that throws around the word ""darlin'""; UnDeniable's club prez, Cole ""Deuce"" West put the word ""darlin'"" in Urban Dictionary, I would say Webster's, but we all know Webster's is too uptight and button down collared shirt for that stuff. Seriously though, Deuce is legendary for using ""darlin'"".3. Crazy Evan is very, very similiar to UnDeniable's Crazy Frankie, from his fixation to kill the club president, the coerced sex, to his obsessed with the heroine, stating ""Need you more than life baby...More than f*****g life...Can't f*****g sleep, can't f*****g eat. Don't you know that?"" In UnDeniable, Crazy Frankie made the statement to Eva ""I can't sleep without you, and I can't breathe, baby. I can't f****n' breathe. "".4. Break to Callie: ""Tell me,"" he whispered, ""do you want it hard, or do you want it slow?"" In UnDeniable, Deuce to Eva: ""You want it hard, baby?"" he whispered, ""Or you want it slow?""5. In one instance, Break says ""She's not for the club, she's mine"". Deuce made the statement ""She doesn't belong to one of my boys. She's f****n' mine"".6. In a rape scene, Break is forced to watch, and Callie finds salvation during the act by staring into Break's blue eyes. In UnDeniable.....ditto.....same thing.There are other similarities, but I've made my point. My review is harsh, but I hate when someone steals another person's ideas and hard work and tries to profit from it.I can't even bring myself to call Kate an author, Kate is a copy-cat and an opportunist; she is not a writer. I want to call her a plagiarist, but she changed just enough words that the statements aren't verbatim. Sadly, this isn't the first MC book that has attempted to copy ""UnDeniable"", but it's probably the worst-written semi-plagiarized version. What parts that Kate didn't ""borrow"" from UnDeniable, were poorly written.Here's an idea, Kate and to others that want to create a succulent dinner by stealing Chef Gordon Ramsay's recipe (aka Madeline Sheehan's book) and calling it their own: go watch Paula Deen on The Food Network (aka take a writing course), then practice with your own ingredients (aka your own words and story), and then when you've worked hard enough and come up with an original recipe, host a dinner party (aka publish your own book). In the meantime, if you want a book that is equivalent of ordering a pink-slime burger through a speaker and being asked ""Would you like fries with that?"", this might be your book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPJ8LYFNW0RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7NPP4E#wasThisHelpful","R1TPJ8LYFNW0RI","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Loved it!  By the time I finished reading UnBeloved, I felt as if I had just hopped off a roller coaster. This book had me crying, nervous, laughing, and filled with excitement.UnBeloved is the 4th book in the saga of Hell's Horsemen Motorcycle Club. I think it's safe to say that this series has moved from just being an MC romance genre to an MC story. This installment deals primarily with the aftermath and dealing with the wounds, both physically and emotionally, from the relationship between Jase/Dorothy/Hawk from years earlier, betrayal from one of the brothers, the spiraling downfall of a former brother, the Russian Mafia, and finding redemption and hope in places that one doesn't expect to find it. If this story feels different than previous stories, that's because it is different. This story doesn't deal with a new love, rather it is dealing with the aftermath of two love affairs that span nearly 20 years.Before I launch into a full review of UnBeloved, I want to talk about the UnDeniable series as a whole. Only a few books have connected with me in such a way that I want to experience them over and over. The in-depth writing of Madeline Sheehan provokes my imagination and connects me to characters that I never thought I could relate. This series is pioneering because the author has taken a band of outlaws, old ladies, and club bunnies; characters so varied, and gives them each a unique voice. At times their tale is sad and tragic, yet we see humor, loyalty, and undying love. Sheehan portrays their beauty and flaws honestly, never apologizing or pleading with the reader to embrace them. Also trailblazing is that the characters are allowed to age, and it's never been so evident than in this fourth book. Whether or not it was the author's intent, she is breaking new ground because the reader watches as the young, flighty women from the earlier books progress from their 20s and 30s , into their 40s and 50s. *gasp* Book characters having a life and sex after 40; I thought at that age, they were supposed to be lead out into a pasture to wait for the Grim Reaper; never to be seen again in the story.UnBeloved is the story of Dorothy, Jase, and Hawk, and how the actions of each affected not only them, but the lives of their families. If I could only use a few words to describe UnBeloved, they would be ""redemption"", ""forgiveness"" AND ""homecoming"". In UnBeautifully, we saw how their love turned into an F5 tornado, creating a path of destruction for not only them but everyone around them. Chrissy, Jase's wife, was convicted of first degree attempted murder for shooting a very pregnant Dorothy, Dorothy shunning both men and the club, Jase losing his mistress and family, and Hawk leaving his brothers and going nomad. Seven years later, the trio still haven't addressed the carnage left by their love vortex, until an emergency has everyone coming home, and the trio is finally forced to walk through the broken mess, and assess the damage and rebuild. The story begins with Dorothy being called back to Miles City, Montana due to an emergency. Once she is inside the clubhouse, she is informed that one of the Horsemen isn't who he has claimed to be and has been covering up his past. So the entire club is reeling from this betrayal, and also from one of their own being held hostage. In dealing with the dire situation, Dorothy is forced to a day of reckoning, seven years after surviving the gunshot, she has to deal with the issues from her past. Jase is also forced to come to terms with the poor choices made years ago. Instead of hiding from the issues like Dorothy did by moving away, Jase has hid from them inside a liquor bottle. Jase's road to redemption comes from the most unlikely source. When he finally comes face-to-face, he knows that he has to make amends and stop the vicious cycle. Hawk has literally ran from all the problems from the past, going nomad and seeking refuge in the road. Now all the running and hiding comes to an abrupt halt. As in any family, when there is an emergency and the chips are down, everyone comes together, and this MC family is no different.Once again I get to see my favorite character, ""DEEEEEEEEUUUUUUCCCCEEEE!"". What can I say, I've loved him since UnDeniable; even when he was an a-- hole at times. My love for Deuce has not wavered, if anything, it has grown. Deuce is still a force to be reckoned with, and it is never more evident than the scene on the highway between he and Preacher, and when he and Ripper pay a visit to Hawk. Cox and Kami are still fighting as usual, and Cox's humor has grown even more vulgar and dirty, as impossible as that seems. OMG, that one scene had me laughing and gagging at the same time. Eva's influence on the club is evident in how everyone, including the women, views it not as a club, but rather another home. The women have formed tight bonds, and just like the Horsemen being brothers, the gals also have a sisterhood.*******CAUTION BELOW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ****I have to talk about my two favorite scenes: 1. the highway scene and 2. the Vegas arena scene. The highway scene, oh that highway scene, that one is my favorite. Sheehan's writing is pure perfection, from her description of the surroundings to the bantering between the characters, if I felt anymore immersed in that scene, I would have needed to throw on my coat and gloves. The spoken dialogue and unspoken thoughts from each character is profound, beautiful, and insightful. That scene showcases how the men have progressed since the beginning of the series; it's powerful and serene at the same time. The Vegas scene, let's just say that I had goosebumps when Sheehan first walks us through the arena, that scene is dark and scary. I didn't know what to expect. Okay, no more, because I don't want to give away a spoiler......As the characters find reckoning, redemption, forgiveness, and peace during their homecoming; some say a sad goodbye. Like a regular family, sometimes we lose members, and this story is no different: one deciding to take the road that leads to home, one's path taking him to jail where he doesn't pass GO and collect $200, and ZZ's route, let's just call Z's road ""psycho path"", and a couple of bikers that take the journey on that eternal highway through the Harley Davidson's pearly gates. In the words of Dorothy Kelley Matthews ""This is the story of us all...all our fates intertwined, and for that reason alone, pain and death be damned, I wouldn't change a thing."" As for me, I wouldn't miss the ride on a rocky road with this band of outlaws, old ladies, and club hookahs for anything. Vroom, vroom!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVA9ZI4V1J63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9HIR4E#wasThisHelpful","R3BVA9ZI4V1J63","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moments In Time is similar to purchasing or receiving a box of assorted Lindt or Ghirardelli chocolates; you get to sample several different varieties, and there isn't a bad one in the bunch.  The chocolatiers in this anthology are Madeline Sheehan, Karina Halle, Nicole Jacquelyn, Ashley Suzanne, Daryl Banner, and several other talented writers, and the genre ranges from Fantasy to Steampunk to Contemporary Romance.  You cannot go wrong with this book of short stories, PLUS all the proceeds go to the Western New York Independent Living, a nonprofit organization that works with people, young and old, living with a disability, and teaching them life skills that will enable them to take control of their lives.  It's a win-win situation for everyone involved.The first story that I couldn't wait to read is Because You Are Mine by Madeline Sheehan, and it didn't disappoint.  This story involves a  shape-shifter, half human and half wolf, and 100%  hot alpha male wolf.  This story is that one piece of chocolate in the box that everyone fights to claim it first, and I couldn't help, but think of that  piece of delectable chocolate in the image of Joe Manganiello.  I only wish that the story could be developed from a short story into a full novel; I would love to see more Shayanne and Grey.  The Benson by Karina Halle is that piece of chocolate with the center being filled with delicious buttery caramel goodness.  Each story in Moments In Time is delicious, and the wonderful thing is if you get a flavor that you don't like, skip it and move to a different variety:  if you're not a connoisseur of Erotica, move on to Paranormal, Fantasy, Steampunk, or Contemporary Romance.  This book is a treat for readers of all genres, not only should you buy it for yourself, it would also make the perfect gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS97VIM0E57Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KD3W8TK#wasThisHelpful","R1XS97VIM0E57Y","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After suffering from book impotency for a few weeks, I have found my literary Viagra. It pains me to say that I nearly missed reading this book, I didn't think that I could suffer through another college-age-coming-of-age Cinderella story. Thankfully this isn't another Cinderella fairy tale.....it's more like Red Riding Hood meets the Big Bad Wolf. What prompted me to read this were the following lines:""I love you, too. Promise me you'll remember that.""I promise.""""Good,"" he says. ""Because I""m about to f*** you like I don't.""Karissa may be a college-age girl, but her love interest is no boy, Ignazio ""Naz"" Vitale is all man. But this is not the typical student being taught by the master; Karissa is teaching Vitale a thing or two. Karissa is embracing college life, she has no other option, because home is basically being tethered to her paranoid mother. Naz is a .....well, I don't know what exactly Naz is in the beginning, but whatever he does, he does it well. The two bump into each other the college campus, and then later at a club. It isn't love or sex at first sight, but Karissa probably should have paid closer the old adage about curiosity killing the cat. The two end up in a relationship, but the story isn't just about the romance, the reader gets a feeling that there is something more going on, and there is....but I don't want to give away any spoilers.Naz may be leading Karissa down a dark troubled road, but let's just say that she fueled up, bought new tires, and packed snacks for the ride. This story held my attention from the beginning until the last page, it got better with each page turned. The suspense kept building, and it didn't disappoint at the end. The author, J.M. Darhower, keeps Naz cool and dark, unlike many stories where the bad guy turns into a softie once he meets the female, this isn't that story. Naz doesn't lose his dark side when he meets Karissa, because Naz doesn't act cool and dark, Naz IS cool and dark.Bottom line....this is at the top of my list for my favorite reads in 2014. If you are expecting a sweet HEA, this may not be the book for you.....but if you like a story with a trip on a bumpy and curvy road, doing 95 mph while blindfolded, this might be your book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQF1YYHUZFRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZCLV4S#wasThisHelpful","RIQF1YYHUZFRN","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Don't you know that?"" In UnDeniable, Crazy Frankie made the statement to Eva ""I can't sleep without you, and I can't breathe, baby. I can't f****n' breathe. "".4. Break to Callie: ""Tell me,"" he whispered, ""do you want it hard, or do you want it slow?"" In UnDeniable, Deuce to Eva: ""You want it hard, baby?"" he whispered, ""Or you want it slow?""5. In one instance, Break says ""She's not for the club, she's mine"". Deuce made the statement ""She doesn't belong to one of my boys. She's f****n' mine"".6. In a rape scene, Break is forced to watch, and Callie finds salvation during the act by staring into Break's blue eyes. In UnDeniable.....ditto.....same thing.There are other similarities, but I've made my point. My review is harsh, but I hate when someone steals another person's ideas and hard work and tries to profit from it.I can't even bring myself to call Kate an author, Kate is a copy-cat and an opportunist; she is not a writer. I want to call her a plagiarist, but she changed just enough words that the statements aren't verbatim. Sadly, this isn't the first MC book that has attempted to copy ""UnDeniable"", but it's probably the worst-written semi-plagiarized version. What parts that Kate didn't ""borrow"" from UnDeniable, were poorly written.Here's an idea, Kate and to others that want to create a succulent dinner by stealing Chef Gordon Ramsay's recipe (aka Madeline Sheehan's book) and calling it their own: go watch Paula Deen on The Food Network (aka take a writing course), then practice with your own ingredients (aka your own words and story), and then when you've worked hard enough and come up with an original recipe, host a dinner party (aka publish your own book). In the meantime, if you want a book that is equivalent of ordering a pink-slime burger through a speaker and being asked ""Would you like fries with that?"", this might be your book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXGGPEOOTHTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ5G56K#wasThisHelpful","R3OXGGPEOOTHTS","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was excited to see that this romance involved mature adults, and a ready-made family.  However, I was not prepared for Josie to speaketh dowdier than a PBS Downton Abbey marathon.  Why?  Josie was born and raised in the U.S., am I to believe that Josie picked up this speech pattern from her surroundings?  The word ""untoward""Josie is an assistant to renowned fashion photographer, ..... you know what, I just can't.  I want to write an accurate review, but the bottom line is that the Josie character is ridiculous.  Josie speaks as if she found a time machine in 19th England and transported herself to the present time.  Josie is written to appear clueless and stodgy at times, such as her irritability if she eats dinner at an different time, being frugal and saving her earnings, and being in love with her employer for 20 years;  lives in his guest house, travels all over the world, but doesn't convey her feelings.  Then there are times that Josie is written to appear worldly and trendy; close friends with designers, rockers, and such a sexual prowess that a one-night stand with a famous hip-hop artist, that left him  in love with her.  Josie doesn't have any children or experience with children, but that doesn't stop her from resolving all the teenagers issues:  from romantic interests to mending the children's relationships with their parents.  All the men in Josie's life are in love with her, I don't know of one male mentioned in the book that wasn't smitten by the sex kitten Mary Poppins.The is the 3rd consecutive release from Kristen Ashley that has left me disappointed.  After reading so many rave reviews, I thought for sure this was the book that would help me forget about the other two books, Kaleidoscope and Broken Dove.  Alas, I wished that I had skipped the reviews. and saved myself from this untoward book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXJU46W1O17M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYIF9FW#wasThisHelpful","R2EXJU46W1O17M","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was elated when I discovered that the follow-up to Crow's Row, Scare Crow was released, and couldn’t wait to download the book. It has been over a year since I read Crow’s Row and awaited the follow-up, which is a decade to a reader. I’m a patient reader, I never want to rush or place stress on an author to finish a book; it’s his /her story to write.My best description for this book is to imagine that you are hungry, absolutely starving, and a driver shows up to take you to a restaurant. She takes you on the most beautiful and scenic route, and then you discover that the road is actually a dead-end street, so then the driver takes a different road, and again, the scenery is as beautiful, but then you discover that it’s another dead-end street. The same scenario keeps playing over, another decorative route that doesn’t lead to the restaurant, and finally you decide that you’ll settle for any restaurant, it doesn’t have to be the one that you were anticipating. You no longer care about the scenic route; you just want to get to a destination. That’s how this story felt to me.Julie Hockley’s writing is beautiful; I don’t know any other way to describe her meticulous flow of words. Ms. Hockley’s exceptional skill of depicting character and their surroundings pulls in the reader; I was immediately drawn into the story. However, around 80 pages, I began feeling that the scenes that I had read didn’t lead anywhere. I didn’t understand the importance of Emmy working in the admissions office, and initiating a plan that would allow her to see information about Cameron. In the end, all she ended up was the address of his mother; the same address that she visited in Crow’s Row. I also couldn’t understand Emmy’s financial situation; in one scene she is scared because she is unemployed, yet she isn’t making any effort to attend school to keep her scholarship from being revoked. Emmy is worried if she can’t pay rent that she will be homeless, yet she has the cabin that Cameron owned. In one scene, Emmy shows up at a bank with information of an over-seas account written on a wrapper, and when the bank personnel can’t help her, unlocking the codes to obtain the account is shelved for a later time. If I thought I was close to being homeless and unemployed, decoding the information to gain access to a potential boatload of money could be important. However, I’ll give Emmy a pass since the love of her life is deceased. Emmy’s desire to remain in that broken-down shack is another aspect that I don’t understand. In one scene, she discusses how she isn’t close to any of the other tenants, that she doesn’t really know them; yet, when Griff show up with money, she can’t bear the thought of leaving her roommates or her closet of a room. Then there are all the details that went into describing the cartels, their families, and connections; so much of it was unnecessary information. The Canadian woman who Cameron supports wasn’t relevant to this story, and it was just one of many details that didn’t really pan out or contribute to the story. Also, I would love to know how many times the name “Meatball” is written; I’m a animal lover, but towards the middle of the story, I was wanting more Cameron and a little less Meatball.I will say that the scene in Canada was absolute killer, Hockley’s account of the brutal and vicious events was fantastic; Hockley didn’t romanticize Cameron’s role. Hockley kept to the raw savagery of an underground crime boss, and didn’t sugarcoat Cameron’s activities. Let’s talk about some Cameron; his character has changed, and to me it wasn’t for the better. I understand how he missed Emmy, I loved that he missed Emmy, but I felt that he grew a vagina when he lost Emmy. Cameron reminiscing about Emmy’s 16th birthday party and all the details, it was too wimpy for me. A huge thumbs up for the depiction off Spider and Carly. The couple has changed since they were living at the Farm in Crow’s Row. Carly is now showing the effects of living in the criminal world, her presence is bleaker; the couple’s relationship with Cameron is strained. Cracks are beginning to form not only with the couple, but inside the crime family as well. Trust is beginning to waver, and they are at each other’s throats.Towards the end of the book, the story began moving at a rapid pace, and then BAM, the book has ended. The events towards the end of the book would have been better suited in the middle of the book and more time dedicated to those scenes. I thought that the book was packed with unnecessary fillers; scenes that didn’t impact the story. I felt that the author didn’t know where to take the characters.Julie Hockley ‘s writing skill is so creative and profound, one of the best that I’ve seen in any author, but the storyline/plot wasn’t there until the very end.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNK30ZBYMXQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMLB0PW#wasThisHelpful","RUNK30ZBYMXQB","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mud Vein is the story of a woman who wakes up one morning to find that she has been kidnapped and left in a house with a man from her past.  Senna/Brenna and Isaac are forced to cohabitate in a cabin in a rural area surrounded with an electric fence.  They have no idea who has kidnapped them, but Senna knows that all the clues point to her past, and so she revisits her past to find the kidnapper before time runs out.I like the basis of the plot, two people who share a past, kidnapped and brought together, where they must work together to figure out a way out of the cabin or the person behind the kidnapping. Someone has stocked enough food and fuel for the generator to keep these two stranded in the cabin for months, so the reader knows that the kidnapper has been plotting this revenge for awhile, but figuring out who and why isn’t so easy.  However, about mid-point in the book, I realized that I didn’t like Senna enough to even care if she made it out alive; I kept reading because I was curious as to who the kidnapper is, and I was also holding out hope that that I would feel a connection to Senna before the story ended.  I felt Isaac’s pain and grief from being separated from his expectant wife, and his character was likeable and the reader could feel a connection.  Senna/Brenna’s communication is very short and choppy, she often answers a question with a question; she is a recluse without any friends or family, and doesn’t seek contact with anyone.  I see Senna struck with some terrible incidents when she relives her past, but she was a one-woman island before these events occur.The abduction turns into many months, with both characters giving up hope at different times, and taking turns saving the other.  Throughout the months, Senna is still revisiting her past, trying to piece together all the clues in the cabin.  There are many clues, however, sometimes the clue is so hidden or vague that it makes no sense why the kidnapper even used the clue because it is unrealistic that the Senna would grasp or recognize it.  After examining Senna’s past, it is a guessing game of which character is responsible for their abduction:  mother, father, wife, or ex-boyfriend, etc..  Both characters come very close to death, which led me to think that this was done by a love-interest-gone-wrong from either Senna’s or Isaac’s past.  But when the kidnapper is revealed, the plot loses me; the kidnapper had access to indoor cameras, and could see all the suffering and near death, yet didn’t intervene.  It would have been different had this been a revenge kidnapping, and also at the end, Isaac reveals a decision that he made that could have resulted in him being released, yet he didn’t seize the opportunity.The bottom line is that I liked the beginning plot, it had me on the edge of my seat; I liked Isaac, and there were times that I liked Senna, although I couldn’t connect with her.  But as the story progressed, the clues were so inexplicit that it was unrealistic to imagine that Senna would figure them out.  When the kidnapper is revealed, and also that the kidnapper had access to watch them, I had to ask what is the purpose in allowing them to suffer and/or die?  (It’s hard to not give any spoilers, but I’m trying.)This book is a testament to the progression of the author’s writing, I think she is evolving and striking out into a different genre, and that’s a big plus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R237PL333L249X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHVUQ70#wasThisHelpful","R237PL333L249X","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I only had to wait 2 weeks for Sempre Redemption because I was late to the Sempre party and only discovered it two weeks ago.  I enjoyed Redemption even more than Sempre.  The story grew beyond the love between two teenagers and morphed into a bigger story;  the love that a father has for his son, deciding loyalty between the  bloodline family and La Famiglia, sacrifice, forgiveness, and redemption.  If you need your characters to be black and white (good/bad), stop here, don't proceed, don't download this book because the characters are drenched in grey. If you need a story where the h is saved by the H and the two of them can overcome all obstacles on love alone, go fetch a different book from the Romance section because this isn't going to be that book.  If you want a story filled with erotica and hot angst sex, don't even look at this book.  If you want a book that has twists and turns, bad guys doing good deeds, good guys doing bad deeds, love testing the bonds of loyalty, then you want to read Redemption.Sempre ended with Carmine giving his loyalty to the Mafia in order to find Haven.  Redemption picks up with the Godfather calling for Carmine to come to Chicago and fulfill his lifelong commitment to serve the organization.  Carmine knows that he can't renege on his vow, but he knows that he can't bring Haven into a life filled with crime.  Carmine has to choose.  Vincent has fought all his life to keep his sons out of the hands of ""The Family"", but even he can't protect Carmine from that life now that Carmine has given his promise in order to save Haven.  Corrado...Corrado...dang...let's talk some Corrado.  Corrado is a hitman for the organization, but he isn't just any ole hitman, Corrado may be a murderer amongst other bad things, but he is a stickler for rules.  Doesn't matter if it's a Mafia brother or blood family, the rules of the organization must be followed or Corrado will dish out the punishment like a lunch lady serving two-day old baked ziti:  hard and cold.  No excuses.  As much as Corrado hates the organization at times, he knows that he has given his oath to serve, and he makes sure that the rules are followed so that his crime group succeeds and isn't engaged in war with other Mafia factions.  In other words, even if you're family, you serve with loyalty or face Corrado.  No one....and I mean NO ONE wants to be on the receiving end of Corrado.  Then there is Haven.  Haven's world has been sheltered from the rest of the world, but now she is thrust into the world, and she has to decide whether to sink or swim...her choice.  But it isn't easy considering that she was former slave and never had the privilege of choosing.Redemption is about choices and freedom.  Both don't always go hand-in-hand.  Carmine took a vow to the serve the Mafia, but was he really free to do it because of Haven being kidnapped.  Later when Carmine makes choices to give Haven her freedom, he doesn't realize it, but he actually limiting her freedom and taking away her options.  Carmine once a free man is now enslaved by the Mafia.  Haven, now has a new life, but is it one that she chose or one that someone chose for her?In Sempre, the author gave us the story of two teens finding each other and trying to find a place in this world together against odds and bad people; in Redemption, the author gives us not only the two teens, but the people trying to help them find their place.  Redemption shows us betrayal, hopelessness, and hate, but we also get to see undying love, ultimate sacrifices, loyalty, and most of all...redemption.Bottom line:  Sempre Redemption....You were worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q46T8ESEVRIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMDPZVK#wasThisHelpful","R2Q46T8ESEVRIS","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Surviving Raine, and I'm probably in the minority, but I rated it a 3.5 stars.  For me this story could have be dubbed Travis Maddox  in Castaway,  with the role of Wilson being replaced by Raine.  I went into this story with high expectations, but it fell short for me.  The story is told from the male's POV; Bastian has similar characteristics as Travis Maddox and Remy.  Bastian is aggressive and possessive towards Raine, he can't seem to control his temper and he is very much an a**hole.  He has a very shady past, a retired underground deathmatch fighter, but now Bastian is the alcoholic owner/captain of a ship.  Did I mention Bastian is an a**hole.After his ship sinks, Bastian and Raine are survivors in a small lifeboat out in the middle of the ocean.  Bastian starts out as the leader in charge, but his alcoholism leaves him weak and vulnerable, as much as he doesn't want to accept Raine's help, he has to lean on her in order for them to survive being lost at sea.The book has some good plots and twists, but I couldn't get into Bastian's character.  Another underground fighter that enjoys the company of wh**es and prostitutes, he can''t control his temper, has the power to snuff out four men threatening Raine, is possessive and jealous of anyone that comes in contact with Raine, is that sounding familiar at all?  Did I mention that he's an a**hole.  I understood his a**holiness when they first became passengers in the life boat, it was a stressful time, but all through the book, the same scenes were repeated, he knew she didn't deserve his rudeness, yet he would still say rude and vicious words to her.  Just because you admit that you're being an a**hole in  your head, doesn't make it okay to keep being an a**hole.  I also tired of hearing how his male body part (Amazon won't let me use d***) jumped whenever he thought about her, and how he didn't deserve her, several repetitive scenes.If you love Travis and Remy, then  Surviving Raine may be the book for you.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NEI3M6BKT5MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWG930S#wasThisHelpful","R2NEI3M6BKT5MJ","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just added this book to my 2013 favorite books list, I finished Sempre this morning and this story took me by surprise. Sempre is like that unknown horse that no one has heard about, yet wins the Kentucky Derby. I can't believe that it wasn't recommended to me prior to it being on sale last week, and if I had to choose one book to recommend out of the dozens that I've read over the past few weeks; Sempre is my Secretariat. Sempre isn't a flashy story, it isn't about a billionaire, it isn't erotic, it isn't about perfection, it isn't black and white; it's a lot of grey that includes good people doing bad things, it's about risking it all for the one that you love, it's about hope, and it's about surviving. There was so much suspense and intrigue, that I simply couldn't put the book down until I finished it. If you are looking a book with the most passionate love story ever told, pent-up sexual angst, and the good guys walk on the right side of the law, do not download it, in fact, don't bother reading anymore of this post because this book isn't for you. Sempre is several genres rolled into one; it's a YA at times but deals with very adult issues at other times, it's a love story but instead of erotic, it's a love story filled with sacrifice and hope not just between a couple, but between a parent and child, and amongst a family.Sempre tells the story about Haven, a 2nd generation slave, and Carmine, the son to one of the most powerful mob members. Carmine is the usual narcissistic wildchild who changes because of his love for Haven. Haven isn't the usual damsel in distress though, she has nothing, she wasn't born with any rights to strip from her. Haven's life has been hell and sheltered from the rest of the world, and even though she is scared and unsure when thrust into a new world, she does whatever is needed in order to survive, and has hope that life will get better. Carmine's father is a high ranking member of the mob, and even though he has sworn loyalty to the mafia family, he wants his son far from the mob life, even if he has to sacrifice Haven.Sempre is a tale about beauty found in an ugly world, hope blooming from despair, betrayal to protect the one that you love, gentleness from the ruthless, sacrifice from the callous, and it's about surviving when everything you've known is gone. If you have $1.99, go place a bet on the thoroughbred called Sempre, because this one is a winner.**********SPOILER*********SPOILER******SPOILER********One question has been bugging me, after Haven was kidnapped, why didn't the doctor track her GPS immediately instead of waiting a day or two?","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OK4DE3RNI1CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBVFWC#wasThisHelpful","R1OK4DE3RNI1CH","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lost Souls is a novella in The Holy Trinity series, although this series was originally planned to be a trilogy, the author gives us this novella before completing the final installment in the series.  Although The Lost Souls is being called a novella, it could be considered a book, and it doesn't disappoint.  TLS continues in the tale of a Gypsy clan trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world after a plague of Skin-eaters have destroyed most of the human population.  The clan are descendants of Romanian gypsy clans and although they have lived in the U.S. for many generations, they still have traditions and rules from the Old World; women don't have a say in marriage, and outsiders are not welcomed.  We learn in the two previous books, The Soul Mates and My Soul To Take, that gypsies caravan and move around often is so that outsiders don't learn that they have white magic.  Gypsies are gifted with a special white power, that power comes in the form of four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. There is a fifth element, power of spirit, but that is only possessed by the most powerful Roma or Gypsy, who also have the gift of the other four elements .  We were left at the end of My Soul To Take with Gerik turning into a dragon because the dark magic had taken over after his predestined soul mate, Trinity, had married Xan.  Trinity wasn't aware that she and Gerik had shared souls in previous lives, and she didn't know that she was predestined to share souls again in this lifetime.  Before Gerik became dragonized, he was able to unite with Trinity and pass on to her powerful white magic she was destined to possess.  Although Trinity was now more powerful than the Skin-eaters and clan members, she was dying from loneliness. Xan, finding out that Trinity was still alive, and she thought that he and the clan had abandoned her, left the clan in search of Trinity.  Xan finds Trinity at the end of the second book, but she is no longer the wife that he last saw.I was excited when The Lost Souls was released, I wanted to see how Xan and Trinity reunion was going to play out.  The love triangle between Xan, Trinity, and Gerik had been gut wrenching because there were two hot Gypsies in love with one gal.  One had loved her and shared the same soul in previous lives, and the other had loved her immensely and Trinity had reciprocated out of free will, not because she was fated to love him.  Now with Gerik out of the triangle,  I would get to see Xan and Trinity united again.  WRONG!!!  The author, Madeline Sheehen, changes course with this novella, this is no longer the Trinity/Gerik/Xan show.  The background characters from the first two books: Hockey, Shandor, Marko, Becki, Nico,and others, it's their stories unfolding in this novella.  It is a gamble by the author that pays off, because at the end of the book, I discovered that I was so caught up with the lives of  these characters, that I didn't have time to miss Gerik/Trinity/Xan.  There is minimal Xan and Trinity, mostly scenes from book 2 re-told, but at the end of the novella, we get a glimpse of the couple and their reunion isn't going the route that I expected.  The reader learns in this book to expect the unexpected.and two things to remember in this novella:  #1.  No one is safe  and #2.  No one is safe.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it was hard to see the demise of some that finally were given a voice in this story, you make that connection, and you get into their heads, and then you gasp as you watch their end.  One thing about this Gypsy clan, they know that their days could be limited, so they don't waste time figuring out relationships, they stake their claim, and have sex.Life is certainly hard in this post apocalyptic world, most of the human population have been either killed or turned into Skin-eaters (Skins).  The majority of survivors belong to the Gypsy clan, because clan members are gifted with some form of white magic that is hidden from the outside world, therefore they are equipped to fight off the Skin-eaters.  Also aiding in the fight is that info has been handed down for generations in the form of stories of how Skins originated, although most thought this was Romani folklore, the Gypsies discover that the centuries-old stories were true.  The Skins originated not because of some disease or government project gone wrong, Skins had been in the making for centuries. A powerful Gypsy named Mullo called upon dark magic to avenge the death of his family and clan, the consequence for his actions was that he would always hunger for blood and never again know peace or life without suffering.  Lore has it that Mullo is still alive, and the only way to break the spell of being a Skin is to kill Mullo.  The number of Skins is now so great that they are running out of food, both humans and animals; Skins are trying to survive, just as the humans are doing.  Shandor is unlike the other Skins, he was a Romani gifted with the power of fire, and to his surprise, he still has the gift of fire after he morphed into a Skin.  Perhaps because of that power, Shandor has maintained some piece of his soul, and works toward influencing the members of the Skins clan that he rules over to become more humanized or in control.  Shandor prefers his clan to eat animals over humans, he is in love with Tahyra, the Skin that he dethroned to take over as the Skin clan leader, and unbeknownst to him, Trinity's sister. Shandor's remaining piece of humanity could facilitate the eradication of  the human population even faster, if he trains Skins to emulate human behavior, Skins may be harder to spot.  That remains to be seen, just speculation on my part.  I have to throw out there that the sex scenes between Shandor and Tahyra are barbaric, animalistic, fury-filled, and HOT!!!  Seriously, if I got a companion like Shandor, I might consider becoming a Skin.Marko redeems himself from his bad behavior in book 2; in search for Trinity, he saves a Gaje, a non-Gypsy girl.  Marko ends up on the receiving end of Trinity and Gerik's souls and vast knowledge.  He has no idea what he is suppose to do with the power and knowledge, but he finds his way back to Trinity's camp, with a pregnant girl and two extra souls in tow.Hockey was separated from his group on their last raid, it's been months now, he isn't sure that anyone is still alive, but he is trying to work his way back to his clan and wife, Becki, while trying to survive the Skins and some evil humans.  Becki remains at the Gypsy camp, not sure if Hockey is still alive, whether she is married or widowed.  Life at camp isn't easy for a female because it's a man's world, and women still don't have a voice in marriage. But since it's a post-apocalyptic world, Becki doesn't let something like she may or may not be married stop her from seeking out another's bed.  But since marriage candidates are dwindling every day, Becki finds herself once again voice-less and being forced into another marriage.  Nico is desperately in love with Becki, who may or may not be married, and recently gave birth to a baby that she admitted wasn't fathered by Hockey. As we all know desperate times call for desperate measures, and Nico does just that to be with the woman he loves.I thought that The Soul Mates referred to Trinity/Gerik or Trinity/Xan, but now I suspect that the title could reference Marko/Carrie and/or  Shandor/Tahyra.; these couples have found soul mates in each other.I eagerly await to see the final installment because I desperately want to see what happens to Gerik now that he is a dragon and soulless, will Xan manage to help Trinity retrieve her soul and obtain forgiveness, will Shandor remain just a powerful leader of Skins or will he find a way to track down Mullo, and the fate of all the remaining players.Excellent series, this is the first paranormal/science fiction-fantasy series that I've follwed.  I'm not usually a huge fan of this type of genre, but Madeline Sheehan has made me a fan.I'm not sure how to rate this novella versus the first two books in the series; it is shorter than the other two books, and it doesn't have quite the meat of the other two books.  But it is being marketed as a novella, instead of as a book, so I'm giving it five stars vs. 4 stars if it was being marketed as a book.  The Lost Souls  provides an insight as to what is going on in the lives of this Gypsy clan and building up to the finale, while providing historical info on the Gypsies and Skins.  It is a fantastic read, and I recommend the series to everyone, even if you think that you won't enjoy the science fiction/fantasy/paranormal genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38CDXYYBKGKTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GG855LY#wasThisHelpful","R38CDXYYBKGKTN","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to take Karina Halle's ""Bold Tricks"", roll it in batter and deep fry it in a vat of butter and Crisco, then chew it up so that it goes directly to my thighs, and that way I will have a piece of Ellie with me forever because my cellulite ain't goin' anywhere. This book just rocked my world, I loved it, and Karina gave me one of my favorite female book characters. Ellie is part ""Kill Bill"" and part Lisbeth from ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", she's the most intriguing character that I've seen in.... I can't tell you how long. Heck with the alpha male, this alpha chick trumps the men in this story. Ellie holds her own; she's not only capable of saving herself, but she's capable of saving all the alpha males in this series. If you are looking for a sweet romance with the wholesome female and the alpha male; just walk on by, don't stop here, don't peek in. Ellie isn't innocent, she's a con artist, she's a damn good con artist, but she really didn't have a choice being born to con artists parents that made Joan Crawford look like Carol Brady. If giving us an alpha female wasn't enough, Karina then throws in the alpha nerd, that's right, the alpha nerd. For once the nerd is pushed around once too much and instead of falling on his face in defeat, Camden comes out fists swinging and serving up gun power, and BAM taking on an entire cartel to save his girl.Love doesn't come easy in this series, especially when one is in love with the leader of a drug cartel, and Ellie has deceived others for so long that she no longer knows who she really is or who she can trust. In the middle of this cat and mouse chase with bullets flying all around, she finds out who she truly is, or maybe she decides to become a better person, but Ellie discovers that she isn't as bad as she thought she was.Halle breaks all the rules in this series, there's a little bad in everyone and a little good; you find yourself still loving the bad boy even though you know you shouldn't. The ending is brilliant, I love it because there was zero predictability; lots of readers love predictable or hate change, so brace yourself.In case you aren't aware, this is the 4th book in The Artists Trilogy series; a novella and two books precedes Bold Tricks. 5 huge-bold-flashing-in-the-sky stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B057O7YRQ0MY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG8ZYA4#wasThisHelpful","R1B057O7YRQ0MY","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gritty tale of the Hell's Horsemen Motorcycle Club just got grittier, the dirty  became dirtier, and the WP  got wilder.  UnAttainable is the 3rd book in the UnDeniable series by Madeline Sheehan, and just when you think that the ride couldn't get bumpier or more surprising, Ms. Sheehan revs up the engine and you best hold on.Before I continue my review, let me just state if you are expecting an MC that sells legal merchandise and hates prostitution and drugs, please allow me to point you to Colorado, because in Montana, that ain't how an MC operates.  I've read reviews on the first two books in this series with comments such as ""there was too much violence"" or ""none of the characters were likeable"", does everyone understand how many of the REAL motorcycle clubs operate, look up Hell's Angels and the Bandidos.  Now, that we have this out of the way, are you ready to hop on the back of Deuce's bike and take that ride for the 3rd time?This story may be Tegen's and Cage's story, but it has plenty of Deuce, and I love it.  Deuce has evolved, and he's getting older.  But this story shows us pieces of Deuce that no one else knows, some of the Horsemen may know bits and pieces, but not all of it.  Deuce loves his boys, and not just his boys, but their families too.  OMG, Deuce taking care of Dirty and the others when they were boys, but especially Dirty, does things to my heart. Deuce has went from a life of bedding club nasties to keeping his MC ran like a fine oiled machine, he takes on all their problems.  But Deuce is still Deuce, and he's not always going to be perfect...thank goodness.  His relationship with his son, Cage, reminds me of a younger Deuce, the one that kept messing up his relationship with Eva, and like the younger Deuce, just when you think he has it figured out, he messes up again.Cage is as much like Deuce as he is so different from Deuce.  Whereas Deuce knew that Eva was the one as soon as he saw her, Cage doesn't figure out the one for him for a long time. In between figuring that one out, he does a lot of fooling around...A. LOT.  The scene where he visits Preacher and finds all the old photos from the past, it was a riveting nostalgic moment.  We see pieces of Deuce and Eva from her first visit to Montana, and we relive Frankie.  Cage's beauty is part of his downfall, it makes women easier to obtain, but it also made them disposable to him.Tegen, all she wants is to put her feelings for Cage and the MC as far behind as she can.  Tegen spends so much time reminding herself that she is the opposite of Eva and Danny, and sensitive that she doesn't fit in with the beauties at the MC.  What Tegen doesn't see is that she has a strength far greater than Eva's and especially Danny's, and in the end, she is actually more MC than those two.Now let's get down to the good stuff.SPOILER......SPOILER......SPOILEROh hell fire and brimstone...no more are the gates opened.....and BAM...here Sheehan hands the reader our first surprise....Z-freakin''-Z....ZZ...are you kidding me?!?! My second surprise, I wasn't expecting to like Tegen, by the end of UnB, I wanted someone to shut her loud crass mouth, I didn't care how, just shut her blasted trap.  Just a few pages into UnAttainable, and Tegan causes a lump in my throat with her feelings about Dorothy and feeling abandoned. Cage and Tegen are an example of how the author's writing has evolved. The characters are grittier and more complex than in the two other books.  I swallow the lump, turn the page, lo and behold, that lump that Tegen gave me is pea-size compared to the fist that Dirty has shoved down my throat.Dirty is killing me, and I don''t want Dirty killing me, I was in this story for Cage, Tegen, and hot angst sex; Dirty wasn't suppose to matter to me. He is chipping away at my heart a little at a time, and melting each individual chip. It would have been easier if the author just ripped my heart from my chest, sprinkled it with cheese, melted it in the microwave and then pour it over chips, and have a pile of Slittified Dirty nachos. I wasn't prepared to see this side of them, I expected sex, feckedupness, and badassery. I don't ever cry, NEVER-EVER, now I have a box of tissues, and I just want to cradle him and take care of him. I swear if Sheehan turns him into a murderous killer, I will defend him and nurture him until death.At 51% into the story, and my heart is beating as if I jogged 5 miles after 12 cups of coffee and 3 lines of coke. Stuff is hitting the fan because the club went into lockdown, and Cage and Danny just found out about T & ZZ, and then Ripper just blurted out my 2nd favorite line thus far ""Does Dirty need a new name?"".I've finished the book, and I cried, and I cried hard over Blue and I cried even harder when Deuce had a heart attack. Deuce....Cole ""Deuce"" West.... he had a heart attack, super heroes don't have heart attacks. There is a formula on how to create the perfect HEA, but no, this author had to be different, she had to show the vulnerable side of Deuce, show that he wasn't perfect, and then she let Cage be a a junkie, for heaven's sakes, members of MCs are clean-cut do-gooders that work with Habitat for Humanity and build houses for the homeless. Bikers aren't suppose to be hard-core bad-a** like Hell's Horsemen, they are suppose to pretend to be bada**es, sober, and monogamous. Madeline Sheehan took the cookie cutter biker mold and raped it with machete and then used an AK 47 to pump holes into the remaining pieces, then dug a hole and buried the leftovers. Sheehan had to be original, and instead of giving us faux bada**ery, she gave us raw, dirty, and gritty bada**ery. She had to write characters that we couldn't love 100% of the time, no, instead she gave us Dirty. When I wasn't wanting to cuddle him, I was flinching from his admittance of dosing women, then I went back to wanting to fix him. Instead of letting Cage be the golden boy and saving the MC from illegal acts, she wrote him as having doubts, hangups, troubles, and flubb-ups, lots of them. Tegan, what the heck, doesn' she know that heroines don't sleep with more than 2 guys in a book, are well-mannered, perfect bodies with a large chest, and wearing Jimmy Choos. Sheehan was suppose to follow the blue-print so that 12% into the book, I knew which characters were going to be together and live HEA. No, she had to be original, make my insides feel like they were being ran over by a Peterbilt, remind me that stuff happens in an MC, that bikers aren't perfect and they aren't always the perfect criminals. And they age, they don't stay 25 for an eternity, and they consume too much salt, and they have heart attacks. Madeline Sheehan made them REAL, and REAL isn't always pretty and perfect. I felt so many emotions, and not just the good vibes ones; love, hate, disgust, shame, healing, protective, pissed off, scared, worried, hope, and compassion. All of these in one book. Madeline Sheehan, be proud of your achievements with UnAttainable, you knocked this one out of the ballpark.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R116NCYUII275U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBZH7C8#wasThisHelpful","R116NCYUII275U","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's been nearly a month since I read UnBeautifully, or should I say devoured UnBeautifully.  I downloaded it as soon as it went live on Amazon, I read it until 3 am woke up at 5:30 am to go to work. It was worth every second of sleep that I lost, it was worth much more than that.  During this month, I have read many other books, but they cannot fill the hangover from UnBeautifully.  I once referred to Madeline as the Charlie Sheen of the literary world, but I stand corrected; Madeline Sheehan is the Pablo Escobar of the literary world and her readers are the Charlie Sheens , she gets her readers addicted and leaves us craving for more.  Maybe someone will establish a rehab center or a 12-step program to wean us off our addiction.I think there are two types of readers for this series: you either hate it or you love it.  No middle ground.  I understand why some readers hate UnDeniable and UnBeautifully, because Madeline Sheehan forces the reader to make a choice.  Most of us envision the good guy/hero as law abiding and almost perfect.  That doesn't work with this series because these characters don't live in a 4b/2ba house, with an accountant father, and the mother is a Girl Scout volunteer.  These characters were raised in a violent world, one without stay-at-home moms and where fathers make their living transporting drugs and guns.  So when you begin reading these books, you have to decide whether to cross the line; do you remain in your world with your safe assumptions and defined rules about love and life, or do you cross over the line into their world and leave all of your rules and judgment behind?  If the reader decides not to cross, he/she isn't going to enjoy these books.  The ones that jump over are rewarded with a story weaved with characters unlike any that I've encountered before.  I must warn you though, that once you cross over, you can't go back to the way you were before.  The books and characters that you love before now become one dimensional and boring.  The book boyfriends that caused you to swoon (you know the educated, makes a billion dollars, and dresses his lover in Prada and Jimmy Choos), that book boyfriend will feel like a middle school crush.  You will no longer be looking at the man dressed in the Armani suit, your eyes will be focused on the man in a cut and wearing leather.  I remember when I had to decide in UnD whether to cross over, I looked up and there was Deuce staring at me from the other side, then he grinned, and I found myself hopping on the back of his bike and riding out the story with him.  I never looked back.Madeline Sheehan broke a bunch of rules with this series, she didn't give us a love story, she gave us a story.  She didn't give us a hero/heroine/bad guy, she gave us many characters, characters that are flawed, and when I say flawed, they are ******-up flawed.  Somehow Sheehan made their flaws and vulnerabilities appeal to the reader, the characters became even more desirable and loveable.  This band of outlaws see their own flaws, and they don't stop trying to fix them.  It isn't an immediate fix either, it takes Deuce years to get to a good place with Eva.  Just when he passed one hurdle, I felt myself wincing again over another ***-up, and hoping that Eva didn't give up, or hoping that he didn't give up on Eva.UnB is the story of Danny and Ripper, and like UnD, the book isn't only about the couple.  Both books are weaved with different characters and we witness how the action of one can cause a ripple throughout all of their lives.  Ripper has changed since his introduction in the first book, this is post-Frankie Ripper.  The previous fun-hearted playboy is now saddled with scars and anger, lots of both.  Ripper is still a member in Deuce's MC, but almost everything and/or everyone has changed somewhat since UnD.  This book could have been titled ""UnFrankie"" or ""Life After Frankie"" because the after effects of that maniac is felt throughout this book.  Even the characters that never met him, such as Danny, still feel the repercussions from Frankie's existence.  But these characters are survivors, they may not be polished and refined, but they do what it takes to survive, and they find beauty in places where others cannot.  This is what makes the characters so different than the ones in other books.  Remember in the Crossfire novels when Eva said that she and Gideon needed each other like air and couldn't exist without each other, this isn't that kind of story.  These characters don't cease to exist when they are abandoned by their lovers, they keep breathing, they don't throw in the towel, they try to fix themselves, and learn to forgive each other, and I'm referring not to just the couple, but also the brotherhood and the families.  And those flaws that I keep mentioning, well those flaws, they become scars, and as Ripper explained, those scars tell the most amazing stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQR2W5CX0XW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRJNH9I#wasThisHelpful","R1GQR2W5CX0XW3","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I devoured the first two Crossfire novels, I mean devoured them, I couldn't put them down until I was finished reading them.  I waited impatiently for this 3rd book to be released, then I saw the ridiculous  price, I decided that I would wait, but curiosity got the best of me.  I downloaded the book on Tuesday, and when I was 11% into the story, I was soon wanting the bedroom scene to just be over.  I was so bored that I didn't bother picking up the book until Thursday and not finishing it until Friday.  I'm not against erotica, but it was tiresome to see the sex scenes repeated over and over.  For any reader that has read the first 2 books, we already know that Gideon is well-endowed, we don't need the same descriptions of how thick it is, or that it spurts a lot. We get that, we've known that since Book 1, what we didn't know was how the Nathan incident was going to pan out, and apparently it wasn't important enough to resolve in this book. There are so many sex scenes and so few scenes with other characters.  Her father's visit was over very quickly, and the outcome of an incident that occurred during his visit was pushed aside.Bottom line, the sex scenes are fillers for this book so that the issues and plots from the first two books can be dragged out to complete the next two Crossfire books.  Other than Eva feeling more secure in her relationship with Gideon, very little has changed.  Cary is still dating both Trey and Tatiana, Corinne still mourning for Gideon, Eva's mom still trying to track her, and Brett is still harboring feelings for Eva.I hope that the publishers are happy with my $10 for this book, because it is the last dollar that I will spend on this series.  The book being just mediocre isn't what angers me, it's the greediness.  I also think that the book was filled with sex scenes so that there would be enough material to finish the next two books. Most readers wanted to see the how the twists and plots from Book 2 would end, they were barely addressed. This series went from being one of my favorite to being a series of sell-out and greed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HT8H272ZLWK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UCJ7KO#wasThisHelpful","R1HT8H272ZLWK3","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edited from original review: It's been a month since I've read this book, one whole month, an entire month that I've spent trying to get myself wrapped up in other books, but only to find myself still thinking about ""Undeniable"". Now I know how Deuce felt when he was with Miranda, but was still thinking of Eva. When a book is that good, and you're still feeling withdrawals a month later, and biting your nails hoping that the author will show mercy and have an early release of the second book in the series, ""Unbeautifully"", it deserves more than a 4.5 rating, ""Undeniable"" deserves 5+ rating. I only wished there was a book rehab to help me fight this book addiction, it isn't fair to all the other books that I've downloaded and ignored over the past month.***************************************************************************************************************4.5 Stars Before I get started let me just explain that this isn't your ordinary love story. In order to understand this love story, you have to take everything that you know about love and relationships, sweep it into a dustpan, empty into the garbage disposal, turn on the garbage disposal. This isn't going to be that kind of love story, because Eva, Deuce, Preacher, ZZ, and Cage aren't our kind of people. They don't live by our rules, they live in a society where drugs and other illegal activities bring home the paycheck, a world where wrongdoings will get you in the ground instead of jail, they have different rules for a lot of things, including love. This story contains violence, sexism, rape, and illegal activities, the characters are primal, they like to curse, they have double standards for men and women, and they like using 3-4 word sentences . But like I said, this ain't our world, it's their world, their love story, and their rules.""I don't remember the day I was born, but I remember the day I found out why.His name was Deuce.He was my ""why"".And this is our story.It is not a pretty one.Some parts of it are downright ugly.But it's ours.And because I believe everything happens for areason, I wouldn't change a thing."" --Eva Fox WestDeuce meets Eva when she's five, at Rikers Island, both were visiting their incarcerated fathers. Deuce was twenty-three. Okay, get your mind out of the gutter, it didn't go down like that. Eva did leave her handprint on Deuce's soul that day, but their love tale didn't unfold until years later. ""I am Preacher's little girl. And I'm going to be just like him when I grow up. I'm gonna have a Fatboy, but I want mine to be sparkly and I want a pink helmet with skulls on it. And instead of being the club President, I'm gonna be the club Queen, cuz I'm gonna marry the biggest, scariest biker in the whole world and he's gonna let me do whatever I want because he's gonna love me like crazy.""Another thing that sets this story apart from others, is that Deuce isn't a young millionaire, you won't find his pic on the society page, he doesn't give millions to charity, he doesn't date debutantes. Deuce is the president of motorcycle club. He likes to hang out at his club with his boys, they like to ride, drink beer, and fornicate...a lot. Deuce is eighteen years older than Eva, and their story doesn't unfold over night, it unfolds over years. His mistakes with Eva are fueled by his passion for her, it's raw and he doesn't know how to deal with it. Some of the dumb stuff that he does would have caused me to plead with any other lead female to dump his sorry behind, but like I keep saying, their world is different than ours. One thing that bothered me about Deuce is that he gave a speech twice about respecting women, yet he's threatened to slap a couple, and he didn't treat Eva the way that she deserved. Towards the end, Deuce steps up to the plate, especially with Ivy.Miss Eva Fox, what a character. I was shocked to learn what she did when she returned from Montana (it's so freakin' hard not to write a spoiler), and I wrote her off as weak. But as events unfold, I come to see that she was more than Preacher's spoiled daughter, she held that m.c. together. Eva did things that I didn't understand, but I realized that I'm in a different world than hers, Eva took care of stuff. She wasn't a princess, because a princess waits on the King or Prince Charming to show up, Eva was a Queen and took care of stuff herself. When Eva hit rock bottom, she hit rock bottom hard, and it was paining me to see how far down she went. In the end, I saw Eva as the strong one, but for the life of me, I cannot understand the way that she dealt w/ the Frankie situation.If you are looking for another multi-millionaire-playboy-meets-virgin-falls-in-love-and-lives-in-a-penthouse-HEA, then this isn't your story. But if you want to see a love story filled with many mistakes, regrets, obsession, primal fear, and lust; one where the love is so wickedly strong that it burns a tattoo in a lover's mind, then you've found your story. ""If you were older darlin', I'd have you on the back of my bike and in my ****in' bed and you'd be not just likin' it, but lovin' it., beggin' me for more.""One last thing, I didn't understand, Kami referring to the club house women as the ""w"" word, pot meet kettle. That girl was straight up cray-cray.Bottom line, I loved this book, I didn't think that I would or could, but I had to remember that our lives are so completely different than this band of outlaws. I'm a vanilla cone, they are Jack Daniels waffle cones sprinkled with tattoos, Harleys, and leather cuts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E86YH0OK8EMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009N539DS#wasThisHelpful","R1E86YH0OK8EMM","A3A8OY4G0CKC7W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A8OY4G0CKC7W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love Pull-Ups both for potty training and for the 'I can do it myself' phase where little ones love to put their clothes on (and take them off!) all by themselves.The cooling sensation when wet does help alert little ones when they've gone, which is nice.  Most diapers just whisk all that moisture away, which is great, but it does make potty training harder.The only negative thing I can say is I sometimes find leaks when Pull Ups are worn during naptime or overnight.

"*First of all, I wanted to give a heads up that this seat is made to fit oval or oblong toilet bowls, not round toilet bowls.I think this seat is a fantastic idea and I love using it for our daughter.  For some reason she has always disliked using a kid's potty, and even the kids removable toilet seat.  She wants to use the potty just like big people do I suppose.  So this is perfect because she can sit by herself on the big potty without needing a lot of extra support.  I like that the lid closes slowly and doesn't bang.  The light is interesting.  When you push the button it stays on for 7 hours, and it illuminates the back of the seat and also the water in the toilet bowl so you can see it easily.  The seat was also easy to install, not much more complex than a regular toilet seat.I would recommend this to anyone with young children and anyone who prefers to use the bathroom in the dark at night and could use the lighting feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFAWTZHL8CBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKSRHPS#wasThisHelpful","R2GFAWTZHL8CBL","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bottom line: This seems like a great range extender, but it hasn't been working for us, due to a problem with interference in our house.The good thing I can say is that it was really easy to set up.  Setup took a half hour or less.  The instructions were very clear and accurate.It seemed to work well for about one day and then stopped helping us.  We have one area of the home on the 2nd floor where we can't get a good signal.  We've tried another range extender to solve this problem and it also stopped working after about a week.  We had a technician come to the house to try to help and he couldn't figure out the problem.  The same thing happened after this extender was installed, except it only worked for a day.  I think there must be something in our house that is interfering with the wi-fi signal.  It does seem to help when the extender is shut off and turned back on, at least briefly, but then the signal cuts out again.I'm giving this 3 stars because it seems like a good product, but I think there is something else going on that is interfering with the signal.  I will update my review if/when we figure out the issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SEUDNAF94I36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S6RYUY#wasThisHelpful","R1SEUDNAF94I36","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried a lot of different brands of diapers over the past few years, and these diapers have been one of the most consistently reliable brands I've tried.  Little Snugglers are soft and don't seem to irritate or give diaper rash.  They rarely leak, and they seem to stay in place and conform to baby as baby moves around.  Sometimes I have chosen other brands just because they are cheaper, but buying Huggies on Amazon in a larger case like this is not too expensive, and I love the convenience of home delivery.  Also signing up for Amazon Mom gives an even bigger discount on these.  Whenever possible, I choose Huggies diapers because they have consistently been my favorite over the years.

Most of my daughter's baby doll's faces are a bit creepy, to be honest (the ones that are supposed to look like very little babies).  This one is beautiful, and almost looks like she did when she was tiny.  The face is pretty, realistic, and not at all creepy.The doll is small, perfect for toddlers and preschoolers to carry around.  My daughter likes trying to take off the hat and put it back on, and she loves giving her the bottle.  She even tries using the bottle herself and sharing with the doll.I wish they didn't make it baby powder scented because I have some allergies and sensitivities to smells, but so far I'm not overly bothered by it and I know it will wear off with time.Bottom line is, this doll is small and cuddly, and very attractive to look at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N814YYI95W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFREGMA#wasThisHelpful","R39N814YYI95W","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really, really nice stroller tote.  And I've come up with other possible uses for it too.  It can be hung on a stroller with the velcro straps, but it can also be hung in the car on the back of a seat, by putting the tabs around the headrest supports of the seat in front of you.  It can also be used on a shopping cart, so young ones can use the tablet or smartphone while in the cart, and keep wipes, bottles, snacks, etc at hand.You can detach the holder for the tablet, as mentioned, and the tablet and smart phone can be used while underneath plastic.  It is a little more difficult with the plastic there, but you can still swipe and push with your finger through the plastic.  So it protects tablets and smartphones somewhat, from being dropped or from liquid or sticky fingers.  And with the hooks attached it prevents them from being dropped too!There's only one problem I can see.  It has two velcro straps, but otherwise no handle.  A removable handle would be perfect for carrying the tote to the shopping cart, or in and out of the car, or when it's not attached to a stroller.  It is not easy to carry when it's full, and not connected to the stroller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV8406B12QS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSA2OK#wasThisHelpful","R1KV8406B12QS6","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, I had recently been having problems with pull ups leaking, particularly overnight or over nap time.  So I was afraid to keep using pull up diapers.

"Recently our family has used both Scott and Charmin, so I can compare this Panda bath tissue to both of those brands.  The Scott brand we've used has 1000 sheets per roll and is 1 ply, very thin.  This Panda bath tissue is 2 ply, much softer and thicker than Scott.  It is not quite as soft as Charmin, but just as thick and doesn't seem to fall apart as easily as Charmin.  You also don't need to use as many sheets per use as you do with Scott.  However, the Scott 1,000 sheets per roll does last longer.  We seem to use these Panda rolls up very quickly, it seems like I'm always changing the roll.  I felt the same way with Charmin as well.I would say this is almost as soft as Charmin, for a cheaper price.  This brand is ideal for someone who likes soft toilet paper but are on a tight budget.  Buying in bulk like this saves money, and it is convenient to have a case delivered right to your door instead of bringing it home from the store.  Bottom line is, it is a good soft toilet tissue at a decent price, with the convenience of home delivery.  Make sure you have room to store all 96 rolls, and you'll be stocked up for a while. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23MJMYHVGVBBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011M3LW28#wasThisHelpful","R23MJMYHVGVBBY","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This animal train is very cute.  It plays songs, educates, and asks questions to help children learn.  The train can be pulled by a little one with the attached cord, but does not move around by itself.The animals on the train snap together and can easily come apart, and the train knows which animal is attached.  A child can attach the correct animal in quiz mode when the train asks ""who likes carrots?"" for example.I think this toy is more suited for younger children, I don't' see it holding the attention of a 3 or 4 year old.  My daughter likes it but loses interest after only a few minutes.  Also, the train cars seem difficult to snap together at first, but then when the train is pulled, they can come apart fairly easily too.

Unfortunately mine arrived with a big hole in the bag so some of them fell on the floor before I realized that.  But I decided to let my daughter 'test' the ones that fell on the floor for durability.  She stacked them on top of each other and she bent some of them, but they never cracked.  Other plastic cups that we've tried have cracked immediately when they got dented.  So these are definitely more durable than other cups we've tried.The size is perfect for adults, it gives you a nice big serving.  It's convenient to have 100 of them delivered to the house too, instead of buying several smaller packs at the store.

"I tried this product after getting back from vacation.  On most vacations I eat a little bit too much of the wrong foods and don't drink as much water as I usually drink when I'm home.  So I usually come back from vacation a little bloated and have to get myself back into a healthier way of eating again.  This product does help with that.  There are capsules to take before breakfast and with lunch and dinner.  There's also a powdered drink to have before dinner.  It didn't taste great, but it was okay, I was able to tolerate it.The first day I didn't notice much but days 2 and 3 I noticed I was using the bathroom a lot more.  It definitely helped me lose a few pounds by helping shed water weight and get rid of backed up waste.  I didn't notice too much reduction in appetite, although after the powdered drink mix in the afternoon I noticed less appetite for an hour or two.For most people, this product alone isn't going to make you lose 10 pounds or more, but it does help shed a few pounds and reduce bloating by a little bit.  I think this is ideal for coming back from vacation and trying to lose the vacation weight and get back into a healthier way of eating.

"I love Hyland's Chamomilla and have used it with my daughter ever since she started teething.  Teething was really rough for her, it bothered her greatly and she would be agitated and irritable until the tooth popped through the skin.  Chamomilla really seemed to help her, it didn't take the teething symptoms completely away but it definitely 'took the edge off' where I could tell if I had given her Chamomilla or not.After she was done teething, and still now to this day, I give her Chamomilla sometimes when she is cranky from being sick, or when she is stressed out in new situations - anywhere that causes her anxiety, and it definitely seems to calm her down a little.  There's no side effects either, which makes me feel so much better about giving her a dose.She also likes taking the dissolving tablets, they must have a good taste, and they melt away instantly so there's no choking risk.I would recommend these for any parents whose child is going through teething or just for irritability and anxiety.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4F9453DAXOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EPQ482#wasThisHelpful","R3L4F9453DAXOC","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long, fine, wavy hair that I can choose to wear either straight or wavy/curly.  Because it is still warm and humid here, I've been wearing my hair wavy/curly.  As I was testing out this hair dryer, I realized this dryer is absolutely perfect for blowing out your hair to wear it straight.  The dryer is super powerful with a very strong flow of air.  It is so powerful I had to put it on the lower setting to keep some of the curl in my hair.  The diffuser attachment is great for getting nice curls as well.If you often use a dryer to blow out your hair, making it smooth/straight with extra volume, this dryer would get it done in record time!I like that it is lightweight and easy to hold, and an attractive color.  I tested out both heat settings and I did not feel like the high heat was any hotter than my last hair dryer, but it is hot enough to get the job done.  I also used the cool button which works well.If I wanted to be picky, the only negative things I could say is that it is a little too easy to push the buttons on the dryer while using it.  I accidentally changed the setting on the dryer a couple of times.  Also, I would like if it had a retractable cord - just my personal preference with hair dryers.

"These little Stikbot figures are pretty cool and my daughter loves playing with them!  She's been sticking them on the refrigerator, the washer and dryer, and the front of the stove and dishwasher.  They also stick to the mirrors in her room and the bath tub.The way the figurines are designed, they almost always look like they are in an 'action' type pose, with very little effort.  My daughter does not fully understand the app and the animation effect yet, although she likes to take pictures on my smart phone.  I think she will appreciate the app and the animation feature more in maybe 6 months to a year as she grows.  The action poses make for great animation and I think even some 'big kids' would love playing with it! :)The tripod is a handy gadget to have and is a good size for my iphone, but the larger phones probably would not fit in it.  It's a great way for little hands to hold the phone steady while they take pictures or video.So far my daughter's favorite is the action figures but the whole setup - figures, tripod, and app is a fun package and I think kids of all ages would like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJR23WVCFJB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0363ZW#wasThisHelpful","R3NJR23WVCFJB3","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would love to test the feature where it plays music from my iphone, however the cord is not included for that.  So I have to try to figure out and buy a cord in order to connect my iphone to this product.  I am not sure what cord to buy, however it seems like it might be a dual headphone jack type cord.Overall we are pleased with it, I'm a little disappointed that there is no card included to connect iphone/mp3 player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ALJDXJCKWPDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H35AUKU#wasThisHelpful","R2ALJDXJCKWPDB","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have some food sensitivities, and we were having some friends over who have even more sensitivities than I do.  I made these cookies the allergy free way, with coconut oil instead of butter.  I also added in a little bit of honey.  I wanted to add chocolate chips but needed to keep them dairy free for our friends.They were easy to make, simple enough that my young daughter enjoyed helping me make them.  I made them in bar form instead of cookie form, I simply had to increase the baking time.They came out very nicely.  We all tried them and they are okay as they are, but I think they would be better with other things added.  For instance, these would be great as a crust for a fruit tart or an apple crisp!  I also think they would taste better if I added chocolate chips to them, or even raisins.  Just by themselves I think they are just okay.  If I could make them all over again I'd make them as an apple crisp with maybe some whipped cream or cool whip on top - it would be ideal for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A4LNHOXR7ZB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOX1FO#wasThisHelpful","R3A4LNHOXR7ZB6","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch definitely has the Wow Factor.  It is large and shiny and catches the eye, but in a classy way not in a gaudy way.  My husband said it felt really heavy at first compared to his last watch, so it took time to get used to that.  We also had to shorten the band a lot for him to wear it.The watch has a lot of features, we like the display showing the day of the week as well as the date, and the secondhand/chronograph features are nice for using as a stopwatch, which he does occasionally.We both found the manual included to be a little confusing because it is a general manual made for several different models of watches, and it is difficult at first to determine if what you are reading applies to your watch or a different watch.Some of our favorite features are the water resistance - it seems to be water resistant up to 330 feet.  My husband's job involves water and he sometimes gets splashed and even has to work outside in the rain at times, so it's great not to have to worry about this nice watch getting ruined in the water.Another great feature of this watch is the ability to see at a glance what time it is in another time zone - or even one other time zone specifically.  So this watch is great for someone who is away from home, out of the country perhaps, or for someone with a close relative or friend who is far from home.  You can set up the watch so that you always know what time it is where your loved one is, or what time it is back home.I would recommend this watch for anyone looking for an attractive watch that is water resistant and with a number of great extra features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FE6NP3DNNOFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XOT3T4#wasThisHelpful","R1FE6NP3DNNOFE","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I think of weight management dog food, I think of dry kibble that my dog tends to ignore.  This is different - he absolutely loves it!  Even our picky cat came over to see what this new stuff was.  The can is full of large chunks of formed chicken in gravy.  Our dog scarfed it right down.  The chunks of chicken are large but soft to chew and I think even medium sized dogs could easily eat this.It seems like it could get expensive to feed our dog only this food every day, but I think mixed with dry kibble every day would be do-able and should help him lose a couple of pounds.  So far he seems to think he's getting a treat. :)  I also like the convenience of home delivery instead of buying it at the store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPHTQG75OEJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSEL8K#wasThisHelpful","R3JPHTQG75OEJC","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These postcards work very nicely with our Canon laser printer.

"My daughter recently started school for the first time so I am on the lookout for possible lice.  I wanted to have this kit on hand in case of an outbreak.  I prefer to use natural or homeopathic remedies for myself and my daughter first, and save the chemicals for last resort.  I like the preventative spray and have been using it on her hair after a bath (a light spray or two), but I will save the rest of the kit for a future lice outbreak and hope I don't need to use it.

"First of all, I'd like to say that my daughter LOVES this doll.  We told her that she could feed the doll and she immediately began feeding the baby the doll food that's included.  It feels a lot like play-doh.  You can use the shapes included to make the play doh into fruits and vegetables to feed the baby.  A fake juice box is included.  The doll does not drink, only eats.  She says a lot of things, either in English or Spanish.  You turn her on by pushing her wrist.  She chews her food and the food is supposed to fall down and come out in her diaper.  Two diaper changes are included.However, as a grown up I have to admit that this doll stresses me out a little bit.  My daughter took off the diaper and the 'play doh' food fell all over the carpeting.  When she ran around with the doll, little bits of food were falling out all over the place.  It was stressful for me to try to pick up all the food before it got ground into the carpeting.  My daughter picked some of it up but she did not see all the little pieces.Also, when she chews the food sometimes it sticks in her mouth and does not come out, it gets stuck in there.  There is an opening in the back of her head, you can open it with a screwdriver, to get out any food that gets stuck.  Well, I didn't feel like opening up her head all the time so I stuck a piece of plastic in her mouth to get the food unstuck.  I don't think you are supposed to do that but I did it anyway.Bottom line is, this doll is very cute and my little girl LOVES feeding her!  She really really likes the toy but it's kind of high-maintenance from an adult point of view, picking up the bits of food that fall out and cleaning the food that gets stuck in her mouth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UOIQIZAN2Z7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4W9W#wasThisHelpful","R2UOIQIZAN2Z7E","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best feeling toilet paper we've ever tried!  We normally buy those 1,000 sheet per roll toilet papers, and you have to use a lot of it.  You definitely use less toilet paper with this Charmin, however, the rolls do not last us as long as the 1,000 sheet rolls.Years and years ago we stopped using Charmin because we had trouble with our septic system and the septic service advised us to change our toilet paper.  I'm happy to see that this Charmin is septic safe and breaks down more easily now.If we end up having any septic problems I will come back and edit my review but so far, so good.I like the convenience of having the toilet paper delivered to the house instead of hauling it home myself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ26JX0ZFHU8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YMVI49W#wasThisHelpful","RQ26JX0ZFHU8O","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is delightful, adorable, and my daughter just loves it.  It's small in size, about the size of a toaster, and if you are creative, you can fit all the included food and accessories inside the oven for storage.  So it saves space - which I love.  The oven door is on the front and there are two burners on the top.  The accessories include a 4 piece pizza, 3 piece french bread, 2 cupcakes, 2 plates, a frying pan with an egg, and a spatula.This makes lots of noises and says lots of things.  There's lots of chatter and songs about cooking and also a lot of counting worked in.  There's a button for music and the numbers 1 through 5 on the front - your child can move the lever between 1 and 5 to make the oven say different things.  When you put something on the burner it makes a sizzling noise.  The food snaps together and comes apart which builds motor skills and encourages counting.We don't have space for a full kitchen toy set in our home but this oven does a lot in a small space, and it holds my daughter's attention.  I would recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R51DYZCQKV6Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1O76G#wasThisHelpful","R51DYZCQKV6Q5","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I like that they come with envelopes included, one less thing to worry about buying, and I can print the cards and envelopes all at once if I choose.The thickness is okay, not too thick and not very thin either.

"Recently I had nail tips on my fingernails, and when I took them off, they left damage to my nail beds - some rough patches and ridges that weren't there before.  I was looking forward to trying this nail care kit to help fix some of the damage.It was easy to use, right out of the package.  I didn't really even need the instructions.  It didn't work right away, but I removed and reinstalled the included battery and there was a red piece of plastic in there that fell out.  After that it worked well.There are 3 attachments - filing, buffing, and shining.  There are 2 speed settings.  I used all 3 attachments on my fingers and my toes.  I didn't like the filing attachment as much, but I did like the buffing and shining attachments.  The filing one worked well for my toes, but on my fingers it felt too rough, it was hard to file my nails without hitting the skin on my fingers which didn't feel great.  On my feet however where my skin is tougher it was fine.This is a convenient tool which makes filing and buffing go quicker, and I did like the way my nails looked afterwards.  Of course and emery board and some effort works really well too.  If you have trouble reaching your toes to use the emery board by hand, this would probably help a bit to get to all your toes.Bottom line is: this works, but some people are going to prefer just using an emery board, which is cheaper and simpler.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UT0ZLXO3J5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013IEGI1Y#wasThisHelpful","R6UT0ZLXO3J5O","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"***NOTE*** I had to edit my review and take this bath mat down to 2 stars, because after only one use and one trip through the washer and dryer, there are 3 small holes in this bath mat!  I washed it in cold water, with a load of towels, and dried it on permanent press which is a more gentle setting.  I don't know what happened, but I don't feel like I can use it now, with the holes in it. ***Original Review:Our bathroom is gray, white, and purple, so I was excited to try out this purple bath mat.  Our old bath mat is getting faded from washing and using and this one is a nice vivid pop of purple color.  It feels great on your feet when you step out of the shower.  It is easy to wash and re-use.Personally I feel like the 17x24 inch size is a bit too small.  Our old bath mat is bigger and gives more coverage from dripping when we get out of the shower.Bottom line is I really like the function and color, I would just prefer the bigger size.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMO2UU5QP0NL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTU52O#wasThisHelpful","RFMO2UU5QP0NL","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, once it is apart it takes a while to put back together.We had this set up for at least a week before we had to put the track away because company was coming, but my daughter still likes to play with the car and the remote on the floor by themselves, so that is a play option as well.We really like this racetrack toy and I'm thinking about buying a second car for the track.

"This mop is really nice from a space-saving perspective.  The separate buckets fit inside each other and the mop goes on top, so it takes up very little closet space.  This is very nice for us because we live in a small space.The mop and bucket were easy to put together, and it's easy to learn how to spin the mop.The one thing I do not understand is the claim that is made that the 'clean and dirty water are kept separate'.  This is not true.  As soon as you rinse your mop after the first use, the clean water is now dirty.  I tried many times to figure out what they meant by keeping the water separate - I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but no.  It doesn't really work that way.Also, if you are doing a large area, you will have to refill the clean side and empty out the dirty side several times.  The mop is so absorbent, that it sucks up a lot of water from the 'clean' side.  And then when you spin it that water goes in the dirty side.  But after a few times the clean side is empty, and the dirty side is so full that you can't spin water out of the mop anymore without emptying it.  I mopped our kitchen and bathroom with this and had to change the water one time.  Not too bad, but they aren't big rooms.  I was surprised how quickly I ran out of water.Overall, this mop is okay and works well for us.  I like the space saving design, but I don't like the misleading statement about keeping water separate and I don't like changing the water so often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24E5QR50KPAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0KU2V8#wasThisHelpful","R24E5QR50KPAV","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These bottles are a very classy off-white color that goes with any decor, and works for either boy or girl.  They work well and seem to cause less gas bubbles than other bottles due to the vent holes on the bottom.Another thing I noticed about these bottles is the nipples are more thick and strong and seem to last longer before they get holes in them.  They hold up well even when baby gets teeth. :)We have the larger 9 oz size and this smaller 5 oz size.  These little sizes are nice for carrying in your bag 'on the go' and can even be used as baby's first sippy cup if you like.I also like that the bottom and the top come completely off for cleaning purposes.  You can even sterilize them in the microwave by filling the bottom with water.  The lid also doubles as a measuring cup.

"This doll is adorable, and absolutely perfect for my daughter - who loves to take things apart and put them back together.  Yes, she has to ask for help sometimes because the buttons are too hard for her occasionally (the arms and legs come apart and together by buttons).  But she likes it.  She also likes taking the hair bows off and changing them.  And she is at the age where she is really starting to love dolls and 'babies' so she likes it simply because it's a cute doll.It's actually larger than I expected, which makes it easier to snuggle and carry around, maybe even fall asleep with.I agree with other reviewers who said that this doll helps build fine motor skills.

"My family and I have been using a surround sound system by RCA, with 6 speakers all around the room, that is at least 15 years old, possibly older.  Recently though, one of the speakers has broken and the sound quality has diminished.  So I was pleased to be given the opportunity to try out this Yamaha sound bar.My husband hooked it up and he said it was very easy, it took him less than an hour.  It would have been quicker except our TV didn't have the right plug in the back so he had to find a way around that problem.The results have been great.  We are very pleased with it.  We all feel that the sound quality is equal to the quality of our old RCA sound system (before one speaker broke).  Is the sound quality better than a new surround sound system with many different speakers?  I don't know.  Maybe not.  But for us, this is perfect, it gives the sound quality we were accustomed to, and best of all - it SAVES SPACE.One sound bar takes the place of 6 speakers around the room and one receiver.  We live in a small apartment and space is precious.  So we get to downsize and just use this one attractive simple sound bar.  There are less wires and cords to worry about too.It is attractive to look at, looks great with the flat screen TV's.  It is a little longer than we realized and actually doesn't fit in front of the TV because of our entertainment center.  So we had to put it above the TV on top of the entertainment center.For us, there is hardly anything negative to say about this sound bar and lots of positive things to say, we are very pleased to have it and would recommend it to anyone needing good sound in a small space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB620477CJMA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTQEZBI#wasThisHelpful","RB620477CJMA5","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is such a great idea!  My little one loves making the cars go down the ramp, and she also likes collapsing the ramp and opening it back up.  I love that it folds to save space and it works great to take to Grandma's house or to appointments, on vacation, etc.It was easy to use, it took me a couple minutes to get the knack of opening it up and folding it up again, but I've got it now.Because it is made to collapse it can seem a bit shaky at times, and once in a while the cars go so fast they fly off the middle of the track.

"These toy hammocks are great for storage, and this one gives you a pack of two of them - for two corners of your kids room or for two rooms.  Since space limited at our house, I love having these around.  They aren't just for stuffed animals, but can be used for toys, bath toys, blankets, towels, pillows, quilts, etc.However, they only come with suction hooks to attach them to the walls, so the suction won't work if the wall is not tile or glossy.  And even then, the suction won't hold a large weight.  However, I was able to use them in our bathroom above the tub for my daughter's tub toys.If you want to hang them in the corner of a drywalled bedroom, you could probably use those drywall picture hanger hooks for the 3 sides but you have to purchase those hooks separately.I received a sample of this product for review purposes, and I'm pleased with the product - I just wish it came with another option for hanging on the wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WG1PSFLVKS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNF72EG#wasThisHelpful","R31WG1PSFLVKS3","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with other reviewers that this shoe organizer is not very sturdy, and also would not hold shoes that are very large.  However, they have been working perfectly for my young daughter's shoes.She needed a good way to organize her shoes, so I'm glad to have this.  Because her shoes are small they do not put a lot of pressure on this organizer so it is less likely to rip or tear.  She doesn't have this many shoes so I can put some toys in the other pockets too.The only other complaint I have is that the hooks that hang over the door fall out easily when you are trying to move this organizer.

"I received this ring in a women's size 7 and it seems to fit very well, true to size.  When it first arrived I was surprised at how lightweight it is, it almost feels like it is made of plastic at first.  But it is very comfortable to wear for a long time and slides on and off my finger very easily.The inscription ""you are my only love"" is VERY tiny.  It is almost impossible for me to find it at first.  But I kind of like it that way, it's like the ring has a secret message on it.I also appreciate that it does not tarnish and is very non-allergenic.The inside has engraving too, but it's not a secret message, it is simply stating that the ring is stainless steel.The ring seems very unisex, would look fine on a man or woman.  I think this ring is perfect for a promise ring when money is tight, or if you are in a situation where you can't wear expensive jewelry.  This ring would be the perfect every day ring to wear.

"This is a very high quality jacket for the price.  My husband could not believe it was only priced at $100, it could easily compete with jackets double the price or more.  We received the Brown Leather jacket size XL for my husband who normally wears size Large, and it fit him perfectly.  This jacket seems to run a bit small, but it could be because it is styled to be very fitted to the body.  If in doubt you should probably order a size bigger.(For reference, I measured the size XL jacket while laying flat.  Underarm to underarm: 25 inches.  Shoulder to bottom: 27 inches  Shoulder seam to cuff: 27 inches  Shoulder to shoulder seam across the top: 22 inches)Other than it running a bit small I have nothing but good things to say about this jacket.  It is heavy and feels like it would provide good protection, there is extra protection built in to the jacket at the elbows, on the shoulders, and on the back.  The lining is great for warmth but easily zips and velcros in and out as needed.There are pockets everywhere!  Some are simply ventilation pockets, others hold small things like wallet and cell phone or mp3 players, etc.  All the pockets are easily accessible from the front, with one hand while driving if necessary.The leather is not overly stiff, it seems soft enough, although I think this jacket will feel even better once it's broken in a bit.  We also like the color - it is dark brown but from a distance almost looks black.  It's a very attractive jacket.I received a sample of this product for review purposes, and we are very pleased with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RZY2NLVQWT48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJATOSU#wasThisHelpful","R1RZY2NLVQWT48","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband was pleased to be able to test this shaver.  He commented on how lightweight it is, and it is easy to grip/hold in your hand without slipping.  The blades flex a LOT and seem to do a good job conforming to your face, chin and neck.He does not like shaving in the shower, but he likes the water resistance because the shaver sits right next to the sink and occasionally gets splashed.  So there's no need to worry when that happens.After shaving his face felt a bit smoother than with his old shaver.The only negatives he felt were the noise - it is a bit louder than his old shaver, and it did leave about the same amount of stray hairs as his old shaver.

"I really like this Otterbox Ipad Mini case so far.  First of all, it looks great, very classy looking, and suitable for men or women.  Second, I like how easy it is to pop your ipad in and out.  I've used an Otterbox case that I could not remove without using a butter knife.  This is much easier to work with.  I like that you can prop up your ipad mini in a lot of different positions.  It took me a while to figure out how to rotate it 360 degrees but I learned and it's quite easy now that I know how.  I like that is is magnetized to stay closed, and I like that the screen turns on when I open the case.  Of course I love the Otterbox drop/shock protection, it gives me peace of mind when my daughter uses the ipad.  Otterbox has been the best brand of cases I've tried as far as drop protection.The only thing I do not like is there is no screen protector included.  So when the case is open, if my daughter drops the ipad, the screen could get scratched.  I can easily buy a screen protector, I just thought it would be nice if one was included with this case as well.Otherwise I have no complaints, I really love this case and will definitely use it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPEMWMKFO1NG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBNTNEY#wasThisHelpful","RZPEMWMKFO1NG","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter was delighted with these when they arrived, but I was slightly disappointed.  They are the perfect size for little ones, and if Mom and Dad use binoculars, all the better - kids will have fun using their binoculars along with Mom and Dad.They are lightweight and easy to carry, and the neck strap comes apart if pulled on sharply, for safety.  There are soft rubber rings around the eye openings to be gentle on little eyes.The only reason I was disappointed was because I did not think the magnification was very good.  It only magnifies a small amount.  I think the key is to remember that these are only a ""toy"" not real binoculars.

They feel well made and good quality when I hold them in my hand, however they are easy to bend out of shape.They come in a pretty blue box and would make a lovely gift for a reasonable price.They would look nice with blue jeans and also with an evening gown, in my opinion.I only have one problem with them - I expected them to look like they do in the main picture above.  However, when they are on my ears they do not 'lay' that way.  They turn to the side, so that the most attractive view of the earrings is actually slightly from the side.

The pictures are bright and colorful, and the language is simple and yet educational.This newest book about China was particularly interesting to me because there is a lot that I don't know about China, so it taught me something too.

"This is a brightly illustrated book that is sure to grab little ones' attention right away.  My daughter was interested immediately.  The book aims to help children understand what being multi-racial means.  The little girl Sofia explains that her dad is chocolate and her mom is vanilla and she and her brother are 'chocolate mixers'.

"This stick on light is a great idea, I love that you can reposition it if you accidentally put it in the wrong spot, and you can move it to another place entirely.I am using it to light up a dark corner of my desk, but I would also put this inside a dark closet or cabinet.  It would make a good nightlight too.  I can think of many possible uses for this.  The black and white design goes with most decor.This uses AAA batteries, and was fairly easy to put together - except I did have some trouble figuring out how to access the battery compartment.  Otherwise it was quick and simple.Now that it is installed, I just tap it to turn it on and tap it to turn it off.  It is very bright.I would recommend this light for anyone looking for a quick and easy way to light up dark areas of the home without using screws or nails or brackets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M1COI59DYF2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5G8XW8#wasThisHelpful","R3M1COI59DYF2K","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been wanting an invisible fence for quite some time so I was delighted to test out this product.  First of all, it would have been very hard for us to install an underground wire on our property due to the placement of the paved driveway - we would have had to dig up the driveway or put the wire over the driveway, neither of which is a nice option.  So I LOVE that this works without digging a trench.  It's also nice for people who rent an apartment and are allowed to have a dog, or for those who travel a lot, because you can take this with you much more easily than a wired fence.Setup was fairly easy following the instructions provided.  We have a large yard but it is a little narrow from side to side so the dog's range does go onto our one neighbor's property a bit.  But we have been working on training our dog to stay off their property anyway, and he listens pretty well - if he is going to roam away he's going to roam to the other side of our property.We do have some sloping on our property and some trees, so we have one or two areas without much signal, but for the most part when our dog reaches the boundary he stops running and turns around, or at least he stops running and doesn't go any further.I think this is a great tool to use in addition to personally training your dog - it reinforces the boundaries that you have already been trying to teach him/her.I also like the warning inside the house that the dog has crossed the property line.  I used to go outside all the time with the dog but now that I have a child I can't always go out with him, so the warning system gives me peace of mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QU04GV3PRZO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU368KQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QU04GV3PRZO4","A2GRDQJ4Z7053K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GRDQJ4Z7053K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros: This cooker was easy to use as a slow cooker. The directions were clear and the knobs are easy to adjust and set up for cooking. Clean-up was a breeze. The ceramic coated slow cooker pot is virtually non-stick and lifts easily out of the heated portion of the cooker to be washed and replaced for further use.Cons: It is almost too big for a family of two. It is set up to roast meat and to be used for baking as you would use an oven. I'm not sure if those features will ever be used, so they may be extraneous features and will have only added cost.In the end, I think this ""cooker"" is a nice addition to my kitchen equipment and I will enjoy using it for large batches of slowly simmered soups and stews or a tender piece of pork shoulder. Last night's Slow Cooker Ropa Vieja (cookinginstilettos) certainly was a good choice.

It is soft but since you aren't sleeping on it, that probably doesn't matter. Seems a little small, so concern would be that after multiple washings, it's going to be tight on the mattress, however since it has to fit under a mattress pad - maybe that's not a bad thing.  Not sure anyone has any major allergies here, so it seems like another step to making the bed more than anything since it's not a mattress pad.

"This is one of those things that ""just works,"" at least once you figure out how to get it going.  I'm very happy with it once I was able to get it set up.Because my Wi-Fi access point is located in one end of my house, there was low signal strength at the other end and on the lower level.  This made it hard to roam around the house and get reliable Wi-Fi access everywhere - perhaps a bit like traveling around with your cell phone and encountering those maddening areas with low signal strength just when you needed it.  Because most of my house is finished, it is very difficult to run ethernet cables to other parts of the house, thus ruling out using wires to put in another access point.  I had considered getting a ""range extender"" of some type, but frankly I have been totally worn out by dealing with all of the problems of managing a home network of growing size and problems, and thus was leery of adding something like this that would likely only add to the complexity.But I decided to give this Linksys a shot.  It seemed simple enough (like so many things these days that turn out to be anything but).  Right out of the box I just couldn't get it to work at all.  The device was recognized by my network, but just wouldn't allow other devices to connect.  The included instructions were scanty to say the least, and the manufacturer's web site offered no help.  Very frustrating!Then I read through all of the other reviews here on Amazon, and found one that mentioned several configuration details that were needed to make it work.  Bingo!  It suddenly started working just as it should, providing a strong Wi-Fi signal at the other end of my house.  That was several weeks ago, and now I've just forgotten that this device is there doing its job.  That is what quality is all about.Since it has been several weeks since I set it up, I don't remember the exact review or instructions, but from memory I think it had to do with setting either this device or my normal wireless access point to use WPA2 (not WPA) with AES (not TKIP) encryption.Once I got it working ... it just works.Update 8/15/2015I had to unplug this device and stop using it.  Why?  Although it did provide increased signal strength in parts of my home and property that are far away from my access point, it also caused big problems.  Although it seems to work fine under most circumstances, every so often all of the wireless devices connected to it would just lose connectivity to the rest of my home network, for no obvious reason.What seems to be happening is every so often this device will start doing strange things in my wireless network.  One symptom of this is that some devices will start reporting IP address conflicts for no apparent reason.  I have used inSSIDer on a laptop to monitor wireless activity, and every so often it shows odd things that come from the MAC address(es) associated with this device (there are several).  This includes MAC addresses such as 00:00:00:00:00:00 and other weird things.I have tried various fixes to this problem, including assigning a fixed IP address to the device, but to no avail.  After a number of my wireless devices just went mute again today, I finally unplugged this device - and the problems went away.This device seems like a good solution to providing broader wi-fi coverage, but it's problematic, and thus I am not using it anymore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M34MG094ETB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20YA#wasThisHelpful","R34M34MG094ETB","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The longer I have this feeder the more I am impressed by it. It is easy to clean and refill and my hummingbirds seem to go through more syrup than with any other hummingbird feeder, thus it is a success from their point of view and mine.With other feeders the bugs, mostly bees, infiltrate the openings and float in the syrup rendering it unusable within days. I have never had a feeder emptied until this one. I just went to clean it and refill it and it was empty, nothing more than a drop of sugar water came out. This has never happened with my clear glass hummingbird feeder nor my beloved Droll Yankee hummingbird feeder. Normally, I have to dump most of the syrup and start over in just a few days due to the aforementioned bug infiltration and also mold issues. This syrup had been in the feeder for almost a week and there was only one tiny spot of black mold in the edge of the basin and not one bug.I conclude that there is something about the red color that filters the sunlight and deters mold and the openings are big enough for hummingbird beaks but not for bugs.I will be getting more of these to surround myself with the beauty of hummingbirds wherever I go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203SD6S3WBJZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9NHRM#wasThisHelpful","R203SD6S3WBJZQ","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read - and enjoyed - the author's earlier book ""Russia Against Napoleon"", I looked forward to reading his account of events in Russia a century later.Unfortunately, either things in Russia became much more dull in that century, or the author's writing style did since his last book, because I found this book to be a difficult read - the opposite of a ""page turner"", so to speak.Perhaps that is because the focus of this book is on the various Russian diplomats and all the details of their arcane political intrigues during the crucial period just before the Great War.  This certainly does provide good additional insights into how things came about during that tumultuous period - mostly from the Russian viewpoint - but for me, it was it was just too much static detail to be enjoyable, and I had to force myself to keep reading.What's good is that the author clearly has done a prodigious amount of new research into Russian archives to expose more of the thinking and details of the Russian diplomats of the period.  I would give that aspect of the book a 5 star rating, but for its appeal and readability for the general reader, I'll go with 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQA3BNB5VT13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025585#wasThisHelpful","R2MQA3BNB5VT13","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After using the pan I simply let it cool, fill it with hot water and let it sit, perhaps overnight. In the morning it cleans easily (like Teflon but better because it isn't).It is large enough to boil pasta, make soup or stew and roast meat but also will do small tasks like poaching two fillets of salmon.It is a heavy pan, so if lifting is an issue you would want to be aware of its weight but it is no heavier than my French copper chef pans and its weight presents no issue for me.Anyway, I've been using it quite a bit since I got it, so that's a good thing.

"Having listened to nothing more than the built-in speakers of my flat-panel Samsung TV, I was eager for an improved sonic experience.  The Polk Audio Soundbar did indeed provide *much* better sound than the TV's speakers (unsurprisingly).  Overall it's a nice product that is easy to set up and use, with a few tiny quirks that are typical of add-on products of this type.  The real question for any prospective purchaser is whether the improved sound is worth the steep price tag.The Good:- Very easy to set up and begin using.  The instructions are minimal - they tell you to connect the audio cord, but just assume that you will also know to hook up the power cords - but what you need to do is simple and logical:  Plug both the sound bar and the subwoofer into power, connect your TV's audio to the soundbar (using either optical or traditional - both types of cord are included), and you're good to start listening although you'll want to perform a few more adjustments after that.- The subwoofer connects to the soundbar wirelessly, which is very nice because it eliminates a cord and allows much greater freedom of location for the subwoofer.- The soundbar was perfectly sized to go with my Samsung TV, and looks good with it.- The soundbar comes with its own tiny remote control, but you can easily train it to respond to your existing remote (at least for volume control).- And the sound is much improved over that of the TV's built-in speakers.The quirks:- By default, the bass volume was very high, so that needed immediate tuning because I don't like house-rattling bass.  But the subwoofer really can pump out the bass if that is to your taste.- The soundbar turns itself off and on automatically when it senses a signal from the TV's audio.  When you turn the TV on, this can take several seconds, leaving an uncomfortable period when you wonder if something is wrong with the audio.- You'll want to turn off the audio on your TV's built-in speakers so you can enjoy what this unit can do.  But at least on my Samsung TV, doing this causes an annoying on-screen message saying ""Function not available"" every time I press the volume control buttons with the TV's internal speakers disabled.  This not Polk's fault, but an example of some of the quirkiness that happens when you mix products from different manufacturers together.Overall I'm quite pleased with the Polk Audio soundbar, but I'm not sure that the amount of improvement in audio quality is worth the price of the unit.  But if you do value good sound, you might have a different opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BAIKWYSMLQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O16236I#wasThisHelpful","R25BAIKWYSMLQP","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've relied upon my wonderfully lightweight and durable Oreck vacuum to keep my carpets clean for 15+ years, but have only used outside services to shampoo them.  Being very overdue for another shampoo, this new Oreck Revitalize seemed like it might be the perfect solution.When it arrived, I spent 2 minutes unpacking and assembling it, and a few hours later had carpets that were visibly much cleaner than they had been in several years.  I was amazed by the amount of very dirty water that accumulated in the dirty liquid tank, and was very happy to pour it out, knowing that all that muck was no longer in my carpets.So the Revitalize accomplished my objective, but I did have a few difficulties with it along the way that you should be aware of:* You need to follow the directions very carefully, especially with regard to technique you use when moving the unit back and forth over the carpet.  In particular, it is very important to make a ""back and forth"" pass while applying the liquid detergent (or water rinse), then immediately make another back and forth pass over the same area to most effectively let the unit suck up the applied liquid.  This is because the liquid is applied as a mist that will quickly (in seconds) evaporate or soak into the carpet, thus preventing you from sucking it (and the dirt) back up.  Don't be tempted to apply liquid over a larger area and then come back even 20 seconds later to pick it up - because you won't get much.* The tank that contains the dirty liquid that is picked up from the carpet has a filter screen in it.  You *must* keep that screen clean at all times, or the vacuum pick-up action will be greatly reduced.  It is very easy to pop the tank off and remove any carpet fibers that accumulate.* If any of your carpet is shedding fibers to any degree, this unit won't work very well if at all, mostly for the preceding reason.  The carpet in one of my 3 carpeted rooms is like this, and was a near disaster.  This unit has some pretty effective scrubbers that pulled up significant amount of loose fibers that plugged the filter over and over, plus permeated the the whole scrubbing and pick-up system.  Obviously that piece of carpet now needs to be replaced, but the Revitalize was almost defeated by it.* Dealing with the preceding item caused me to learn that this unit is (mostly) very easy to clean out and wash up after use. All of the parts except one short hose come off to allow them to be washed out so you can put the unit away in clean condition.  The only difficulty is that the main plastic pick-up unit is held in by 2 small Phillips-head screws that need to be unscrewed and refastened every time time you need to wash out that particular part.  Besides needing to find a screwdriver to do this (the only time you need any kind of tool), those screws are easy to lose when washing the part (I almost lost one down the drain); it is very likely that those screw heads will be stripped before too long; and having to unscrew and refasten the screws all the time was the most annoying aspect of using this unit.  If Oreck had used fasteners that were larger and could be worked with just your fingers (something like wing-nuts), it would have been much better.* Although it carries the Oreck name, this product subjectively does not seem to be of the same quality and durability as my trusty 15 year old Oreck vacuum.  Maybe that is OK, since I don't expect to shampoo my carpets nearly as often as I vacuum them.  I haven't checked, but it is also possible that new Oreck vacuums have changed over the years as well.  And unlike this Revitalize unit, nowhere on my vacuum does it say ""Hecho in China.""* Don't expect the Revitalize to produce the miraculous ""clean paths"" through dirty carpet that you see in commercials for carpet cleaners - and even on Oreck's web site for this unit!  That is not what happens, and is overly-dramatic to the point of being false advertising.  This product *does* pick up a lot of dirt and *does* make your carpets cleaner, albeit in a less dramatic fashion, so Oreck should skip the drama.Despite the foregoing items, I am generally happy with the Revitalize, and my carpets are too.  Recommended.By the way, the Revitalize was *so* easy to use that even a man could use it!  And did, at my house.  :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YVUK78PQPG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFMXWN6#wasThisHelpful","R4YVUK78PQPG5","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this book fascinated me, so I had to read it.As a child, I was raised in one of the major churches that preached revealed religion via ""faith"" (i.e. just believe what you are told), but as I matured I became an agnostic because I simply could not accept what I had been taught as a child.  I have remained uncertain about how things came about in the Universe, and how it could have just ""happened,"" and could there be a god.  This book seemed to offer a possible answer, so it intrigued me.This book provoked a variety of thoughts and emotions for me, thus I judge the book a very worthwhile read.I fully admit that I did not (and still do not) grasp all of what the author is trying to say, so I need to read it again.  I can't say that about very many books.Some of the author's ideas are fascinating, while others I reject.  I will leave other readers to decide for themselves on these, and won't attempt to review all of them here.One of the ideas I liked the best was her description of ""god"" as an ""emergent"" phenomenon.  Perhaps I don't get out enough, but I was not familiar with the whole concept of ""emergence.""  But now that I have been introduced to the concept by this book, many (non-religious) things are much more clear.  Simply put, an emergent phenomenon is one that is literally greater than the sum of its parts, e.g. a living organism is composed of unthinking atoms that individually just obey the laws of physics, but when aggregated into a human body, a totally new and wonderful thing emerges - somehow.  The author's premise is that god is also emergent, which is quite interesting.  I am still trying to decide if I buy this or not, but I *am* still thinking about it.Overall, the author firmly believes that the laws of physics do apply everywhere, and that ""god"" must also obey them.  So if you don't agree with that, some or most of the book will be a tough sell.  But she makes a convincing case that this might be true.Perhaps my only disappointment was that if ""god"" truly is an emergent phenomenon, that still does not explain ""the beginning.""  But perhaps god did not create the universe.  Perhaps there never was a beginning, and just an endless circle. More to think about.None of this can be proven or disproven, but at least here we have a coherent body of thought that doesn't rely upon blind faith in a revealed religion of some type.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MH92R92BBL50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807073393#wasThisHelpful","R1MH92R92BBL50","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that I got this just for the novelty of being able to take infra-red pictures.  Years ago I experimented with infra-red B&W film in my camera, so I wanted to play around with the modern - and MUCH better - equivalent.Taking pictures of my dog, spouse, and kids was fun, with the resulting false-color pictures interesting to everyone.Then I starting looking at what else it could do.  I found two very useful things:1. It showed weak spots in my house's insulation.  Almost like having X-ray vision, it showed where many of the rafters and studs were, which was merely entertaining.  But then I found some unexpected cold spots in the wall that I had not been aware of.  These turned out to be places where insulation had settled or been disturbed, several of which I was able to make better as a result of knowing where and how bad they were.2. I have built some ""quiet"" PCs in very small cases, and have been concerned about adequate cooling of the components.  With this device, I was able to immediately see which components were hot and roughly how hot, and how that changed with various configurations of internal components and cooling fans.  That helped me come up with arrangements that ensured better cooling, promoting longer component life.So - the device that started out for me as a toy turned into a useful tool.  That I still enjoy using as a toy as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y557CQ4LR1EX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYWABAA#wasThisHelpful","R2Y557CQ4LR1EX","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wooden figurine set is attractive to my grandsons who are ages 3.5 and 2, each for their own reasons. The almost 4 year-old loved setting up the village and felt an attraction to the wooden figures thanks to an animated show on television whose main characters actually resembled the village pieces including the knight and the dragon. He was beyond delighted when he realized he could also set up his wooden railroad around the village and run the train around the perimeter.The two-year-old was much too young for the set, or so it seemed to me. His delight was in knocking it down as fast as the 4 year-old could build it including the railroad track that surrounded the village. All of the sturdy pieces survived the rough treatment and I know in time the two-year-old will enjoy playing with it as much as he did tearing it down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193QXJHNHOZN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTWW6MG#wasThisHelpful","R193QXJHNHOZN0","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this book was a mixed bag. Perhaps that is because it is presented as series of essays, each of which addresses some topic related to the Civil War, but that don't all support the book's subtitle of ""Why the Civil War Still Matters.""  Much (too much?) of the book keeps coming back to slavery; the better parts give us some insight into what Lincoln had to deal with; while some other chapters are anecdotal looks at a few very specific characters such as McClellan and Farragut.While reading the book, I kept expecting to finally come upon the answer to why the Civil War still matters, but I didn't find it.What I did find:* Some quite interesting glimpses of how very different things were in the 1860s.  At one point, Lincoln, Seward and Hay *walked* over to Gen. McClellan's house, waited 90 mins to see him only to find out that he had gone to bed without seeing them, and then the 3 of them walked back to the White House.  Can you imagine any of that happening today???  What a different world.  I enjoyed reading some of those tales of how different things were in the past.* A constant emphasis on slavery by the author, to the point where it becomes the over-arching topic of the book.  Of course, the existence of slavery was a significant political issue in the 1850s and 60s, but my amateur understanding of the era was that states' rights was the primary issue.  Slavery was not illegal at that time, and only became so during the war, and not totally because of just the moral issue.  The author spends some time discussing without totally dismissing, the incredible thesis put forth by some others that the slaves themselves did (or could have done) most of the heavy lifting that led to the abolition of slavery, which totally devalues the efforts of the 750,000 Americans who died fighting over this issue.* Most of one essay goes on and on with author's disagreement with Mark Neeley's ""The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties"", who he repeatedly takes to task on a variety of points.  I get it - the author doesn't agree with Neeley.  Next chapter, please.* Some other insight into a general political observation that when whomever those in power veer too far away from the center, it often provokes an opposite reaction from others, as though Newtonian physics also applies in politics.  (It's too bad that our current and previous president don't understand this - if they had read this book and got this message, our country would be much better off that it is today.)* Related to the last item, one realizes after reading this book just how much profound political disagreement and polarization there was in the USA in the middle of the 19th century.  As we reflect on how polarized things are becoming today, perhaps we should realize that extreme polarization led to war in the past.  The author doesn't mention this, although it might have been useful in helping to support the book's subtitle.My verdict:  This book passed my key test of being worthwhile because I learned at least one useful thing from it.  But I only give it 3 stars because it seems like a random set of disconnected essays that fixate on slavery, but that left me wondering exactly why the Civil War still matters, in the author's opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N30GCTLXDE0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199375771#wasThisHelpful","R1N30GCTLXDE0I","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We know that some of our customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year. So purchase the product you normally get and then call one of my team members ... so they can get you the upgrade necessary to meet your needs.By the way, if we did this for revenue purposes we would have targeted a segment of our customer base much larger than the 2-4% who are affected by this change.""I say:""One of the challenges of buying things from your company is that we don't know how and when you will make arbitrary and inexplicable changes to your product for returning customers like us.

"I've used several different types of pedometers and heart rate monitors, so was attracted by this new unit from Epson because it can be used for both purposes.After several weeks of use, I have concluded that it has some very nice characteristics, a few things that could be better, and one serious drawback.The device itself is a black plastic wrist band that measures your pulse through the use a of green light on the underside.  The face of the device has a string of colored LEDs that light up in various patterns that tell you various things, and can also convey some of the same info via a vibration mode.  The device is rechargeable, using a propriety recharger that is included.  The recharger needs to plug into a USB port, and does not come with a brick to plug into line voltage.The real user interface is intended to be an iOS app that you run on your iPhone and that you pair with the device via Bluetooth.  It's a nicely-designed app that can show your current heart rate, along with steps taken, equivalent distance traveled, and hours slept.  Not only does it show numerical values, but it can also show graphs so you can see your activity rate over time.What I liked:* The graphing mode in the iOS app.* The device itself is fairly nice looking.* The heart rate monitor seems to be quite accurate, yet does not require straps around your chest or other cumbersome things like I have used in the past.Things I was not so fond of:* The wrist band is hard to adjust, and to make it stay adjusted.  It has 12 holes (like on a belt) that you can use to adjust for wrist size, but every time I put it back on (you need to take if off for showering and for recharging), I struggle to get it adjusted back to the correct size.* The device itself is fairly thick, as is the buckle area, thus it (especially the buckle part on the bottom) frequently catches on shirt sleeves in an annoying way.* It has a feature that can alert you whenever you change from one activity ""zone"" or level to another.  It does this by a series of 5 vibrations and/or turning on the LEDs in a certain pattern or number.  I found that it would frequently vibrate and light up, both of which were very annoying when they happened while I was not exercising.  Fortunately you can turn both of those things off using the iOS app.* The iOS app includes a battery strength indicator, but it's not on the main screen and thus you have to take several steps to view it.  Given that you need to recharge the battery every few days, you need to keep an eye on battery strength, thus this indicator needs to in constant view instead of tucked away.* Setting up the iOS app and pairing it with the device required me to create an online account and supply an e-mail address, the process for which was cumbersome.  Having to divulge my e-mail address to yet another place also raises privacy concerns, what with all these companies getting hacked these days.* It's not the fault of this device, but you are encouraged to wear it on the wrist of your ""non-dominant"" hand.  Unfortunately, that's where I usually wear a wristwatch.  Maybe I need one device that is both a watch AND a pulse meter.  Apple?* In the past I have most often used a heart rate monitor to watch my heart rate while exercising.  The devices I have used in the past have been cumbersome, but have also allowed me to watch my rate in real time.  This device does make provision for that through a specific screen in the iOS app (or also by setting up the vibration trigger to go off when entering/exiting a certain level), but using the iOS app to do that requires you to have your iPhone in front of you, and leads to the next item -The deal-breaker:* Once I started using this device paired with my iPhone 4S, battery usage on my iPhone went up alarmingly - to the point where I had to charge it at least daily.  Before using it, my iPhone battery would last many days.  I had to start turning off Bluetooth to get around that problem, but of course then the device doesn't talk to the app on my iPhone.  Unless I can find some solution for this problem, I'll probably stop using this device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVJL8CJWW58F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUKZNIC#wasThisHelpful","RAVJL8CJWW58F","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are into Apple devices, you can never have power cords for them.This is a nice little set, with a USB Lightning cord and a car charger plug that you can use together or separately.Why this product is good:* Very reasonable price, especially for the combo.* It works.  That should be a ""given,"" but my experience with non-Apple cords has not been all that great.  Quite a few of them don't work, or stop working soon, or break.* The little LED on the car charger lets you know when the outlet is ""hot.""  My vehicles have a variety of outlets, some of which remain hot when I turn the car off and some of which don't - and I can never remember which is which.  I suppose having the little green LED remaining on while you walk away from the car might seem odd, but it would probably take several years to drain a car battery from such little current draw.* AND - This actually *does* work with my iPad.  Some chargers do, and some don't - because of the additional power required by the iPad, which is quite a bit more than your iPhone or other smaller devices require.I only found one drawback, which is that the car charger only has a single USB outlet.  One of my cars only has a single power outlet, thus plugging in this car charger does not allow me to plug in anything else (unlike some chargers which have 2 outlets).I like this set, and am considering getting more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12S5RVB5J1VSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LETJDNQ#wasThisHelpful","R12S5RVB5J1VSP","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this book, and enjoyed reading it.I have never been in the military, and cannot imagine being in harm's way as the author and thousands of others have been, thus this book provides a real-life glimpse into that world for those like myself who haven't been there.Of course, what makes this story special is the fact that the author was not just an average soldier going through a typical deployment.  If he had been a cook or logistics person for example, I'm sure he could still have written about some of the aspects of being in Afghanistan, but what makes this soldier's story special is the extraordinary set of circumstances he experienced, his particular role as a sniper, and especially what he did.I admit that reading about someone whose job is killing other humans does raise some uncomfortable questions, but this is a story about war, which is a sad reality of human existence.  The author clearly views his mission with the professional detachment that is clearly necessary for the job, and the reader must accept that approach.This is a ""soldier's story,"" the autobiography of an enlisted man who carries out missions assigned from above, and thus is told purely from his point of view as is usual for an autobiography.  You will learn what he is seeing, hearing, thinking ... and sometimes even smelling.  Being in a fire-fight can't be fun, but the author tells about each of the major incidents he participated in with calmness and matter-of-fact clarity, without unnecessary embellishment.Because we are experiencing the events as described by the author, there are lot of things that one is left wondering about.  It's not a fault of the book, but you won't get any background for the larger picture in which the author operated or what others were thinking or doing.  There are a number of mysteries that remain mysterious (what WAS that enormous hole his friend fell into, anyway?), and not much explanation of the weapons, tactics, equipment, or units.But perhaps the biggest unexplained mystery of the book was why was the author able to rack up such a large number of confirmed kills, when (as I understand) the majority of other soldiers deployed there (including other snipers) had few, if any, opportunities to do so?  Is it because of his skill in marksmanship, or his being in the right place and the right time many times, or both ... or something else?These things did not detract from the story, but I did find myself hoping for an appendix or afterword in which a few of these things had been explained for the benefit of the curious such as myself.One other thing that became clear was that Afghanistan is a place that I would not have cared to visit.  Besides Taliban trying to kill you, there is the blast-furnace heat, raw sewage in ditches, and - something that the author delicately mentions - some unspeakable local Afghan sex habits.Near the end, as he talks about returning from his last deployment, it is interesting to read about how he has to make the transition from being in a combat zone where one has to be constantly ready to fight, to being back in civilian life in the US, where the combat reflexes are no longer appropriate.  I would think that would be a very difficult transition for soldiers to make.A very interesting read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38KZPI9D84U3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250045444#wasThisHelpful","R38KZPI9D84U3H","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice-looking scale, but one that I wouldn't recommend and would not purchase again because the manufacturer doesn't stand behind their own product.  Read on.My scale came in a box that presumably was sealed at the factory in China, but after I opened it and installed the 2 AAA batteries in the compartment on the underside of the scale, I noticed that the cover for the battery compartment was missing.  The cover is likely a small piece of plastic that is not attached to the scale but that should snap in place to hold the batteries in place under the scale after they have been installed.  I triple-checked the box and packing material, but clearly the battery cover had not been included.I then used the customer service section on the manufacturer's web site to report the problem, and ask for a replacement battery cover.  They responded the next day, asking me to send them photos of the front and back of the scale (which I did), and told me that they would ""send a replacement"" in a few weeks (it was not clear if this would have been a replacement battery cover or an entire scale).After receiving the pictures (which clearly showed the missing cover), I received the following response:""We do not have battery covers as replacement parts. Lost parts are not covered under the warranty and since you received it from Amazon they would have to contact us to get the replacement sir. Sorry for your inconvenience.Thank you for contacting Taylor Precision Products.""Maybe my scale was the only one for which the factory forgot to include the battery cover.  Or maybe many of them have this problem.  But in any case, you won't get any help from the manufacturer.Regarding the product itself, I got it to replace a 20 year old Accutech digital scale that still works fine but looks a bit outdated.  Both scales give exactly the same readings, so that is reassuring.  From a visual standpoint, this scale is sleek and modern, which goes better with my bathroom decor.This scale can be set to read out in pounds, kilograms, or (for the UK market) stone & pounds (a stone is 14 lbs).  This is the only user control.One quirk that I had trouble getting used to is that it is almost impossible to read the digits when you are standing on the scale - they are barely visible from that angle.  But when you step off of the scale, they suddenly become much more readable at that viewing angle.  My old Accutech with red LEDs gave an immediate reading that I could see while standing on the scale, while with this scale you have to hop on to it and wait a few seconds for the display to start blinking, then hop off and look at the reading.Other usage notes:You need to step on the scale briefly to have it self-calibrate the first time you use it.  No big deal, except that you need to do this every time you move the scale.You must place the scale on a hard surface.  It won't work right on carpet, because it has 4 small feet on the bottom.  On my scale, the 4 feet do not stand level on the floor, thus the scale tends to rock ever so slightly while sitting on the floor.  This is not a significant problem either, but was noticeable to me.Bottom line:  I would not recommend this product due to the indifferent attitude of the company towards a customer who reported a problem with their product.Additional note:  In fairness to the manufacturer, I followed up with them *3* times to further explain the problem and tell them what I needed help with, but to no avail.  While it is commendable that they have a customer service department that actually does respond to customer inquires, that doesn't do much good if they are unwilling to help correct a problem with their product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NTM1PYO1K0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OWA0JAU#wasThisHelpful","R5NTM1PYO1K0J","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not an architect, but have had a long-standing amateur interest in the design of things, especially houses.  I know that Mr Ching has written lots of books on architecture, so I was hoping and expecting this book to provide me with some new insights and ideas on the design of buildings.Unfortunately, it didn't.What you get here is a thick book that seems to be a catalogue of architectural concepts, accompanied by *lots* of architectural drawings by Mr Ching, mostly of famous buildings, that are offered as illustrations of the listed concepts.  This approach really left me cold and uninformed.Perhaps if I were an architect, I would somehow understand the value of this and thus appreciate it more.  But I would also assume that someone trained in architecture would already know and understand these concepts.  So I can't actually figure out what this book is for, or who the audience is.Despite the large volume of drawings, this is not an ""idea book"" from which one could find inspiration for designing your own house (as I am doing).And in the end, this book failed my ultimate test of value:  Did I learn one enduring or useful thing from it?  No.  Well, maybe that Mr Ching is good at making architectural drawings of famous buildings.I would contrast this to any of the books by Christopher Alexander, from whose books I feel that I learned what design is all about, and *why* various design elements make so much sense.If I had browsed this book in a physical bookstore, I would never have bought it.NOTE TO READERS 12/17/14When I published my 2-star review of this book, 5 people quickly rated my review as ""unhelpful"" while no people rated it as helpful.While I don't expect everyone to agree with my opinion, it really seems odd that there were SO many negative votes so quickly, especially given that no other review has gotten more than 2 votes of any kind so far, and nobody left any comments to explain why my comments were not helpful.Since I have absolutely no connection with the author, the publisher, or any of their possible competitors, I was not motivated by any purpose other than to write a frank review to help others who might consider spending money on this book.I will let others decide for themselves whether it seems there has been any ballot-box stuffing here to discredit a review that did not promote the sale of the book being reviewed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PO4QZVPSNH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118745086#wasThisHelpful","R32PO4QZVPSNH5","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mirror really seems like a product from the past - back when things were solid, heavy, and substantial - as opposed to the cheap and flimsy articles we find in the stores today.  What a refreshing change, although one that is reflected in its price, which is also substantial.  You get what you pay for.The side of the mirror with 3X magnification is very nice, with no noticeable distortion.  This side is slightly concave, and provides just the right amount of magnification to see things on your face that you probably couldn't easily see in detail without magnification (this might be good or bad, depending upon what you are looking at!).The size of the mirror is just right - big enough to see as much of your face as you need to, without being so big that it takes up too much space.The design is simple and pleasantly attractive.Because it's constructed of lots of metal instead of plastic, it's just heavy enough to stay put and not be tippy, unlike cheaper and flimsier products.It doesn't have any built-in lighting, but that is consistent with its solid and simple design, and thus no cords or batteries are needed.I really like this mirror.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTME2YI62B3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VZWC94#wasThisHelpful","R3VTME2YI62B3P","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Having used an Epson B11B178011 Perfection V700 Photo Scanner since 2006 to scan over 10,000 photos and slides, I decided to try this unit as a potential ""more modern"" replacement.  Verdict:  I'm going to keep using the V700 for reasons that I will get to in a minute.The V700 is top-notch photo, film and slide scanner that I reviewed on January 21, 2007.  Despite giving it only 3 stars at the time due to some quirks, it has been a very reliable and flexible workhorse for the past 6 years, and I continue to use it for all of my photographic scanning.  Being that old, it uses fluorescent tubes for illumination, making it quite bulky by modern standards and also requires it to warm up for a period before use.  In contrast, the V370 uses LED technology for illumination and thus is only half the height of the V700 and has virtually no ""warm up"" delay.As a photo scanner, the V370 works fairly well and with one exception, produces scans of a quality that will be just fine for most people.  It also uses the same software and scanning concepts as the V700, so if you are used to the Epson way you can just carry on.It does have some things I didn't like:* The cover opens ""sideways"".  Every other flatbed scanner that I have or have owned has a cover that is hinged on the short axis and thus opens away from you if the scanner is positioned with the short axis facing you (which minimizes the amount of space it takes up on my desk).  But the V370 has the cover hinge on the long axis, on the right side.  This might be great for some people, but I find it unhandy, as will most right-handed people.* The V370 comes with only 1 insert or frame for holding slides and film (a combo unit that can hold 4 slides or 1 strip of 35mm film), while the V700 came with a set of 5 different types (of which I have used every one). Like the previous point, this will probably not be a problem for most people who typically don't have a lot of 6x6 negatives and other oddball formats to scan anymore.* Continuing a negative Epson tradition that I pointed out in my review of the V700, you can't buy replacement or additional film holders directly from Epson.  Their web site gives you a list of distributors to contact - Is that the best Epson can do in this age of buying online?* I should also mention that I could not get the drivers to install from the CD included with the product.  I am running Windows 7 64-bit and have never had trouble if this nature, but this CD would not autoplay, and when I tried to browse the CD and manually execute the setup.exe program, it would just hang.  Only after a considerable amount of fiddling around did I finally manage to get through the install process.  I was unable to determine if the problem was the Epson CD, some quirk with my computer, or the fact that I already had the Epson V700 software installed.But here's the real problem:  It doesn't always keep the edges of photos flat while scanning, thus you will likely see places on one or more edges of scanned photos where the photo is not totally pressed flat into contact with the glass of the scanner.  This causes some scans to have a slightly wavy edge and a tiny but wavering shadow in places.  Inspection of the scanner design shows the cause:  Because the V370 can scan both reflective materials (e.g. photos) and transparent materials (e.g. slides and film), it has illumination in both the base and the cover as would be expected.  For scanning photos, you slide an insert into the cover that provides a white background ... AND that should also press the scanned photo flat against the scanner glass.  Unfortunately, the white background is only backed by a plastic rectangle that does not support either the center of the background or its edges, thus fails to keep scanned material pressed flat against the glass.  I see no easy way for the user to fix this, but Epson could easily just re-design and replace this inexpensive item, which is not attached to the scanner unit itself.I also have a Canon LiDE 110 scanner on my desktop for doing quick document scans, so I had hoped that perhaps the V370 could have replaced *both* the V700 and the Canon, but that wasn't feasible either.  Without going into the details, the V370's drivers didn't work well with either of the document scanning applications I use.  I don't consider this a negative since the V370 is marketed as a photo scanner - I was just hoping to reduce the amount of stuff on my desktop.So I'm going to stay with my current scanning set-up of the V700 for photographic scan and the Canon LiDE for documents, and find a new home for the V370.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZ39PNX4WKUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ZDCZ8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UZ39PNX4WKUV","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the latest reports, Magnesium Threonate has been found to cross the blood brain barrier and is the only form of magnesium known to do this. Why is this important? Magnesium is necessary for a well-functioning brain, and if this form crosses the blood brain barrier it will feed your brain and keep your brain fighting fit.I am a great believer in taking magnesium and have taken magnesium threonate (trying MagMind and a couple of other brands of magnesium threonate, one by Doctor's Best and one by Life Extension) for about one year. I find three MagMind capsules per day to be the correct dosage and the least costly. Doctor's Best magnesium threonate has fewer fillers and additives but I found that I needed almost twice as much to equal the effects of MagMind and cannot justify the increased cost just to avoid fillers.I have not conducted a controlled study, so my results are purely anecdotal. My subjective feeling is my recall for names is  better than it was. I more easily do crossword puzzles; my recall for passwords seems better and I also sleep better with a mind that isn't so busy and find myself more relaxed during the day. I find it easier to lay claim to success when my legs and feet no longer cramp nor twitch but MagMind is really for the brain, magnesium chloride seems to work better for leg cramps, etc. so I take it was well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABNO1PVAKQQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007LEO4Y6#wasThisHelpful","R1ABNO1PVAKQQV","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I take 1000 mg of Krill oil every day to reduce inflammation and the resultant negative issues inflammation creates in a human body (such as high cholesterol, inflammatory arthritis). I decided to try Jarrow Krill oil to see if it compared favorably to my usual Mercola krill oil and, in the end, it did not.Upon opening the bottle of krill oil an acrid rotten fish smell hit me first. Then I noticed the size of the capsules which were not unlike tiny footballs. They weren't hard to take but they are much larger than the ""Licaps"" that Mercola's krill oil comes in and the dark color of the gelcap masques whatever stinky substance is inside the gelatin, maltitol and natural flavored capsule. There were no fishy after-burps but I have never experienced that with krill oil and would have been a cause to give this product one less star.In summation, I will keep buying my Mercola krill oil even though it is slightly more expensive (but only just) because the ""Licaps"" are small and easy to take and there is absolutely no fishy smell to be detected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7DG08BBTCAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OULFQ#wasThisHelpful","RF7DG08BBTCAQ","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The human brain is one of the great wonders and mysteries of the Universe, perhaps surpassed only by the Universe itself. Memory is just one aspect of the brain, and thus we have a great subject here to study and read about.I judge books by whether they leave me with some thought or idea that I am likely to remember and use for years to come, and in that respect, I am certain this book will have succeeded, because it definitely provided me with several interesting new ideas.  (Although in the spirit of the book, I'll actually have to come back a few years from now and see what my memory has actually retained.)When my daughter was young, I used to jokingly accuse her of ""remembering things that never happened,"" but after reading this book I now realize that that can actually happen due to the way memories work.One of the key insights I gained was that memories are not like pictures or videos that are stored away intact; instead, memories are reassembled by the brain as reconstructions, using lots of bits and pieces that have been stored away somehow. When a memory is ""recalled,"" the veracity of that memory depends upon the reconstruction process and the quality of the selected bits and pieces, which can vary with each reconstruction and are subject to distortion and manipulation over time.Some of the other things you will learn about including why humans unable to remember things before a certain age, and how the past and the future (i.e. imagination) are related, among many other things.The author uses a number of long stories or descriptions of the reminiscences of others to illustrate several points, and while he does this on purpose, for me those passages were the weakest and least interesting parts of the book.  And the fact that the author is British becomes abundantly clear when he relies upon things that are unfamiliar to non-British readers to describe things, e.g. ""about the size of Cafe Creme cigars"", using Blu-Tack, taking a GCSE, or what happens on Bonfire Night - as he does frequently, although this is just a minor annoyance.Anyway, I enjoyed this book quite a bit for the new insights it provided me, although I now realize that even at this very moment I am having to rely upon the ability of my brain to (imperfectly) reassemble and reconstruct what I finished reading just minutes ago!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPU34J5HTEN0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062237896#wasThisHelpful","RPU34J5HTEN0J","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just gotten a new Canon G15 camera that has an HDMI output via a small HDMI jack on the camera, I got this cable thinking that it would be perfect for connecting the camera to my TV for viewing pictures and videos on a large screen.  Alas, it didn't fit on the camera end.It turns out that there are THREE sizes of HDMI connector today:- A large one called type ""A"" - this is the one found on TV's and monitors- A smaller one called type ""C"" or ""mini HDMI"" - this is found on many cameras such my Canon- An even smaller one called type ""D"" or ""micro HDMI"" - typically used on smartphonesThis cable is accurately described as a ""HDMI to micro HDMI"" cable.  I got it before I realized there were TWO types of small HDMI connector, which is my fault.  I am smarter now, and I hope that readers of this review will be, too.But is this situation really necessary?  I am a reasonably savvy person, yet was unfamiliar with the proliferation of HDMI connector types (which is very similar to the situation in the USB world, where we have standard, mini and micro connector types as well).  For the industry to create many variations is a bad thing, because it causes consumer confusion and more electronic waste, so besides blaming myself for ordering the wrong cable, I'll also assign a fair amount of blame on the electronics industry for allowing many variations to exist.And nowhere in the specs or 316-page instruction manual for my camera does it describe the connector as anything other than ""HDMI"", so I also put some of the blame on Canon for their careless lack of precision on something that makes a difference.So how to assign a rating to a cable that I cannot actually test?  The cable appears to be very nicely made by cable standards; it was accurately described; and it came in Amazon's nice ""frustration free"" packaging.  So I'll arbitrarily say 4 stars until such time as I can actually test it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJL9P6EVKP8X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009CNHZKO#wasThisHelpful","RJL9P6EVKP8X3","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of this product until a recent service job on my 2004 Ford F-250 Super Duty with 6.0 liter PowerStroke diesel.  I dropped it off one night at my mechanic for routine service the next day, and it sat outside on a cold night before my mechanic  worked on it. When I picked it up the next day, my mechanic commented on how roughly it started after sitting out in the cold overnight (this has not been unusual for this truck, but has never caused me any problems either); that the Navistar 6.0 liter diesels like the one in my truck have been known for this; and that he had treated several of them with Rev-X and it made them start more smoothly.I was a bit skeptical of how an oil additive could help with this, but thought I'd give it a try anyway.That was a few months ago, and I have to say (unscientifically) that I think my truck now starts more smoothly on cold mornings than before.

"Having read books about the ""heroic"" Antarctic explorers such as Scott, Mawson, Amundsen, Shackleton and others, but never paying much attention to what has happened on that continent since then, and never having been to Antarctica myself, this book provided an interesting glimpse of what has been happening there recently and what has changed over the past century.And what changes there have been.The men of 100 years ago who struggled to reach the South Pole by the only means possible at the time - months of arduous and sometimes fatal journeys on foot - would be astonished to find humans living there year-round today, with living comforts similar to home, and in constant contact with home.The author, who has spent considerable time on the Antarctic continent herself, takes us along with her on visits to the Amundsen Scott station at the Pole as well as a number of other of the outposts scattered across the continent, all of which are there for the purpose of doing scientific research (with one odd exception).  She tells us about having a drink with 800,000 year old ice cubes (presumably for the novelty, as one can't imagine too much demand for chilled beverages in Antarctica), how the atmosphere at each station various according to the nation that runs the station (naturally the French have the best food), how she went from hating penguins to loving them, and more - and colors the whole experience with stories from the heroic age of exploration.  You'll pick up a lot of little factoids, including learning that children and domestic animals are prohibited on the continent.Another of the things that has changed since the heroic age is that women are now present on the continent - as the author tells us over and over, as though this is a surprise.And of course a modern story about Antarctica and change wouldn't be complete if it didn't spend a lot of time pointing how ""climate change"" has affected the place over the past century, with lots of ice melting.I enjoyed the book for the modern glimpse it gives us of the Earth's most remote continent.  It was like reading a very long article in National Geographic - a magazine that I still enjoy reading from time to time.  It's not a bad thing, and I mention this more to describe the journalistic style than anything else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTA67R8J9CA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151015201#wasThisHelpful","R2BTA67R8J9CA2","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You'll never find this book on a list of best-sellers because it's highly focused on a very specific and uncommon topic, but I really enjoyed reading it.  Maybe that's because I always like trains as a kid, and I'm an engineer by training.I don't know how many people in the whole world are experts in ""the forensics of rail disasters,"" but there can't be very many, thus the author is a man of rare knowledge.  He's clearly an engineer through and through, because he writes in a terse, non-nonsense, right-to-the-point style.If you hated high school physics, you probably won't like this book.  While quite a number of actual train wrecks are used as case studies, this book is not a set of involved train wreck stories.  The author tells you just enough about each wreck to give you the situation, then jumps into the analysis which often involves Newtonian physics (mass, force, acceleration, etc).  To the author's credit, he does a great job of explaining all this in fairly simple terms that you don't need to be a scientist to understand.After reading this book, you will know a lot more about how railroads physically work - like so many things, it's a lot more complicated than it appears.  There's a LOT more to being a railroad engineer than just sitting the cab while twiddling with the throttle and blowing the horn occasionally.You will also learn a lot of obscure but interesting facts, such as:* How long was the longest train in the world?  (Hint: MUCH longer than a mile)* Why it's bad to have too many engines at the front of a train.* That the front and back ends of a train are rarely traveling at the same speed at the same time.* Why trains (in the past) often had to back up a ways before they could start moving forward.* That cars of different weights and lengths need to be put into a train in a certain order.* How railroads overcome the thermal expansion of steel rails to use long lengths of continuously-welded rail (instead of the bolted-together 39' sections of the past)* That fatal train wrecks can even happen to trains that only traveling a few miles per hour.* and LOT more!My enjoyment of reading Train Wreck was diminished slightly by the author's desire to express all measurements in both English and metric terms.  This is not so bad when he writes things like ""a single locomotive moving at 25 mph (40 km/hr)"", but it gets tiring after a while, and then there are some pretty horrific cases such as ""Given a typical 74-foot (22.5-m)-long, 15-foot (4.5-m)-high, 10 foot (3-m)-wide, 415,000-lb (188,240-kg) locomotive design...""Which then leads to an embarrassing problem that I am sure was not the author's fault.  Whoever translated Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius failed to realize the difference between absolute and relative temperatures.  For example, when talking about actual air temperature, it's correct to say something like ""70F (21C)"", but when giving a temperature *difference* this needs to be calculated differently or you end up with silly mistakes such as ""One inch (2.54 cm) of steel heated 1F (-17C)...""  This latter mistake is made over and over throughout the book, which is a shame.But overall an interesting and rare book if you like trains and engineering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNM1YEQB2BXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421405903#wasThisHelpful","R3QNM1YEQB2BXB","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently upgraded to this version from last year's version (2012).  I reviewed that product a year ago and found that it worked well for me although contained a number of niggling little issues, thus I called it ""Quirken"", but none of them has caused any real problem in a year of use.Compared to the 2012 version, the 2013 version looks and acts virtually identically except for a new ""Mobile & Alerts"" tab on the top bar.  Many years ago I bought an applet called ""Pocket Quicken"" for my Palm Pilot, and found it to be very useful to be able to enter and manage my expenses while away from home, even if that device did not have a wireless capability (you had to ""hot sync"" the device by connecting it to your PC every so often).  Sadly, Pocket Quicken and Palm Pilots went away, and I have missed the mobile capability ever since.  Will the 2013 version finally bring mobility back to Quicken?I installed this version from CD onto a PC that was had been running Quicken Deluxe 2012 on a 64-bit version of Windows 7. To ensure that I could undo the installation, I *first* set a system restore point by going to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > System Protection > Create.  I highly recommend doing this anytime you are about to make a potentially risky system change, including installation of a critical software product.  If things go wrong, this allows you back out the change and restore your system to the way it was before you made the change.Impressions:* The installation process was quick (5 mins), simple and error-free.  It looks like it only installs a small amount of the product from the CD, because the longest part of the installation process was a download from the internet, supposedly to ""get the latest version.""* During the installation process, it installs a ""Free Credit Report"" icon on your desktop.  This is really annoying and unnecessary.* As usual for every one of the past many versions of Quicken, it converted my existing Quicken data to a new format, saving a copy of the existing data in case you need to go back.* And of course you need to ""register"" this copy with Intuit online.  I wish it could just pick up my previous registration data instead of making me re-enter it.* I ran through a variety of typical operations, all of which worked just fine for me.* I then clicked on the new Mobile & Alerts tab, which prompted me to create a Quicken Cloud account.  That was fine, but then it wanted me to select which of my accounts to enable for the cloud.  This part makes me a bit uneasy, because I have never allowed ANY of my financial data to leave my computer.  I'm just not certain I like that, but to try it out, I selected one of my accounts and proceeded.  Quicken then spent a few minutes uploading a lot of stuff from that account, and hopefully keeping it really safe.* Quicken then advised me to get the relevant app for my mobile device.  Since I have an iPhone, I went to the Apple App Store and got the free Quicken app.  Be sure to get the one from Intuit and not one of the others than come up when you search.  Once installed in my iPhone, I logged in with my new Quicken Cloud ID, and found the data for the one account I had enabled.  Seems OK so far.* ADDED: I found that my Net Worth didn't match what it had been with Quicken 2012.  The reason seems to be that in 2012 there was an option to exclude selected accounts from your Net Worth, which I did for a few accounts that I use to track unvested assets.  That option has disappeared in the 2013 version, but you can accomplish the same thing by going into each account that you want to exclude and checking a different box called ""Keep this account separate"" which isn't very enlightening.I will continue to exercise both the PC application and the new mobile app and report back later, but so far it has been a pain-free upgrade, and I am really hoping to finally ""go mobile"" with Quicken - like I used to do some years ago, except hopefully better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5R0S2SIFZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RA5A00#wasThisHelpful","R3T5R0S2SIFZ8","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earlier this year I bought a Carson LM-20 2X LED Illuminated Magnifier & Desk Lamp because I needed a lighted magnifier for doing some hobby projects, and also to pull slivers and thorns that I get from gardening out my fingertips.  I selected that product because it seemed to best fit my needs at the time, and it has worked well for its intended purpose.Now comes along the Normande lamp, which is almost identical in size and can serve many of the same purposes.  Which should you choose?  Here is a comparison:Compared to the Carson, the Normande:- Has a magnifier of similar size and power, but lacks the small higher-power 5x spot magnifier of the Carson.- Uses a circular fluorescent light that provides much more light than the 2 LED lights in the Carson.- Must be plugged in to 120v power for the light to work, while the Carson can run on batteries if necessary but also can be plugged in, albeit with one of those annoying little power bricks.- Is much lighter, so much so that it skates around on your work surface.  The Carson is just heavy enough to stay put.- Is usable as a task light on your tabletop, while the Carson really can't be used as a lamp.- Has a cover that flips up & down to expose or cover the magnifier, which the Carson lacks.  This helps keep dust off of the magnifier, and is also a very important safety feature - see NOTE below.- Subjectively feels a bit ""cheap"" compared to the Carson, even though both are made of plastic.If I had gotten both of these units at the same time and only kept one, it would have been a close race but with a slight nod to the Normande because of its dual-purpose capability as a lamp and magnifier, and also because it has a cover on the magnifier, but it lacks the 5x magnifier and the ""nicer"" feel of the Carson.NOTE on magnifier cover:  If you *ever* leave a magnifier of any kind in a location that can be reached by natural sunlight, beware!  If you are not careful, it could focus the sunlight onto a combustible surface and start a fire very quickly as any schoolkid knows.  I almost had this happen years ago, so know to be careful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7QQ6LJ14OJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029ZBKXU#wasThisHelpful","R2U7QQ6LJ14OJ7","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When the old Actiontec modem that I got from Qwest failed, I got this unit to replace it.  I plugged it in, it self-configured itself for Qwest/CenturyLink, and I was up and running.  No need to use a setup CD like Qwest supplied with the old unit.  It has now been running on my network for several months without a hitch.Conclusion:  Simple & reliable unit for Qwest/CenturyLink.It does have a few drawbacks that may or may not be important to you:1. Very basic DHCP server.  I run a home network that has several devices that require specific IP addresses, but I don't see any way for this unit to provide some fixed addresses with others dynamically assigned.  Not a big deal, but I'm glad that I have another more sophisticated DHCP server on my network that can provide this capability.2. Very basic blocking capabilities.  For example, I don't see any way to have it block a certain web site during certain hours: it only allows you to block completely or not at all.One other thing that I haven't figured out yet is whether this modem will work with CenturyLink's higher-speed services or not.  I have been limited to their 1.5m service until just recently, when they upgraded to fiber in my area, and now supposedly 7m and 12m speeds are available.  CenturyLink uses VDSL2 for some of their higher-speed services, and since the GT784WN is an ADSL2 unit I am not sure yet if it will work with a speed upgrade I am hoping to get.  Will update this if/when I learn something about this.Other than the comments above, this is a very satisfactory unit.UPDATE 12/28/11:  When CenturyLink *finally* introduced faster (12m) service in my area and I upgraded to it, this unit continued to work just fine at the new speed.Some people have reported that this unit doesn't work on Qwest/CenturyLink, but one thing to keep in mind is that CenturyLink uses at least 2 different DSL technologies.  This unit works with the ""ADSL"" variety and not the ""VDSL"" variety, so you need to check that before trying to use this unit or complaining that this one does not work.One other CenturyLink tip that I don't think is specific to this unit:  Sometime after I upgraded to the higher-speed service, I lost the ability to refer to most of the computers on my home network by name, i.e. when I did a Ping or RDP to another of my computers by name, it could no longer be found, although they still could be addressed by their IP addresses.  After much frustration, I finally fixed this by overriding the DNS addresses provided by CenturyLink and replacing them with the free DNS provided by Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) and that fixed the problem.  Not sure if the problem was caused by this Actiontec unit or a change in CenturyLink's DNS - I just know what finally fixed the problem.  Specific instructions to do this:1. Open the modem's admin page by browsing to its address (usually [...] but yours could be different)2. Click on Advanced Setup icon3. Click on WAN IP Settings link4. In section called ""5. Select DNS Type"":  Select ""Static DNS"" and enter the addresses of Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) in the 2 boxes provided.  There are other DNS servers you can use, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWQPNEIT4V8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NBZ98K#wasThisHelpful","RGWQPNEIT4V8M","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great product.I bought this for 2 reasons:1. To reduce noise during air travel.2. For hearing protection while shooting.It succeeds in both, and is a big improvement over the various solutions I had been using.While flying, I like noise protection to reduce the ambient airplane noise (not to mention the noise of chatty passengers) while I am reading.  I fly a lot, but do not like using any type of electronic noise reduction for many reasons, including the restriction on using electronic devices below 10,000 feet.  My solution up to this point was an expensive set of Israeli-made SilentEar earplugs that were supposedly really good, but just would not stay put in my ears despite trying several sizes.  This product fits my ears *perfectly* and results in a quieter environment, so will be coming with me on all future flights.While shooting, I have been using various brands of ear muff style hearing protection, including ones from Stanley, Beretta and Browning.  Besides being bulky, nearby gunfire still sounded LOUD.  But with these, the sound is now tolerable, and I don't have to fill up 1/4 of my range bag with big bulky ear muffs.You get 3 sets in this package, which is nice and very good value.  The only cautionary note I will add is that in each set I got, the yellow cord connecting the two ears was tied in such a tight knot that I almost could not get it apart.  For a moment I actually considered *cutting* the knot, thinking that it was not part of the cord, but quickly realized that doing so would cut the cord between the 2 earpieces.  You can untie the little knots - if you have patience. [Update:  For some time now, they have come tied with knots that are much easier to untie, unlike the earlier version, thus no longer an issue.]I like them!  Sorry, what was that you said???UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER:It puzzles me why a few people have had such trouble with these and think they don't work.  Unlike what a few others have reported, these work really well for me at the range, and in fact when I have tried wearing ear muffs over the top of these I really can't detect any further reduction in sound.For anyone who has had trouble or think they don't work, be sure that you have inserted them properly and completely.  As the instructions indicate, you have to pull out on your ear lobe with one hand while inserting them into your ear with the other - you can't just push them in with one hand because they won't go in far enough to fully seal the ear canal.  When properly inserted, you *will* notice the difference - a feeling that I can best describe as being ""cut off"" from the world.  If you don't feel that, they are not inserted properly and you will NOT get anywhere close to the level of sound reduction that these can provide.Anyway, these work just great for me, and I am about to order more.UPDATE, several years later:I keep buying more, because I am concerned about my hearing, and these help a lot.  If you don't do anything around noise, you won't need these, but most of us do.My latest use, which perhaps negates my original title a bit, is to wear while out on my side-by-side ATV, which is quite noisy.  I keep several pairs of these in the vehicle, to wear myself, for my spouse to wear, and for guests.  While they greatly suppress the noise of the ATV, my spouse and I actually *can* easily hear each other while wearing these.  Seems perfect.I've seen a lot of silly comments by others here, who say that:* They are uncomfortable.  True, you won't want to wear them all day.  That would be true of any hearing protection.* The state of California says that they are ""known to be carcinogenic.""  Perhaps true if you eat them, but half of the things I have purchased lately have come with such a warning.  I live in the real world, not California.* They don't work.  Well, they do for most people - especially if you insert them correctly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQNF0XSKPCOWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000DZF7T6#wasThisHelpful","RQNF0XSKPCOWB","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Given that the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking is coming up soon (April 2012), we can expect a spate of new books on this popular and still-fascinating subject.  Here is an early entrant in that derby.This book is about J. Bruce Ismay, the ""owner"" of the Titanic who was excoriated for being one of the surviving male passengers from an age when ""women and children first"" was the expectation.  The re-telling of the familiar story of the actual sinking in this book is brief, as it should be.  Ismay himself is an interesting character who obviously had a major role in the Titanic episode, and a book about him is a useful addition to the literature on this subject.The biographical details of his life are well-covered, including how he grew up, how he inherited the White Star Line from his father who founded the company, his deportment at the enquiries on both sides of the Atlantic that followed the sinking, and his later family life.  The book spends considerable time recounting his behavior at both enquiries, in which he comes across as unhelpful, aloof and enigmatic - exactly as he was in life.Other familiar Titanic characters such as Lightoller figure prominently here too, and we are given the impression that both he and Ismay are hiding deeper secrets that mostly were never revealed.According to the author's bio, she was a lecturer in English literature for many years before writing this book, and it shows.  Early on she starts using Joseph Conrad's ""Lord Jim"" as a parallel to Ismay's story, and after many references this device emerges in full bloom to fully occupy one whole chapter (out of 8), including a mini-bio of Conrad.  It was interesting at first, but then it went on for page after page until I found myself skimming to the end of that chapter and hoping to get back to the story.I found the book interesting because it added to my casual interest on the famous Titanic story, but it was just ""too literary"" for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5OBNDABLRB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062094548#wasThisHelpful","R2F5OBNDABLRB9","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having found that the larger version of this product makes reloading 9mm and 45 ACP magazines much easier, I got this - the Baby version - at the same time as I ordered my first .22 pistol (from another source, obviously!).While the Baby seems functionally similar to its larger sibling, after trying it on 2 different .22 magazine types (Browning and Beretta), I threw it in a drawer and don't ever expect to use it again.  Why?1. It doesn't work on many types of .22 magazines!  Nowhere in *Amazon's* description does it tell you this (although other reviewers have now mentioned this).  Included with the product is a tiny label that says ""Does NOT load the following mags with projecting side pin, like:"" and then lists 6 of the most popular .22 pistols including Browning Buck Mark, Ruger, Walther, Beretta, etc. Here is one disadvantage to buying online where you can't examine the merchandise first.2. The Browning and Beretta .22 mags I use are so easy to load by hand that any extra mechanical assistance is totally unnecessary.  The springs in them are very soft compared larger-caliber magazines, where it truly is a bit difficult to push each cartridge in.  Maybe others have stiffer springs, but mine are easy.My advice:  Check compatibility before buying.  Better yet, save your money and buy more ammo instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R597YYBVLBKZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ITKHM6#wasThisHelpful","R597YYBVLBKZ7","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted when I found this product, which was exactly what I needed to provide hot showers at my remote mountain cabin.  I love going there, but didn't like having to go too long without a shower, especially when working on projects which are dusty or dirty.  This little unit now allows me to feel fresh and clean while in the boondocks.It was not without its tribulations, though.  When I first connected the unit to an LP tank (standard 20 lb container used for outdoor grilles) and a water supply, I was delighted to have hot water emerge from the spray handle.  I shut it down and planned to take a shower a bit later.  A few hours later, as I was preparing to savor my first hot shower in the wilderness, I was surprised when the battery compartment on the bottom (which takes 2 D cells for the igniter) was very warm to the touch.  And the unit wouldn't heat.  :-(Disappointed, I had to give up on having my long-anticipated shower.  Later in the day when I reached an area with cell phone reception I called Camp Chef's customer service.  The company is in Utah, and someone answered immediately and took my info.  A short time later a very helpful ""engineer"" came on the phone, who immediately offered to ship me a replacement unit overnight.  Given my remote location that didn't seem like a good option, so then he told me that likely the batteries were shorted somehow (creating heat) and gave me simple instructions on what I might try to fix the problem.  Again he emphasized that he could send me a replacement as well.Back at my cabin I followed his instructions to remove the cover (1 screw) and found that the insulator that was supposed to cover the spot where some wires connect to the battery compartment had slipped, allowing the battery connect to short to a pipe inside.  I easily correct this and - voila! - hot water again.Some other things I learned by talking to the helpful engineer that were not covered in the instruction manual:- It's OK for the unit to get wet, e.g. if it is out in the rain.- Might be obvious, but if you leave the unit somewhere where it might freeze, be sure to drain it thoroughly.  There is an unlabeled knurled knob on the bottom that can be unscrewed to ensure it drains thoroughly.Summary:- Unit is made in China (like everything these days) and should not have been designed to allow the battery contacts to come into contact with other internal metal parts, even if insulated.  I would expect this problem to affect every unit, even if there is an easy work-around.- Once working, the unit is great.- Camp Chef is to be highly commended on their prompt, knowledgable and personal service.  Even if the unit is made in far-away China, the service is right here in this country by real people who care.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QPNJPE54575G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J4AU2E#wasThisHelpful","R3QPNJPE54575G","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned/used several other blood pressure meters over the years, including ones from Omron and LifeSource.  The older units look pretty basic compared to this latest Omron, which provides significant more computerized functionality than the older units.  However, this does come at the cost of greater complexity.Good things about the new Omron:* ""TruRead"" mode, which automatically takes 3 sequential readings and averages them.  I always did this manually with my older units anyway because the readings would differ slightly from time to time, but this one does it with one touch of a button, and then computes the average for you.* Cuff is very nice: broad and stiff, which I find much easier to apply.* Automatically determines if you have applied the cuff correctly.* Like a dozen other things I own these days, this unit can connect to my computer via USB, which fortunately is by the common ""mini"" USB connector and not the less common ""micro"" USB connector, which means that you can use the same USB cord as you use for many other devices.Things that may or may not be good:* It is set up to handle 2 regular users, via an A/B slide switch. This really is only useful if you have 2 people who both use the same unit regularly, and they both want to have the unit keep track of averages and/or download readings to a computer.  Of course, you have to remember to set the switch in the right position for you so you don't get mixed up, which would destroy the value of any history.* You can connect it to your Windows computer as mentioned above, supposedly to connect to Microsoft Health Vault (which I did not try - who wants to upload their personal information to something run by Microsoft?) or to Omron's Health Management software package which you can download and run privately on your own Windows PC.  I did try out the latter, which does allow you to upload stored readings to your computer for graphing of historical trends.  I find this only marginally useful if at all - I do keep my own log in Excel, where I can also add notes, add other data, and analyze and graph it myself - all without having to plug it in to my computer.  I did experience some difficulty uploading, where it was not obvious what to do to start the upload after connecting the unit to my computer.Things that are not so good:* It has various computational abilities such as a memory, ability to keep history for morning & evening readings, etc.  I suppose this could provide some value to those who are tech-oriented and would value the additional information, but I find that it just adds unnecessary complexity to the device with little value to me.  I found it difficult to figure out how to make this work, even after (re)reading the instruction manual several times.  Anything that requires you to keep the instruction manual handy flunks my usability test, and likely will not be used by 98% of most users.  Factoid to provide contrast:  My old LifeSource unit had just 1 button, my old Omron had just 2, while this unit has 7 buttons.Overall, I like the unit because it is a useful improvement over my older devices, particularly due to the useful TruRead feature.  It does provide PC connectivity and more computational features that older units too, but not everyone will find those capabilities useful, and they do increase the complexity of the unit.UPDATE 12/23/11 - Long-term experience report:The unit is still working well, and I like it.  The good features I mentioned above, especially the TruRead feature, have turned out to be real advantages over previous units, and I would really miss them if I had to go back.For anything other than very occasional use, you *will* need to run this unit plugged into the power adapter (included), because it consumes batteries more rapidly than older units, perhaps because of the TruRead feature.  I don't find this a problem.I'm a satisfied user.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BBG80L2FI0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H44GB4#wasThisHelpful","R39BBG80L2FI0U","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not been one to enjoy a spate of good murder mysteries until this past year. That said, in the past I have read murder mysteries by such diverse authors as Diana Mott-Davidson and John Sandford, so this genre of books are in my repertoire; they just are not my norm. However, when offered the opportunity to read the latest Henning Menkel book I jumped at the chance.I opened the book with, I will admit, some trepidation. I enjoy the Wallander television series and feel Kenneth Branagh does a snap job of portraying a somewhat dry, often depressed and unsmiling detective Kurt Wallander but to read an entire book composed of dry and lifeless conversation seemed a bit daunting. Imagine my surprise when one morning I laughed out loud at a line of conversation between Wallander and another character in the book. I actually asked my spouse if I had just laughed out loud and, in fact, I had. Obviously, this is not a humorous book but it is a book that speaks to you of someone not unlike yourself who has chosen to be a policeman and solve heinous crimes.I still feel that Menkel's style is one of simplicity. Simple dialogue, simple premise for a murder in a simple land and yet you cannot put the book down. I felt compelled to turn page after page to keep reading even though I had other deadlines to make. I finished the book in record time with an inexplicable feeling of emptiness perhaps because it appears this is Kurt Wallander's last appearance in the printed media. I suppose all characters eventually  must have the last story written about them but having just discovered Henning Menkel's Sweden and  Kurt Wallander I was not prepared to say goodbye.It seems I have read things totally out of order as this is my first Henning Menkel book but it will not be my last. As soon as I finish my long line of Elizabeth George books, Henning Menkel's books will fill my shelves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSP58YDNCIQRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307593495#wasThisHelpful","RSP58YDNCIQRY","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These lamps were exactly what I wanted for bedside reading.  Color and appearance were a perfect match for my decor, and the size and style were just right as well.  After installing them, I removed the lamps that had been taking up space on my nightstands, creating a tidier appearance.Installation was fairly easy (I mounted them on the wall, but plugged them into nearby outlets.  They also can be hard-wired, but obviously that's not an easy thing to do in an existing house.) All you need to do is drill 4 holes in the wall for the set of screws that is used to attach the mounting plate to the wall.  I agree with the other reviewer, who strongly advised against using the included drywall anchors because the anchors looked pretty flimsy, although that would not be a problem if you are mounting into studs because the supplied screws would be fine for that.All was well until, after mounting them, I noticed that each lamp shade hung slightly crooked.  The fault is in the arcing tube that comes up from the mounting plate and curves out to the top of the lampshade - on both of mine, the part that hangs from this tube does not hang straight down, but is slightly angled to one side (both lamps were the same in this regard).  I really like the lamps and didn't want to go through the delay and hassle of exchanging them, with no certainty that the replacements would be better, so I did my best to adjust the shades to minimize any appearance of tilting.  If I can't get used to this over time, I might take them down and try to bend the metal tubes.Summary: Really nice design, appearance is great, but suffers from quality control in the manufacturing process.  Needless to say, these lamps, like 90% of all products being sold these days, are made in China.  :-(","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L680LOUO61WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FOFSQA#wasThisHelpful","R2L680LOUO61WZ","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never read Gibbon, nor did I know much about the late Roman empire (376-476 AD), which is why I got this book. Reading this book filled in a lot of knowledge gaps and corrected a lot of misconceptions for me, but it was heavy reading at times.Things that surprised me (keeping in mind that I am a casual reader and not an expert):- There actually is quite a significant written historical record from this period.  Although it was not the golden age of the early empire, with fewer famous writers, much was written and still available to modern scholars (even if a huge additional amount that was known to exist has been lost).  Most of this is in sources that are not commonly available to the modern reader, and from the excerpts quoted by the author, are unlikely to be of interest to the modern reader due to their style and fragmentary nature. Thus Peter Heather provides a great service to readers like myself by piecing together and interpreting that material, turning it into this volume.- Contrary to the belief popularised (I believe) by Gibbon, the western Roman empire did not collapse from its own weight or decadence, but the ""fall"" of Rome was a gradual process that was primarily driven by external sources, mainly the brief rise of the Huns under Attila who drove others (Goths, Vandals, etc) out of their traditional spaces and into Roman territory.  Those once-fractional groups finally coalesced into much larger groups such as the Visigoths that became serious threats to the Romans.- Economic factors also loomed large even back then. (What's Latin for ""It's the economy, stupid?"")  Heather makes it clear that only large nations with large tax bases could remain economically able to maintain the large armies needed to survive in that period, and the Roman decline was caused by the combination of the cost of armies necessary to fight off increasingly-larger Barbarian forces, while at the same time deal with a shrinking tax base caused by a slowly shrinking empire.- Another fascinating insight is how the ""Dark Ages"" came to be(Heather never uses that term, and the period is beyond that covered by this book). During the Roman empire, literacy was widespread among the upper classes, with a strong command of Latin or Greek being necessary for high public status.  But after the fall of Rome, when Europe fell under Barbarian rule, the way to impress one's superiors shifted to being good with fighting instead of writing, and literacy fell out of favor until it was only of interest to church officials (hence the importance of monks to preserve ancient writings through the period after the fall of Rome).This book was a good reading choice because I learned a lot from it, but it was quite heavy going at times - probably a lot like reading the details of the goings-on in some small, faraway town that you have not heard of.  Fortunately, Heather has provided useful appendices that made it a bit easier to figure out and remember the multitude of little-known and barely-pronounceable Barbarian bigwigs of the era.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HXVNXP1P9V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195325419#wasThisHelpful","R33HXVNXP1P9V5","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always believed that complexity is bad, but after reading this essay by Donald Norman (former VP at Apple and now author, professor and expert on design) I have come to understand that complexity is both unavoidable and not *necessarily* the evil thing I once thought.Norman himself made this same transition in belief, coming to understand that complexity is bad only if it causes confusion.  Since the modern, technology-filled world is filled with complexity that will not go away, we have to look for ways to tame it - And good design is one of the ways.In this context, design is not just how something looks, but is how it operates in the context of the user's experience, and could be a whole ""system"" rather than a single product.Norman offers many fascinating insights; here are a few:* Apple, famous for design and usability, first used a 1-button mouse because it was the simplest (Windows used a 2-button mouse and Unix preferred 3). This wasn't just a guess; studies have consistently shown that while humans have no trouble attaching unique meanings to ""up"" vs. ""down,"" the difference between left and right is arbitrary.  Thus a mouse with a left button vs. a right button seemed complex.  But guess what?  Apple now uses a 2 button mouse!  Why?  Although slightly more complex, the 2-button mouse provided many more advantages at the cost of only slight complexity, and was deemed superior from experience in practice.* From a variety of studies, it seems that people actually WANT complexity in many cases.  For example, when purchasing electronic equipment, people equate more buttons with more function, and will pay more for it even if they have no idea of how to use it.* Having more buttons on a control is better than fewer buttons - Provided that each button has a unique purpose that is obvious and easy to understand.  The contrast is that a device with only a small number of buttons is actually more complex if each button has many different purposes (like on an electronic wristwatch).There were numerous other insights I found fascinating, such as Norman's belief that error messages are bad (""the machine should be scolded, not the human""), and his disdain for modern numbers-driven management because it fails to take into account the human aspect of what is needed in products and systems.So Norman helps us understand that complexity is inevitable and not necessarily bad, and thus it is imperative that we pay a lot of attention to the design of products and services to make things understandable to the humans who use them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U06DSXTVVXKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262014866#wasThisHelpful","R3U06DSXTVVXKK","A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DZ0QRHRXIE5V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The very first chapter had me just as fascinated as Julian was as we watched Kate (quite unknowingly) put on that little show in the parking lot of the Shelter she volunteered. It is the importance to details, here and all through the story that brings the characters true to life. It also made me wonder what Kate would have thought, had she known, something as simple as dropping her keys was about to change her life forever. I felt like this was the defining moment Julian knew he was going to have her, for just one night. ( yeah, right?)I have read hundreds of vampire stories, and what I really liked here was the fact that Julian, although he is in fact knock me down and do me gorgeous, he is by far not perfect. He makes a few bad calculations and he isn't the strongest vamp around, at least not until his friend Reese, who is an older vamp gives him some of his blood, that gives him a fighting chance when he decides to take on Evangeline, his maker. She wants Julian, who never wanted her, and when she learns of Julian being with Kate, well, that's when things get intense....But I have to say, this isn't your usual, beautiful woman meets dangerous, dark vamp and fawns all over him, & they spend eternity together. no no no ....First off, Kate is not teenage model material, she has her flaws just like the rest of us, and she's a little older, and a little heavier than she'd like to be. and her "" forever"" with Julian is not a given. One lusty, erotic, fantasy filled night in the arms of a stranger, does not forever make....at least it's suppose to only be one night, remember? Hell, she doesn't even know that he's a vampire. A lot is going to happen before that little cat is let out of the bag...which brings me to Kate's BFF Mazzie. She is one tough cookie, and she is fierce with her loyalty to Kate, and I am still waiting to find out what in the 7 hells went on in that bathroom between her & Julian. And way later with Mazzie, laying in a pool of blood when Reese finds her and Julian is going insane looking for Kate who is no where to be found....& Insert cliffhanger here..This amazing saga continues with even more excitement as Reese is forced to make a decision that could result in losing the love of his life, as Kate is kidnapped, believing her bestie is dead......Julian scrambles to achieve and perfect a vampire talent that will allow him to reach and link to his beloved Kate who is in the clutches of John, the deranged creation of Evangeline, who in her own madness believing that Kate stole Julian from her as the way of getting him to come back to her.The action never stops as there are a few different and very enlightening story lines that explains a lot of the why's and who's of this saga........Evangeline's origins and all she went through, made me believe that she never stood a chance.So, I have mixed thoughts about the emotional cliff hanger that I hope means that there is another installment coming in this series.These characters are so well developed, each as individuals and together, they were so true to life for me, from the smexy erotic scenes to the horrors that are visited on some of them. This is a most amazingly believable Vampire romance....I have read many, so, I do recommend this series as an adult read.

"""AVENGE"" This third book of the series is what ""ABUSE"" & ""ACCUSE"" have been leading up to....  the romance between Grant Wilkinson and Renata Koreman has grown into everything Andre' Chevalier could have hoped for. When Grant came to Andre' (in need of therapy)  he put ""the monster together with the little mouse"" in the hope that they would heal each other. Grant  now believes he has the best of both worlds. It turnes out Renata, his sex therapist is  also his soul mate. They compliment one another in all things, especially in the bedroom, or any room for that matter! They continue therapy in the most erotic ways.... but an adult that has been abused as a child has many obsticals that must be addressed before life can be anywhere near normal. If that abuse was sexual, even harder. If that sexual abuse was at the hand of someone the child should have been able to trust ...Well, I think you can see where this is going. We see the full depth, depravity, and lengths people will go to in order to keep their secrets. I'm talking about wealthy, well educated, and connected people, some in high places. People that can frame you for murder, or make your death look like a sucide. There are secrets within secrets covering up other secrets. No wonder these sex rings are so hard to take down. But at least for this story, our beloved Andre' Chevalier has come up with a plan. Why would Andre' do this you may ask? It seems our favorite frenchman has kept a little secret of his own....I was so enthralled by this whole Trilogy, but this last installment is not only an erotic romance, but a mystery/suspense/detective novel all rolled into one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX5LL4KR9E7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01816ZR66#wasThisHelpful","R1BX5LL4KR9E7S","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Killer"" is a brilliantly written prequel to the coming soon, "" Stalker"".. All the characters are really well developed. I could see Phoenix quite clearly in my minds eye...the story line grabs you, holds you, and pulls you in until the end. There are secrets within the secrets and nothing is as it seems. The blurb does not prepare you for this fast paced, dark erotic story, or the look into the pitch black mind of  Phoenix Sullivan..... what really scared me was to watch Vanessa's mind  slowly going over to the dark side. Or has she been there all along?StalkerFirst of all...... WOW, just, WOW! .....This story is just one revelation after another.  These characters  are so well develped, in fact they continue to develop all the way through as we share their memories, mistakes, and sins....Some believe that people are a product of their up bringing. Others believe that at some point we can choose how we are going to be. But what if that up bringing was so stringent, dark, abusive, never to feel loved,...so terrifing that it truly became the only way to survive?  To do or die...Or to do, so someone else doesn't die? ... This is such a story.  We get both POV's from Miles, who later becomes Phoenix Sullivan, a killer,  who has escaped prison with vengeance, his sole focus. and then there's  Vanessa, who is molded into the object that will further the power of her family, and much later, she escapes one hell, only to find herself in another hell, and to top it off, she knows he is coming for her, she is stalked, and hunted. She knew this day was coming, but she's not ready this soon.......There is so much going on.... stories within stories... secrets, deceptions, corruption, greed, and murder...I recommend this to adults who like a fast paced, dark, read. There is cruelty and violence involved.....  Are You Ready?","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJOQTH9F5IQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017FASIFG#wasThisHelpful","R2SJOQTH9F5IQZ","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"KARMAThis is a story of how different lives can become connected by the smallest of happenstance. It is a tale of greed, lust, abuse, cruelty, courage, trust and love.The characters are true to life and so believable that I found myself feeling what they felt and even had to stop and blow my nose and wipe away tears at the wedding!KARMA truly makes you believe in ""what goes around, comes around"".This is a tale of the courage of two totally different women, who despite unbelievable heart break and abuse learn to love again.There are vivid erotic scenes, and yummy role playing, so adults only please.I am hoping that Nikki isn't done with this. I would love to see Andre' get that truck load of good karma that Marcy is sure is heading his way and maybe see more of her and Mike too!Promises To KeepFirst I would like to say how much this story touched me ....Nikki & Zachary came together with the perfect mix of their talents and experience to give us this incredible story of a promise made and all that happens before, during and after that promise is kept.The cast of characters are true to life and exstremely well developed. I could honestly see them and feel what they felt. From the very first chapters, my emotions became invested and I was hooked! I ran the entire gambit of laughing, being afraid, getting angry, heartsick and even teared up several times. And I loved it that our very own Andr'e Chevalier was given an honorable mention. ( you rock Nikki)...Also, it is a fact that PTSD can happen to anyone who has any kind of a tragic life event, soilders or civilian. (thanks Zachary)Dr. Jack Curren, USMC , serving in Fallujah, Iraq and Laura Wynn, widow of Robert Wynn, USMC Corpsmen, living in North Carolina have lived through their own seperate brand of hell and survived. What Laura doesn't know is that hell isn't quite finished with her yet. It comes at her in the form of one Jonah Lacks, ex-boyfriend and OxyContin pill head.This is a story of these two people drawn together through letters, the comfort & strength they draw from each others words in their little corners of hell to be able to go on, so when they finally meet 6 months later it seems like a natural, easy thing to continue where they left off with the friendship which soon blooms into a sweet romance and then love. But Jack soon realizes all is not well in Laura's life despite the up beat and pleasant front she puts up. And Jack, well, he has his own secret and wonders now if he's waited too long to tell Laura the truth of Bob's death leading up to the ""promise."" Can this relationship continue in the light of truth? ..And Oh Yeah! Don't forget about the ex-boyfriend, Josh the pill head who has become exstremely unstable in his addiction and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. One person has already paid the ultimate price for getting in his way. Will Zack be next?What Wendy WantsThis is a very intriguing look at how a couple, Wendy and Frank, put life back into their relationship with the help of a Kindle, sex toys, love and trust. Having a good marriage and three children was all well and good but it doesn't replace the spark that seemed to fizzle over time with the saddest thing being that Frank had no idea it was happening until the day he found his wife's books of choice. I enjoyed following these two on their quest of rediscovery and do recommend it to any adult who enjoys a sexy romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AZW8JZBEPU7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017E2DKH6#wasThisHelpful","R2AZW8JZBEPU7L","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Her Dragon To Slay by, Julia Mills The detailed description of the large cast of characters really made me "" see"" and know each of them. Kyndel is a breath of fresh air as a strong woman in her own right. She is not some tall, slinky blonde. She has curves and always felt a little over weight. She has freckles and reddish hair with emerald green eyes. She cares about the people around her and is quick to help those in need. The only thing she is afraid of is walking alone in the dark, which is exactly how she meets Rayne Masterson. He quite literally crashes into her life on her walk home from work in the dark. It's all about the universe and destiny from there......This is a steamy romance of two mates finding each other, a story of the unconditional loyalty of brotherhood and all the laughter, games and fun they have together. This is also a story of unimaginable loss and betrayal......A Love For Somnus by, Nicole GarciaThis is really Somnus and Lailas story,but,  pretty much everyone gets in on the act. Actually, between Olympus and the Underworld, it's turning into a regular Peyton Place.Jupiter, the King, has been keeping some pretty significant secrets that I sure didn't see  coming. ....So, anyway, there are a couple hiccups to cure and get over for Somnus and Laila, but, O.M.G. when they do, hot, hot, hot is all I can say. At the start of this story, I just wanted to cry for Somnus. Then I spent the rest of the time chuckling, sighing, and Oh hell noing it. This book had me right up to the very last sentence..... Again, didn't see it coming at all! I am already wanting the next installment.Conjuring Darkness by, Melanie JamesI was totally captivated by the whole story line of magic, witches, an amulet and a love that transcends time and space.The characters are all well developed and the journey flowed smoothly so it's like I could actually see it play out in my minds eye.The relationship that grows between Lexi and Ryan is a mutually erotic romance, no games, just an amazing love that plays well within the story line as an ancient evil spirit and seven witches battle to open a portal buried centuries ago and recently uncovered that will release hell on earth! It comes down to an amulet. And just guess who has this amulet!!!!Chasing Magic by,  Gena D. LutzThe final trial, what every witch spends years working toward. Freedom to use magic outside the covens watchful eye..... Anika Webb is preparing for her final, and is carefully brewing her spell. ...Her boyfriend Drake, a very powerful Warlock, also happens to be son to the High Priestess. Pretty cool, right? ...... right up to when we get to Tamara, Anika's best friend, more like sisters really.  Well, not so much anymore for Tamara. She has let jealously for all of Anika's accomplishments eat away at her until blinding hatred drives her to sabotage the final trial  There are other things to deal with along the way, such as the Alpha Werewolf, Dante and his Crimson Wolves....An Imp, Cerin, half demon, half fairy, complete with a small side effect, and an accidental fairy who refuses to be human again.This is a quirky, romantic and thrilling read from start to finish, except that I don't think it's over yet. You see, while speaking to the High Priestess, Anika forgot to tell her a couple of things in all the excitement. But hey, there's always tomorrow, right?You need to read this yourself to learn about the result of the final trial, and what became of Tamara?Come and be captivated for a while.....Exquisite Breath of Darkness by, Candice StaufferI really enjoyed this story and being able to journey along with Mia and Joseph. Believe me, it is quite a journey that has you holding your breath with fear and at times, suspense at other times.The last chapter really made me change my mind about Eli and his convictions. I hope we see more of him in the future.This book can be a stand alone read, but I strongly recommend reading this series from the beginning as there are appearances by previous favorites and their stories are too good to miss.Absolutely great adult paranormal romance!Dark Love by Claudy ConnA remarkable tale of murder, lust, mystery, magic, revenge, love and a power so dark it ripples at the edges of reality itself. That said, I'd also like to say, there is just something so enchanting about Ireland which is where Chaz takes a job in order to continue her investagation. Her parents have been brutally murdered by what seems to be a serial killer and she is consumed with the need to avenge them. There is a mystery to be solved if she is going to find their killer.... Chaz is also coming into her own as a witch. All these stirrings of power and lust she is feeling are the last things she wants to be focused on. Then she meets Lord Jethro McBain..... dark and dangerously handsome. He is un like any other man she has ever encountered, He makes her feel things she has never felt before.

"Freaking WOW!....Could there have been any more twists or surprises? I am just floored, this is such a deep, emotional, and sinfully erotic story. Emily and Chris both are so true to life, so well developed that I felt like I knew them personally.... Emily works for a PR firm. Chris King is in desperate need of her services, but not just to clean up the mess that is his public image, he wants,... no, he needs her in his bed, or anywhere eles he can have her. These two have a history, and it's not very pretty. It goes all the back to high school. That's where he ruined her life. That's why she hates him. He is determined to get her forgivness. She belongs to him and it's about time she knew it.... This story moves along at a smooth pace, things are happening constantly. The sexual scenes are graphic and sinfully delicious.... Emily is forced to face her true feelings when the unthinkable happens and Chris is rushed to the hospital.....and we have a few cameo appearances from other family members, one of whom tells Emily something that changes everything.... This is a stand alone, but you can meet the rest of this family in THE POSSESSED SERIES. I do recommend this to 18+ readers","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HK7JJN0HA2Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RZQ4XK#wasThisHelpful","R3HK7JJN0HA2Y3","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"FATEThis is a fast and enjoyable read! Nikki does it again with brilliantly done characters and story line. Who doesn't like a great love story and hot sexiness with a twist?I thought it was great fun to watch Emily go get her man by changing into Candy. She was so good at it that Paul wanted her for longer than the one night stand she had planned for. After all, he refused her twice before as Emily, his best friends little sister. But he's wild for Candy! Now what's she gona do? She has loved Paul since childhood, this should be her dream come true, but what happens when he finds out who she really is? Oh what a tangled web......I absolutely recommend this to adults who enjoy erotic romance with a side of humourKINKPaul Jarman is a Dom. This story is told from his POV...It is the sequal to FATE but it can be read as a stand alone book.Paul is a man who never dates, there is never a comitment or Love....That was before Emily, Now he is committed and in Love! But can she handle his darker side? will he lose her? He knows he has been a Bastard in the past and thinks Emily is too good for him.So he courts her as per the advice he was given by Andre' Chevalier. he spends time talking with her, for a whole week they talked, flirted and teased each other but never went past second base. He is ready to make love to her and tells this, but he really can't remember ever making love before. He has dominated many women, but not made love to any.They spend time together at Mr. Jarman's store, running things while Pauls Father is ill. Emily has worked there for years but Paul is just back since his fathers illness and things only get better between them, the sex is hotter than ever but when Paul proposes and Emily says no, he becomes like a man on a mission. You will have to read for yourself...Really Cracked me up!But it isn't all fun & games as attemps on Paul & emily's life stir things up...Who & why?......Then Paul's Mother tells him that his biological father wants to meet him. She never told him about Paul and now that he knows (and he is dying) he would like to meet him. It turns out that he is a rock star , His band is famous from the 80's....There is a whole crazy story as to how Paul's Mother hooked up with him back then, again, you will have to read it.Then a brother he knew nothing about comes to his office and Paul stands there looking at his own face on this guy! Turns out they were born 3 days apart.(part of that crazy story)....So Paul is just overwhelmed at this point. What more could there be you ask? How about ......Paul gets shot!Yep, someone is still trying to kill him! I was surpirsed to learn the who & the why of it!There is a lot of Erotic, hot BDSM going on throughout, so Adults only Please.......I totally enjoyed Paul & Emily's story, All the action, mystery and Erotica too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38TC6OP90O0YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EKU3LQ#wasThisHelpful","R38TC6OP90O0YR","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, I've got to tell you, the first two chapters left me breathless, and that was just the begining! From there on out It was just raw emotions, any you can think of and some you never thought of.....The one who tricked Evangeline with words of love, lied to her, used her as a sex slave, abused and tortured her, not to mention the one who turned her and then  abandoned her, drove her into a kind of a frenzy that made her search for someone that would love her, belong to her forever. Someone that would not be taken away from her or leave her. But time and time again she is left alone, broken, and tormented.....Now her maker, Bastian, is back and he has someone very special to Evangeline with him. Could this be the redemtion she seeks? Her joy is short lived however when she learns what her maker wants of her. ( and he is sounding more insane by the minute)  Will this new round of torment end with her being forced to meet the sun?Evangeline became more real to me as she continues to develope through the telling of her story.  The amazing detail put into each scene made me ""see"" it happening, and I could  ""feel"" her sorrows as well as her joy. I can't remember the last time a story moved me to tears as this one has. Especially for a character I so recently disliked. I do recommend this to adults only.

"I loved so much about this story it's hard to know where to begin.... The first thing for me without a doubt,  It's an adult saga with adult, well developed characters that are as true to life as I am, with the same ups and downs, trials, tribulations, hopes and dreams as any one of us.... I identified with Alexandra in the loss of her father and then her husband. But she is no shrinking violet, Alex is the owner of her own successful bakery. Walter, her late husband also had a good job, so she is more than fine financially. So when she meets Jesse Bond, who is rich by the way, it's not the Billionaire and the poor girl being rescued turned to true love stuff...... Nope, this is a journey of two hearts. One that is ready to embrace ""forever"" again with someone and one that feels ""forever"" isn't in the cards at all......This is a madcap world of friends, pranks, relatives that mean well and just about every flavor of sexy and erotic in between...... It is a captivating whirlwind of enjoyable reading.... I for one hope it isn't over yet. This is really too good to be just a one book affair.

"Possessed Part OneFirst I'd like to say how much I enjoyed reading part one from this debut Author. A breath of fresh air... It's about a big woman instead of the ever popular Barbie doll skinny, young and beautiful girls. Samantha Webber is a big curvy fake red head with all the insecurities the rest of us ""fat"" woman have. She has a job as an assistant to the billionaire and CEO of W Magazine, Leo King. And although he is knock down gorgeous, and she appreciates that, this is not a love at first sight story for Samantha. In fact she can't stand her boss most of the time! He tramples all over her privacy and personal time. He can be obnoxious. He ignores her unless he needs her. No small talk or friendly conversation. But he pays really, really well so she resists the urge to throw things at him in frustration....Instead she goes to her on line friend, Mr. Awesome. No names, no faces just sexual release. People who don't know anything about each other getting each other off. Samantha loves being dominated. They send pictures back and forth as she follows his demands. She never has to worry about a man breaking her heart just because he finds it amusing. This gets real interesting within the story. I just had to laugh, even as I felt for her....Samantha is called into Mr. Kings office. He needs her and what he needs has something to do with the pictures she had to delete from his phone (and hers) from a Las Vegas trip where he got drunk. And I mean Hammered to where he didn't even remember sending those pictures to her phone. He tells her the whole story and it ends with him calling his parents and telling them he got married! So, now he has to go to a family gathering with a wife! I can't even begin to tell you what a fiasco this turns into, it would spoil all the fun and I don't do spoilers. Let me just say that there is more going on here than meets the eye and after the cliffhanger at the end, I can't wait for part two! I do believe that I have found a new favorite Author!Part TwoPart Two picks up exactly where part one left us...... the extraordinary truth about the ""real wife"" comes to light, and believe me, it is a stunning example of what lengths a person's greed and jealousy can go to, and what their willing to do to get what they want, even if it can potentially destroy what that is.There are several different things going on here and watching them each play out, in, and around each other really had me glued to Sam's side..... I wanted to drop kick me some Leo, even as I kind of felt sorry for his dilemma. And there is just no denying the chemistry between Leo and Sam.....so erotic! But so is her on line sessions with mrawesome....Oh My Gawd, Hot, Hot, Hot!!I have come to know that with this Author, the devil's in the details, clues, hints and seemingly unimportant events are anything but, which is why I am so looking forward to part three. Not to mention the cliffhanger we are left with!Part ThreeDrama, erotic romance and retribution all come together brilliantly to finish this trilogy.Marilyn continues with her evil plans to become CEO of the magazine. She believed in that twisted mind of hers, if she got Sam out of the picture, it could all be hers.Sam does something that has dramatic consequences...... Leo fires her.....it looks like Marilyn got what she wanted and she signs the divorce papers, but she will never be CEO, so it looks like it's all good for Leo too, or it would be if only Sam would answer her phone, text messages, or email. Leo wants her, and by God, he will have her... he pulls out all the stops in order to reach her....but Sam is feeling, used, her heart is shattered. Is there even a way to come back from such devastation? She gave it all, all of herself to him, and he callously threw her away. But whats really killing her is the fact that shattered or not, her heart and her body still wants Leo, Sir, all of it...... You have got to read this phenomenal trilogy yourself. I can see a brite future ahead for this new Author. A brilliant beginning indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PM0MDZIX3AZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01220MMAG#wasThisHelpful","R1PM0MDZIX3AZR","ACNA2DX8FTGWG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACNA2DX8FTGWG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To Light The Dragon's FireThat Blurb you read for this book tells you about how Terra Heggan is going to sacrifice her own happiness to save the family business. She is going to marry into money....To Terra, it's no big deal as she thinks she is well past the age of finding true love anyway.So she and her younger twin sister Lanni go rock climbing, a last adventure as a single woman.....Man, she has no idea what an adventure they are both about to embark on! Like ending up in another reality kind of adventure...I don't want to give spoilers so I will just tell you that all the different mythological creatures within the five Kingdoms of this reality just boggle the mind. And you remember how Terra said she would never find true love? Yeah, we all know how that goes.....just when your not looking for it, Shazam! Turns out that King Draven, who can shift into a dragon is Terra's intended. But it would seem that someone else wants the throne & all the power that goes with it and will stop at nothing to get it. There is so much going on here, plots within plots, friends that could be foe. This had me from the very first chapter right to the very last sentence, which left me with my jaw hitting the floor having an Oh No No No moment.To Save The Broken HeartIT IS really Arin's story but we see all our old (and some new) friends get into the fray as one rescue mission turns into two.Arin Manus, war advisor to King Draven is to face death in the arena for crimes he didn't commit and his assassin may be his one true mate!Lanni Heggan, Who IS ALIVE after all, but is tricked while on her way to rescue Arin is taken prisoner so Golix can use a power she didn't even know she possessed!The people and creatures of Bak'ra are in danger from the very person who was appointed as King Draven's replacement, but......Is he dead?Absolute chaos abounds!I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for you. But just let me say that the twists and turns and astonishing things that happen in this installment are mind benders!Margaret Taylor Has created a world of five kingdoms, the likes of which I have never experienced before. The inhabitants of these Kingdoms are a mix of mythical, human, and Imagination and any derivative there of! Some are delightful,& scary. Most are magical in some form or another and some are Dark, just pure evil.To Free The Dragons SoulThis is the 3rd installment to a most remarkable series, It follows smooth and true from the first two books where we see some old friends that we learn more about as they continue to develope,as well as new characters, some of which will become friends, comrades and mates. I'm still delighted with the every kind of mythological caracters with a twist,... most can shift to being humanoid. One of the newbies is a little round fur ball called a Ilthe. his name is Tollo. generally speaking, Ilthe's are guardians of the dragons but will go pretty much whever they are needed. Tollo has some unique abilities and I'm not sure we've seen all of them yet......Anyway, Golix, that most vile of Unicorns is moving forward with his plans for the 5 Kingdoms while Draven and company try to gather forces and at the same time figure out what Golix plans are. Why is he going back and forth to the human world? What is he doing? Then, Tyleios Cannis, interin King of Bra'ka turns on the very people he promised to protect. That's all I will say about that except to say, it's only the begining... The end game is so diabolical, the sacrifices made, the loss of lives, all the suffering and it may not have been enough! It becomes clear that this has been years in the planning. Will the five Kingdoms fall? This is one journey you will have to make for yourself.

"This is without a doubt one of the best series I've ever read.. The action never stops and the missions get more in your face  with danger, mystery, betrayal, and loss as the series unfolds. This of course brings this motley crew together, and we see them bond as an elite special opps,, last line of defense team.......  There are however some religious references throughout,  PLEASE keep in mind this a work of FICTION.I absolutely adored the large cast of well developed characters, but Lopez will forever be my favorite.. He is the "" Pull a rabbit out of the hat"" go to guy and gets the team away from danger or death on a regular basis. I know you will enjoy meeting Stark, who is the eye in sky computer geek who, along with the assistance of his mother keeps the team informed any way they can, even if a little hacking here and there is needed. They have been indispensable as far as intell on any mission, and my idea of help from above, well, along with the team's sniper on the roof, and that would beDavidson. ( He has a rather remarkable history).....There are so many more absolutely unique team members, it's impossible to tell you about all of them.

"It feels like I have been waitong so long for this third book of the Viper series, but I just have to say, it was worth the wait! I so enjoyed getting back together with the band and seeing old friends....yes, yes, I know this is Saul's story, and what a story it is too! I did tear up a couple of times, but I laughed some too.( I blame Cruz)I highly suggest reading the first two books ( Rock The Viper & Forever Viper) as they are relevant to understanding the  ""Then""  that gets us to the  ""Now"" of what's going on with the Viper band members, who by the way are Vampire!  So......One night at the club, Saul meets Jade, and there is most certainly something there. He swore he could never love again, not after Julia.... As he is soul searching, Saul tells us about his painfull past and how he lost his entwined, his beloved Julia... he knows how he feels about Jade, but can he let go of past hurts and love again?

"I won this debut book in a giveaway from the author. I am always excited to read "" new blood"", and I sure wasn't disapointed.Bentley Celeste is an erotic, & dark romance author who hides from the world due to a very dark and disturbing past. She has a mother who hates her. Always has, always will. In fact, if Darla Celeste could find Bentley, it could be the end for her. She has been trying to kill her since before she was even born. Darla did not want twins, and put her all into Cora ( the pretty one) her ticket to grandeur on the heels of Cora's modeling career.Bentley and Cora are twins, ( albeit completely opposite) Cora, thin and willowy..Bentley is short and curvy and has  suffered her mothers wrath, both verbally & physically all of her life which left scars inside as well as outside for Bentley. It's left her a very broken girl who has no idea how it feels to be loved. She lives a solitary life, alone with some very dark secrets, with very few people within her small circle....Then one day she her life is turned upside down when she is almost literally walked over by cover model Tristan Reece. ...Tryst isn’t your average man candy, he has a lot of his own baggage & secrets He is dealing with, including nightmares he still suffers from his stint in the military. He has a face and body that lets him have his way. That is until Bentley goes all hell fire missle on him. She has zero tollerance for that crap, and just wait until you find out why! This chick just can't catch a break in this horrendance life she is forced to live. ... At the same time I was feeling bad for Tryst. The poor guy just can't seem to do anything right where Bentley is concerned. He starts out with the best of intentions and I get my hopes up for them,... they really are magic together, then, ...you know those secrets and stuff I was telling you about?  Yeah, one of those happens...... and, well, ..... I'm still routing for them...The characters are all well developed, and true to life like which really made this an emotional read for me. The twists, turns, surprise and secrets kept me off balance right through to the cliffhanger. I am so going to read the conclusion of this story.

""The universe is infinite""We get to see Ember live the life's of a requisitions expert and then as an FBI agent just to name two..... in each life she has very smexy hot erotic encounters with men who are drool worthy, yep, this action along with all the intrique and drama that she finds every time she is thrust into another life time was enough to keep me reading till the end.

"""Killer"" is a brilliantly written prequel to the coming soon, "" Stalker"".. All the characters are really well developed.

"First of all...... WOW, just, WOW! .....This story is just one revelation after another.  These characters  are so well develped, in fact they continue to develop all the way through as we share their memories, mistakes, and sins....Some believe that people are a product of their up bringing. Others believe that at some point we can choose how we are going to be. But what if that up bringing was so stringent, dark, abusive, never to feel loved,...so terrifing that it truly became the only way to survive?  To do or die...Or to do so someone else doesn't die? ... This is such a story.  We get both POV's from Miles, who later becomes Phoenix Sullivan, a killer,  who has escaped prison with vengeance, his sole focus. and then there's  Vanessa, who is molded into the object that will further the power of her family, and much later, she escapes one hell, only to find herself in another hell, and to top it off, she knows he is coming for her, she is stalked, and hunted. She knew this day was coming, but she's not ready this soon.......There is so much going on.... stories within stories... secrets, deceptions, corruption, greed, and murder... They first  meet as children and become friends. For Miles (a rebellious foster kid) it was love at first sight. He would do anything to protect her. But Vanessa is forbidden to have anything to do with him, her life is planned out and it doesn't include that"" dirty boy.""  She is going to grow up and marry Phillip so the two families become stronger. Richer. Powerful.... and in the background (just quitely waiting) is Arthur, Phillip's greedy, jealous, brother.She continues to sneek and see Miles, They become very close, and on prom night, he is there to rescue her again. He sweeps her away and in his car they become lovers.... This truly marks the begining of the end for them. The betrayal, lies, and rejection that follows makes an already volatile Miles prime pickins for ""The Company"".... He is recruited by none other than Mr. X.... He is taught to kill without remorse, it is where he becomes Phoenix.... contract killer.Vanessa is in deep trouble.... She out witted him once. Can she survive long enough to do it again?... because what she doesn't know..... Phoenix isn't the only one who wants to end her life.I recommend this to adults who like a fast paced, dark, read.

"If you've read the blurb, you know that Kaypahl sacrifices herself. This is the story of a girl with such a pure heart, she continues to love those who only ridicule and reject her. Even her own sister who was once  unattractive also, turned on her when she blossomed into a beauty with womanhood.... all except the princess Leepak, she always had a warm smile and a wave for all, even a peck on the cheek for a child offering her a flower. But she is concerned that her people will starve if the rains don't come soon. Chaac has not been pleased by any of the sacrifices made so far. ...believing that she won't even be missed, she offers to be the next sacrifice...... at least her family will be proud of her then.So she is at the old ruins, at the foot of the temple. These ruins have been her only friend. Where she would pour her heart out and the stone would listen to her. Now she comes to say good bye..... she here's a voice that says..."" when the time comes, run as fast and hard as you can, when you fly through the air, stand tall & proud but point your toes, when you sink, spread your arms like a bird taking flight."" "" when you sacrifice yourself for the sake of your people, I will meet you on the other side.""So after they adorn her, get her ready and then parade through the city streets, thousands of people cheering, chanting her name, past the kings palace where the royal family stood in all their regala.When she is in place, she remembers what the voice told her, so she runs as fast as she can and hurles herself towards the water below.....She wakes up confused... there's a woman with her. It's Chaac's daughter. He told her to retrieve you & revive you. It's not your time to die. There is something about this woman, Kaypahl is reminded of Princess Leepak.........There is an amazing journey ahead, lessons to be learned, some surprises, and an absolutely remarkable resolution for Kaypahl.I started this journey feeling sad for Kaypahl, but I couldn't have been happier for her in the end.

Gabe, his cousin's, Tristan and Julian together own one of the largest securities company and along with being private investigators are owners or investors in many other things. One of them is the new club that Samantha's best friend, Kendra just opened up. It's here, at the grand opening that Sam meets the sex on a stix bartender named Gabe.From here things get quite erotic as Sam is introduced to new and exciting sexual horizons with Kendra while being drawn to Gabe..... this is like her fantasizing all becoming real, and that would have been wonderful except for everything that is also about to overflow into her life, courtesy of the real bad men that Kendra got mixed up in. The very same men that killed Gabes wife. Now Gabe is dead set on protecting Sam, this woman who has broken through his wall, and made him feel again. ..........then the unthinkable happens, not once but twice! ....is history going to repeat itself?

"Dazzled By Silver....This is a Brilliant beginning to what I believe is going to be an exciting and amazing trilogy......Here we meet Samantha Connor who is just out of a dead end relationship. One that she thought she'd be safe in, or at least her heart would be safe from falling in love. She has loved and lost, all at the age of seventeen through a disease that destroyed her, even as it slowly took her love from her. She vowed never to love again.........We also meet Gabriel Silver. He has also vowed never to love again after the death of his wife which he blames himself for. Gabe, his cousin's, Tristan and Julian together own one of the largest securities company and along with being private investigators are owners or investors in many other things. One of them is the new club that Samantha's best friend, Kendra just opened up. It's here, at the grand opening that Sam meets the sex on a stix bartender named Gabe.From here things get quite erotic as Sam is introduced to new and exciting sexual horizons with Kendra while being drawn to Gabe..... this is like her fantasizing all becoming real, and that would have been wonderful except for everything that is also about to overflow into her life, courtesy of the real bad men that Kendra got mixed up in. The very same men that killed Gabes wife. Now Gabe is dead set on protecting Sam, this woman who has broken through his wall, and made him feel again. ..........then the unthinkable happens, not once but twice! ....is history going to repeat itself? This leads us to the second installment as one thing is resolved, another event presents itself! I do recommend this to adults who enjoys mystery, romance, and explicit sexual scenariosLayers Deep.....This installment leads into where the last one left us. Tristan is bringing the full force of Cross industries to bear on rescuing Kendra. And to that end recruits Allie Green, the rookie cop we met briefly in the last book. She has her own reasons for wanting the job. She needs the available resources to carry out her own agenda for revenge...to kill the man responsible for her father's death and rape of her mother which resulted in the death of the unborn baby girl she carried.What she didn't count on was the draw they both seem to share for each other and how complicated things could get because of it.....This is a no holds barred look at the underbelly of human traffickers and the humiliation and cruelty that the victims are subjected to. Can Allie handle the part of a victim so as to get to Kendra? Especially after learning about the history between her & Tristan? Is what they have together a lie? Is he using her to get Kendra back because he still loves her? How is she suppose to stay focused and not get them both killed? ......this is the one you don't want to miss out on, because you know that what ever can go wrong, usually will! And the cliffhanger on this one, yep....there is one, and it's a definite....Oh. Hell. No. moment.......Layers Peeled..... just so loved this installment. The surprises just kept on coming, some good, some tear jerking great, some not so good and some down right heartbreaking. But I just couldn't put it down, between the non stop action and the awe inspiring erotica, my pulse was all over the place. The whole Cross family is in this one, from weddings to births to,...well, you just have to read this one. I strongly recommend starting from the beginning with Dazzled by Silver, so you get to know this large, truly amazing family. They are a bunch of well developed characters that I'm sure will captivate you too. I can't say too much more without giving away all the good stuff.

"Epic has really distinguished themselves as ""getting it"" as far as what Paleo people want to buy as convenience foods. I started eating Paleo about 3 years ago and I really like the way I feel. I have been able to effortlessly maintain my weight and it is pretty easy to eat in restaurants...but snack foods are another story. I travel a lot and sometimes you are just going to get stuck looking at some nasty airport food. I try and carry some convenience foods with me when I travel. This is a wonderful snack that is 100% Paleo, and tastes wonderful. I probably would have not tought to pair toasted coconut with jerky....but they work well together.

"I feel a lot of reviews of this product are not fair. While I guess there could be genuine issues....the real reason for complaints about this product are almost undoubtedly from product misuse. The company I work for makes residental water heater elements. I have sat through endless meetings with engineers about how electric elements work...so I have a little more knowledge of submersible elements. This item is designed in an identical way to a home electric water heater element. Electricity flows through a copper core in the center of the element producing heat, which is then dispersed throughout the liquid it is submersed in. If the element is not A. fully submersed or B. taken out even for a second while plugged in....it will dry fire. What is a dry fire? The tiny copper wire inside the element overheats in one spot and breaks...stopping the flow of electrons and thus the heat. There is no way to fix it...it is just game over...throw it away. ANY plumber will tell you that tank dry fires are the #1 cause of element failures in residential water heaters. Thus you can see the opportunity to just by a very brief careless moment to dry fire this element. Don't have it submersed to the lip of the cup...congratulations...you just dry fired it, throw it away. Took it out of the cup before unplugging it? Congratulations...you just dry fired it, throw it away...game over. I have been using mine for many months while traveling and have not had an issue at all...however I am quite vigilant about how I use it...careful to fill the cup to the top...even covering the clip on the handle...and then I unplug it about 30 seconds before taking it out of the cup. If you do this...you won't ever have a problem....if you do? You'll be on Amazon venting your anger with a crappy review over your own negligence. Since no hotel in Las Vegas has in room coffee...this little bably saves me $4.00 a day plus an early AM trip to the lobby. This is always on my Vegas or international travel ""must take"" list, along with some Starbucks instant coffee...mug and sugar. If you are a methodical vigilant person...don't be scared by the bad reviews.

"Easier to finger than I anticipated, with tone also better than I expected.  I tuned as recommended, and played mostly open chords with a few bar chords up to the fifth fret.  I even did a bit of fingerpickin', as well as flat-pickin'.  I can ease back in the recliner and play, which was my hope when ordering.  My fat fingers adjusted to it quickly - that isn't as much of an issue as a few claim.  Playing this gem is simply pure fun, and my guitar buddies thought so, too.

"Due to health issues I sold my guitars a couple years ago, keeping only a Yamaha CG100A classical model.  I have lost some dexterity in my hands, but playing the nylon-stringed classical instrument restored a fair bit - finally to the point where I began to consider a new steel-strung dreadnought.  I have owned an Ovation (decades ago), an expensive Guild, a Takamine, and several others in the past.  I didn't want to spend a lot, even though I could go as high as $1200 comfortably.  For my ability and use, that would be wasteful.  After considering many, I finally narrowed my decision to two Yamahas - either the FG700S or the FG730S (I felt the 720 was too close in price to the 730 to be appealing).So I decided upon the FG730S, and put it in my Amazon cart.  However, I had left messages for two Craigslist sellers - one had a 700, the other a 730.  Pics of both looked good, and the story for each was the same - wife bought for hubby as first guitar and neither ever learned to play.  The phone rang before I could proceed with my order.  The 700 owner was willing to deliver immediately for my counter-offer (which was near his asking) and thirty minutes later I was checking out the guitar.  Natural finish - which is my preference and is what I had put in the cart.  Just a beautiful guitar, with great sound and excellent action, with no fret-buzz or any other issues requiring adjustment.  Thus my review of the 700 is based on my used one, which actually looks new.Boy, I really wanted the FG730S, but I doubt that I'd hear any difference between the two - at least with me being the player.  Nor can I imagine it playing any better as far as its action is concerned.  In fact, this is the best-playing guitar I've owned, despite having spent enough on one to buy at least three of these, new, or four at my used price.  Nor have any sounded better.  Very good guitar tonally.  Us rank amateurs are lucky that Yamaha makes great guitars affordable.Fate sold me a 700, and it is all the guitar I need, and much better than I had hoped to find in its price range.  You need not spend a grand or more to buy a very good guitar, unless you desire a more exclusive name, fancier decorative touches or different materials - or are advanced enough and experienced enough to have developed a set of preferences that preclude this model.  For many of us, a Yamaha FG700S is a great choice which will never become a limiting factor, either from the standpoint of playability or sound.  And you will never have to make apologies for it in rarefied company, nor hang your head in shame.  If you ever become accomplished enough to feel you've outgrown it, then congratulations are much in order.  Buy with confidence.One of the main reasons I wanted a 730 instead of this 700 was appearance, I think the blond, natural top contrasts well with the Rosewood sides.  If you can stretch your budget the 730 is an excellent choice, just as is the 700 at its price.  The buyer is very likely to be satisfied with either one.  I already love my 700.  It is a definite keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUXBQNKLM7EEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIZISQ#wasThisHelpful","RUXBQNKLM7EEM","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chair back is hard steel, with edges - don't expect comfort as it digs into your back - not a model for actually leaning back, better to stay stooped forward with elbows on the bar..  Comes with short screws for attaching seat, but they are far too short for the padded seat - won't reach wood - so are useless.  (Some finishes come with unpadded wood seat - short screws are for those.) Only two long screws are included, so four more are needed for every order of the padded-seat models, including those with black finish.  Seller pretends not to have figured this out (despite all the complaints in these reviews), so you must either contact him to beg for the rest of the order (more screws) or go out and buy some if you don't have appropriate screws on hand.  Swivel is stiff, not smooth.  I'm not certain that the hard plastic feet are any softer than the metal tubing from which they protrude - be careful when dragging across your hardwood floors.  Better to lift them, but they are a bit heavy so some folks will have trouble doing so.  Good chair for kids in a frat house, but many adults may find them unaccommodating.  Not a happy purchase for me, whether considering vendor or product.  Wish I could return the two I purchased, but I don't want to eat the return shipping, nor try to fit them back into the box.  I still need two more chairs, but these will not do.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H0NXCLWMD30G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLSEH6I#wasThisHelpful","R1H0NXCLWMD30G","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Ferris above said it well, fresh, inventive and energetic, yes.  I'm new to this artist - he's a good singer with a voice that fits the style of music, which is a smooth and fun amalgam of Dixieland, swing, jazz, country, bluegrass and blues which he blends cleverly in his own genre-defying way.  The result is a sophisticated, but fun sound sure to please all who love a bit of variety in their music listening.  I am sure to buy more Pokey in the near future.

"For me, Yes best albums are:#1 Close to the Edge#2 Yessongs (or Progeny Highlights)#3 The Yes Album (1971)#4 Fragile#5 Tales from Topographic Oceans#6 Relayer#7 Yes Symphonic DVDThough I own other titles, the first four of these get the most play, while the first two (now three) get the lion's share.  I have been a Yes fan since 1971.  While I realize that many music fans my age remain stuck in the past, that is not the case with me;  my taste in music has broadened over the years, and I listen to more genres than anyone I know.  My collection reflects that, as it also reveals that I have continued to listen to new artists right up to the present.  I believe every generation has its music prodigies.  So, it isn't because I'm stuck in the past (I'm not) that I prefer Yes's earlier works.  To my ear, they are the best.  The most complex and intricate, with the best songs and the best line-up for the earlier of these.  Of course, that is opinion - what holds true for me isn't gospel.  Those who prefer others speak with no more - nor less - validity than I.Yessongs has been my favorite for decades.  However, that was not the case the first few weeks after I purchased the LP upon its release.  The first listen was somewhat disappointing, the recording sounded weak and flawed.  It sounded that way because it was, and is, both.  It didn't help that the recording level of the LP was very low, requiring the volume knob of my receiver to be jacked up.  Despite its flaws, however, there was a rawness, a truth, and a sense of there-ness emanating from the grooves that kept me coming back.At first I continued to prefer the near-perfection of the studio versions of these songs, but as time passed the allure of the live cuts beckoned ever more insistently, and I came to prefer the Yessongs versions.  Progeny Highlights offers a slightly cleaner window, and I enjoy it very much.  However, Yessongs (now on CD - finally had to let go of all vinyl) has a warmer, if blurred, presentation that is almost tube-like to my ear, so I listen to both these about equally.  Together, Yessongs and PH combine to get most of my Yes attention.For live Yes, either of these is a good choice - you don't really need both.  The Yes Symphonic Live DVD is also a contender for good live Yes, adding the visual element - the best cut on that is CTTE.  I prefer the two CDs discussed but video may be a strong pull for some, and it isn't a bad choice.  When it comes to Yessongs vs PH, modern sensibilities will likely prefer the more detailed sound character of PH.  I lean slightly toward the warmer, fuzzier Yessongs, but am happy to have both.Tracklists:Yessongs:Opening Firebird SuiteSiberian KhatruHeart of the SunrisePerpetual ChangeAnd You and IMood for a DayExcerpts Six Wives of Henry VIIIRoundabout  [end disc one]I've Seen All Good PeopleLong Distance RunaroundClose to the EdgeYours Is No DisgraceStarship Trooper  [end disc two]Progeny Highlights:Opening Firebird SuiteI've Seen All Good PeopleHeart of the SunriseClap/Mood for a DayAnd You and I  [end disc one]Close to the EdgeExcerpts Six Wives Henry VIIIRoundaboutYours Is No Disgrace [end disc two]PH's lack of Siberian Khatru, Perpetual Change, and Starship Trooper vs Yessongs' inclusion is significant in my mind.  Presumably they would be included in Progeny's Box Set for much more jack.  You pays your money and you makes your choice.  In my case, since I like both albums, I'd likely opt for Yessongs extra tracks over PH's slight increase in clarity if I had to choose one, but I can easily understand going the other way.  In conclusion, for those who desire live Yes, either of these choices will likely please, while those who are annoyed by live deviations compared with Studio tracks can pass these by unless feeling venturesome.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQROA50CGGXLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U39G62E#wasThisHelpful","RQROA50CGGXLK","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I saw a Boxcar Willie commercial on TV many decades ago, I thought he was just some unheard-of wannabe with a hobo gimmick.  It would be a few years later that my dad bought an LP and loved it, but it yet took me a couple years to really listen.  Okay, so his name, clothing and five o'clock shadow were a gimmick - but there was nothing tricky about that voice and his singing style.  He didn't try to rock up a song, or jazz it up, or soul it up.  He sang country songs straight up, just as his accompaniment played it - unashamedly country - but with an effortless vocal delivery which reveals a singer with excellent octave range and pleasing timbre.  He once described himself as Vanilla.Sometimes we want Rocky Road, or Buttered Almond, or Strawberry Cheesecake, but the most popular ice cream flavor - year-in, year-out - remains Vanilla.  It's sort of like hearing the National Anthem at a ball-game;  it's rare to get a straight-up vocal rendition of it these days, and many of us really appreciate it when we hear it.  You can count on Boxcar Willie - and his instrumentalists - not to mess up a song, and, furthermore, to perform it well.  The sound quality of this download is very good - clean and dynamic - and the song selection outstanding.Don't get me wrong, I like many genres of music, and many different styles.  When I want country, I have many choices in my collection, from bluegrass to country, old and new.  But there is no doubt that Boxcar Willie gets as much play as any, and more than most.  Sometimes you just can't beat Vanilla.  Don't even hesitate to pull the trigger on this album whether you are new to Willie or a long-time fan - you won't regret it.PS:  I also downloaded eight more songs and tucked them into this album with my Zune software, which made the collection perfect for me.  I added Orange Blossom Special, Forty Acres, Precious Memories, Teddy Bear, Girl on the Billboard, Blue Moon of Kentucky, My Heart's Deep in the Heart of Texas and Convoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHWIOTHOFY3XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A649OU#wasThisHelpful","RHWIOTHOFY3XA","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My musical taste runs far and wide - various jazz styles from swing to bop to smooth, rock of all stripes from the Carpenters to Judas Priest to Epica with  a good deal of prog, folk, soul, R&B, reggae, zydeco, polka, vocal stylists singing standards, classical of different eras and various styles, and some opera. So there isn't much I don't enjoy, and my music collection reflects the variety.  My love of country music, then, includes old and new and much in-between.  I tire of those who love to hate on new country as much as I tire of those who love to hate on the old.  There is music I don't enjoy, but I never insult those who enjoy it by denigrating the style or type of music;  I simply say that I don't enjoy it, not my cup of tea.  In the end we are only the arbiters of that which we enjoy.  I wrote this in reply to the haters so evident among so many reviewers at this site.  I enjoy the recording under discussion here very much.My dad was a big Jimmy Rodgers fan, as well as loving Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams - so I grew up hearing those fellows, but I never really was exposed to Lefty Frizzell, other than an occasional song .  Probably I heard him some over the years, not knowing who was singing.  Lately I've been adding more bluegrass and older styles of country to my collection.  I've been thoroughly enjoying Lefty's smooth delivery, interesting vocal timbre and the unstrained quality of his voice. Great singer, with a voice reminiscent of Hank - but smoother (I love Hank, but his voice does turn a bit strident sometimes, though recording quality available to him is likely a factor, too).Lefty certainly deserves the accolades his fans have afforded him over the years.  Recording quality here is very good.  Not sure why I waited until my sixties to add him to my collection, but, on the other hand, it gives me more 'new' music.  Yep, great new country here!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6QA7JKHAZSTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002AD4#wasThisHelpful","R6QA7JKHAZSTH","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great collection of many of the classic bluegrass hits.  If you like bluegrass but aren't interested in putting together an extensive (and expensive) artist-by-artist collection - or if you are new to the genre - then this nine-dollar collection of thirty greats is hard to beat.  In my case, I already had a few bluegrass albums which included quite a few of these songs.  I began by putting tunes I wanted in the MP3 cart, but soon had ten songs and still wanted more, so I bought the whole album since that was more affordable..  Sound quality is excellent - and I'm pretty picky about that.  The duplications I have with other albums don't bother me at all - putting this album on and letting it play makes for a pleasurable and varied listen.  Diehard fans already have all these songs, but for us more casual fans, this hits all the right buttons.  Forget the Redneck moniker and goofy art, this is a seriously good collection.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1S4PDUEKSZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR8DE0K#wasThisHelpful","RB1S4PDUEKSZC","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She gave me an unexpected gift in return, so a good time was had by all.I researched this choice thoroughly, and found this model consistently rated in the top five, but more affordable than most.  Owner satisfaction is among the best, too.  We are changing to brushed nickel fixtures in the kitchen, so that was a serendipitous match, also.

"We are remodeling our kitchen, adding a large island which is designed to include three large, deep drawers down low, with smaller drawers above.  My cabinet guy had no luck finding HD slides locally, so after searching many online sites, I decided these were the best value - if they lived up to the heavy-duty claims.  We ordered three pair of these, and when they arrived and my hired man opened the box, all present were highly impressed with the quality.  Exciting for a group of working men, using phrases like badass to describe the slides. They are indeed heavy, and they glide as smooth as silk.  You get a satisfying amount and heft of smooth, strong steel and just holding the rail for a single side is impressively heavy.  At around 450 bucks for the set of three, they weren't cheap, but the high quality is obvious - you can see and feel where the money went.

"Beautiful MusicRock Band:  CamelAlbum:  “The Snow Goose”The HistoryIn 1940, as Germany proceeded with its war for world domination, they entered France.  French armed forces fighting with assistance from Great Britain's BEF (British Expeditionary Force) were no match for the German onslaught.  England had hoped to help keep France free, because the English Channel is pretty narrow – only twenty miles across at the Strait of Dover.  Outgunned and over-matched, the forces retreated all the way to the port city of Dunkirk with the Germans at their heels.  The French and English forces faced imminent slaughter or surrender, a certain defeat.However, two German Generals failed to press the attack at that point, inexplicably deciding instead to pause and regroup for three days to make sure none of their opponents could evade fate.  Those three days gave many of the 300,000 British and French fighting men a chance to evacuate Dunkirk, crossing the Channel to Great Britain by using every type of boat available along the coast.  Civilian boat owners came in droves, making multiple runs across the channel, with quite a few losing their craft – and their lives – to the enemy.  So this, in broad strokes, is a synopsis of the evacuation during the Battle of Dunkirk, fought in late May/early June 1940.  True history.Also true is that an author, Paul Gallico, born in 1897 and thus 43 years old at the time, became inspired to write a short story soon after reading newspaper accounts of the battle and evacuation, and used those events as the backdrop to his work of fiction, which was published in 1940 in the Saturday Evening Post not long after the actual battle (years later he would write “Poseidon Adventure”).  In 1940 “The Snow Goose” was published as a short story but would grow into a novella within a year.The StoryA lonely hunchback artist moves into a lighthouse near Dunkirk to paint birds and to lead his outcast, solitary life.  Walking the beach one day he finds a young lady named Fritha trying to assist a wounded snow goose.  He helps, and together they nurse the bird back to health until it can continue its migratory lifestyle thus building a bond between the disfigured artist and the girl.  However, after the goose flies away the artist sees the young lady no more... for a year.  However, a year later the bird returns to the lighthouse during his annual migration.  Rhayader (the artist's name) immediately sends for Fritha with word of their feathered friend's return.  She quickly arrives to see the goose.  During subsequent migratory years, the goose continues to return, strengthening Rhayader and Fritha's bond until romance seems nigh.  Finally the goose returns to the lighthouse to stay.It is then that word of the soldiers' plight in Dunkirk is broadcast with a plea for boats to respond to the need.  Rhayader takes his boat, and the bird flies along behind him as he makes trip after trip to save as many soldiers as possible.  Finally, his boat is hit by enemy fire and Rhayader and his boat are sunk into the sea.  The goose flies back to Fritha at the lighthouse, who considers it the soul of Rhayader bidding her farewell.In 1975, 35 years after the battle and the published story, the rock group Camel wrote music inpired by the story.  It is a really good album, all instrumental, and probably would not be considered rock by many listeners.  It is well-known and loved by fans of progressive rock (aka prog rock) and is a soothing listen.  Highly recommended.[This is a very brief account written by me, using various sources, and is likely to contain errors of fact.  However, it does indicate the essential history of this example of historical fiction, published so soon after the actual battle, for those who were unaware of what this music is all about.  The story had quite an emotional impact upon many readers, both then and since.  I always think of my late father's service in France during WWII when I listen to the recording.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SC1L9Y2KEJSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005V1B2#wasThisHelpful","R3SC1L9Y2KEJSU","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very attractive stand, sold as a pair in one box.  Lots of extras make it really nice:  for instance you get two pairs of upper plates, one is rectangular, the other a truncated triangular shape (use whichever works best for your speakers, store the other pair of plates for different future needs, nice), also choice of self-adhesive pads or small press-in cones for the speaker to rest upon, and includes carpet spikes or plastic feet for the base plate.  Very easy to assemble using a Phillips head screwdriver.  Carpet spikes have a nut that can be tightened with just pliers, small channel locks, or appropriate wrench (something in the 1/4"" to 3/8"" range judging by sight - not sure, I just went with channel-locks).  Also has a pair of grooves into which you slide flexible plastic slats for hiding speaker wires, which worked fine for my 14AWG wire.The stands' piano black finish looks very nice.

"A few years ago I gave my wife a very expensive (to us) long, black lamb's wool coat with fur trim and black leather laced trim which we call her ""Audrey Hepburn"" coat because it has timeless style and a svelte appearance with my slender wife wearing it.  She also has a nice brown leather jacket for more casual wear.  Her gloves match the jacket, but she had none to really accentuate the style of the nice dressy coat.  Until now.  I put these in her Christmas stocking over the fireplace mantle, but a cold snap hit and then it was time for an event to which she would wear a black silk dress and her ""Hepburn"" coat.  So I told her to check her stocking for an early gift.  Wow, they looked even better with the coat than just the gloves alone.  They look like they were custom made for her coat.

"Very good for the price, so an excellent value imo.  Doesn't get as deep, nor have the output of my Paradigm subwoofer (at almost 6x the money), but adds significant bass output to my tertiary system in a small listening room.  Using with a Cambridge Audio Sonata receiver and RCA/Radio Shack small bookshelf speakers with the Linaeum tweeter.  This speaker has very good mids and highs but suffers from severe anemia in the bass;  the Polk subwoofer, used judiciously, really improves the sound adding dynamics along with the low end.  Not made for high SPLs, but packs a nice punch when used within its capability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HFKDNVO7M5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002KVQBA#wasThisHelpful","R4HFKDNVO7M5M","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are not self-drilling anchors.  We definitely had to drill holes in our dry-wall and tap the anchors into the holes with a light hammer, then torque the screws into the anchors.

"Affordable and durable.  I ordered two trays and a stacker set.  Assembling the stacker mounts is a bit tricky, but here's a tip for you:  Once you figure out how the lower end connects to the bottom basket (that's the tricky bit), then you will find it easier to assemble if you get one end done first because then you can tip the other ends far enough apart so that the two final mounts can be rotated into place.  The stacker mounts actually become very strong springs that hold the upper tray tightly in place such that it is very unlikely to accidentally come apart.  Well-designed and well-built actually, though a bit tricky.The stacker set includes four mounts, which is enough to stack two baskets.  Baskets are ordered individually, so order two baskets and one stacker set for two-tiered storage, or three baskets and two stacker sets for three-tiered.  Order as many trays as you need, and as many stacker sets as your own design requires.  Makes a nice custom configuration for your specific needs.  I'm using them to help organize a closet and will probably order more because the trays are deep enough to be very useful for my minimal home office needs.Highly recommended.  Functional and great for a closet or an office where style is not important.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EO83JQUCVOJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DBMMO#wasThisHelpful","R2EO83JQUCVOJL","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This new desk maximized usage of the space, with room to spare for add-on devices in the future.  I used nylon zip-ties to neaten wire management, so our PC is no longer an eyesore.  Using this desk to organize our space enabled us to expand the functionality of the room, which now includes two bookcases and comfortable seating for three in a non-cluttered, attractive area which also includes music listening, and a small TV, too.

"I really don't understand why so many reviewers claim the stand is sturdy.  They fall over with the Pioneer SP-BS22LR speaker; won't stand at all.  Even with small, light speakers they wobble.  They need either a heavier base or spikes, or both.  I like the clamp-on feature, but the tilt function is difficult to adjust properly.  All-in-all, they are good with the potential to have been great but miss out in the ways described.  They are okay for speakers near the 5-lb range, but not stable enough very much beyond that; not a great model for use around pets or toddlers.Those who can weld  a heavier plate under the base might well find this stand a delight to use with a wider range of speakers.  Larger squares of plywood or MDF could be bolted through the existing feet holes to increase stability also, and painted flat black would look fine.  I happened to have a smaller speaker which I used rather than the Pioneer which I'd have preferred, though I do intend to modify the stand to increase its stability.  Then I'll use what I want.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AO5OB0KT2QDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VRREPG#wasThisHelpful","R2AO5OB0KT2QDT","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very much pleased with the quality of this product.  It isn't just a wooden board with screwed-on castors and handle.  You will need either a 12mm socket-wrench, nut-driver or basic wrench to tighten the hexhead 12mm screws.  Or at the least an adjustable crescent wrench, which though not ideal, will do this job well because the screws tighten easily with any of these tools.  Split type lock washers are included.  All four screws for each castor screw directly into the cart's metal frame.The cart handles are already fastened into place, in a closed position.  Raising the handle snaps it firmly into place;  the user's foot can be used to depress the strong spring if handle needs to be folded back down for storage or transport.  I really feel like I got my money's worth with this cart.  Very sturdy and can handle some real weight.  Rolls easily.Note that carts like this are made to be pushed, not pulled.  Not due to the cart itself, but back strain is much more likely if carts are pulled;  it's a human body mechanics issue.  This is why swivel castors should be on the 'handle end' of the cart.UPDATE EDIT:  One of the best purchases I've made.  This cart has been so useful around the house several times already and made several chores/projects so much easier that I hate to recall all the extra work required before we bought it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R8PKGHZA84LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017TF09Y#wasThisHelpful","R3R8PKGHZA84LX","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cambridge Audio quality at 50% off the regular price makes for a very nice deal.  This receiver is smaller than standard, meaning that it fits places where others won't.  I love the combination of style, sound and function.  Even the remote control device breathes quality, with its attractive metal face and sensible set of features.Even just opening the box reveals the above-average engineering design, which extends even to packing materials, which were made with cutouts for each included unit.  That seems a small, perhaps even inconsequential observation, but the results are a well-protected package which makes a nice presentation when unpacked.Sound quality is very good, with an excellent top end.  Sparkle and shimmer of cymbals, chimes, and other such instruments is exquisite, mids are good and the 2.1 receiver's subwoofer output provides the signal for a powered subwoofer to provide the bottom end, relieving the small on-board amplifier of that duty thus extending it's dynamics.With or without a subwoofer, I highly recommend this receiver.  With smaller receivers currently rare - most choices being either cheap crap or prohibitively expensive - the CA Sonata AR-30 falls right into a reasonable price range at the current close-out.  It seems the number of units available are restricted.  Get yours while the getting is good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7TAI2ZHDBZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00290QL5C#wasThisHelpful","RT7TAI2ZHDBZG","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought my first pair of these AKGs sometime from 1975 to 1978, and loved them.  Used them for about 15 years until they were damaged in a mishap.  I've had other 'phones since then, most notably the Nakamichi SP-7, but none I liked as much as that old pair from the past.  So when I saw that they were either still - or once again - available (and on sale) I had to get a pair especially since I'm using headphones a lot lately.  I just had to know whether they were as good as I recalled.They are better.  Improved, I guess.  They still look, feel and fit the same - and that's a good thing.  The bass is deep and well-defined, not artificially boosted but can thump with the best when a thump is on the recording(Gov't Mule's ""Lay Your Burden Down"").  Highs are clean and well-extended - certainly they go higher than my 10khz cutoff hearing - younger folks who've passed through like the highs.  Mids sound good, with virtually none of the congestion you can get with lesser 'phones or speakers.  As the mids become more complex due to multiple instruments, its easy to follow just one (for instance cello in several quartets I sampled).Dynamics are great, as heard in Glenn Miller Orchestra, ""In the Digital Mood,""  ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" track, and the Tchaikovsky ""1812 Overture"" in this case on Telarc.  With movies, explosions can be startling.In addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.Also, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1/4"" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1/8"" - 3.5mm - plug).The one area in which the headphone does not excel is isolation, but that is to be expected with an open (they call it semi-open) type cup construction.  On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to attain this level of sonic excellence in a closed-back design.  I've heard none, if they exist, but even if there is one I'm sure it would be much more pricey.  Generally, one just expects to give up the ""airy"" sound of an open design with a closed headphone, so it depends on the importance of isolation to the listener.  I have a pair of closed-backs to use when needed, but most of the time I'll be using these.I'm not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I'll get, since I certainly won't spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn't be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I'm darned glad that I did.  My opinion then is obvious - best at the price, and better than many to which I've listened in the past that were much more expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAG2K76GY1LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ARCFA#wasThisHelpful","R2QAG2K76GY1LA","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have owned some classic budget amplifiers over the years, from a Pioneer SA-5500 to an NAD 3020 to several Adcom GFA-series amps, including the GFA-535 and 535 II, as well as some more powerful amps by NAD and Adcom.  Others too numerous to name.  How Emotiva manages to offer such a quality amplifier as the mini-x a-100 so affordably in the current era is beyond me.  It has power to spare for most speakers, while sounding every bit as good as any I have owned.  In my opinion you'd have to spend several times the asking price to best it, and I'm not sure that the difference would be obvious - since my ears aren't so young anymore the difference would have to be in the mids on down into the bass for me to notice an improvement.  Some young guys who've listened to my system claimed the highs were well extended and clean - my hearing now cuts off at 10khz.It is a compact little brick of an amp, heavier than it looks.  The size and price were equally important factors for me because I needed to replace a large, heavy Adcom GFA-5503 in order to use the space it occupied in my audio cabinet for a different component.  The amp appears well-built, its auto-on/off sensing circuit (switchable) responds quickly,  Banana plugs fit well, I think it's attractive, and its half-component-width size was critical for my purpose - it does require some depth, though.  My cabinet has plenty of that.I did try an SMSL SA50 Class D amp first, and was surprised at its admirable capability.  I wound up using it for rear channel, and put the Emotiva on the front L/R speakers.  It simply sounds better, as the SA50 exhibited a tendency to become slightly strident as volume increases - a characteristic that exacerbates the same tendency in my Klipsch.  The Emotiva makes my speakers sound nice and smooth.  I highly recommend this amp - nothing I've heard anywhere near the price comes close.UPDATE:  I have just ordered a second mini-x for a highish-end system which is all currently in transit or about to be.  The speakers are the Peachtree Audio ERA D5 while the preamp is the NuForce HAP-100 and a pair of Sanus' best speaker stands.  It will be interesting to hear how well this combo fulfills its potential.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JSDZ7ZWU363/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O37FOE#wasThisHelpful","R12JSDZ7ZWU363","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Anyway I stored the jewel box in  the attic years ago - with hundreds of others - as I have a couple of 400-disc players which I use for both storage and play.  I don't think the artists were identified.  The sound quality is first rate, and the performance seems just as good to me.  I'm glad I have this, even though it's now redundant to other discs I've purchased.  This one definitely remains in my play rotation (I've begun to have to make choices about which discs hold their spot in a player and which get kicked in favor of another), so it's pretty good, especially the Four Seasons.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EC357VWIXO33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006L3O8#wasThisHelpful","R1EC357VWIXO33","A38SK72V6NORUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38SK72V6NORUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Missed the movie (and the soundtrack) in mid-80's when I was busy working and raising kids.  Found this perusing affordable soundtracks, scanned the reviews which prompted me to listen to 30-second excerpts - had to have it.

"Let's get one thing straight, right up front:  I hate opera.  Can't stand it, fat lady sings, fat man sings, words in a language I can't understand;  hate everything about it.  I hate opera.  Don't know the story;  I have no clue what it's even about.  Those are just some of the reasons I hate opera.Well, thanks for stopping by and letting us know;  we were all wondering... but what's your point?You're welcome.  Point is I love this.But it's opera - you hate opera.Yeah, I know, and it's kinda p$$$g me off.  'Cause I hate opera.So, what happened?  What's different about this one?Well, what happened and what's different are the same thing.  I listened to a few minutes of it... then a few more... then next thing I know it's about two hours later, it's over, and the songs were so good some melodies were just stuck in my head.  So... I had to hear them again, just to get over it, but more tunes stuck.  It's as tragic a story as any opera.Yeah, due to your hatred of opera, because you do hate opera.Right.Whatever will you do?The only thing I can do.  Now I hate loving opera, and will check out other operas to discover whether I can hate loving them, too.  It seems my only way out.  In the meantime, I just want to warn opera haters everywhere not to listen to this recording because you just might like it.  This is my public service message.

"I just ran across these Big Box deals recently, and have purchased most.  I've found sound quality to be very good to excellent, with performances mostly at a high level.  I am no expert, but I have owned a modest library of classical over the years, so I have a lot of listening experience.  I've always wanted my collection to be more complete, but classical is just one genre of music I love so the expenditures get spread around.  It was thrilling to buy these sets, and I've been listening almost non-stop and still have much to discover.This Haydn disc is great, and while one reviewer criticized it mildly for having too many chorale selections, I must say that they aren't my favorite, either.  However, I have found that there are a few that I liked at first listen.  I'd never have heard them at all if it were not for the great price and the preponderance of non-vocal music.  The Haydn strikes me as being right up there with the Bach set(s) in quality and selection.  I love Amazon and the various labels involved who make these glorious and ridiculously affordable offerings available.

"I'm a new Tony Bennett fan, and I ordered this CD and the old ""...Heart in San Francisco"" CD, which I was able to enjoy immediately, thanks to Autorip.  However, this live disc arrived today, and I just opened it, and WOW.  The quality of the sound is top-notch, clean and dynamic and far better than I'd hoped... and I had hoped for a high level of fidelity.  Recorded music just doesn't get appreciably better than this.  Better yet, the performance itself gives up nothing in quality to the recording...meaning, this is indeed one very fine performance.  His voice sounds fantastic.  I already don't even recall what I paid for this, it just doesn't matter - and I do have a cheapskate bone.

"This is my favorite Bach composition from the first time I heard it on record 40 years, or so, ago.  I think the copy I had then - on a vinyl LP, of course - was one of the old Funk & Wagnell's records which were accompanied by a very nice book about the composer's life.  I have long since sold all my LP's and had the piece on cassette tape for many years until it disappeared, too.  It was with harpsichord rather than piano, as is also this recording.

"Sound is stereo, clean and dynamic.  If you have no clue which conductor/orchestra combos are considered the best ""interpreters"" of Beethoven, and so long as they sound good think they sound pretty much alike, then you should buy this and save money.  Sounds great over my big Klipsch Forte speakers.  If you are a highly experienced and knowledgeable Ludwig listener then you may want to get it, too, just because of the low, low price.  Then you can tell everyone about its shortcomings... and strong points, too.  I'll read all about it and still enjoy it as much as I would any other Beethoven cycle.  Good deal for regular folks and cheapskates!I only took off one star because it's not a famous, top-tier orchestra and conductor, but they sound great to me.  And I have heard tympani sound a bit better...but, then, also worse, too, and from better orchestras, at that.

"Wow, that picture is lovely!  The green tones combined with the lovely flowers in this duvet cover really remind me of pond lilies, or maybe just the season of Spring in general.  It's really nicely priced for such a beautiful print, especially something that's made entirely of cotton, so I decided to take a chance on this unknown product brand and ordered it (along with their Sunny Blue Daisy set, which I also fell in love with).Well, now that I've seen it in person, it's not quite what I was expecting.  There's a lot more white in the print than I would've guessed from the picture – the green parts are mainly at the top and bottom, and they sort of fade into a big white middle section (which still has spots of purple flowers printed on it).  I was expecting a lot more green color (and I'm ever so slightly disappointed), but there's not much to complain about since it's still very pretty.  The two pillowcases I got were pretty random (one of them seems to come from the white section and the other one is green), so, it's a bit of an odd mis-match there.  Oh, I should note that this duvet cover is reversible!  The backside is actually that blue geometric-style pattern you can see on the sheets in the picture.  That's a nice bonus.  The pillowcases, however, aren't made reversible with the blue fabric on the underside (despite the fact that it would've been easy to do), so that's a bit of a baffling oversight...Quality-wise, this seems like a solid item.  I washed it (in hot water and a hot dryer, no less) and the colors didn't fade at all.  It came out a bit wrinkled, but that's to be expected for an all-cotton item, and most of the wrinkles have already fallen out (this is helped by the fact that I folded it immediately after drying).  It has convenient corner ties already added to it, as well as a nice zipper closure, and seems pretty true to size (I ordered the queen).  The fabric itself feels just like you'd expect average cotton to feel – not super soft or satiny, but reasonable for its 300 thread count (if you've ever touched a normal quilt, you'll know exactly what kind of cotton I'm talking about).My ultimate feelings about this item are that while I'm slightly disappointed by the colors in the print and the lack of attention to detail in the pillowcases, I'd have to say that I'm still generally pleased with it.  It's still a lovely item for a good price, and I can't complain about that.  If you saw the manufacturer's picture and thought to yourself, ""wow, this would be perfect if the green was toned down a bit with more white,"" then go ahead and give this item a try.  Personally, I'd have to say that I ended up liking their Sunny Blue Daisy set better, but I'm pleased enough with the overall quality of this set that I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye out for any new products from Swanson Bedding in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPXQOP2NTLBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RI7H9FW#wasThisHelpful","RRPXQOP2NTLBX","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really fell in love with this duvet cover when I first saw it.  The orange, yellow, and white daisies on that light blue background really remind me of the sky on a bright, sunny day!  Plus, it's all cotton, and the price is pretty affordable for such a beautiful print.  Still, I wondered if such a bright, crisp print could really look that good in person, especially for such a good price...Well, now that it has arrived, let me assure you that it looks great!  The print on those daisies is crisp and clear, and the colors are just as bright in person as they are in the picture.  In fact, it looks exactly like the picture.  I washed it (in hot water and a hot dryer, no less) and the colors didn't fade at all (woo!).  It came out a bit wrinkled, but that's to be expected for an all-cotton item, and most of the wrinkles have already fallen out (this is helped by the fact that I folded it immediately after drying).  It seems pretty true to size (I ordered the queen), and has convenient corner ties already added to it, as well as nice zipper closure.  I should also add that the duvet cover technically has a reverse side – the underside has a slightly different print, which is light blue with pale greenish-white daisies on it.  It looks very similar to the top side, so I'm not sure I'd actually call this reversible even though the underside is technically a different print.  As for the feel of the fabric, well, it feels like your average cotton.  It's not super soft or satiny, but it feels like a good sturdy cotton, and that's good enough for me.Well, I'm overall very pleased with this item.  It seems like a great value (I got mine for about sixty bucks, inclusive of shipping) for an all-cotton duvet cover set, especially one that is so pretty.  I hadn't tried Swanson Bedding before, but if the company's other items are this good of a quality at this kind of value, then they have definitely won themselves a loyal customer.  If you're in the mood for something cheerful and whimsical for the bedroom, or if you're just a fan of daisies, then I highly recommend you try out this duvet cover; it'll put a smile on your face!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WP4LZISLXWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2A422#wasThisHelpful","R35WP4LZISLXWH","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to try out this new Febreze scent since it seems like a great way to freshen up some musty-smelling areas (like closets, towels in storage, etc.).  So, after it arrived, I decided to get straight to testing!My first test was on some clothes hanging in the closet, as well as the smelly shoes being stored there.  The fragrance is pleasant enough, and somewhat ""fresh"" as the name suggests, but it's rather hard to describe.  It's not floral or fruity in any way, and it reminds me of maybe a cross between cologne for a man and the smell of fabric softener sheets.  Yeah, I know that's vague, but it's really quite difficult to describe.  I like it okay, but it's not my favorite scent.  Anyway, it smelled strong to me when going on the clothes, but while it's very strong when it first comes out, it seems to lessen over time.  However, while the strength of the odor did diminish, the smell lingered for quite awhile.  After five days I could still faintly smell it.  Seven days is a bit of a stretch (I still noticed it if I stuck my nose in the clothes and sniffed hard, but it was mostly gone by then).  As for the effect of the smell, well, it won't get rid of odors that are already there, but it will help you freshen musty things or cover up some lingering odors once the source is gone.  That's pretty par for the course with Febreze products, though.Lastly, let's talk about the bottle.  It's got a nozzle that can be twisted to ""off"" or ""spray"" but there's two spray settings, and they don't seem to be any different in volume.  It would've been nice to have a heavy spray vs. a light spray setting.  Nonetheless, I'm pretty pleased with the spray performance because it comes out as more of a mist, whereas in the past I've had Febreze fabric bottles that came out in huge heavy sprays, and this one is much easier to control.  That being said, the neck of this bottle baffles me.  There's a clear separation that looks as though the top could come off, and there's a symbol for locked and unlocked.  I took this to mean that the head will twist off (perhaps so one could clear any clogs that might happen, or refill the bottle or something), but it won't budge.  It doesn't seem to open at all, and all that did happen when I tried is that liquid squeezed out onto my hand.  Oh well, I have no idea what that's about.Anyway, if you are a fan of Febreze products and want a fragrance that doesn't smell floral/fruity, then this might be the product for you.  If you are not already a fan of Febreze, then this certainly isn't going to change your mind.  As for me personally, I like the better misting effect the spray bottle provides, but I think the smell is just okay.  If I do get this product again in the future, I think I'll choose a different fragrance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5AH1TJEM8UGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMVCM8#wasThisHelpful","R5AH1TJEM8UGO","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit new to the world of duvet covers, and naturally, I wanted to start off with a cheaper one to test the concept before I start investing in expensive stuff.  I also wanted one that was 100% cotton, and that was bright and pretty.  That seems like a pretty tall order for a lower-priced duvet cover, but then I stumbled onto this item.First off, once you see it in person, you'll notice that the colors are a bit more muted and pastel in tone, while the picture looks a bit brighter.  This is something that didn't bother me (it's still pink and blue and pretty!), but it should be noted.  Also, it's hard to tell from the picture, but the part that folded over (where you can see a bit of a darker blue with pink roses) actually represents a reverse side.  The duvet cover is reversible!  I actually prefer the reverse side a little more (it's a solid baby blue with pink roses here and there), as opposed to the more multi-colored side that's pictured.  Nevertheless, I think the reversibility adds extra value to what was already an inexpensive duvet cover (it was about thirty-six bucks when I bought it).As for quality...well, the first thing I did was wash it, and it didn't fall apart at all.  It did seem to shrink a bit in the dryer (and wrinkled, but those seem to have largely fallen out over the past couple days of use), but this was actually helpful due to its odd size.  I ordered the queen size, and the shams measured 20x30"".  It shrank to about 20x29"" and seemed to fit my pillow a bit more snugly.  The duvet cover itself is the odd size of 88x96"", which is very weird for a queen duvet cover, which normally are around the 88x88"" size, or 90x90"".  Nonetheless, it's a pretty easy fix with a sewing machine to reduce the length.  There's a zipper closure at the bottom, and it works well, but there are no corner ties, so you'll have to add them yourself if you care about such things.  I should also mention that the listing says it comes with a flat sheet, but I got no such thing.  I don't really care, though, as I never use flat sheets anyway.  As for the way the fabric feels...well, this is 200 thread count cotton, and it feels like it.  It's not particularly soft or smooth, but you can't really expect that for this price point and for this thread count.  To me it feels like your average cotton – not high-end, but sturdy enough, and I like it just fine, personally.Well, I'd have to say I'm pretty pleased with this item.  It's certainly great for the price, since it's very hard to find all-cotton duvet covers that are so brightly colored for such a low price.  I think it's weird size is a drawback, but for the price, it's worth fixing with your own sewing machine (or getting somebody else to do it for you).  It's a quick, easy fix, so I can't really complain too much, and I didn't hold it against the item in the rating because it's clearly stated in the listing.  I must retract a star, however, for the missing flat sheet.  I don't particularly care about it, but it's still technically false advertising.  For the overall package, though, you're still getting a great bargain on a lovely duvet cover (and two shams).  I'd definitely recommend this item if you're on a budget, and I'll probably be checking out more of their stuff in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A1VI0HON1RLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJPCYU0#wasThisHelpful","R2A1VI0HON1RLL","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to the world of duvet covers, and was looking for an inexpensive way to try one out.  That's when I happened upon this item.  It looked bright and cheerful, and the price just couldn't be beat (about thirty bucks when I bought it), so I gave it a try.It is indeed as bright as cheerful in person as it looks in the picture, and the colors are pretty spot on!  However, the picture is a bit misleading in another way.  Because of the way it is folded, you can't see the top half of the duvet cover.  The bottom is indeed that nice blue color, but about halfway up the cover, the blue sort of fades out into a big white strip, which fades into the tan/cream color you can see in the picture in the folded over part of the cover.  When I first saw the picture, I assumed the tan color was a reversible print side, but both sides are the same.  I'd honestly say the design hurts it a bit, and it would look better if the whole thing were blue.  I still think it's reasonably pretty, but you should be aware of this incongruity.Quality-wise, the duvet cover seems well made.  There were no loose threads or tearing seams on mine.  There's a zipper closure at the bottom that worked fine, and it does seem to be reasonably accurate to the listed size of 91x91 inches (I had bought the queen size).  Oh, and if you are used to your duvet covers having corner ties, well, this one doesn't, so you'll have to add them yourself if you care about that sort of thing.Now, let's talk about the fabric.  This duvet cover is a 50/50 polyester cotton blend.  I thought this would be reasonable for me to take a chance on because I've had a comforter in the past that was a 80% cotton, 20% polyester blend, and it felt just fine.  With this one, however, I guess the polyester content is just too high...  I can REALLY feel the polyester - in fact, it feels way more like polyester than cotton to me.  It also feels like it doesn't breath particularly well, which is a typical trait of polyester.  I'm rather sensitive in my dislike of polyester bedding and I just didn't like the feel of this duvet cover, so I ended up returning the item.  You might be wondering why my rating is so high for something I returned.  Well, it's because this item is rather nicely made for its price, and its texture is pretty typical of a polyester-containing item.  In other words, it didn't seem fair to knock off its score just because I have a personal dislike of polyester.  I did, however, retract a star for the misleading nature of the print (as mentioned earlier).Overall, I'd have to say that this item is pretty good, despite my personal dislike of its fabric content.  If you are the sort of person who has no qualms with polyester bedding, and you happen to want a cheap and cheerful-looking duvet cover, then I'd definitely recommend you try this one out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SQVJU2AZV7A5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHJ8LA2#wasThisHelpful","R3SQVJU2AZV7A5","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use tampons frequently, and I've gone through quite a few different brands/models over the years to find out which kind I like best.  I'm not really brand loyal at this point, but the one thing I require is plastic applicators.  Yes, I have suffered the cardboard ones in the past, and all they tended to do was slide in roughly, be uncomfortable, and collapse annoyingly when trying to use the tampon plunger part during insertion.  Plus, if they get wet from being set down in the bathroom, then forget it - those cardboard applicators just squash in and become useless.  So, I now stick exclusively to the plastic ones.  However, that brings us to these o.b. tampons, which claim to work without applicators.  I'm both intrigued and skeptical.  On the one hand, I'm worried that they will be very uncomfortable to insert, but on the other hand, I'm quite attracted to their small size (just imagine how easy these would be to fit in a purse!).  So, I'm willing to give these a chance!First off, I'm pleased with the overall spread of sizes offered in this package; it's a good mix of regular, super, and super plus.  Of course, if you find that your needs are different, you're probably going to want to buy the sizes separately anyways.  Now, onto the nitty gritty - the actual use!  After trying them out...  Well, this is where my enthusiasm has started to damper.  These things are quite rough and unpleasant to insert, even on a relatively heavy flow day for me - so forget about using them during a lighter flow day (a problem I did not have with regular size tampons with plastic applicators because those went in smooth, and by the time they were ready to be removed, were sufficiently filled as to come out easily).  Maybe my flow isn't as heavy as other people's (even on my heaviest days)?  I don't know, but these things feel like sandpaper going in.  Also, you'll likely get your finger messy when you're inserting these.  This isn't such a problem at home where one can run to the nearby sink to wash up, but imagine trying to use these tampons in a public bathroom.  Not fun at all.  As for absorption, well, it was fine enough, and about average, I'd say, for each size range.  I didn't have any problems with leakage or anything, so that's good.While absorption was good and the small size is nice (the regulars are 1 "" long, while the super sizes are 2"" long), I'd have to say that I'm overall dissatisfied with these.  What's the point of using them if insertion is so unpleasant?  Of course, each person is different, and you may have better luck with these than I did, so if the concept of applicator-less tampons intrigues you, then you might as well go ahead and give them a try (maybe try to buy a smaller size for testing purposes).  As for me, though, I'm going back to my normal plastic applicators.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R42D1TJJQB18Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNJ6WI#wasThisHelpful","R42D1TJJQB18Y","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally use overnight pads (but I've tried some in the past.  I'm very paranoid of leaks (I've had some bad experiences) so now I almost exclusively use a tampon at night combined with a normal pad or a pantiliner (depending on heaviness of flow) in order to add a double-layer of protection against leaks.  Nonetheless, these Stayfree Ultra Thin Pads seemed like a decent option for the tail end of my period (when it's not practical to use a tampon anymore).First off, physically, these are very long (measuring a full 11.5"" when laid flat) - even longer than most normal overnight pads I've tried in the past.  They are also rather wide (3.5"") and feature two sets of wings (yes, two!).  These are extra big (although still thin - somewhere between a pantiliner and a regular pad) supposedly in order to guard against leaks in the night.  Well...as for actual performance, if you sleep on your back, I can definitely see these being good.  I, however, sleep on my side almost all the time.  I used these towards the end of my period when the flow is lighter, and I can say that I didn't have any leaks while using these, but I don't usually have leaks at that point even while using normal regular size pads (you know, the ones that are of a normal length and thickness).  As for trying to use these during my heavier flow days, well, I'd be frightened to.  They just don't feel thick enough for a heavy flow, and when one sleeps on their side, gravity pulls all things down in that direction, so leaks would probably escape at some point.  If you sleep on your back, though, it'd probably do an admirable job - it's certainly long enough for that.  Oh, and for anyone who's wondering, these do seem to have a very, very light scent, almost not enough to even say it's there.  I don't know if this will bother anyone or not, but be warned.Anyway, I think these worked admirably for light flow days, but I won't chance it for heavy flow days - for that, I'm going to stick to my tampon/pad combo at night.  As for these, I like them just well enough to use up, but I'm not going to get them again.  They just don't offer me, personally, enough benefit over normal-sized pads to keep them on hand.  Oh well, if these sound like something that would work well for you, give them a try!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLID2ZCQ6KMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJNIUDE#wasThisHelpful","RLLID2ZCQ6KMH","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've long been a fan of ""gothy"" comics, or just darkly humorous comics involving the supernatural, and I just so happened to stumble upon this one while browsing amazon.  So, I decided to give it a try.  ""Outlook: Grim – The Dead Nasties"" is actually a collected volume of the first six issues of the series.  I much prefer collected volumes over individual issues since I can get one big chunk of a story in one place, so this pleases me.  Of course, I've not actually read any of the individual issues previously, so this is my first experience with their series.  Now, onto the meat of the review...First off, the artwork is quite stylized (which I enjoy) and it's also quite detailed; each page is absolutely stuffed with things to look at.  I appreciate the details, but at the same time, there is almost no shading in this black and white comic, so it can be quite difficult to actually look at sometimes – like it's too chaotic and hard on the eyes.  Nonetheless, once I got accustomed to the art style, it became easier to follow the action.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the monster designs – they are both incredibly cute and horrible, and I love them!As for the story, well...the story is fairly interesting, involving main characters Wren and Chloe unleashing ghosts in Wren's apartment, and then trying to find a way to get rid of them.  The interesting bits don't really pick up until the latter half of the book, though, and the overall story feels unfinished – as though it's only an opener to a bigger story.  I presume this volume is only the beginning of a longer story, and seems like it'd be a good introduction to a future Volume 2.  As it is, though, I'm not sure Volume 2 is coming.  I certainly hope so, because I'd like to see a continuation of this series, if only because it feels like there's some character development that needs to happen in our main characters.  Wren, in particular, is riding the line of being unlikable, and she desperately needs some fleshing out as a three-dimensional character.Overall, I'm very conflicted about what rating to give this book.  On the one hand, it kept my attention while reading, and was never boring.  On the other hand, it feels like it's only the beginning of a longer story, and as such, doesn't feel complete.  Plus, the story and characters feel like they need further expansion.  If it is truly just the first volume of many to come, then it's a good introduction, but as it is, I must judge it on its own merits.  If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars as a stand-alone book, but since that isn't an option with the rating system, I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and round up to four stars.  I truly hope Volume 2 is coming!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QSU7VPVBZ1XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593620063#wasThisHelpful","R1QSU7VPVBZ1XP","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was randomly browsing through comics of an ""alternative"" bent when I stumbled upon this one.  I'll state right now that I know nothing about the character of Emily the Strange, nor have I read any Emily the Strange comics previously.  So, I decided to pick this particular book up since it is Vol. 1, just to give franchise a try.First off, the book is nicely made in the physical sense.  The pages are nice and thick, and the inking looks really vivid.  I applaud the manufacturer for not cheaping out on the pages.  Unfortunately, the cover binding on my copy popped off.  I fixed it successfully with some rubber cement glue, but that's a bit of knock against build quality there.  Nonetheless, I'd say the book overall feels solid discounting that exception.As for the actual content, the art is quite lovely.  The book is technically in color, but the art tends to stick to a black, white, and red color-scheme.  I found the art style overall enjoyable, and I really dug the red and black aesthetic that was used on a lot of the pages.  While the art is nice, however, the story really lacks substance.  The book is composed of a series of short skits, with none of the stories really being part of an overarching narrative structure.  That's fine enough, but with a skit-style comic, the skits have to be really good to carry the book and maintain the interest of the reader.  Sadly, these skits were neither funny, witty, clever, or engaging.  It was as though the writers were desperately trying to have jokes, but none of them successfully achieved humor.  Out of all the mini-stories in the book, I only thought the ""Lostco"" one was amusing.  That's not a good track record at all...  Another issue I take with this book is its treatment of goth subculture.  I quite enjoy goth-y comics (or at least comics that are darkly humorous in tone - Jhonen Vasquez has a grumpy hissy-fit if you refer to his works as ""goth""), and in fact I tend to stick to them primarily.  This book feels more like a parody of goth than an actual entry in the genre.  Everything is ""black"" and ""dark"" and not in an ironic way...  The whole thing comes off as superficial and immature, as though it's desperately trying too hard.  Of course, I could've forgiven all this if the book had been entertaining, but sadly, that wasn't the case.I know humor is subjective and all, and you might get more out of this book than I did, but I just didn't care for it.  Overall, even though the artwork is quite nice, I just can't strongly recommend this book, especially since there are better options out there.  Check out ""Serenity Rose: 10 Awkward Years"" for some gorgeous artwork and a funny, yet mature storyline, or ""Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors"" for a hilarious romp of dark humor.  Either way, find something better than this book...","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36V4Q2Y5DNM19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593075731#wasThisHelpful","R36V4Q2Y5DNM19","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I doubt that anyone who isn't a fan of Cradle of Filth would be looking at this, but just in case you know nothing about this item, let me describe it.  “The Curse of Venus Aversa” is a small comic story that was inspired by the band, Cradle of Filth.  However, this story does not directly feature the band at all (not exactly, anyway).  In fact, the story involves a brand new fictional protagonist, although there are many references and themes that are drawn directly from CoF's previous works.  So, people who were expecting a story featuring the band will be disappointed.  I, however, liked it well enough.Story-wise, the book feels very Victorian-Gothic in style, but with the band's trademark cheesiness filtered over it.  Without spoiling anything, I'll say that I found it entertaining enough, but it also felt a little lacking in closure.  I don't know if a second issue is planned, but I doubt it.  Oh well, in that case, I guess you could say it has an open ending.  As for the artwork, this is a black and white comic, and I'd say it's very nicely drawn.  The style is more realistic than cartoony or stylized, and the inking and shadow work are quite heavy.  I can't say it's my favorite comic artwork ever, but it certainly looks like a good deal of effort was put into it, and I appreciate that.However...all that heavy inking has a downside.  I don't know if I just got a dud copy or what, but when I first received my copy, it has a terrible chemical ink stench to it, and just opening the book set off my allergies.  I had to wrap it in a paper towel and stick it in a box full of baking soda for a week before the smell dissipated to a tolerable level.  Once again, I don't know if I just got unlucky or if this is an issue with all the copies, but do be careful picking this up if you're sensitive to smells.Nevertheless, if you're a fan of CoF, I'd suggest giving this comic a chance.  It's nice enough, and if you don't have allergies to ink then you'll probably enjoy it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39CKNZWWE022A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991571215#wasThisHelpful","R39CKNZWWE022A","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“I Feel Sick” #2 is the conclusion to the small spin-off story involving the character Devi, who was originally featured in Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.  While it could be considered an independent story, I believe you really need to read JTHM to fully get what's happening in this story, so I suggest you start there first.Strangely, out of all of Jhonen's comics, I'd consider the “I Feel Sick” story arc to be my favorite.  Maybe that's because it's the only one to have beautiful, fully-colored art, but honestly I think it's the story itself.  This comic is only two issues long, but it feels like the most coherent and complete of Johnen's stories in terms of plot development, and for me, the humor was absolutely spot-on.  So, I'd describe it as short, but sweet.  On another note, I've heard that this comic sort of metaphorically represents Jhonen's frustration with Nickelodeon while working on Invader Zim, and that he felt his creativity was constrained by corporate mandate.  If that's true, then it's sad.  I understand his frustration, but I also believe that Invader Zim may well be Jhonen's greatest work (although it wasn't entirely his, as many people contributed to the final product) and that it's too bad that he found the experience so unpleasant.  To be honest, though, some of his ideas (such as killing off Dib only to replace him with an identical character) were terrible ideas from a narrative perspective and I'm glad Nickelodeon didn't let him do it.  On the other hand, “I Feel Sick” is a great way to covertly see Jhonen's perspective in the whole thing, and I respect that (I daresay that small cameo Jhonen makes in this story says it all).  On a surface level, though, “I Feel Sick” is a great story in it's own right, and is quite funny, too.Obviously, if you pick this up (and it's quite rare and somewhat expensive now, but I still suggest getting it), then you need the other issue, too, to complete the story.  I really hope Jhonen re-releases both issues as some sort of nice compilation thing (as he did with JTHM and Squee), but I'm not sure when or if that'll ever happen.  Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Jhonen's works, try to get your hands on this one, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C0DZ1KB161D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593621574#wasThisHelpful","R2C0DZ1KB161D8","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Squee is essentially a follow-up to the Johhny the Homicidal Maniac comics, but not in a traditional sequel-type way.  Squee was a character that appeared in JTHM, but was not the main focus.  This volume focuses directly on Squee, though, so it can't really be seen as a sequel to that book – it's more of a spin-off really.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed “Squee.”“Squee” still has Jhonen Vasquez's usual dark humor, but it feels like a slightly lighter, more fun collection compared to JTHM, and I'd have to say I found “Squee” to be funnier than JTHM overall.  Not to say I didn't enjoy JTHM, it's just that “Squee” is my favorite out of the two.  I really love the humor of Squee, and, additionally, for fans of Invader Zim it's super fun to see strange little precursors to characters and alien designs that appear in Invader Zim.  Aside from the main Squee-related stories, this collected work also includes the “Meanwhiles” and “Wobbly Headed Bob” side-stories, so if you get this and the Director's cut of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, you'll have the whole collection of side stories.So, if you like JTHM, then you need to pick this up.  If you haven't read JTHM yet, then you should start there since that's the origin of Squee as a character.  The best option of all, though, is to get both!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIKX7NQVVOUUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0943151244#wasThisHelpful","RIKX7NQVVOUUL","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, here we go...  Sigh, I hate to even have to say this, because this story must be pretty cliché by now, but I was introduced to this (and Jhonen Vasquez's other comics) through my love of Invader Zim.  I didn't start with JTHM, though, but with Filler Bunny.  Yeah, nevermind why that happened...but anyway, if you are looking to get into JTHM, this is the collection to get since it has all the JTHM volumes (this sentence will be awkward and incorrect later if he ever releases new JTHM comics).The book itself is softcover, and the pages are not the thickest or highest quality I've ever encountered, but they seem sturdy enough.  The comic is in black and white, and Jhonen's spidery art style and text will either appeal to you...or it won't (I personally like it).  As for the story...well, let's just say that you may think this book will just be a weird revenge fantasy thing wherein the reader is meant to identify with the main character's violent acts, but it's not.  By the end of the comic, it becomes apparent that there's a bit more going on here, and that this is less about mindless violence and more about following one special person's descent into further madness, all wrapped up in dark humor.  If you pick this up, just give it a chance and go in with an open mind.So, if you want to collect all the JTHM comics in one convenient format, then this “Director's Cut” version is definitely the one to get.  If you end up liking it, then I'd suggest you try out “The Collected Works of Filler Bunny,” “Squee,” and “I Feel Sick” (and after you work your way through those, “Serenity Rose” is an excellent comic).  If you are new to Jhonen's works, then you should definitely start here since all his other comics pretty much get their origin stories here.  Oh, as an extra note, this book also includes the “Happy Noodle Boy” and “Anne Gwish” segments (these are sort of little extra stories, unrelated to the main storyline).  The other half of the side stories included in the original versions of the comic (the “Meanwhiles” and “Wobbly Headed Bob”) are included in “Squee,” which I strongly suggest you also pick up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5KLCCHQAHNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0943151163#wasThisHelpful","R3L5KLCCHQAHNQ","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most people, I have already read (and own) the other Filler Bunny comics, but I figured I'd go ahead and just review all of them here in this lovely collection.  Also like most people, I was first introduced to Jhonen Vasquez's works through Invader Zim (of whom I am a huge fan), and eventually decided to try out his comics.  That's where I differ a bit from the typical fan, who would probably have started with Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.  Nope, I somehow decided it'd be easier to ease myself into the comic world of Mr. Vasquez by starting with Filler Bunny.  No, I don't know why I thought that'd be a good idea (and I don't recommend it for others).  Anyway, that brings us to this item, “The Collected Works of Fillerbunny.”If you are looking at this review, I presume you are already a fan of Filler Bunny, or at the very least, Jhonen Vasquez, or else, why would you even be here?  Well, if you are looking to collect the Filler Bunny comics, this is the best item to get.  The physical book is bound in softcover, but is of high quality.  The pages feel decently thick, but are in the original black and white (except for the few pages of the third Filler Bunny comic that were originally in color anyways).  Also, if you are concerned that this version misses anything from the originals, the only difference I can see is that the covers for the original books are reproduced in black and white when they were originally in color.  Other than that, everything appears to be here from the originals.  Plus, in addition to this, there's a brand new Filler Bunny comic included!  As for the content of the new comic, if you liked the old stuff, you'll probably like this...If you DO happen to be someone who's never experienced Filler Bunny before...Well, the plot of this thing is a bit difficult to review.  Filler Bunny was originally meant literally to be filler in the spare pages of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, because apparently when Jhonen needed to fill some extra space he instantly thought the best way to do so was to draw a cartoon rabbit being tortured over and over again (yeah, it sounds bad, and it might be, but it's pretty funny as far as dark humor goes......don't judge me!).  Anyway, Filler Bunny is not a coherent narrative experience since it was only ever meant to be filler.  Over time it's sort of grown into its own unique thing, though, and has evolved beyond just being filler for another comic.So, if you want to easily collect all the Filler Bunny comics in one place (plus the extra comic), then this is the definitive version to get.  As for whether or not you'll like it if you've never read anything by Jhonen before, I think you'll just have to try it yourself.  I strongly suggest, though, if you are new to Jhonen's works, that you start with Johnny the Homicidal Maniac first.  Nonetheless, for people who are already fans of Jhonen's works, “The Collected Works of Filler Bunny” is a real treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BPRV22798LVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159362266X#wasThisHelpful","R2BPRV22798LVN","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As for it's physical characteristics, it's a little over 3 feet long, accurate to its listing.  I'm quite pleased to say the ends are reasonably slim, which is great since some cables have those fat ends that won't fit easily in certain electronics.  The last thing to mention is the bright orange color, which is indeed as bright as it appears in the pictures.  Having the cable be bright orange is great for people who have a lot of cables because you can easily pick out which cable is which.

"I've been looking for a decent photo prop for displaying my sales earrings for quite some time.  It's surprisingly hard to find a mannequin with a normal sized pierced ear (many of the ones that do have ears feature ears that are too thick and not good for post earrings).

As for construction, mine arrived undamaged, and the pole fit into the base and bust with ease, and the whole thing felt stable.Unfortunately, that's where the good points end.  First off, it's not realistically sized.  It is far smaller than a real human's face (as compared with my face – I'm pretty average).  The description claims that it is “8 1/4"" wide x 5 1/2” deep x 19 1/2"" tall” and that's pretty true for the height and depth.  However, the width is actually smaller than stated, being only 7” wide at the base, and slightly narrower at the face.  What it all amounts to is that the face is not realistically proportioned compared to a real person (unless you intended this bust to match a small child).Well, even though the size is off, I figured it'd still be good for earrings (the primary reason I got it).  I'd read other reviews that claimed that it was hard to get fishhooks through the ear, and they were right.  In fact, I tried all the major types of earrings, and none of them work.  First, I tried a standard fishhook, and it wouldn't work because the ear is too close to the head.  I'd have to bend the fishhook out of whack to make it fit, and I'm not keen on having to damage my fishhooks.  Not that that matters much since my for-sale earrings are actually post earrings.  Post earrings don't fit any better because you can't possibly get your finger behind the ear to get the backs on, and the posts just fall out otherwise.  Lastly, I tried a hoop earring just for the sake of fairness, and it wouldn't fit either.  So, the three most common earring types and none of them would fit. I'd say that's a resounding failure all around.I ended up returning my bust for a refund since it just doesn't reasonably work for any earrings.  If you were just going to get this to display necklaces, I'd say it's okay for that purpose.  However, if you want something nice to display earrings, I'd keep looking.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENM2EOOACZUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HIFJN6#wasThisHelpful","R3ENM2EOOACZUE","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this new Angelspit album, but I can fully understand why the long-time fans will find this release divisive.  It's certainly much different from anything they've previously done, and some people won't be on board with that.  I actually think this release might be just what they needed to get themselves out of whatever rut they were stuck in before.  Yes, I'm implying that I didn't really care for Hello My Name Is, or Hideous and Perfect before it.  I just found them terribly dull (sorry to anyone who loved those albums; it's just my opinion).  If nothing else, this radical change in style has injected some much-needed life into Angelspit's music.It's really hard to pin down exactly what makes this release so different from their older stuff, but it's very easy to feel the change while listening to it.  There seems to be a heavier emphasis on electro stuff in the music.  Of course, how much that bugs people really depends on how much you like/dislike electronic stuff.  I personally enjoy the music on this album – it feels multi-layered and interesting to listen to.One major change here is the conspicuous absence of DestroyX to lend female vocals.  I don't quite know why she's gone, but despite assurances to the contrary in interviews and such, I can't help but fear that she's planning to leave the band or something - I hope that isn't true.  The real reason her absence is particularly noticeable is because although Zoog does an admirable job of singing, and despite the use of guest vocals by people such as Miss Ballistic, there feels like a serious lack of female vocals.  It just feels like something's missing, and that the “something” is female vocals.  The guest vocalists only seem to contribute tiny parts, and the strong female presence is sorely missed on this album.  As for Zoog's vocals, he clean sings here more than any past release, and he does a good job.  I can't complain there.If I was going to complain about something else, it'd be that while the first half of the album feels strong and energetic, the second half of the album (right after Baal Arise) seems to trail off in energy levels.  I just didn't like the songs after Baal Arise as much as the rest of the album (with Ambassador being my favorite).  Still, I can't honestly say that the songs after Baal Arise are terrible or anything, I just didn't quite like them as much.  I still frequently listen to the whole album and enjoy it, so that's not a huge criticism here.  Oh, and on another note, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Creeper is a fantastic instrumental piece, perhaps one of the best instrumental songs I've heard off of any album in a long time.  Heck, if Angelspit chose to release a purely instrumental album one day and it was up to the quality level of Creeper, I'd be thrilled!Anyway, the last bit of change one might notice is in the lyrics.  The lyrics seem a bit less abstract than the ones you'd find on Krankhaus (and with more varied subject matter than that album had, too).  Still, I found them to be excellent - just as vivid, colorful, socially aware, and angry as you'd expect from an Angelspit release.  There's certainly enough artistry here to keep your mind as occupied as your ears...Overall, this is a good album, but I feel like it does have a few small flaws here and there that are holding it back.  However, it's a solid release, and a great return to form from the disappointment that was Hello My Name Is (once again, sorry if you liked that one).  While this album isn't perfect, it's great enough that it makes me excited again for future Angelspit releases.  I just hope that DestroyX comes back next time.  If you're an Angelspit fan, then you should definitely check out The Product (if only by listening to the song samples on their website first).  Even if you don't end up liking it, it's still worth listening to and deciding for yourself if you like this new direction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GN0WO7LL6J5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INTRO40#wasThisHelpful","R2GN0WO7LL6J5L","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first became acquainted with Angelspit through their first full-length album, Krankhaus, and this EP feels very much like a companion piece to that album.  Nurse Grenade, however, does predate Krankhaus.  Nonetheless, it's safe to say, if you like Krankhaus, you'll probably enjoy Nurse Grenade.Much like Krankhaus, the music on Nurse Grenade is a cacophony of industrial beats, distortion, and yelling, chant-like vocals, all deftly woven together to create a pleasing whole.  As with Krankhaus, the lyrics here are a superb blend of disconcerting word associations and stream-of-consciousness lyric styles, which help to evoke powerful imagery in the listener.  The standout tracks here (at least in my opinion) are Infect, Meat, and Nurse Grenade, but the whole album is great.  The only song that sort of got on my nerves was the I Feel Disease remix, which goes on a bit too long and tends to wear out its welcome.Overall, though, this EP is fantastic and should not be overlooked by Angelspit fans.  It's also not a bad place for new fans to start out with the band, and if you already like Krankhaus but for some reason don't own Nurse Grenade, then you should definitely pick this up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SSMJK8VXNR6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFF5ZY6#wasThisHelpful","R3SSMJK8VXNR6H","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Where do I begin?  I guess I'll begin at the beginning!  Well, I'm sure everyone's already heard this story a million times and is sick to death of it, but it's the truth.  I originally saw Invader Zim back in the day (and still am a huge fan), got into Jhonen Vasquez's comics after that, then, like most of his fans, went looking for new material to fill the gaping hole in his release schedule (and in our hearts!), and eventually stumbled my way over to this comic.  I promise not to make any comparisons to Jhonen's works, though, because that's probably going to feel insufferable by now since it seems that anyone who's related in any way to the cast of Invader Zim (Aaron Alexovich contributed character designs to the show) gets their comics, books, underwear, used tissues, etc. compared to Jhonen's stuff.  Nope, I'll be judging this item on its own merits.So, let's talk about this book in particular: the “Serenity Rose: 10 Awkward Years” collection.  I didn't even know this thing was a Kickstarter funded item (and only learned this recently from reading other reviews), this is the very first time I've ever read any Serenity Rose comics, and I had no idea what to expect whatsoever.First off, let's talk about the physical aspects of this collection.  I knew it was a collection of all the comics released over the years when I bought it, but I was truly surprised by how big it was when I finally saw it.  It's massive!  It's about a full 1  inches wide, like a friggin text book!  Not just that, but the quality is really fantastic, much better than I was expecting.  It's in full hardcover binding, and the pages are thick, glossy, fully inked wonders of beauty (similar in quality to the Hyperbole and a Half book, if you've seen that before).  The artwork itself is mostly black and white, but not quite like what you may have seen in other comics.  The shading work is incredible, and there are splashes of color here and there so as to be not truly grayscale.  You seriously won't even notice that it's not in full color after awhile because it looks so good!  Not to mention, the bits that are in color do not look awkward or forced against the backdrop - everything looks really natural and nice; it's hard to explain but suffice it to say, it looks great.  On top of all that, the book has a blue ribbon attached to the top to serve as a bookmark, just like some crazy old leather-bound tome!  You really couldn't ask for more in terms of physical presentation.As for the story and characters, well, remember that this is my very first time ever reading anything Serenity Rose related, so I'm going in with a completely fresh perspective.  The story starts off a bit confusing in the first and second “issue” sections.  I think it's because this portion is meant to really just be an introduction to the characters/town/world/etc.  That's fine, but what makes it confusing is the author's style of interjecting a mostly linear storytelling method with random pages of information (such as town history background, newspaper articles, ect.).  At first, it threw me off, but after I got used to it, I really became apparent that this background info. is useful to the story.  Not to mention, after the second issue, the plot really starts to get going.  It just gets better and better from there, and overall weaves an interesting story.  Unlike some other comic series, this one feels like it actually has an ending, albeit an open-ended one.  My only complaint is that I never got to see the end of Humbly's story.  Sigh.  Oh well, after the main story, there are several special items at the end, mostly old concept art and stuff garnered off his website. This was all very interesting, and I'm glad it was included.Overall, this was an excellent comic and an excellent product.  My only issue is that now I wonder if this comic is going to unfairly raise my expectations for all other comics I read in the future.  Seriously, though, it's rare to see this level of high quality put into a comic release (or any book release of any kind, to be honest).  So, if you are in any way interested in comics, I suggest you check this one out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I20HU7FHUKJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991303709#wasThisHelpful","R2I20HU7FHUKJS","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of blooming tea, and the first brand I ever had was Teaposy.  That one was gorgeous and delightful!  After that, I ended up getting a Primula teapot gift set, and eventually I replaced the Primula teapot with one from Grosche.  The actual Primula blooming tea balls were not very impressive, as they seemed to be very unreliable with some of the balls floating and refusing to sink, or some not opening properly (the ones that did open properly, though, were nice).  I had a few of the Grosche tea balls that came with the teapot, and they displayed many of the same problems (although, to be fair, they may have been old or something).  After that, I was intrigued to try out the Numi branded ones.Numi has a great reputation for tea, and indeed I like many of their normal boxed teas, such as the white rose flavor.  However, I noticed many bad reviews for their blooming tea.  Still, the price per tea ball was good compared to Teaposy, and I was really intrigued by their unusual flavors.  Most blooming tea I've encountered is either white or green jasmine tea (which is nice), but the Numi tea seems to have more unusual flavors.  The flavors in this box are: Dragon Lily (white tea with lily petals), Sunset Oolong (oolong tea with lily flower), Lavender Dream (lavender flower, hibiscus, and possibly white tea), and Golden Jasmine (black tea and jasmine).  Lavender is a flavor you never really see in blooming tea, so I was excited to try it out.  Not to mention I love the fact that their tea doesn't have any artificial flavors in it.  Besides, even if the tea balls were terrible, I'd only be out about six bucks.The very first thing to discuss is the packaging itself.  It came in a tiny box (which is fine) but inside none of the tea balls were labeled, leaving me to guess which was which based on matching appearances with the pictures on the box (I think I got it right).  More perturbing than that, though, is that the individual ingredients for each type of tea ball are not listed – the ingredient list is all jumbled together for all four.  In addition, the plastic encasing the tea balls is only loosely sealed – it's not vacuum sealed for freshness at all!  The box claims these don't go bad until March 2016, but not being vacuum seals still worries me a bit.  Oh well, there's only four, so surely they'll be used up before long regardless.  I'll go through each individual flavor and describe my experiences.I started off with the Golden Jasmine first, because that's the one my husband was most excited about.  Unfortunately, this experience seems to reinforce all the negative reviews.  The tea ball failed to sink, and it opened sideways on the top of the water line.  Not very impressive or nice-looking at all.  The flavor isn't particularly impressive either.  It tasted of a rather weak black tea, and although the box describes it as being “scented with delicate jasmine,” there is almost no jasmine in evidence.  The scenting must be very “delicate” indeed.  Lest you think it was my steep time or my teapot size, well, I let it steep a full 15 minutes by the end (10 minutes is my normal steep time), and the teapot is the same one I've used for other brands (that gave good flavor).  After my husband and I  each drank one cup, there was enough for one more cup left.  This liquid had, of course, steeped longer due to being left in the pot, and when I drank it, it was indeed a bit stronger tasting.  Unfortunately, it just tasted like slightly stronger black tea; still no real hint of jasmine.  Oh well, one dud out of the four.  We'll see what the others are like...The next one I tried was the Lavender Dream.  I had high hopes for this one since I do like lavender.  While this one sank and opened correctly, it was not particularly attractive.  The “bloom” in the middle wasn't much to look at – just a few ruddy brown petals that looked more like leaves than anything (that was the hibiscus, presumably).  The taste was not good, either.  The hibiscus taste was mildly there, but the lavender wasn't really apparent and the whole thing had an unpleasant bitter undertone.  Overall, I wasn't impressed.Next I tried out the Sunset Oolong.  This one has to be better, right?  Well, the flower in this one was at least more colorful, but this one once again the tea ball refused to sink, and ended up not fully opening either.  The taste was...bland.  It is rather hard to describe, but it's just bland.  Maybe it didn't steep fully or properly since it failed to open?  I don't know.Lastly, I tried out the Dragon Lily.  By this point, I didn't have much hope for this product.  This one, unfortunately, didn't do anything to change my mind.  This one, once AGAIN, didn't sink and opened on its side.  The bloom was dull-colored and rather unattractive regardless.  The taste was pleasant enough, though.  It just tasted of a mild white tea (which it pretty much is).  I can't say I detected any of the purported “velvety apricot flavor” that the box describes, but it was at least drinkable.  However, it wasn't particularly special-tasting, and I can't say I'd want to drink it again (if only because this is an expensive option for something that tastes of plain white tea – I might as well just buy a cheaper box of white tea).Well, overall, I'm deeply disappointed in Numi.  Normally they make such nice tea, but this was a huge let down.  There wasn't a single bloom in here that made me want to buy this again, and frankly, I won't be.  Unfortunately, the other negative reviews are correct.  If you want some blooming tea, I'd recommend you buy Primula (for a cheaper option) or Teaposy (for a really awesome, but more expensive, experience).  There may be other good brands out there, too.  Either way, avoid these.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANALDB46PVCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P0JNZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3ANALDB46PVCH","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned a glass teapot previously (I believe it was the Primula brand) that was of a similar size (about 40 oz. - so slightly smaller than this one).  It was nice enough, but my main purpose for having a glass teapot is exclusively to use for blooming teas (a treat I indulge in only occasionally since they are rather expensive).  The problem with the Primula teapot is that it was short and wide, and while it technically held 40 oz., it was too short to properly display a blooming tea, such that I really couldn't enjoy them as much since the “blooms” would often be squashed and unable to be viewed completely.  Eventually I decided that if I was going to use expensive blooming teas, I might as well purchase a better teapot so that I could fully enjoy them.Enter the Grosche Vienna teapot.  This one is tall and rather large, measuring 5 ½ inches from the bottom to the top lip of the teapot.  The bottom is about 5 inches in diameter.  This makes it quite ideal for viewing blooming teas, even the taller designs.  Physically, the Grosche Vienna teapot feels rather delicate (being made of glass), and I have no doubt that it would break if handled roughly.  The lid does need to be held onto while pouring (or removed), or it will slide off, possibly breaking!  However, it is a glass teapot, and this is an inherent property of them.  It is still quite beautiful regardless, and I really like the nontraditional angular design of the sides.  Plus it is really hard to find glass teapots in this large size range, especially ones that are so nice!  I haven't been brave enough to heat it directly on the stove, so I pour hot water into it instead (a good decision judging by the other reviews, regardless of what the packaging claims).  This method has been working well for me, especially since I only bust it out for the occasional indulgence in a blooming tea (my normal tea gets made in a boring old sauce-pot).I really only use it for blooming tea most of the time, but I have tested the infuser too.  This experience was, sadly, a little less than perfect.  The infuser insert has TINY slits rather than holes, and I'm sure this was meant to prevent small loose leaf teas from slipping through (such as rooibos), but it's more of an irritant than anything.  It doesn't allow water to pass through very quickly at all, which means that tea cannot steep very well, but aside from that, it make filling the teapot irritating.  You have to fill the teapot a bit over half-way so that water doesn't spill out when you stick the insert in, and then, the insert fills with water so slowly that you have to pour the rest of your water in small increments so that the whole thing doesn't overflow.  Bigger holes would have prevented all this nonsense, but of course, a few bits of tea might have fallen out.  I'd say that would be a worthy trade-off, though.  Better yet, adding in some more holes in the sides of the infuser would've helped a lot too.  Oh well, I'd recommend using a teaball (with it's little hook chain hooked to the rim of the teapot) instead of the glass infuser.  I know that defeats the purpose of the pretty glass one, but it honestly works better.My package also came with three bonus blooming teas of the Grosche brand, and unfortunately, they were pretty mediocre.  I don't know if this is a flaw inherent to all Grosche branded blooming teas, or if these were just out of date or something (who knows how long they have been sitting in this package).  The problem with them was that none of them bloomed properly (most didn't open up all the way, or just plain looked hideous, and many of them floated and refused to sink).  The taste seemed okay, though, so maybe it is just a flaw with the Grosche brand.  For reference, I've also tried Primula flowering tea (better, but not perfectly reliable) and Teaposy ones.  The Teaposy ones are the best by far (and most reliable in terms of always opening up properly and such), but also the priciest, so I guess this is one of those situations where you get what you pay for.As for any major flaws in the teapot...well, I can only think of the issue with the infuser.  I do wish sometimes that the glass were a tad thicker, but I haven't yet discovered a glass teapot with thicker glass, so I can't really say it's below the standard or anything.  Also, the narrow opening does make it slightly tricky to clean, but I've discovered that a simple rinse is fine usually, and once it starts to look a bit stained, I use oxyclean.  Just soak the teapot in a bit of hot water and oxyclean and the stains melt right off, no scrubbing involved!  Then just give it a good rinse and it's all ready to go!  Overall, if you're in the market for a glass teapot specifically for blooming tea, I can't think of a better one to recommend than the Grosche Vienna.  Just maybe buy another brand for the actual blooming tea-balls themselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FP5AUGCQV7M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004242Z2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1FP5AUGCQV7M4","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmm...so i'm not exactly the target audience for this device, but I've decided to review it anyway, because writing reviews is fun!  Besides, I might be able to offer some information to help other buyers in the future (and my husband really doesn't like writing reviews, so he said I should do it on my account).  I bought this as a gift for my husband ('cause I have lots of toys so I thought he'd like one, too!) and have gathered his feedback on the device, as well as my own thoughts on the product.  It helps that I got a really good half-price deal on this, so my perception is already skewed slightly toward the positive.First off, I don't entirely get the whole ""fleshlight"" gimmick.  I thought the point was to conceal its true nature and have it look more discrete.  That's all well and good, but this item won't fool anyone into thinking it's a real flashlight.  It's huge (bigger than any real flashlight would be), looks really plastic and fake, and as if to rub salt in the wound, it's got the word ""fleshlight"" plastered on the side in big letters.  Oh, well, I suppose that doesn't matter so long as it functions well...My husband says it works quite nicely and feels quite good (use some nice water-based lube with it, of course - I got him some ""Gun Oil H2O,"" which I recommend).  He recommends warming it up with some warm water first, though.  I stuck my finger down the entrance hole (which is actually strangely fun to do), and I can say it feels squishy, but also kinda firm (like most good things in life!), but didn't remind me strongly of the real thing.  However, my husband seems to like it, so that's good enough!So, functionally, all seems well, but the issue comes afterwards.  Cleanup of this item is not easy at all.  One has to run water through it to remove 'fun-time fluids,' and then the item takes ages to dry out.  Even if you remove the squishy silicone part from the plastic casing, it still doesn't dry out any faster.  Even putting it back into the plastic casing and standing it upright to help the water drip out doesn't make it dry any faster.  It took a couple days for it to dry out completely!  This is certainly an issue if you're worried about kids/roommates/your parents/your pets/that one friend who won't ever go home/etc. seeing this out in the open.  I'm thinking the best way to handle this is to get a blow dryer and use the low heat setting.  That's not exactly discrete either, but it might speed up the process a bit.  If I had my way, I think the design could be improved by cutting the entire item lengthwise, then permanently gluing the silicone to the plastic housing, and have the two halves connected by a hinge that could be open and shut.  That way, it could just be hinged open when cleaning, and it'd be able to be dried much faster.  Of course, I have no idea if this plan is even possible in reality, or if the silicone would lack sufficient rigidity to hold its shape during use in this design.  Oh well.  I still give this item five stars since there doesn't appear to be any better alternatives in the current market, and this is really the best one can get for this type of item.Overall, this seems like a great item for its purpose.  I do sorely wish the design made it easier to clean, but this is probably the best male toy of its type that one can find.  You'll just have to decide for yourself if the functionality is worth the trade-off of the inconvenient cleaning.  If you're on the fence about getting one, try to wait for a good sale before taking the plunge!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSP2NAQSGDFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008OISS9K#wasThisHelpful","R2TSP2NAQSGDFX","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already own several fake gauge earrings because I've really fallen in love with the look of them!  To finish up my collection, I was interested in getting some really cool dragon themed earrings.  I didn't find any that appealed to me for awhile, and then these came up!I love how they are based on a more “medieval” style dragon rather than the oriental kind (which are pretty common in fake gauge earrings – I love the unusualness of this one).  I also like their small size (mine measure at a petite 1.25” diameter) and the silver tips that give it some edge.  Oh, and lest you think this is something that won't look as nice in person as the picture does, the carving work on mine was superb.  All the little details pictured are present and look great!  Indeed, I've not been let down by this seller yet!As for insertion, I found it pretty easy, but I've got so many fake gauges that I'm pretty good at this by now.  If you are new to fake gauges, you might need to practice a bit.  Just make sure you treat them gently so you don't bend the ear wire.  I find them to be very light weight when worn, and they look great on me.So, overall I'm very pleased with these.  If you are looking for some cool dragon earrings, or just some cool earrings in general, give these a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DMNYOKZJ51Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK0UPZQ#wasThisHelpful","R14DMNYOKZJ51Y","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I was intrigued by this item but kind of too embarrassed to review it, then I thought, ""what the heck, I'll do it!"" and picked it up.  TP+ Cleansing Foam with Aloe is exactly what you imagine it to be - a foam you put on your tissue paper to help pamper your behind.  Well, no one pampers his behind more than my husband (who spends an inordinate amount of time in the bathroom), so I decided to let him do the bulk of product testing for me.  Of course, I have tested it as well - it's always useful to get a second opinion.The product itself comes in a small bottle, which measures about 5 inches tall and 1 ¼ inches in diameter.  This is a great compact size if you intend to bring it with you while traveling.  The bottle has a very easy to press nozzle, which secretes a foam substance.  This foam feels exactly like those foaming hand sanitizers.  It's a nice texture because it doesn't run nor soak through the toilet paper excessively and make it soggy (assuming you are using good quality toilet paper and not the horrible industrial stuff).  As for actual use...well, I didn't experience any burning sensations or other allergic reactions, but your mileage may vary here.  I also felt like it did a good job producing a feeling of cleanliness, at least better than plain toilet paper.  I would compare it to moist wipes, but I've never actually used those before, so I wouldn't know...As for my husband's assessment, he says that it's a very nice item to have to get that feeling of extra clean, but that it's not essential.  So, nice as an extra, but not an item he couldn't live without.  That's pretty much the same feeling I had, too.  Once again, though, your mileage may vary here since everyone's different.  I, personally, say you give it a try if the idea intrigues you.  If you end up not liking it, well, then, you're not really out much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZUZX5VOO5XE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJE5NCS#wasThisHelpful","RQZUZX5VOO5XE","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, just to give any readers a full disclosure, let me state outright that I'm not too fond of green tea.  In fact, I have tons of different kinds of tea and herbal “teas” (yes, I know brewed herbs are technically tisanes and not “tea”), but the one thing I don't keep on hand is green tea, because I don't care for its flavor.  However, when I saw this item that combines green tea and peppermint, I thought, “why not?”  The great thing about peppermint is that its strongly flavored, and might make the green tea more palatable...The first thing I did when I got my tea in the mail was to open it up and sniff a tea bag.  It smells strongly of peppermint, with no real hint of green tea.  I chose to brew mine for 10 minutes, and after tasting it hot, I can say that the green tea is definitely subtle.  In fact, I almost wouldn't know that it wasn't plain peppermint tea.  It tastes almost exactly like normal peppermint, with only a tiny hint of “something else” in there.  Once I let it cool in the fridge and tried it iced, it tasted about the same.So, I can safely recommend this tea to someone who doesn't really care for green tea, but might be interesting in drinking it for health benefits or some such since you really can't taste it.  However, if you were really hoping that the green tea flavor was prominent with only a hint of peppermint, well, unfortunately, you'll be out of luck with this product.  In fact, if that's your situation, I'd suggest buying some loose leaf green tea and peppermint (easy enough to find) and making your own little mix.  As it is, this tea is decent enough for my needs, so I'm pretty pleased with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYG4APO295LT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSYVFQY#wasThisHelpful","R3DYG4APO295LT","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the past year, real life had crept up on me, and I hadn't even noticed that my favorite author had released a new book until now!  I've been a fan of Amelia's since middle school, and although I'm no longer within the target age range for her books (far from), I find that I still enjoy them.  After her last book, Promises to Keep, I was feeling rather anxious about how any future sequels would fare (some rather intense changes take place in that book, but I won't spoil it here).  However, this book does not take place chronologically after that book, but instead is set in the distant past (in the 1800s).  Oh well, so it's not a sequel.  Nonetheless, I did enjoy it.The book follows protagonist Vance Ehecatl, a shapeshifter who was raised in luxury and gently cared for, but who is essentially being manipulated by his vampire overlords.  Eventually, he must choose where his loyalties lie.  I'm not going to give away any more of the plot than that, but suffice it to say, it's a great and interesting new perspective from Ms. Atwater-Rhodes.  I've read every single book of hers (plus extra stuff on her website), so I can definitely say that this book offers a new and fresh perspective.  Diehard fans of her books will be quite pleased with it.However, this book isn't really for “newcomers” to the series.  In fact, in the past I was able to describe certain books of hers as okay starting points for people unfamiliar with her works, but with each passing book, it's become apparent to me that anyone who doesn't already have a background in her world will be awfully confused.  This book is no different.  I know some might claim that you could jump in right here and be fine, but that's not really the case (and judging by the other reviews where people were obviously confused, I'm quite right about that).  That being said, I personally loved this new book, but I'm already very familiar with her world, and many of the characters featured here were introduced previously in other books (and indeed, for the dedicated fan, seeing all those cameos were great!).  Many of the characters, though, were fleshed out much better in previous books, and I can imagine that a new reader wouldn't really understand these people without that prior knowledge (in fact, it's helpful to have even read all the supplementary information in the wiki page on her website). A new reader would probably not understand much of anything that happened in this book, and I don't blame them for being confused at all.  Still, I did enjoy it.So...do I recommend “Bloodwitch?”  Well, if you're already a fan of Ms. Atwater-Rhodes' writing and have read her other books, then yes, it's quite the treat!  However, if you are new to her writings, I'd suggest starting with her very first book, “In the Forest of the Night” and just reading them in order of release.  I know that reading that many books is a pretty big investment, but you'll know after the first two or three if her writing style is for you or not.  I'm already a huge fan and love her work, but not everyone does, so I guess that's up to you.  You'll just have to read and find out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29IPDD9M6VC31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743033#wasThisHelpful","R29IPDD9M6VC31","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a canopy bed with a big metal frame, and I was looking for some new curtains to put on it.  My first thought was to buy some 216"" long window scarves, and I did, but they ended up being awful quality - full of snags and runs.  So, I dumped those and went with Plan B: these ruffled curtains.  I was somewhat reluctant to buy them, though, since there were some negative reviews.  Still, I forged ahead and bought four of the 60x84"" ones in the cream color (to match my bedroom).I'm very pleased to say that the quality was great!  I didn't get any with horribly crooked ruffles (of course, I'm sure a few ruffles are a bit crooked, but not to a distracting degree).  They have a great weight to them and are not as sheer as other reviews would have you believe.  In fact, I'd say the material is voile-style and not like a sheer at all.  They are reasonably heavy without being too heavy, I'd say.  The cream color is a light cream (almost an off-white) and is pretty true to the picture.  One negative point, though, is that when I got them they had tons of tiny loose strings hanging off everywhere.  I trimmed them off, and now it's not an issue.  Of course, they were also terribly wrinkled, and I tried the ""wet them and let them drip dry"" trick to get out the wrinkles, but no luck, so I had to iron them.  That took about two hours, but hey, it's done now, so no big deal.  Oh, as a side note, I think that a rod bigger than 1"" diameter probably wouldn't fit through the rod pocket.  Hmm...maybe a 1.5"" rod could fit at the most.  Keep that in mind if you're thinking of buying this.The ruffles look great on my canopy bed, and I've already found four different ways of arranging them (via wrapping around the bed posts, draping across the cross-beams, pulling them back and using ribbon ties, etc.) to get different effects.  It's too bad amazon doesn't allow picture uploads anymore, or I'd show some pics.  Oh well, I'm really pleased with the versatility of these curtains for a canopy bed.  They probably wouldn't be nearly as versatile when used on windows, but I'm sure they'd still be pretty enough.Anyway, I heartily recommend these curtains, especially if you have a canopy bed of the sort with a big rectangular frame.  They are a great value for their price (which was about twenty dollars a panel at the time of my purchase).  They would look great with a shabby chic décor, or just for anyone who wants to add a touch of romance or whimsy to their room!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9XFNCLS4203B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00851A2R2#wasThisHelpful","R9XFNCLS4203B","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had recently gotten tired of my old bedding (a perfectly good cream colored Raymond Waites set that is nice enough but I was in the mood for something brighter).  I was interested in something very bright and cheery instead of subdued for my room.  Unfortunately, the manufacturing world has decided to switch most bedding to microfiber (read: polyester) because it's cheaper, but I can't stand polyester.  I need cotton because it breathes!  So, naturally, that limited my options.  I looked at tons of queen sized bedding online, but I wasn't really feeling a lot of them.  I was thrilled when I found this set, because it's made of cotton and is so bright and pretty, but there are some downsides...First off, though, let's talk about the good parts.  The set is indeed brightly colored - just like the picture.  I like the fact that the squares are just printed on instead of being an actual patchwork quilt-type thing, mainly because that's fewer seams that could potentially rip loose in the wash.  The underside of the comforter is light minty green with white dots (a decent backing, but you couldn't really call this comforter ""reversible""). The pillowcases seem to fit fine.  The fitted sheet that comes with it has elastic all the way around, which I like.  Unfortunately, it's made for a much bigger mattress than I have (I have an 8 inch memory foam one), so I couldn't use it (FYI: the only sheets I've found that fit thin mattresses like that well come from Target!).  I would've bought the smaller 8-Piece set without the sheets, but it seems chronically out of stock.  Anyway, it's a generally nice-looking comforter for the price, even if I ended up not using the sheets.  That's about it for the good points, unfortunately.Now, the bad stuff...  When I first got the set in the mail and opened it up, I spread it out and noticed that several of the tacking stitches were already torn loose.  I fixed them by hand.  Then I noticed the awful texture of this comforter.  This is some really low grade cotton, and was immensely stiff and actually made a crinkling sound when moved.  It was so bad that I decided a washing was in order to hopefully soften it up (of course, you should always wash new bedding anyways).  The washing did help soften it a bit (not as much as I'd like, though), but the rest of the tacking stitches came loose in the wash - all of them.  I had to fix all of them by hand (I also added extras to be safe).  Well, that should take care of that.  Unfortunately, that's when I noticed that the batting was rather thin.  The comforter fabric feels loose and saggy because there just isn't a decent amount of batting in there (enough to keep me warm, though).  So, I guess my point here is that quality is rather poor overall.  The weird thing is that my other comforter cost about the same price, but is of immensely better quality.  Go figure.Despite all those rather negative points, I'm still overall pleased with it.  It's certainly very pretty, and does it's job of brightening up the room with color.  Just be prepared to do a lot of work to fix it up if you choose to buy it.  It's a shame they didn't do a better job on this comforter - then it would've been outstanding and worthy of five stars.  As it is, though, it's only getting 3 stars from me.  I imagine it won't last forever, but I'll just try to enjoy it until it breaks, then get a new one - hopefully something of better quality.Update:  Okay, here's an update to my original review. I'm lowering my score to 2 stars now.  I really wish I hadn't been so in love with the color of this comforter when I first bought it - I would have sent it back for a refund.  I've had it an additional four months now, and the cotton fabric is still ""crinkly"" and unpleasant (in a way that cotton really should not be), and doesn't seem to be softening any more with repeated washings at all.  It hasn't fallen apart yet (due to my many tacking stitches), but it's still loose and floppy feeling - like sleeping with an old sack for a comforter.  This is the one time I truly wish the cotton had shrunk in the dryer because then it wouldn't be so floppy and sad!  Also, and this might be just my imagination, but this comforter feels like it doesn't breathe quite as well as my other one, despite having such thin batting.  Either way, there's no doubt about it, the cotton fabric is of poor quality.  On the bright side, the colors have not faded and still look quite bright.  Too bad the thin filling and bagginess of it hurt the overall appearance.  My final verdict on this set now is to just avoid it.  I know it looks really pretty and brightly colored, but it's just not worth the poor quality and the hassle of fixing the stitches.  I'll personally be avoiding the Pointehaven brand in the future.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N9F88BZRD6KT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JMZDMA#wasThisHelpful","R2N9F88BZRD6KT","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own several Sauder furniture products already (the Harbor View Computer Armoire, Harbor View Dresser and the Vinegate Storage Tower) and I love them!  So, when my husband wanted a new desk that better fit his needs, I looked to Sauder once more since I trust their quality (well, for particle board, of course).We ended up choosing this desk and buying it from a certain store that starts with “W” and ends in “-mart” (seriously, it's cheaper there – I paid about $250).  Once it arrived, we laid out all the pieces, and sorted/counted all the hardware.  I only discovered one bit of damage, a large scratch on one of the big pieces.  It wasn't a big deal though, because it was a part that would be under the desk and not so visible.  I touched it up with a furniture marker and moved on to assembly.Assembly for this item is the hardest I've had for any Sauder piece of furniture.  It definitely requires two people, and as with any assembly, you need to proceed methodically and carefully (preferably reading through the instructions first before starting).  Assembly took about 4 hours, as I figured it would.  Oh, and it's in the instructions, but as a heads up, you can adjust the individual heights of each dresser drawer so that they are all evenly spaced and perfect-looking.The desk is quite heavy once fully assembled, but I count that a good thing since that means it's sturdy.  The finish, though, is not the strongest, so if you eat at your desk a lot, I'd recommend using a placemat so you don't damage the finish over time.  In terms of overall appearance, I'd say the desk looks nice enough for being particle board, but it does have little imperfections here and there (such as slightly crooked spots) that keep it from looking like a true “executive” desk.  Let's be honest here, though, no real “executive” would buy an unassembled particle board desk to stick in their office – they'd get one made of real wood.  For its price compared to real wood, I'd have to say it's pretty good, and would be fine for home usage.  My husband certainly seems pleased with it, so that's good enough for me!  Oh, and by the way, this one does not have the blank 'cardboard' back, so it can look good from any angle!Something that you should be aware of, and something that I was disappointed with, is the two top drawers.  They look like two small  drawers each, but they are actually just faux drawers, and it's one big drawer.  That means there's only 4 drawers total (plus the middle one, more on that later), not six.  The two big lower drawers actually are built to hold file folders, which is cool.  They even feature adjustable sizes for different sized file folder types (pretty much all the standard sizes).  The middle drawer is actually a hidden pullout keyboard tray!  It opens up and the front flips down (and features a hole in the back to let cords out).  That's pretty cool, but my husband preferred his keyboard on top of the desk, so he just used the middle drawer for office supplies.  The desk also features a hole in the top (with a cover cap) to hold cords from a monitor.  Overall, it's a pretty cool, functional desk that looks nice enough for home use, so if you have a tolerance for assembling furniture (I'm a freak and actually enjoy it), then I'd recommend it!Oh, and for anyone who needs them, here's a load of measurements for your pleasure...  First off, the whole desk measures 29 ” deep by 65 1/8” long by 30” high.  The space for the desk chair to go under measures 24 ½” high by 29 3/4” wide.  The height of the feet on the bottom of the desk is 4 3/4” (don't know why you'd need this info., but here it is!).  As for the drawers, the interior of the middle drawer keyboard tray measures 27 3/8” wide by 14” deep (front to back) by 3 3/4” high.  When the front is flipped down for keyboard use, the depth is a full 18 1/2”.  The interior of the top two drawers measure 12 1/8” wide by 14 ¼” deep (front to back) and 6 ½ high.  The interior of the bottom two file drawers measure 12” wide by 14 ¼” deep (front to back) and 9 ½ high.  Well, that's everything that I could imagine you needing a measurement for.  Hope it helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGG9KMVTHZAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034JXWWC#wasThisHelpful","RVGG9KMVTHZAZ","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This seems like a perfectly nice stapler.  It's a rather average desktop stapler and takes average size staples (I used some generic branded ones I already had instead of the recommended brand specific ones).  Size-wise, the stapler is very average for a desktop stapler, measuring 7 1/4” long.  The weight is decent considering it's all-metal construction, but it's not overly heavy or anything.Performance-wise, it seems to be pretty good.  I tested it on just two sheets of paper, and also on a thick bunch of paper (pushing it's 20 page limit) and it performed fine on both.  As I've been using it, I haven't had any jams or staples fail to go through things, so I have no complaints there.  I don't feel like it takes a particularly strong amount of force to staple things, but it's not as easy at those “easy touch” staplers or anything – pretty average, I'd say.  Oh, and as an added bonus, if you use a switch on the bottom, it can be opened up flat and used to staple things to bulletin boards.  I suppose that's useful if you have a bulletin board that requires stapling.Overall, I'd have to say this is an average, but sturdy and reliable stapler.  It might not be spectacular or standout in any way, but I have no complaints against it.

Oh, and my old flashlight is a nasty cheap thing from dollar tree, so obviously this is a big step up.  How good is it?  Let's find out!First off, size-wise it's quite small at only four inches long.  As for it being advertized as light weight, well it weighs 2.15 oz., so I'd say it's pretty light.  The build quality here feels fantastic.  The housing body is a sturdy metal, while the head and end are both plastic (nice plastic though).  I also love the metal clip part - that thing is never going to snap off!As for functionality...  First off, it can apparently take a variety of batteries, but I only had some AA batteries on hand, so I used one of those.  It was quite easy to screw off the button end and stick the battery in there.  Also, I feel stupid about this, but the flashlight arrived with no instructions, so it actually took me awhile to figure out that if you pull the head of it out, you can narrow the beam.  Just push it back in if you want a wider beam.  Speaking of which, I don't often run into tiny flashlights that have such wide beams, and I love it!  Of course, the ability to adjust it is even better!  Lastly, let's talk about the light itself.  The LED casts a more bright white light than yellow (don't know if that's important to you or not, but I like it).  As for brightness, mine's a 220 lumen version, and subjectively, I can say that it's pretty darn bright for its size.  It's certainly bright enough to look into the interior of a computer or behind the couch to see where you dropped your keys, but maybe not bright enough for a romantic nighttime beach walk.Overall, I'd say this is a great flashlight for its size, but just don't expect any miraculous, unfair levels of brightness out of it.  Also, the price as of the time of this writing was about ten bucks, so you really can't beat the price either.  If you need a tiny flashlight, you may as well get this one - it's nice!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAKPXF2C3ROG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEMUOWU#wasThisHelpful","R2QAKPXF2C3ROG","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited when I saw the brown version of this binder because it looks a lot like one of those really classy stitched-leather binders (I mean, if you squint a bit, from a distance...), and indeed, I got the brown one!  Once seen in person, it can sort of pass for leather (I mean, if you squint a bit, from a distance...).  Okay, in all seriousness, it's not going to fool anyone, but it still looks like a nice classy binder, and could be useful if you're going for that look.More important than aesthetics, though, is how well this binder functions.  In that regard, I'd say that it works as you'd expect (for the most part...).  The metal rings are good and hold paper well and if it matters to you, the rings are on the back cover and not on the binder's spine.  Some people prefer one way or the other, but I have no real preference there.  This binder has some pretty serious flaws, at least for me.  There is no back cover pocket, only a front one,  and it's one of those horrible half-pockets.  If you don't know what I mean, the right side of the pocket is totally open, allowing paper packets to fall out.  Not to mention, due to the stitching, any standard size 8.5”x11” paper you put in them stick out the top awkwardly by just a little bit (however, standard college-ruled notebook paper seems to fit fine; I guess it's slightly smaller).  That's a shame for such a nice looking binder, because anyone who'd drop money on this classy-looking item wouldn't want it to then look messy from papers sticking out the top.  The lack of functional pockets is what kills it for me in this item.Oh, and on a different note, the metal rings are removable.  According to the instructions, this is actually for recycling purposes.  I can't imagine that even people who recycle will remember this when the time comes to throw this binder out, but it's a nice thought on the manufacturer's part, I suppose.Well, I guess the last point of interest is price.  This binder was about eight dollars as of the time of writing this review, which is indeed more expensive than your average cheap three dollar white binder (we all know the type).  Of course, anyone buying this would be doing so specifically for it's appearance rather than just it's functionality as a binder, so the price might be worth it depending on one's perspective.  I'm just sad that the whole pocket thing keeps it from being a perfectly functioning binder.  I guess if you don't need that pocket or simply want to trade functionality for aesthetic appeal, then go for it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NPF63WUUZPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HY9IKI#wasThisHelpful","R29NPF63WUUZPI","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have the Sauder Harbor View Computer Armoire (which I absolutely love) and the Sauder Vinegate Storage Tower (using it in the bedroom as a display cabinet since even though it isn't technically part of the Harbor View collection, the finish matches perfectly!).  After those two items, it seemed time to finish out my bedroom suite with the Sauder Harbor View 5 Drawer Chest.  My old dresser is actually another Sauder dresser, but in a finish that doesn't match.  I've had it for 8 years, and it has held up beautifully well (the only reason I replaced it was to get a matching color item).  What I'm trying to say is, I trust Sauder's quality.Sauder makes a lot of what I'd refer to as ""high end particle board"" furniture.  Unlike many brands that make particle board furniture (*cough* Prepac *cough*), Sauder actually makes rather nice quality for being particle board. Their pieces are nice and heavy and feel sturdy instead of weak.  However, this is only if assembled properly...That brings me to my next point that everyone seems to complain about: the assembly.  Yes, this will take you about 4 hours to put together (and I suggest having help to make things a bit easier).  Frankly, you shouldn't rush through this job.  I suggest reading through the instructions once fully before even starting so you have an idea of what pieces go together and what their ultimate articulation is going to be.  It helps a lot.  Then, lay out all your pieces and parts and go through the list, accounting for all of them and checking for damage (mine was completely undamaged).  Make sure your sort your screws and other parts into organized piles at this time.  Once you do start assembly, make sure you are slow, thorough and methodical to ensure accuracy (which is good advice for many projects in life).  I was able to assemble my dresser easily and it is sturdy, even, and beautiful.  Oh, and it's in the instructions, but as a heads up, you can adjust the individual heights of each dresser drawer so that they are all evenly spaced and perfect-looking.Unfortunately, though, when I made this dresser I thought I'd be clever and leave off the drawer Interlocking System (this prevents you from opening more than one drawer at a time) to save a tiny bit of time.  That was probably a poor decision, though, as I discovered after testing that the dresser will become unstable if you open just three drawers at once.  My old dresser didn't do that, but it was also a lot deeper (and much of that was empty space since the drawers were shallower by comparison).  So, this dresser sacrifices a bit of stability for a reduced size profile, which in my tiny apartment is much appreciated.  I then decided to retroactively put in the Interlock System, and did so successfully with minimal effort.Now that I've discussed all that, let's go through some pros and cons of this item.  First, the pros.  It's a very attractive item for being particle board.  Yes, it does have the ""cardboard"" back (but every piece of particle board furniture has this - there's no getting away from it).  It still looks good for what it is, and matching the other furniture from the Harbor View (and Vinegate) collection well.  As mentioned earlier, if assembled correctly, it is level, strong, and sturdy (for the most part, see my cons below).  On top of that, the drawers are rather spacious and make full use of the unit's size.Now, let's have some cons.  The finish will scratch if you aren't careful, but being an ""antiqued"" finish gives it the benefit of still looking acceptable if you touch up the scratches with a furniture marker.  Antique charm and all that.  The one big con I really think of is the drawer bottoms, which unlike every other nice thick sturdy piece on this dresser, is made of a very thin, flimsy material (some sort of press-board, I think).  This gave me some pause at first, but then I realized that my old dresser had the same sort of thin flimsy-feeling thing for it's drawer bottoms, and that lasted me 8 years of heavy use.  So, maybe it won't be such an issue after all.  I wouldn't use this dresser for a very young child's room, though, as they might manage to break the drawer bottoms, and besides, if they climbed up the dresser, it would surely tip over since it is front-heavy.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the dresser.  It's meeting my needs quite well, and is the Sauder brand quality I've come to expect (in fact, I'll be sticking to this brand as much as possible for future furniture needs).  Sauder's Harbor View collection (and honestly many of their other collections) are a great way to get a decent-looking furniture set without spending a fortune for real wood items (which will often run you $1000+ for a single item).  If you're on a budget but still want a nice look, I highly recommend the Sauder Harbor View 5-Drawer chest (and much of their other stuff too)!Oh, and for anyone who needs them, here are some relevant measurements.  The overall dresser dimensions are 49.5"" high, 31"" wide, and 17.625"" deep.  The inner dimensions of the top dresser drawer is 25.625"" wide across, 13.875"" from front to back, and 3.75"" deep (note that this is the smallest of the drawers). The next three drawers measure 24.5"" wide across, 13.75"" from front to back, and 6.375"" deep.  The bottom drawer is only very slightly different from the other three, and is: 24.625"" wide across, 13.875"" from front to back, and 6.375"" deep.  Well, hope these measurements were helpful to someone!Edit: Just an update.  The dresser is still working quite well for the most part, but I've encountered a minor issue with the drawer locking system.  The bottom two drawers stick sometimes.  What I mean is that they don't open sometimes even when the other drawers are shut, and strangely this problem is solved by opening a higher up drawer first, then closing it.  This was a kind of an annoying problem, so I removed the locking mechanisms from the bottom two drawers.  Problem solved!  Now it works fine and I have no further issues.  Just putting this out there in case someone's having similar problems and need a fix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37FDC3OXBOVSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DKVBIQ#wasThisHelpful","R37FDC3OXBOVSA","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm long past the days of needing locker accessories, but I still thought this pencil cup looked interesting, either for a fridge door, or to sit on my desk like a normal pencil holder.  The color looks nice in person (a nice rich purple) and the construction seems solid.I tested it on the fridge and the magnets are quite strong, but I've decided to use it on my desk.  I like the idea of the divider in the middle so I can better organize my stuff.  Once closed up, the pencil cup still holds well and does not pop open accidentally (which is great).  However, there are some serious flaws in the design...First off, is a minor complaint:  it feels ever so slightly too tall for the average pen/mechanical pencil.  This is a rather personal subjective thing, but I wish it was just 1/2 of an inch lower.  I recognize that this negative point is a bit nitpicky, but there is a far worse issue I ran into.Those strong awesome magnets that let it hang on lockers and fridge doors are actually so strong that once it's closed (to use on a desk), anything that's got a bit of metal in it sticks the middle divider.  Yes, really.  My scissors stick to it, and even my mechanical pencils stick to it (by the top clip part, which is often made of metal in mechanical pencils).  I guess this could be good if you are using it in a locker and you want your mechanical pencils to be really secure because it's all magnetically stuck, but I found it irritating.  The magnets were so strong that every time I pulled my scissors out to use them, it would knock the cup askew just a bit.  It's just the sort of tiny irritation that would end up bugging me a lot over time...  And even if most high schoolers (the target audience for this product) wouldn't be stashing scissors in their locker, most of them will be using mechanical pencils, and they may find the tugging magnetism every time they tried to get one out annoying.  Or maybe it'll be a plus since the pencils will be so secure...Eh, my final verdict on this product is that while I had good expectations for it, I'm thinking it's not right for my particular needs.  I'm probably better off to just buy one of those simple organizer cups that you see everywhere.  Still, if you have a locker that needs a good, strong magnetic pencil cup, I think this might be just the thing for you...","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSHTD8SUHX9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4613Y4#wasThisHelpful","R2JSHTD8SUHX9C","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was rather intrigued when I saw this device – it's like a notebook and  binder combined!  Well, that's technically what it is – a hybrid between the two.  I use binders a lot for my college classes, and tend to avoid notebooks (don't like the fact that you can't replace or move paper).  Of course, the only downside to a binder is size since they can be a bit bulkier than needed depending on the size.  So, when I saw this item, I was willing to give it a try.First off, let me give you a quick run-down of what comes in this and exactly what it's all like.  The front cover has a clear plastic pocket so you can put any labeling page in there you want (such as “Accounting 101”).  The back cover is much the same, sans the clear pocket.  I really don't like these covers because they are floppy.  If only they had been stiff plastic instead!  The floppiness of them makes the whole thing feel unstable when you are lifting it in and out of a backpack, plus if you wanted to fold the front cover back and write on it in the field like a notebook, be prepared to have a really awkward thing on your hands.  Meh.Well, moving on from that, once you open the cover there are two pocket pages/tab dividers (apparently the theme of “hybrids” runs throughout).  Unfortunately, these pocket pages are nearly useless for anything more than 2-3 sheets of paper.  Why?  Well, the pocket's left edge isn't secured to anything.  Yes, it's just open and the pocket just sort of hangs there.  They added a flap to the top to help hold the papers in (they knew it was a terrible idea and tried to compensate).  If you put in something like a stapled packet of papers (the sort of thing your professor might hand out), it'd fall right out during normal use.  Sadly, compared to a binder with normal pockets (which a packet of papers WOULD fit into), this thing doesn't compare favorably.  Interestingly, on top of the open flap pocket, there's a smaller pocket that I don't really know what to do with.  I suppose a few notecards or something could fit in there, but of course, the number of notecards most people would use would be far too thick for it.  It might be fine to hold some pencils though.  Well, it seems that I'm not too impressed by these pocket pages (the tab label on the side works fine though!).Next up, we have some page protectors combined with tab dividers (see, hybrids again!).  Much like the pocket pages, they are open on the left side!  Completely unlike a real page protector!  These also feature a flap at the top to help hold the page in.  Unlike the pocket pages, though, being open on the left side doesn't hurt it too much since you'd only ever put two pages at most into a page protector.  The tab divider part functions well enough (and yes, they do include a few labels for them).  After those, we have a rather decent amount of lined paper, and a reasonable amount of grid-lined graph paper.  Those are rather nice freebies, but not really necessary.So, that is all that is included in this package, so let's talk about the construction of the main outer cover part.  As I already mentioned, the covers are floppy and I really dislike it (although this may be a personal preference – your mileage may vary).  The rings, interestingly, are rubberized plastic, and do not work on a spring mechanism like a traditional binder.  Instead, they pull apart and reveal a long plastic thing that fits into the hole to keep it secure.  They seem a bit weaker than a proper metal ring on a binder, but more importantly, they are on the outside of the whole notebook-thing.  This means that they are going to take the most abuse from rubbing around in a backpack and will be extremely easy to catch on something, which could be quite irritating.  If they were metal, then they might have been more suited to withstand that kind of wear and tear, but I suspect these plastic things won't last very long.  Other than that, there's a bit of fabric used to help hold the front and back covers together (and protect your pages) but who knows how long that'd last before ripping...  Size-wise, it says it can hold 200 sheets of paper, and I measured it expanded and it seems like it could be equivalent to about a 1 inch binder in size.Overall, I'd have to say that this hybrid notebook/binder idea was interesting in theory, but maybe not well-executed in practice.  Perhaps if they had replaced the rubber rings with metal ones and made the covers out of a proper stiff material instead of bendy stuff, it could've been good.  Not to mention making proper pocket pages and page protectors.  Supposing, though, that you are not like me and the bendy covers and rubber rings and open pockets don't bother you, there's still the issue of cost.  As of the time of writing this review, just one of these will cost you around sixteen dollars.  Compare that with your average 1 inch binder, which only costs about two-three dollars (or your standard notebook, which is also pretty cheap), and you have to seriously ask yourself how much you really like this item.  Imagine trying to buy one for each class!  I know you're thinking that you'd probably put all your classes in this one “notebinder” and not buy separate ones for each class, but remember that's it's only got about a 1 inch capacity.  I personally find that I need a separate binders for my classes, so I'd have to drop a lot of money if I wanted to switch to using only these things.  Sigh...  All things considered, I can't really recommend this item unless the things I mentioned in this review wouldn't bother you at all.  To me, it seems like a poor execution of a unique idea, or perhaps an idea that didn't need to exist at all...  Either way, I'm going to stick to my normal binders.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXZUKCE8YLYT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OCW7YS#wasThisHelpful","RXZUKCE8YLYT3","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a disclaimer before I start this review, let me describe my exact situation and interest in this product.  I am not actively on a diet/exercise program nor actively trying to lose weight.  I just happened to hear about these and read about their appetite suppressing abilities, and I was curious to see if they actually worked or not.  Since they came up in Vine for review, I figured I might as well give them a try since I really had nothing to lose.I followed the instructions on the label and took these well before the meal itself (the bottle says to take them 30-120 minutes before the meal).  I tested these pills for several days (about 2 weeks total).  I can honestly say that they had absolutely no effect on my appetite at all.  They didn't suppress it (nor increase it either, thankfully).  They didn't make me feel fuller sooner, nor as though I could go longer before eating again.  It was as though I might as well be taking nothing at all.  On the bright side, they didn't cause any horrifying side effects either (which is why I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1).Overall, I'd have to conclude that these just didn't work with my body chemistry or that they don't work at all and all the happy people are just subject to placebo effect (which is entirely possible with something as subjective as “appetite”).  A third possibility is that this specific brand doesn't produce high quality pills and that another brand might be better.  Either way, I don't care enough to try out another brand.  If you're interested in trying these, I'd try to find a smaller bottle so that you spend a minimum amount of money first, so that if they don't work for you, you won't be out much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBK4ARRQ0874/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBFQEEI#wasThisHelpful","R3PBK4ARRQ0874","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally use clinical strength deodorant (Degree is my favorite brand) but they are expensive, so I'm always trying out other deodorants to see if I can get away with something cheaper.  That brings me to Speed Stick Gear, Cool Motion scent.  This is rather cheaply priced deodorant that makes the bold claim of being “48 hour protection.”  We'll see...Well, I normally put on my clinical strength deodorant at night after my shower, and then do not reapply until the next night.  Since the Speed Stick deodorant claims to be 48 hour, I decided to follow my normal application routine.  So, after trying it out for several days, I have made a few observations...Firstly, it is not quite as strong as clinical strength deodorant, but it's rather admirable for its price.  It does not last 48 hours though, as it seems that by the time night has hit, it's definitely time to shower and reapply.  It's pretty good at blocking smells but only average at stopping sweat (which is fair because even clinical strength doesn't seem to completely stop sweating for me, and I'm not even a heavy sweater).  Lastly, as for the smell, I rather like it.  I don't quite know how to describe what “Cool Motion” smells like, but it's pleasant (I guess if I had to describe it, I'd say it smells a lot like many brands of bar soap I've smelled over the years).So, in conclusion, I'd have to say that this seems like a decent deodorant option if you're on a budget.  In fact, I'm going to keep testing mine during the hot summer and see if I like it well enough to make a permanent switch to it, if only to save a bit of money.  If you're interested in getting away from expensive clinical deodorants, you might as well give this one a try – even if you don't like it, you're not out much money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IAY90PH69DDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1HAR1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1IAY90PH69DDT","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I normally stick to clinical strength deodorants, and my favorite is currently Degree Clinical Strength Motion Sense, so when I saw this “normal” version of Motion Sense, I decided to try it out.  I was mainly interested in trying it because it's a bit cheaper than the clinical strength stuff, and I have an issue with the holes in the clinical strength container getting clogged constantly with bits of fluff (and no, I don't really know where they come from – I didn't think my armpits were collecting that much lint!).  Anyway, let's see if this deodorant is any better for me...Interestingly, this deodorant is an invisible solid rather than a smooth solid (like the Clinical strength – which is sort of soft like a mixture between powder and gel).  Anyway, it went on easily enough, and didn't seem to leave cakey white marks on anything.  I rather like the smell, which is a strong berry-ish scent.  Some people might not like their deodorants so strong, but I enjoyed it.  The smell does, however, seem to lessen considerably in a couple hours.More important than the scent, though, is how well it guards against sweatiness and odor.  In this regard, since it says it offers 48 hour protection, I used it just like I did my clinical strength deodorant.  I put it on at night after a shower, and didn't reapply until the next night.  I did this for several days.  It does seem okay at protecting against sweat and odor, but not as good as my clinical strength deodorant.  I pretty much expected that since it is not a clinical strength product.  That being said, it's decent for what it is, and I can't really complain about it.So, this seems like a decent enough deodorant, but not a replacement for anyone on clinical strength.  If you need some average deodorant and like the idea of a berry scent, I'd give this a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FCDCQ0DEIXU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7PCHIK#wasThisHelpful","R3FCDCQ0DEIXU4","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to have an older Sandisk USB drive (it was a Cruzer Glide) in the same size capacity (128 GB) but it was an older model that didn't have USB 3.0 compatibility.  I used it to back up my personal files (which were about 88 GB at the time) and it literally took about 4 hours!  I eventually upgraded to a Corsair USB 3.0 Voyager flash drive that was much better, and only took about 1 hour and 45 minutes to back up that data.  This was all using USB 2.0 slots since my computer doesn't have any 3.0 slots, but more on that later...After my experience with the older Sandisk, I wasn't expecting much from the 'SanDisk 128GB Extreme Pro USB 3.0 Flash Drive.'  I figured I'd give it a fair chance anyway, though, by conducting a vaguely scientific timed test.  My personal files have changed a bit here and there over time, but they still have about 88 GB's worth of data.  Oh, and in case you're wondering what the files consist of, it's a fairly even mix of music, videos, text files, and pictures - pretty much the average sort of things that most computer users would have.  I decided to borrow another computer that has 3.0 ports to test this on so I could test both types of ports.  The files copied onto the drive in 16 minutes using a 3.0 port, and about 1 hour using a 2.0 port on the same computer.  That's pretty impressive!  On my own computer using old 2.0 slots, it took about 65 minutes to copy those files.  Still better than the Corsair!Well, now that we've established that this thing is really fast (which is honestly the most important feature) let's talk about some other things...  That software that came on it (the SecureAccess thing) allows you to password protect your files.  It only works on Windows and Mac, though, and my main computer is running Linux, so it's not of much use to me.  Besides, it's not really the sort of thing I need or find important, so I just deleted it off of there.Now, for those that find physical features important, let's discuss those.  The body of the flash drive is aluminum (all brushed texture and nice) with a strip of black plastic down the middle, and a loop for sticking a lanyard on there.  I guess I'd say it was an attractive-looking flash drive (although that sort of thing doesn't really matter much to me since I view this as more of a practical item).  Oh, and it does have a slide-out design if you prefer that over flash drives that use caps.  Size-wise, it measures about 3.875"" long by 0.875"" wide by about 1/2"" thick.  It's not particularly huge or particularly small.  Do keep the measurements in mind, though, if you have some really crowded USB slots you need to use it with.Lastly, let's talk price.  This is indeed an item you're going to have to spend some money on (it was about 150 dollars as of the time of this review).

"I use a lot of sheet protectors, specifically for recipes in a kitchen cookbook.  The sheet protectors allow me to keep the printed recipes relatively protected from spills and splatters so that I can have a conveniently organized recipe book without having to constantly replace papers.  I always need a few more sheet protectors, though, as my recipe collection expands, plus over time some sheet protectors get so grimy (despite wiping) as to need replacement.  That's where this product comes in!These claim to be “heavy weight” and as far as I can tell after comparing them to my standard weight protectors, they are a bit thicker.  I'm not sure, however, that they are so much heavier as to justify their increased price from the standard ones (they are, however, competitive with other brands for their weight as far as I can tell).  Either way, they are decent page protectors, and work well.  I was even able to fit five pages in one comfortably (not sure why you'd want to, though).  Size-wise, they are the same size dimensions as every page protector I've ever bought before, so nothing new there.  The holes for the binder are made of a slightly heavier plastic than the main body, which can help prevent tearing, so that is much appreciated.Well, there's not much more to say.  These are decent page protectors if you really want heavy weight ones, but I'm not sure they are so much more protective than standard weight as to justify their cost.  They perform well though, so I can't really complain!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3JYUBRW4QEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00015YRCG#wasThisHelpful","R3U3JYUBRW4QEN","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use sticky notes constantly to remind myself of important to-do lists, and as such, have tried out quite a few different brands over the years.  I find myself returning to good old Post-it brand over and over again, though, since this seems to be the one brand that keeps a good, consistent quality.  These particular Post-it notes are no exception.After extensive testing, I can say I'm quite satisfied with these sticky notes.  The sticky notes are not too sticky (to where they damage wood veneer surfaces – yes I had that happen before with some Avery Brand sticky notes) and not so weak as to constantly come unstuck (once again, a problem with some Avery brand sticky notes).  Once I had stuck one to a surface, they stayed put very nicely, and didn't even lose their stickiness when removed and reapplied in a different location.  Neither did they curl up at the edges nor come loose over time.So, in conclusion, I am pleased.  There's not much else you could ask for from a sticky note, and it always sucks when you buy a whole pack only to realize that the sticky notes are terrible and you're stuck with them (pun totally intended), so I'm going to stick to Post-It brand from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VTFP3YDGH9R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2UDAHC#wasThisHelpful","R3VTFP3YDGH9R1","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have fairly regular allergies – pollen in the spring and summer, and also allergies to dust and mold (which often seems to hit in the winter).  So, I take a Zyrtec pill every day to take care of it, and it's reasonably (although imperfectly) controlled.  I'm fine most days and don't have massive sneezing and a runny nose most of the time, but I usually still have stuffed up sinuses.  Anyway, I decided to try out the Mucinex pills to see if they would help me any better than the Zyrtec does.Well, I've went ahead and tried all five pills, and honestly, I can't say it helps any better than the Zyrtec.  I'm not particularly impressed.  It didn't seem to stop the occasional runny nose I had (which was about the same as the Zyrtec's performance).  It seems it's about the same, performance-wise, but I seem to have had an extra side effect of nosebleeds.  I got two nosebleeds one two different days while taking these, and I very rarely get nosebleeds.  While I can't prove it was caused by the Mucinex, I can't help but correlate the two.I realize that everyone's system is different, and you might have better luck with these pills.  The only way to know is to try them yourself.  As for me, I'm thinking I'll just stick to my Zyrtec from now on – there's really no incentive for me to switch over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14STS3NDQVE91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLXKXFC#wasThisHelpful","R14STS3NDQVE91","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these to glue to the backs of cabochons and make my own earrings, as well as make earrings to sell.  I chose them specifically because the amazon title says they are made of surgical steel.  They are not, in fact.  I really should have looked closely at the photo, because it says right on it that it's made of brass (plated with silver).  Thankfully, I'm not allergic to metals, but I can't use these to make and sell earrings since I try to have my items as hypoallergenic as possible.  Of course, the packaging doesn't lie, so it's not really this product's fault that the amazon title is wrong (at the time of this writing, amazon may fix it in the future).Aside from the material, what is quality like?  Well, it's not too bad.  Most of the posts are fine and not bent or anything (I did have a couple that broke, though - the posts justs fell right off the pad!).  The earring nuts that come with them are fine enough, but they suffer from the issue of being a bit too loose.  Not ludicrously so (they do stay on reasonably well), but they are a bit looser than I'd prefer.Well, other than finding out they weren't surgical steel, I'd say these posts are alright.  Just be aware of what they are made of if you have metal allergies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZ0HKQ70T8Y8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052YVBDY#wasThisHelpful","R2LZ0HKQ70T8Y8","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, and for anyone who's trying to do the same thing, you should be aware that the version of the Mythbuster's Shark Week Special on here is an edited version that 's only half as long as the normal one.  YES, it's only half the episode!  Imagine my shock to find out that half the special was missing!I've since done a bit more research and discovered that you can get the proper full episode on the ""Shark Week: Great Bites Collection"".  Aside from that, even if you're not specifically a Mythbusters fan and just want to watch shark-related shows, you'd get a better value for your money choosing some other Shark Week collection, such as the ""20th Anniversary Collection"" which has many more episodes on it than this.

"I already own several fake gauge earrings because I've really fallen in love with the look of them!  To round out my collection, I was interested in getting some that were made of tamarind wood.  That's when I discovered these.What I really love about these is how elegant they look.  Many other tamarind wood earrings that I've looked at in the past had a sort of ""beach-goer/Bohemian"" look to them, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I just really love the versatility of these.  The swirly patterned golden shell part lends these earrings an elegance such that they wouldn't be out of place when worn on a special occasion, yet the tamarind wood keeps them feeling casual enough to wear out and about everyday as well.  Speaking of the tamarind wood, mine looks much prettier than the picture.  Mine actually has nice black striations in the wood grain, and is therefore quite lovely.  Of course, this is a natural product, which varies, so there's no telling what sort of wood pattern you'll get if you bought one.  Oh well.Now, onto some useful information!  My earring measured about 1.75""x1.75"", so keep that in mind if size is a consideration for you.  As for insertion, I found it pretty easy, but if you are new to fake gauges, you might need to practice a bit.  Just make sure you treat them gently so you don't bend the ear wire.  I find them to be very light weight when worn, and they hang very well (not crooked or awkward or anything).  I've pretty much come to expect this level of good quality from this seller, and I'm certainly not disappointed in these at all!So, overall I'm pleased with these.  If the idea of tamarind wood intrigues you, or you're just looking for some earrings that are unique without being too edgy, then give these a try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ENCVFLHCPW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYH1X58#wasThisHelpful","R34ENCVFLHCPW4","A1IQV6AI7L9NOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1IQV6AI7L9NOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was using another sleep mask for a few years that I liked, but I felt like it pinched my nostrils during the night - not painfully so, but it did seem to limit my air flow while breathing through my nose. One of the two head straps finally failed on it, so I decided to see what else was out there.I was a bit cautious about this one - seeing that it had a single head strap, which based on other products I'd tried, ended up hurting my ears. This one is well-designed and the head strap goes nicely on the back of the head at an angle that's natural and well-fitted.

"When I received my speaker set, I was a little skeptical. I’ve owned the original SHARKK boombox for some time now and love it, but I guess I didn’t really get how this system with two speakers would be better. In short, I was really wrong and love this thing!After having purchased a SHARKK boombox myself and getting a lot of great feedback on my review, SHARKK reached out and asked if I’d like to demo this new product. That’s not something I’ve done in the past but hey, why not, right? So they shipped me this product pair and I must admit that the new buddy system looks even nicer than the original – cleaner lines, better finishes, plus buttons that light up via a motion detector when you move your hand near the system. That’s a really nice (and helpful) touch!So the main question I had was, how does it sound? In word, awesome. I’ve always been impressed with the rich clarity of the original SHARKK boombox, so I found it hard to believe that this one would be any better than that. Well, it is. I don’t know how to describe it, but the audio from this thing is just crystal clear and so… defined. Not in a painful, tinny sort of way – but in a “hear everything beautifully” sort of way. The sound just isn’t muddy or riddled with overdrive or poor crossover. That’s a really good thing – so good, that it ended up replacing a desktop stereo system that I’ve used as studio monitors for years. Yes, really.Seriously, there’s just nothing else like this on the market that I’ve seen with two speakers (that can be used completely independently as separate, stereo speakers) that can be paired together with true, left+right stereo sound. As a test, I set these little puppies on my existing home theater Paradigm speakers in my living room, then started playing music through them – cranking up the volume. I did the ol’ wife test and called my wife into the room and asked her where the sound was coming from. To her utter amazement (and mine, to be honest) a monsoon of crystal clear, thunderous sound was coming from the buddy system speakers – not the Paradigm system. Can this get as loud as my home sound system? No, it can’t – but it was waaaay louder than I would want it to be, if I wasn’t testing it. Does the bass compare to my Paradigm speakers? Yes and no. On the normal, soundtrack type stuff, yes – it sounds very similar. For home theater stuff with explosions and really ultra-low bass, no it can’t match it. But really people, this thing is about 1/8th the size of my home stereo speakers. It’s ridiculous that it’s even worth discussing in the same paragraph.Feel free to ask any questions – I’ll try to answer them. This thing is just ridiculous; awesome when using the speakers separately, and then just insane when used as a pair with incredible stereo channel-separation. After several months of usage and testing, I still love this thing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3729I3EZDMBJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUAIYRC#wasThisHelpful","R3729I3EZDMBJW","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this mouse (not a free sample) about 2 months ago as I was looking for a device to help with the joint and wrist pain I was experiencing in my work day. I work in IT management and as such, I use a mouse all day, every day – often for 12-16 hours a day, depending on how the day goes. Even as a 30 year old, by the middle of the day, even with my very expensive ergonomic mouse (Logitech Performance Mouse MX; love it for photo editing!), my wrist and knuckles would be on fire!So I bought this one on a whim to see if it would help my pain and hand cramps. Oh man! This thing has helped a ton! It does take a day or two to get used to it (you use your arm more and less of your wrist), but after about 6 hours of usage, I could already tell a huge difference in my hand/wrist.The build quality is great; the flat black finish does well at hiding finger prints while remaining easy to grip. I have larger (not huge) hands, and it fits me comfortably. I’ve never had any trouble with interference with other devices – even while having other USB wireless devices (Logitech) plugged in nearby on the same PC.This mouse isn’t the world’s most accurate mouse. It’s a fantastic general computing mouse, but if you do photo editing, video editing, or CAD drawings that require highly accurate mouse input, you might find this mouse to be lacking the accuracy you need. For those of you who don’t do those tasks, you do not have anything to worry about – this mouse is as accurate as any off-the-shelf mouse out there. For those with specialized roles though that typically purchase high-end, high-accuracy mice, this doesn’t possess that level of accuracy. For me though, I use this for my day-in, day-out work. If I need to photo edit for long periods (more than just 4-5 photos), I switch back to my Logitech Performance MX mouse for that. I hope this review was helpful.

"First, this smells amazing. It's a great, masculine blend of cedar and citrus that's fresh, but not heavy or musky. It's great for the office - or for whatever. I really do love the scent.As other reviewers have stated though, the smell wears off very quickly and even with 4 sprays (quite a lot, if you ask me), it isn't noticeable after a two-three hours. I don't want to overwhelm anyone with a scent, but if you can't smell it at all, that's underwhelming at best - if not completely pointless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATN7CZSBMV4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002XQ1TCM#wasThisHelpful","R2ATN7CZSBMV4C","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can I say? It works great and allowed me to keep my old panel, but still upgrade the electrical. This is only docked one star because one of the 2-pole breakers on the circuit breaker wouldn't reset when it first arrived, so I ended up doing some resistance testing and found that one side wasn't reset properly. Once I knew that, I then I worked it back and forth pretty hard to finally get it to grip the breaker and trip the one side that wasn't resetting.

"UPDATE OCTOBER 15TH, 2014:Jaime from Photive contacted me a few days ago to follow up on my poor experience with the bluetooth performance of the Soundscape 8 (see my original review below). He was very friendly and helpful and after asking some questions about the original device, he thought it sounded like mine might have been defective. Having no other unit to compare it to, I agreed to see if the replacement worked any better than the first one I'd received.I received the replacement device and instantly noticed better performance from the bluetooth - no more choppy sound or interference with other devices. The overall range of the bluetooth was better as well - very consistent in the 15-25ft range while indoors, which is good. This device does get a tad bit louder than the SHARKK I mentioned below - and the sound is a bit wider in its projection in the room. I can still hear a noticeable hiss (sounds like white noise) from the device speakers though while audio tracks are played more quietly, or when the softer part of a song is playing. I've tried turning my phone volume up and the speaker volume down, and vice-versa... and lots of other variations in between. Still same hiss. I don't know that it's a deal breaker, but it is noticeable while playing at mid- to low-volume, or during lower-volume tracks.I've given the device an extra star for a couple reason: One, because Photive was incredibly supportive and helpful. Really people, they have ridiculously good support. Second, because the bluetooth functionality does work well on my new, non-defective device. Why not five stars? The hiss is still quite noticeable - notably louder than other similar devices, and two, the bluetooth tech is still older. For instance, I love being able to control the volume of the speaker from my phone - or skip tracks from the actual speaker. Because this uses older Bluetooth 2.0 technology, controlling the tracks (play/pause/rewind/fast-forward) isn't possible from the speaker from what I understand. Likewise, I have to control the volume on the speaker and the phone - instead of being able to turn my phone/speaker up simultaneously. Both of these problems are isolated to the bluetooth technology; the hiss all but disappears when using an AUX cable. I look forward to seeing a new version with updated bluetooth in the future - Photive makes killer devices and I love the Photive Cyren!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased this one alongside the SHARKK Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox NFC 10 Watt Speaker to ""duke it out."" In short, the SHARKK won the battle: The Photive is louder, but I think that was a mistake on Photive's part - the sound becomes quite distorted and choppy at full blast. Additionally, the SOUNDSCAPE 8 had a very noticeable amount of hiss when playing music over Bluetooth - far more than any speaker I've ever used. That hiss essentially disappeared on an audio cable, but via Bluetooth, it's very noticeable.That, coupled with the fact that it kept causing Bluetooth interference with my wife's phone and that it used old, slow Bluetooth 2.0 made this one a loser in my book. I should also add that the Bluetooth 2.0 struggled with my higher bitrate sound files - making the audio bitrate fall off and sounding a bit ""crunchy"" when listening via Bluetooth. So to me, my thought was why would you buy a larger, less portable speaker with poor Bluetooth performance for the same price as the SHARKK? Apart from those glitches though, the specs are fairly similar.I not sure why you'd put Bluetooth 2.0 (old technology) into a brand-new device design. Sadly, this device could have been amazing - I wanted to love it - but it fell short due to distortion and did a face-plant when it comes to bluetooth performance and sound quality. There's a lot to love here, but the few glitches made it a no-go for me.I compared this device against many other Bluetooth speakers.

"First, I am not a paid or ""free sample"" reviewer for SHARKK; I bought this speaker dock all by-my-big-boy with my own money. Impressive, I know.So now for the review portion. I should start by stating that I am an audiophile... on a budget. I love accuracy. I love two-channel stereo. Yes, you heard me - I'm a purist and would rather have two quality speakers than 5, 6, or 7 speakers attempting to throw as much sound around the room as possible. I love big, warm, crisp sound. I want bass (*ahem*... that's ""bass"" not ""base,"" by the way), but I don't want as much thump as possible just to have it - I want the bass to match the original audio, not to over-amplify it. If the recording thumps, so should the speakers. I want tight mid-tones - not the muddy, mushy stuff. I want crisp, clear highs, not the tinny pinch of some speakers. By my definition, the best speakers are the ones that can match the original audio without losing or distorting content.Next, I should state that this speaker sound great - but it won't beat out something two or three times its size, at least in most categories (it actually did in many of my tests, but more on that later). This won't rival your home theater sound system (or if it does, you need to upgrade). These statements all should be common knowledge, but judging by the reviews I read on this product and other portable speakers, it would seem that I am sadly mistaken.OK, now with the preliminary disclosures out of the way, let's begin...BUILD QUALITY:In a word: Excellent. Pick anything up off the shelf at Best Buy or anywhere, and I think you'll find that this is right up there in the top category. The metal is clean, nicely executed and classy. The plastics on the top and bottom are very sturdy and firm (why can't more American car interiors use plastic of this quality?). The buttons have great feedback and a nice tactile feel. Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about the build quality, it's just that good. I should also add that SHARKK added high quality rubber ""feet"" on the bottom of this speaker to keep it from sliding and vibrating around - they work very well and are better quality than most I've seen.SIZE/WEIGHT:The unit does have a bit of weight to it. No, I wouldn't call it heavy by any stretch, but it screams quality when you pick it up. I think the large battery, large speaker drivers and partially metal construction contribute to the weight - all of which I am thankful for and appreciate. As for the size, I consider this thing about perfect - no, it's not pocket-able (maybe in cargo pants?), but you can easily grip it in one hand. I have a phone that's pocket-able and it has a speaker built in. I don't need another one of those. So to me, the whole pocket-able market is a moot point. Portable yes, pocket-able, no.BATTERY LIFE:In short, really good. I charged it when I bought it and have been using it off and on for the last week and haven't charged it again yet. Granted, I usually turned it off when I wasn't using it, but that's awesome just the same. I feel comfortable saying that the 10 hour, 2500 mAh polymer Li-ion battery life advertised is 100% accurate, if not a bit modest.SOUND QUALITY:Here comes the meat and potatoes. Like I said before, I'm a bit of an audio nut, so when I buy speakers or headphones, I always use a frequency generator app on my phone to put it through its paces to see if it responds as well as advertised. Granted, this isn't the most scientific method because it still depends on the ability of my ears to hear it, but it's a whole lot more precise than someone saying ""I listened to some music and this sounds really good!""The speaker has two, 5w 50mm speaker drivers - plus a passive ""bass radiator"" in the back. For the size of this device, that's awesome. Let me tell you, this thing gets loud. Uncomfortably loud. It won't replace a tornado siren on your block, but you could definitely hear it anywhere in an average home. For instance, I usually listen at 25% or 50% volume in our great room (shared space of kitchen, family room, dining room) and it fills the space with sound that is either light and ambient (25%) or clear but not obnoxious (50%). So in other words, at half-power, this is filling a space of about 800 sq. feet with clear sound. Saying a speaker is ""loud"" doesn't really mean much though; lots of people can sing loudly, but that doesn't mean I want to listen to them, so let's talk about sound quality.I used my frequency generator app and turned my phone up to full volume. I then started at 1Hz and gradually walked my way up until the speaker (also at full volume) began producing sound. At 18Hz, I could easily hear a very low rumble  - which by the way, is excellent. Granted, you'd have to be listening at full volume to produce this, but that's amazing for something this small. At 30Hz, the rumble was quite loud. By the time I reached 40Hz, the thing was really cranking. So in other words, for the size, this does actually produce a fair bit of passive bass. Will it ""lay down bass?"" Well, no. Something that fits in your hand isn't likely to shake the windows. Can you hear it though? Yes. Again, I think SHARKK's 60Hz information might even be a bit conservative - a fact I commend them for - but I can say this thing definitely has more warm ""thump"" than I would have ever expected from something of it's size.As for mids, I have nothing unusual to report. It passed with flying colors. The highs also passed with flying colors. I can only hear up to 17.5KHz (which is pretty good) - and that's faint - so I heard it all the way up to that point. As for 18KHz, sure... it probably reaches it. Good luck finding a set of ears that can hear that high though, apart from your cat or dog.Next, I cranked a classic rock song through it. It has a fair bit of bass, rich mids and an awesome high guitar part. This speaker killed it (in a good way). I was actually laughing out loud listening to it - in disbelief that this much quality sound was coming from something the size of a Chipotle burrito, sans guacamole. I called my wife out to the garage where I was testing and had her listen as well. She too was in disbelief. Granted, my wife is no audio nut, but the size-to-sound ratio is still remarkable.BLUETOOTH (AND NFC) PERFORMANCE:Again, excellent. I can listen to music streaming from within the advertised 30ft mark without a problem. I actually had it streaming at more like 40ft - with several walls in between. I wouldn't want to promise that, but it worked for me nonetheless. Bluetooth performance wains a bit outdoors, but that's common as there's often no walls to bounce or reflect the signal off of, it still worked well for me though. The speaker is very responsive (no lag) between commands issued from the speaker (e.g. - skip track) or commands issued from the phone. Additionally, the audio quality remained quite high. Of course you'll always get the best audio quality from a wired connection, but I found that while listening to music in the room, I couldn't tell a difference in quality. I could hear a very faint hiss when using Bluetooth if I held the speaker to my ear... but really though, that's what headphones are for, and I strongly discourage holding speakers to your ears. You look dumb, and you'll go deaf; bad combo.Next, NFC. Sorry iPhone/Apple folks, you can skip over this one because Apple doesn't think NFC is a cool technology. Others, stay tuned if your device has NFC. OK... so wow. I'm nerdy and can quickly pair with various Bluetooth devices, but I can't tell you how slick it is to walk up, touch my phone to the speaker, and have it immediately pair or disconnect (if already connected). I didn't think I'd use this feature, but I actually use it all the time. My wife also loves it - a person who is admittedly non-nerdy. I think she'd never use this thing if it required her to pair with it each time, or select it from a list in her Bluetooth menu. As it stands though, she can easily walk up and hold her phone on it and it pairs or disconnects. With the new (quieter) voice prompts, it's also incredibly intuitive at explaining the process without being annoying; you know when your device is connected or disconnected. Absolutely brilliant, SHARKK.CONCLUSION:I really like this speaker; I have a hard time believing that it was only $65 when I compare it with the items from Best Buy, and I have a hard time believing the sound coming out of it when I crank it up. It's no replacement for a home theater system, but it certainly has its place in the arsenal of portable listening. If you're considering any other speaker, give this one a try first.COMPARISONS:NOTE: Please don't take my prices as 100% certain; Prices change regularly and may have changed since this was originally written.I'll try to keep each review brief, but I wanted to offer a comparative review of the SHARKK speaker against many of the market options - both the Amazon devices and the more industry leader ones you'd find at Best Buy. Most of these devices I've just tested in store multiple times on multiple occasions, but a few I've owned personally.JBL Flip: Meh. Overpriced, about the same size as the SHARKK and much more tinny-sound. The volume level is nearly the same (SHARKK wins), but audio quality and price give SHARKK the clear win.JBL Charge: This one narrows the gap a bit, but I still think the win goes to SHARKK. The sound is still a bit richer with the SHARKK and the price $150 price tag just makes it a no-brainer.Sony SRSBTX300: In sound quality, the Sony probably wins. Granted, I find the sound a bit muddy and soft on the Sony, but it's hard not to like it's rich sound... if you want something that's the size of a shoe box and cost $100. Great speaker, but not what I was after personally.Sony SRSX5: This is my personal favorite; it's the upgrade of the device above but the audio quality is vastly improved. Granted, it is $200 and way outside my price range - and a bit big for my portable needs, but this thing really does sound awesome. If you have $200+ to spend, this is the device I'd recommend - or it's big brother, the SRSX7 ($300).HMDX Audio HX-P230 JAM: OK, seriously people. I shouldn't even have to say it, but I will. There's no comparison. The JAM may be small and funky, but it pales in every way compared to the SHARKK. Very portable, but poor audio quality.Ultimate Ears - BOOM: The only thing that goes ""boom"" about this speaker is the damage to your wallet; muddy sound, weird 360 degree sound projection (soft sound in all directions), over priced ($175 ish) and very little ""umph"" to carry your audio around the room.Jawbone - MINI JAMBOX: Personally, I think this device is a joke. It's quiet, way over priced, and hard to justify from any perspective. So from a price, audio quality and general functionality standpoint, the SHARKK kicks this thing's butt. If small size is on your high-priority list, get the Photive CYREN instead (see review below) and save yourself $110.Beats by Dr. Dre - Pill 2.0: This is louder than the MINI JAMBOX, but all the other notes apply here as well.Photive SOUNDSCAPE 8: I purchased this one alongside the SHARKK to ""duke it out."" In short, the SHARKK won the battle: The Photive is louder, but I think that was a mistake on Photive's part - the sound becomes quite distorted and choppy at full blast. Additionally, the Photive had a very noticeable amount of hiss when playing music over Bluetooth - far more than any speaker I've ever used. That, coupled with the fact that it kept causing Bluetooth interference with my wife's found and that it used old, slow Bluetooth 2.0 made this one a loser in my book. I should also add that the Bluetooth 2.0 struggled with my higher bitrate sound files - making the audio bitrate fall off and sounding a bit ""crunchy"" when listening via Bluetooth. So to me, my thought was why would you buy a larger, less portable speaker with poor Bluetooth performance for the same price as the SHARKK? Apart from those glitches though, the specs are fairly similar.Bose® - SoundLink® Mini: This thing sounds pretty good. I love to hate Bose, but I have to admit that they did a good job on this device. I think the SHARKK gets a bit louder though, and it's hard to deny that saving about $150 by purchasing the SHARKK is a winning choice.Beats By Dr. Dre - Beatbox: OK, this thing is $400. Of course it has bigger sound than the SHARKK. It's also the size of a beach ball and is about as obnoxious as a foot rash at a dance party. If you have $400, there are better options.Ultimate Ears - MINI BOOM: See notes for the ""BOOM."" This is just the rehash of the BOOM, but with slightly less BOOM on the wallet and even less BOOM in the room. SHARKK easily wins.Bose - SoundDock® Series III: This is $250 and barely portable. It does sound good, but I bet 5 SHARKK speakers would sound good too (how many you could purchase for $250, in case you missed the parallel).Beats by Dr. Dre - Pill XL: $300 for this? It sounds OK, not great, but OK. I really don't understand this item or the people who buy them; you could do so much better. For $300, you'd expect it to sound $250 better than the SHARKK, and it simply doesn't.Photive CYREN: I purchased this device to test out alongside the SHARKK. I will say that it is surprisingly small. At $40 though, the SHARKK absolutely kills the CYREN in terms of loudness, bass and flexibility. The CYREN is a fun device and would work well on an office desk, for instance, but not nearly the performance of the SHARKK. To be honest, this device sounded a lot like the JAMBOX to me - not very loud, decent sound, but not horrible either... it's just that the CYREN is about $110 cheaper.JBL Pulse: If owning a speaker that looks like a strobing lava lamp is your thing, then this is the device for you... at a $175 price tag. From what I could tell in my audio tests, this is a JBL Flip with strobe lights. Yippee.Jawbone - BIG JAMBOX: This does have richer sound than the SHARKK, but it's also $269, on sale. I will say that it's also bigger and the audio can be a bit over processed at times. Not bad though, just a bit pricey and big.Jawbone JAMBOX: The JAMBOX isn't a bad device, but I still think the audio is a bit muddy and sloppy for the sake of over-amplifying the bass... Which, oddly enough, isn't really that punchy even still. Note that the JAMBOX is nearly identical to the Photive CYREN ($40) in size and performance, but $110 more. The SHARKK is slightly larger than the JAMBOX, sounds far better and costs far less.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ADVDAX2966ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES2BQ7M#wasThisHelpful","R1ADVDAX2966ND","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I should say that I'm a bit of an audiophile. Like, really. I have some great headphones and I have some not so great headphones. I have a pair for mowing the grass and a pair for running. I have a pair I use at work and a pair I use at home. For me, the thing that is most important is sound accuracy: How closely does the sound coming from the headphones mirror the sound coming from an excellent set of studio speakers. Or to say it another way, how closely do the headphones mirror what the microphone originally recorded in studio.Second, I should say that these headphones are currently $6 with free shipping using Amazon Prime. $6 dollars, people. 6. Count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So yeah, if we really want to compare them, go look at the Wal-Mart.com $6 and less headphone rack. Depressed yet? Yeah, pretty sad.So when these arrived, I honestly expected to hate them. But get this, I don't. First, the tangle free cord works great. The build quality is actually really good. The fit works well - the ear clips keep them on my head if I'm running or working, but I found they stayed put during normal activity without the ear loops. They include three sets (small, medium, large) of rubber ear fittings and a little carrying bag.What about audio, you ask? In short, it's decent. Award winning? No, but it won't make your ears cry either. I will say that the call quality through the in-line microphone was excellent. I made a few calls and waited for people to say ""huh"" or ""what"" a few times and never got that, so after a while of talking, I asked my wife if she could hear me OK. She said I was almost too loud - in a good way. I was speaking naturally and she said I was coming in loud and clear and she actually turned down her phone volume a bit. If you've had any in-line headsets before, you know that's a rarity - most are quiet and unpredictable, but the SHARKK did quite well.I did some frequency tests on the headphones to see what they're actually producing. Granted, this is based on my ears - so it's not flawless, but a good frame of reference. The box states that the response range is 20Hz-20KHz. I was able to hear them at about 32Hz all the way up to about 16KHz. Not bad for (my less than perfect ears and) a 6$ pair of headphones with a tangle-free cord and a mic!Comparatively, I took my Sony MDREX10LP headphones ($9; Prime - no mic) and ran the same test. I could hear them at about 29Hz and all the way up to about 17KHz. That's a little better than the SHARKK headset, but not a huge difference.So that's the technical. Let me talk figuratively now. To me, the SHARKK headset has a nice, wide soundstage - meaning it gives a sense of depth and presence to the music that isn't often found in a headset of this price range... or much greater price ranges for that matter. The Sony's weren't able to provide this same ""virtual depth"" to the music; they sound like they're pumping music into your head instead of creating a theater sound system around you.The Sony headset sounds a bit fuller and definitely punchier on the bass end of the spectrum. The SHARKK headset is a bit more mellow, but still very enjoyable to listen to - vocals and guitars really shine on the SHARKK headset. Honestly, I felt like the Sony's force the low-end punch a bit and the SHARKK's probably could have forced it a bit more. Both headsets offer a nice listening experience, both are budget finds.So which is better? Personally, as an all-around headset, I think the SHARKK is better. With the ear loops, different ear fittings, tangle free cord, and the microphone... man, what can't this headset do? It could easily be your jogging, phone-talking, beat-listening, all-day-wearing, productivity accomplice. The Sony headset just can't do that. The Sony's sound good, maybe a bit forced, but they're simply not as versatile... and let's face it, if you're searching in the sub-$10 price range, you're looking for the best ""all-arounder,"" not the best in class. Why? Because the best in class cost $278 more.... Ok, I just made that number up, but you get the point.As a technology reviewer, I requested a pair of these headphones directly from SHARKK. SHARKK provided these headphones as a free sample in exchange for my honest review... and there you have it folks. That's all I know. Are they ""the best studio monitor headphones every created?"" No. Don't be dumb, but they're pretty dog-gone good for six dollars. I'm still a bit baffled that headphones this well-made are selling for $6!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R9T053BMW594/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRBZZJK#wasThisHelpful","R2R9T053BMW594","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won't take you on the incredibly lengthy journey I went on by searching for a ""photo editor's monitor"" at a budget price. My absolute max budget was $300, but I really wanted to be closer to $200 if I could do it. While I would love to own a 16 bit monitor, I was well aware that wasn't going to happen at the $2000+ price tag. At the same token though, I needed something that was color and print accurate so I could edit with confidence that my prints would look like what I was viewing on my screen.This monitor is fantastic - the contrast and viewing angles are great and the accuracy is really quite amazing at this price range. I recently edited about 50 photos for print from a recent shoot I did, picked up the prints and then compared them with the on-screen images. In sRGB mode, I felt like the colors were spot-on and the final prints mirrored what I saw on my screen. The screen is a bit too bright, compared to the prints - but not bad. In other words, the screen can give the illusion of a well-exposed image (because it's too bright) when in fact, I need to bump the exposure on the photo another 1/3 to 1/2 stop. So for future edits, I know that what looks pretty bright on screen is actually a bit dim in print - and I need to increase the exposure a bit more. That's an easy fix - either through calibration or through manually adjusting the photos.I should also note that I'm 6'5"" and finding a monitor that adjusts well to my poster is hard - I often set books or get stands to elevate the monitor a bit. Not with this one! It has an incredible range of adjustments to practically an position you could want. All in all, I feel like this monitor was an absolute steal at this price! I can edit in confidence, knowing that the colors and contrast I see on screen mirror the printer's output... and for $200, that's not too shabby at all.If you're thinking about buying a monitor and want to keep it in the $200 range, stop thinking. Buy this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO8WTRN4SGXA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00906GBBC#wasThisHelpful","RO8WTRN4SGXA9","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should begin by saying that I have a high arch and narrow feet. In athletic shoes, I almost always wear a size 12 and ASICS tend to fit me best (typically high arch and run narrow). I bought the 11.5 and those were huge on me. I then got the 11's and those are still slightly too big in length. If I went for a 10.5 though, I think they'd be too small so I stuck with the 11.I found the insoles to be very uncomfortable. There's a heel gel square inserted into it, but I actually found this section to be bruising my heel over the course of the day. Additionally, the sides rubbed the under-side of my ankle bone. Couple those gripes with a lack of arch support and I wasn't too impressed... but I still liked the style, color and construction.I ended up removing the provided insole (pops right out, thankfully) and putting in the size 13 orthotic insert and it fit perfectly. Now they're pretty comfortable - but still a bit big. After a few days of break in and with the new insoles, they don't rub my ankles any more either. I may go back to Wal-Mart and get a flat foam insert to stick under the new insoles just to make them a bit more snug, but they're pretty comfortable now as is.Like I mentioned above, the styling really is great. Dressy enough to wear with a suit or dress slacks, but also non-showy enough to wear with some chinos or dressy jeans. That's what I was after appearance wise, so I'd say I nailed that objective. And thankfully, after some after market insoles, they're pretty comfortable now too. The construction seems to be good, although I've only had them a month, so I can't say for sure. Only time will tell.So in summary, it's a decent shoe. Can you do better? Maybe... probably. With Amazon's free returns (Prime), it's worth giving it a go though. Maybe you'll have better luck - it's pretty hard to find a shoe this well made and looks this good for this price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KT72Z7WZBXR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AUP6LC#wasThisHelpful","R2KT72Z7WZBXR3","A1MBGLP2CH1BND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MBGLP2CH1BND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this case for my wife who, due to children and all that entails, is pretty hard on her phones. The case is a bit bulky, but with larger pockets, or wearing the belt clip, or (as my wife does) carrying it in a purse, it's not a problem at all. The kickstand works great and the built-in, reenforced screen protector is also a real plus.I certainly don't recommend abusing your devices or cases, but this one has been through a lot already; dropped, kicked, slobbered on, thrown, bounced and spilled upon - primarily by some toddlers who happen to live in my home - and it's handled it all without any signs of exterior damage to the case and certainly no damage to the phone itself.Seriously people, for this price... and really, regardless of the price, this case rocks. I can't think of a better option for people who need total protection. To quote my wife, ""This case is a TANK! It can handle anything, and I love it that I can hand the phone to my toddler to play learning games on it and not worry if they're scratching the screen or going to drop it on the floor.

"Great umbrella - the materials are great, manufacturing seems to be sturdy and well-put together and the lighting effect it creates is predictable and lovely.Finding a decent umbrella with a removable cover at this price is difficult - especially with a the very desirable silver lining on the underside of the black liner. The light quality is great and the silver lining underneath the white does a great job of bouncing that last bit of light back out without making it harsh. In my mind, this is the perfect balance between the silver-lined umbrellas that can be a bit harsh in some circumstances and a non-lined umbrella that ends up absorbing some of your light.In short, it works great and seems to be built well.

"Small relief, big (stinky) smell.It smells (strongly) of tar, mixed with something else.  Very unpleasant, strong smell.  Which, might be worth it, if this were the miracle cure.  But, it's not.It does provide some healing and relief, but did not heal sores after a full thirty days of use.  (I will note that the packaging recommends a full 90 days to see results.  I am reviewing after 30 days, due to Amazon's vine time allotment.)  I tested this out on my mom, who has long term recurrent psoriasus abd eczema.  The smell nearly gave me an asthma attack, but it did provide some relief for her.

"First, it Is a strictly Cool Mist humidifier.I chose it because it looked nicer and more contemporary that my older one.  It also looked smaller.  It looks something like ""Jeanie's bottle"" which is cute.  In person, I discovered that, while it is a bit of a smaller footprint than my old one, it really is larger than I anticipated.In function, it works well.  The mist is fine.  It doesn't go up to a heavy mist (and there's no reason I want it to) but it needs to be turned past the minimum to mist noticably.  In states it will run for 6 hours, but I found that, in practice, (and with the lower settings I prefer) it will run longer.It assembles quickly and intuitively.My favorite feature is that the it the light will change color and it will turn itself off when it empties.  I feel much better sleeping with this on, because of that.  The light is, happily, not terribly bright.Why only four stars?  There is no way to fill this from the top.

"I'm giving this a four star rating, because it's a good (not amazing) mattress whose pros far outweigh it's cons.  I feel it's correctly priced and should compete well at its price-point.  And, if you are furnishing a guest room, and you don't mind seriously annoying packaging, I would recommend you order it.  However, if you are looking for you OWN mattress that you are going to sleep on for the next 7-10 years, go to a local showroom, lay on a bunch of them, and pick the one you really, truly like and have them deliver it, set it up, and haul away the old one.Mattress preference is a very personal thing.  It's like the way you take your coffee (1 sugar, two creams) or the way you take your eggs (only in French Toast); you like it the way you like it.  Someone else's opinion can only take you so far.  (Fortunately here, I will interject that Amazon does have an excellent return policy, however returning something of this size would be at best slightly annoying in any scenerio.)  This mattress is a pretty good middle ground of a lot of likes and dislikes (which, granted, you might consider an excellent compromise or the equivalent of lukewarm coffee), which I will discuss below.  I do think it's quality on middle-groundness makes it well suited for a guest room (for guests you like) and may even make it a good match for you (depending on your preferences).Some people like the dense hug-your-body-ness of the memory foam, that solid squish.  Some (like me) prefer the springiness of a spring mattress (and can start to feel a little too-trapped-to-move in a memory foam only mattress).  This is a hybrid between the two.  Even as a lover-of-springs, I found I liked it.  The memory foam ensures you don't feel any springs and softens the effects of movement, but the springs presence allows for a quicker bounce and (to me) a more pleasant support.This mattress is, for me, a little on the firm side.  When you sit on the edge, it feels like it's going to be much softer than it is when you lie down.  Some would disagree with me, because it's not a real exxxtra-firm mattress.  (Some might even say it's not firm enough.)  But, personally, I want to sleep on a big fluffy cloud of cuddliness.The pillow top.  (Or, why it lost a star.)  The pillow top is a little wimpy.  And while the actual mattress itself hopped-to and totally ragained shape instantly, the pillow top took forever to smooth out and even retained a couple wrinkles.  And, it could be thicker.  I, personally, kind of want to add another pillow top to it.  But, then, I'm a junkie for softness.  The thickness of the pillow top is probably fine for most people; however, the pillow top's response to this packing method may be an issue.You will need deep pocked sheets for this, so make sure to add those to your order.And, do not forget to note that this is a mattress only.  No frame/box-spring/platform.  So factor that into your price comparisons (especially since most stores, in my area at least, advertise prices for sets).Finally, THE ANNOYING PACKAGING (or, the other reason we lost a star).  I haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate the way this ships.  My box, as others have noted, was completely trashed and half-opened.  Fortunately, the mattress is heavily wrapped in plastic, so it was still protected. I would say this weighs close to 100 pounds (defintely way more than my Golden Retriever---and I can't lift my Golden Retriever).  There are no handles or hold holes on the box of any kind.  Just getting it into my house, over the threshold, was a pain.  Then, awkwardly manuevering it into the bedroom, positioning it onto the bed, also a pain.  Once you get the plastic partially cut, it pretty much forces itself off from that point, like butterfly getting itself from a caccoon.  Pretty amusing that it pops up like a cartoon life raft.  Not so amusing that, with the way it's rollled, it unrolls automatically upside down.  So, just when you think you're done moving the heavy beast, you get to flip it over (the mattress does have side handles, but they aren't so useful when you are 5 foot tall).  Meanwhile, you have to handle disposal of the old mattress on your own (see your local charities about needed donations, they make pick up, and some cities have curbside pick up for large items on scheduled days).  I broke two nails and needed ibuprofen.  But, I did do it myself.  Hurrah for me.And, one more thing, ABOUT THE SIZING.  I can't comment on the ones other people recieved (go through the reviews and read their experiences) which may or may not have been like the one I have.  But, I did notice a couple comments that seemed to find their mattress to be of an irregular size.  So, I want to inject this here.  The compression seems to seriously (though, temporarily) contort the size.  Upon unboxing, I was convinced that there was no way it would fit on the platform of the bed I was placing it on.  I thought perhaps they had sent a different size than I ordered.  It looked that strange.  Happily, ""upon inflation,"" I found that it was the correct size and it was perfectly regular, perfectly matching the platform size.  So, if you order this, and it looks oddly shaped when you try to roll it out, don't panic.  It re-inflates faster than an air mattress and gains it's real size as it does so.(PS: Instructions state that you should open box within 72 hours of reciept to gain full inflation, and that you should allow 24-72 hours to regain shape once open.  I opened the box instantly upon reciept and gave it 48 hours before testing out.)I love Amazon, I love online shopping.  Love it.  But there are some items that are more or less conducive to the online shopping experience.  And, I think personal mattress shopping is one of those things not well suited for online purchase.  It's a very personal choice and you should try it out and know how well it suits YOU.  The average person buys a mattress every 7-10 years, get one you really like.  However, as said in the beginning, I do completely recommend this for your guest room (assuming you weren't completely horrified by the packing and assembly).  It's completely more comfy than most guest beds or hotel beds I've been stuck in, and at a really fair price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q7XARFOQ86YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJ7CYLQ#wasThisHelpful","R3Q7XARFOQ86YO","A2CZ98V784SRJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CZ98V784SRJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is benefit to exploring that area of the war, which, in light of other far-more-extreme atrocities, becomes easy to ignore.  In spite of that, I could not help having a rather visceral reaction to aspects of the book.  Because it is the world-as-she-is-in-it, a world gone mad, the politicals powers of the day are referenced in very...regular ways.  Hitler, Rommel, the gestapo are all matter-of-fact background.

"The cover makes a pretty fantastic claim, ""A great new American epic...nothing less than Dostoyevskian.""  Dostoyevskian, now that's aiming high.  I don't know a single American writer that I would lump with the greats of Russian or French literature.  But that cover claim is asking me to judge this along highly brilliant literary works (and I'm all for comparing and reviewing a work within and against it's genre).  So, it looses a star because it can live up to that, but, really, what can?It's good, though, it's really good.  It's appocolyptical, messy, all-over-the-map in terms of locations and people groups and classes...and yet, really, real.

"This is an average to above average salycillic acid acne treatment.  It's a good product, but there's really nothing about it that truly distinguished it from other products.  In fact, I think I may slightly prefer Clearasil's rapid acting salycillic product.  Overal, it'sa good product, horribly packaged (more about that below).  With a name like Benzac, I was (happily) surprized to find this is not benzoyl peroxide based.  Salycillic acid is, based on both my knoowledge and experience, a slightly more gentle product, and it is well suited for those whose issues tend more toward black heads.  It's less likely than benzoyl peroxide to produce peeling, and I can happily report no peeling with its use (and my skin is rather prone to peel).  I also have rather sensitive skin and this was non-irritating.  Lots of things to like, and based on product alone, I would consider repurchasing.  However, since there are other similiar (and more readily available to me) products that I like at least as well, and I hate this packaging, it is unlikely that I will.As product performance is, overall, reasonable but not miraculous.The packaging is not reasonable.  It's annoying.  It desperately needs to be redesigned.  My first issue is more cosmetic, but is a function to a small degree.  The issue is a not-full tube.  The tube initialy feels half empty, which was odd.  However,  quickly noted that that was by design.  The tube is approximately the same size as a 1 oz tube of a competing product, but contains .5 oz.  So there's a perception of value that isn't there.  However, it also means that the product is packaged containing more air space, therefore more air, which, I suspect may affecs it's efficacy. It definately affects its use.  Which I will explain as I go onto the main issue. The opening to the tube is HUGE. Up to 3x larger than those of competing products.  No matter how careful I was, I was consistently squeezin out twice the product needed (this problem is compounded by the half empty tube, since you are squeezing product from the bottom).  It's a very liquid formula, so it needs a more petite opening.  It's designed for waste and mess.I did give the product the full four star rating of the formula, without deducting points for the packaging, however, do note that the package is one of the reason I don't expect to repurchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OCR01PHI8SC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON1VH22#wasThisHelpful","R3OCR01PHI8SC7","A2CZ98V784SRJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CZ98V784SRJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you like ""Amish fiction.""This is the sort of book I keep on my shelf t ensure my mother is entertained.  Personally, I wouldn't have picked it up for just myself, but that's because I don't even faintly understand the appeal the recurrent Amish background in fiction. However, presumably, if you are picking this up you LIKE that, and I am trying to judge it against its genre, hence the four stars.  My mother would give it five, I would give it three stars, hence, my total of 4.  I do think it distinguishe itself somewhat amoung the (too many) Amish fiction books out there.

The Natural Balance brand tends to have a bit less protein than the Blue Wilderness, which is a plus for their kidneys (there is is still a really great amount of protein in this brand).I started feeding a limited ingredient diet several years ago.  I own a Golden, an AMAZING breed, which is also, sadly, prone to lots of health issues, including skin and ear infections.  We were experiencing multiple ear infections a year, and I was advised to adjust her diet.  Which has been amazing.  Her coat is also shinier, but most importantly, we have avoided so many vet visits.  Her ears are simply healthier.  She is also far less itchy.Huge fan.

"If you’re a preacher, you’ve probably got a short list of individuals and authors you look to for encouragement and advice. For me, these includes a few personal friends and mentors, as well as a number of well-known individuals. There’s a great deal I’ve learned about preaching from the works of Charles Spurgeon and Martyn Lloyd-Jones, from listening to men like Daniel Akin and Matt Chandler.And then there’s Tim Keller. One of the things I appreciate about Keller is the fact that he holds his hearers’ attention without drawing too much attention to himself. He loves words and wordplay, but he’s not trying to entertain you (even though his humor is quite disarming)—he wants you to understand the Bible on its own terms, and to see Jesus in every jot and tittle. So when Keller set out to write a book on preaching itself, I was intrigued. Would he focus primarily on mechanics? Study habits? The C.S. Lewis saturation point in each sermon?In Preaching, Keller chooses to take a different approach than other authors writing on the subject by primarily looking at Word ministry philosophically, asking readers to consider how preaching serves the Word of God, reaches people, and is a demonstration of the Spirit and of power.The first section of the book addresses the best methods for preaching. Keller encourages making expository preaching your typical approach, as it best “expresses and unleashes our belief in the whole Bible as God’s authoritative, living, and active Word” (35).Topical preaching, on the other hand, can be helpful at times, and even necessary, but a steady diet of it doesn’t leave people appreciating the scope of God’s Word, nor grasping the Spirit’s power. Most importantly, it fails to show hearers how all of Scripture is about Jesus. He writes:""Try reading only one chapter out of a Charles Dickens or Victor Hugo novel without reading anything before or afterward in the book. Would you be able to understand and appreciate the chapter?  Certainly you would learn about the characters, and some relatively complete narrative action or subplot could take place within the portion of the book you have read. But much would be inexplicable, because you wouldn’t know what came before, and many things that the author was doing in the chapter would be invisible if you didn’t see how the story played out. That is what it is like to read and preach a text of the Bible and not show how it points to Christ. If you don’t see how the chapter fits into the whole story, you don’t understand the chapter."" (59)Someone can give a great, inspirational message, but if Jesus isn’t there, if he isn’t made known, preaching hasn’t happened.The bulk of Preaching deals more with the issue of contextualization. Readers familiar Keller’s other works know that this is a hobbyhorse of his. Why? Because we don’t seem to understand what is meant by it.By contextualization, he does not mean conforming and compromising the truth in order to make it palatable for a 21st century audience—instead, he means communicating the truth in ways that they can actually comprehend. Though there are some who adamantly deny we should do this at all, we are wise to remember that “no one can present a culture-free formulation of biblical truth”:""The moment you open your mouth, many things—your cadence, accent, vocabulary, illustrations and ways of reasoning, and the way you express emotions—make you culturally more accessible to some people and force others to stretch and work harder to understand or even pay attention to you."" (102)I was reminded of this reality a few months ago when speaking at a church in another community, and one illustration I made—referencing Calvin and Hobbes—just didn’t resonate. Because it was a very friendly and smaller group, there was a lot more freedom to adjust on the fly as I was preaching. So I asked, “How many of you know what I’m talking about right now?”One person. That was, on my part, poor contextualization (though, honestly, one that probably couldn’t be helped), in the same way it would be were I to use the word “sanctification” with the grade four and five kids in our children’s ministry without explaining what it means.But Keller goes one-step beyond simply reminding us that we need to remember where we are, but also reminds us of the need to correctly identify the spirit of the age. What Keller argues is that we are actually not in a post-modern age, but in a late-modern one. Citing Charles Taylor’s The Secular Age, he writes that, ""…secular people are not more objective, but instead have embraced a new, constructed web of alternate beliefs about the nature of things that are not self-evident to all, are no more empirically provable than any other religious beliefs, require enormous leaps of faith, and are subject to their own array of serious problems and objections."" (124-125)What makes late-modernity unique, though, Keller says, is, ""nonsecular cultures are overt about their faith, and their members acknowledge the faith nature of their convictions. Many late modern secular people, however, don’t see or grant the leaps of faith they are taking.""And that is what presents the great challenge to preaching in our day. This has been put before our eyes in the most graphic way possible by the Planned Parenthood video scandal. They’re edited. They can’t be trusted. Think about the services women wouldn’t have access to without Planned Parenthood? A fetus is human, but not a person… On and on the arguments go, all seemingly without anyone taking a moment to really think about what’s being said.That is the late-modern worldview at work. And that is what our preaching needs to combat. But even as we do, it’s wise to remember that, as Keller writes, “you are at odds with a system of belief far more than you are at war with a group of people. Contemporary people are the victims of the late-modern mind far more than they are its perpetrators. Seen in this light, the Christian gospel is more of a prison break than a battle.” (155-156)Preaching matters not simply because it’s something we’ve always done, but because of what it does in people—or more correctly, what the Spirit of God does through in people through faithful preaching. When the Bible is faithfully preached, some people are challenged in how they have been living and believing. Others are strengthened and given new hope. Others still find the message abhorrent and want nothing to do with it. And this can happen all in the same sermon!And that’s why this book matters, and why anyone engaged in any form of preaching ministry should carefully consider what Keller has to say in it. Preaching is not a book on “how to preach the Tim Keller way”. And for that I am grateful. It is a book about the primacy of preaching, a call to put our trust in God’s word on display, and to rely on the Spirit to work through our preaching as we strive to show Jesus as the real answer to those the late-modern mind cannot answer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVEJ8SN328JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953035#wasThisHelpful","R3CVEJ8SN328JQ","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, there has never been a scarier time to be a Christian in the West than right now. There has also never been a better time to be a Christian in the West than right now. Why? Because Cultural Christianity is dead, and the days of Christianity being a part of any moral majority are over.See, it’s not exactly going to buy you any cultural cache to be a Christian right now. We increasingly seen as backwards and anti-progressive, desperately trying to use whatever remaining political power that remains to turn culture back to the 1950s, while risking winding up on “the wrong side of history”. When we’re living consistently what we say we believe, we are weird—really, really weird to the world. Am I the only one who sees that as potentially a very good thing?Thankfully not, at least not if Russell Moore’s latest, Onward: Engaging the Culture without Losing the Gospel, is any indication. The President of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, Moore believes the “increasing marginalization of Christianity offers an opportunity for the church to reclaim a gospel vision that has been too often obscured, even within sectors of the church we think of as ‘conservative'” (61). We have, as he puts it:""…the opportunity to bear witness in a culture that often does not even pretend to share our “values.” That is not a tragedy since we were never given a mission to promote “values in the first place, but to speak instead of sin and of righteousness and judgment, of Christ and his kingdom."" (10)Onward is all about helping its readers reclaim that understanding—to move away from seeing ourselves as an embattled moral majority, and instead embrace our role as a prophetic minority wherever God has placed us.Careful readers will notice that Moore is not concerned with changing the content of our historic message—he is not advocating a revisionist alternative in order to gain favor with those who reject us—but encouraging us to consider our methodology. This is especially important when addressing concerns of renewed culture wars.Christians of another generation (and many of the current one) grew weary of culture wars (and culture warriors). They tired of hearing how the world was going to hell in a hand basket, and how whatever issue on the agenda would bring about the end of America. They weren’t interested in getting back to a Christian America (and whether or not such a thing ever existed is an entirely different matter). They just wanted to everyone to keep their opinions to themselves, and get along.Moore is no advocate of an unrestrained culture war that sees gay rights activists and abortion proponents as our enemies. We are not to run around acting like some “protected class of victims.” Instead, “we ought to see that our culture is less and less connected with the roots of basic knowledge of Christianity” (180). And this viewpoint changes how we approach those who would disagree with our view of marriage, human dignity, sexuality, and so many other issues. We approach them with what he describes as convictional kindness:""This kindness is not weak or passive. In fact, kindness is an act of warfare.… Those who serve Christ must be kind to everyone, Paul wrote. Those who serve Christ must show honor to everyone, Peter wrote (1. Pet. 2.17).… The Spirit bears fruit in our lives, as Jesus lives out his life through us. This fruit consists of kindness and gentleness. This is not a break from the fighting. This is how we fight."" (224–225)No doubt many reading these words will struggle with this idea. I’ll admit, I struggle with it at times. I mean, show kindness to those who ridicule us? Yep. Show kindness to those who deny non-conformists the right to practice their religious beliefs without discrimination? You betcha. Why? Because they aren’t our enemy. They have believed a lie. Though they are responsible for their acts of rebellion against God, they are also victims of Satan’s schemes to defame God.So to fight against them—to attack and demean, to fire all of our ammunition at those who are merely doing the bidding of the Serpent misses the point. Our war is not with flesh and blood, but powers and principalities. Our enemies are spiritual, not incarnate. It doesn’t mean we cower in a corner and merely “take” it when someone does us wrong. But it does mean we, like Jesus as he was dying on the cross, need to be prepared to say, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34).It’s also a recognition that the future leaders of the church might be among those working against us, just as Saul was there approving the death of Stephen (Acts 8:1).""The next Jonathan Edwards might be the man driving in front of you with the Darwin Fish bumper decal. The next Charles Wesley might be a misogynistic, profanity-spewing hip-hop artist right now. The next Charles Spurgeon might be managing an abortion clinic right now. The next Mother Teresa might be a heroin-addicted porn star right now. The next Augustine of Hippo might be a sexually promiscuous cult member, just like, come to think of it, the first Augustine of Hippo was."" (255)This is so important for us to get: Those out there in the world right now, those who might even be violently opposed to us right at this very moment—any one of them could be saved by God, redeemed by and through the death of Jesus, and used by God in order to further his gospel. Were it to suit his purposes, God could someday use the very same lesbian couple that sued a Christian baker for not baking their wedding cake to reach the gay community with the gospel of Christ as easily as he could use the president of Planned Parenthood as an advocate to end abortion, and as easily as he uses any of us according to his purposes.And so if we do not show these people kindness, even as we decry many of the things they represent or currently participate in, we are missing the point. After all, “the path to peace isn’t through bellicosity or surrender, but through fighting the right war (Rom. 16:20). We rage against the Reptile, not against his prey” (231).This will seem strange to the world. Heck, it will seem strange to many Christians, won’t it? Honestly, it felt a little strange to even write it. But it’s true, and this is one of the beautifully strange things about Christianity. God isn’t out there looking for “good people” to do his will—he takes wicked, messed up people like you and me and calls us good. And that merely scratches the surface of the strangeness of Christianity.Everything about what we believe is strange to a world like ours—it is totally incomprehensible. Sexual expression belonging only in the context of monogamous heterosexual marriage in a world racing toward polyamory? Bizarre. Having more than one child in a culture where children are more of a burden than a blessing? Peculiar. Believing “a previously dead man is going to show up in the sky, on a horse” (12)? Kind of nutty.This is the sort of strangeness we need to embrace if we’re serious about truly engaging the culture—and that won’t happen until we are arrested by the strangeness of the gospel ourselves. Onward presents a captivating picture of the weirdness of Christian belief, of convictional kindness in a world of mudslinging and second guessing. The world needs “strange” Christians, and I hope all who read this book will recognize within themselves a desire to be exactly that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QPQYX3G6OGR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433686171#wasThisHelpful","R3QPQYX3G6OGR2","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I remember hearing ""Amazing Grace"" was, of all places, in the Spock funeral scene in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. No lyrics, of course; just the tune. So for years, I figured it was a song that was connected to death, but didn't know anything else. (Yeah, I know. Remember: no religious background growing up, 'kay?) It was another 20 years before I found out there were lyrics that went along with it—and learned anything about the man who wrote it.Most of us probably know a couple of big details of John Newton's life. He was a slave trader prior to coming to faith, and even 10 years after his conversion, remained one. Eventually, Newton left the slave trade and became a pastor and abolitionist. He would go on to be a significant influence in the life of William Wilberforce, who himself would lobby to see the abolition of slavery come to pass. But unless we've taken the time to read his autobiography, or perhaps a later biography like Jonathan Aitken's, we know little about his life beyond this. And even fewer of us know much about his ministry and theology. His sermons were, apparently, remarkably unremarkable, and so they have not attained the status of those of, say, Charles Spurgeon. But, as Tony Reinke reveals in Newton on the Christian Life, it is his letters and hymns that reveal the depth of his pastoral heart and his theology—and what they reveal is a man whose life and theology were singularly on Christ and him crucified.Early in the book, Reinke summarizes John Newton’s vision for the Christian life as one centered ""on the all-sufficiency of Jesus Christ."" This is a vision that echoes the declaration of John the Baptist; that just has he would decrease so Christ could increase, so should we. That whether in times of strength or weakness, we should say ""I am nothing, Christ is all.""Similarly, Newton (and Reinke alongside him) reminds us that ""victorious"" Christian living, as is understood in our own day, isn't our aim. Instead, our aim is for Christ to be our life, since ""Christ is always the Christian’s victory, life, and example.""Newton labors to show why the successful Christian life hinges on the sufficiency of Christ. The Christian life centers on one rule—one man. Christ is our example and our pattern. He is the measure and the means of all our holiness (Eph. 4:13). We follow in the footsteps of the Savior by the power of him who has completed the race and who now empowers us for the race. Christ is the example we follow, the forerunner we emulate, and the finish line we anticipate.Imagine what it would look like if we lived like we actually believed this? What would change in our day-to-day lives? In our ministries and churches? Would we see some of the goofiness we've grown accustomed to go away? Would we be less concerned with spectacle on one side, and with being anti-spectacle on the other? Would we see our love for one another grow deeper in both affection and action? At a minimum, I suspect it would drive us to recognize how little we actually depend upon him, and how different our standards of holiness are compared to his.Even thinking about this topic now, there are at least two or three things that come to mind as points where I can see where my standards are significantly more lax than Christ's. Even so, I don't find myself overcome with a ""do more harder"" attitude. After all,""God’s aim in saving us is not to boost our self-esteem or self-evaluation, but to expose our self-sufficiency as a sham."" Instead, it reminds me that any degree of holiness attained comes through the gift of grace. Christ enables me to be holy. It is his gift. My pursuit of holiness, and my recognition of unholy aspects of my life, cone with them a desire for more of his grace.It's been a long time since I read a book that I've highlighted as much as Newton on the Christian Life—and for those highlights to be overwhelmingly positive. As such, it's a book that I have a hard time critiquing (though perhaps one who has a greater degree of familiarity with Newton's work might do so with less difficulty). If anything, the only criticism would be one that applies to every volume in the Theologians on the Christian Life series I've read to date, which is that there is clearly more for the author to say, but space and focus prevent it.But this is a minor thing, one that shouldn't hurt the appreciation of any reader. Newton on the Christian Life is an extremely accessible introduction to Newton's theology, one well worth your investment because it is saturated with good news for weary Christians. It is, in a word, a hopeful book, and those are in short supply. I trust that as you read it, you'll see that for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN78H7QSES2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433539713#wasThisHelpful","R3UN78H7QSES2Q","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like all little boys between the ages of two and five, my son is fascinated with his boy parts. At least, I think he’s fascinated, considering how he runs around without his pants on. Maybe he just likes to gross out his sisters.My son’s boy-ness aside, from a very early age, we’ve tried to instil an understanding of the importance of keeping ones parts to oneself. We’ve taught them proper names—sometimes with embarrassing results at family gatherings—and told them that if anyone ever asks them to keep a secret, or touches them in a place they shouldn’t or just makes them uncomfortable (even if it’s in a way they don’t understand), they need to come tell us right away.The sad reality is far too many kids don’t get taught these things. And many will experience some form of sexual abuse within their lifetime. Some stats show that as many as one in five have been or will be abused by the time they turn 18. I know some of them. And Lord willing, my kids will not be counted among them.But many parents don’t know where to start. In our province (think “State,” American friends), our government is trying to meet the need with an updated sex-and-health education curriculum in public schools that, while it has some helpful elements, appears to leave children at greater risk for grooming by a sexual predator than informed about the real risks that exist. This same controversial curriculum has seen many parents—notably those of a Roman Catholic background—protesting, failing to offer an alternative beyond leaving it up to the parents.And it’s in the hands of pro-active parents that I want to put a copy of God Made All of Me by Justin and Lindsey Holcomb.The Holcombs, who’ve already written two exceptional but difficult to read books on sexual abuse and domestic violence, have taken a different approach with this book—they’re giving parents a tool with which to teach their kids about their private parts, consent, and what to do if they need help.Two key points they raise in the book center around removing shame and giving control to children:“God made every part of you and God called every part of your body good. Some parts of your body are for sharing and some parts are not for sharing.…” They write (14). And, “It’s OK to say no because we don’t always want to be touched even if it’s by someone you love. If the person doesn’t listen to you, ask for help right away” (17).What makes these two stand out is how they counteract the lies that creep in through the words and actions of abusers. For a child to feel as though they are in control of their own body—that they have the right to say no to any sort of unwanted affection—is a wonderful gift, and something we’ve strived to instil in our own children. Our middle daughter, for example, hates kisses (unless they’re on the top of her head). So we don’t give her kisses on the cheek, and even when we do give a kiss on the top of her head, it’s only with her consent. With all of our kids, we’ve let them know that they can refuse hugs at any time, and especially because our girls are getting older (one is getting awfully close to being a tween), we’re making sure they know that mom and dad respect their privacy, just as we expect them to respect ours.So in many ways, this book was an encouragement for me that we’re already on the right track—and although sometimes the kids will say things we don’t expect in a restaurant or at a family gathering, I’ll take a bit of embarrassment over them not having any understanding of their body any day.And that brings me to the one concern I have, which isn’t so much with the book itself as its audience. I wonder if, because of the subject matter, and because so many parents seem either afraid to use proper names for body parts with kids, or believe it’s inappropriate for those names to be known, that they’ll overlook the book entirely. Worse, I wonder how many will assume that, because the book itself is illustrated in a wonderfully child-friendly style (Trish Mahoney does wonderful work, by the way), they’ll assume it’s a book for their kids, but not one for the family to actually read and discuss together. In fact, as my wife and I sat down to read it, she initially made this assumption, too. It was only after we started reading that it clicked. So parents just need to be aware: this is really a book for you, a teaching tool to use with your kids. Just don’t make the mistake of filing it next to The Jellybeans or Elephant and Piggie.Regardless, I would highly encourage every parent to make sure a copy of God Made All of Me is in your home. Read it with your spouse. Work on a plan to read and discuss it with your kids. Protect their innocence by giving them wisdom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2766DLHL81CZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942572301#wasThisHelpful","R2766DLHL81CZ5","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago I went to a church conference focused on bringing up the level of creativity and the production values of the Sunday morning worship gathering (or experience, as they preferred to call it). As the band turned their amps up to loud enough to make my ears bleed, and lead the group through 13 or 14 rounds of “whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-ohs”, I decided it’d be a good time to hang out outside. Not too long after, I was joined by another attendee. We chatted for a while about what we’d been learning at the conference, and this person lamented, “It just seems like a show, not worship.” I agreed. This person was right: it was a show.And I suspect that’s what’s going on far too often in churches all over North America.People who know me well (and, let’s be honest, people who don’t know me all that well at all) know I’m not a fan of what’s called the “attractional” approach to church—the big show, felt-needs oriented style of church popularized in the 80s and 90s by the likes of Bill Hybels and Rick Warren. Why am I not a fan? It’s not because I’m grumpy and/or only like hymns. Though the aims of its practitioners are noble, this approach encourages people to act like consumers rather than grow as disciples. And that’s totally antithetical to everything the worship gathering is supposed to be about.Jared Wilson gets this. He’s served in attractional churches, and seen the fruit of the model. Or, rather, the lack thereof. But rather than spend an entire book railing against everything that’s wrong with attractional churches (because, hey, who doesn’t like hearing how they’re doing everything wrong?), Wilson simply asks, are you sure about that? Are you sure the smoke machines, lasers, sermons on being a better whatchamacallit and skinny jeans are what the world needs? Maybe what we need to do is go back to the Bible, not to do away with innovation, but to recover a sense of wonder and awe at the glory of God—and build our lives and worship around that! That, in a nutshell, is The Prodigal Church: A Gentle Manifesto against the Status Quo.And it’s quite spectacular.What will surprise most readers of The Prodigal Church is its tone. Wilson strikes a delicate balance, simultaneously calling us out for acting like pragmatic knuckleheads while making us feel really good about it. There’s no sense of animosity toward practitioners, but great—and I believe warranted—hostility toward the practices themselves.Take topical preaching, for example. While it isn’t wrong per se, what is questionable is the practice of putting together messages based around ideas I as a preacher might have (with biblical support), rather than preaching the text itself. And to preach in an expository fashion—that is through an entire book, verse by verse or passage by passage—is considered lazy or cheating by some, such as Andy Stanley. Wilson has some harsh words for this criticism, notably asking, what’s the fruit of the topical/applicational focus?“What is the fruit of having treated the Bible like an instruction manual?” he asks.""[W]hen the church is run as a provider of spiritual goods and services, and slowly stops asking, first, 'What glorifies God?' and begins asking more and more, 'What do our customers want?' what the customer wants becomes more central to the life of the church. The functional ideologies of pragmatism and consumerism erode our theology, which becomes more flexible and less faithful."" (73)Or, more succinctly, “To teach and preach in this way is implicitly to say that the Bible can’t be trusted to set the agenda, and that my ideas are better than the Bible at driving change in my audience” (72).This is what we need to understand: Pragmatism puts humans at the forefront, rather than God. They, functionally, become our gods. So you need to resort to more pomp and circumstance to keep them coming back. More programs, flashier gimmicks, bigger, better… whatever.The only problem is it doesn’t work.But faithful preaching does. The kind that puts the Bible at the forefront, puts Jesus in the place of greatest prominence, does this. And it isn’t cheating:""It is in fact hard work, at least spiritually, because it always necessitates dying to ourselves. The sermon prep may not take as long—thank God!—but the impulse to go first to Christ can be more difficult, and counterintuitive. We must have a stronger faith, to trust that a sermon mainly about Jesus will 'help people grow' more than our set of tips will."" (80)In every chapter, readers will see Wilson avoiding cheap victories. He doesn’t go for the easy joke (usually). He doesn’t resort to nasty ad hominems, which are the weapon of choice of people with a weak argument. Instead he points out the issues with a deficient view of worship, a weakened approach to preaching, and offering programs as a substitute for shepherding congregations, and says, it doesn’t have to be this way. Things can be different, but it means giving up control:Part of moving forward and away from the functional ideologies of the attractional church is also abandoning ourselves to the sovereign mercy of the Spirit, who cannot be measured or leveraged or synergized or whatever. (162)And this is what we all hate, isn’t it? We like to think of ourselves as the masters of our own destiny. That when we hear “There’s no fate but what we make for ourselves,” it might actually be true. And this is where we need the gospel—not simply as an add on at the end of our message, but as part of what we live and breathe as Christians. We need to recognize that we don’t need to make our own fate, God’s got that handled very well, thank you very much. We don’t need to put on a big show to draw people in, Jesus has it covered.""The gospel is not made more powerful by a dynamic preacher or a rockin’ band: those things might adorn the gospel in an excellent way, but the gospel cannot be improved. The message of Christ’s sinless life, sacrificial death, and glorious resurrection is capital-S Spiritual power all unto itself."" (163)Since I finished reading The Prodigal Church, I’ve been thinking about how to get it into the hands of those who really need it. And the truth is, we all probably need it, to greater or lesser degrees. Many of us attend churches that have embraced the attractional ethic, if only in part. It’s definitely true of  my own church and the network we’re affiliated with since most of them have embraced the principles of corporate worship espoused in a not very good book. But how helpful would it be for me to hand it to my pastors and say, “Here you go, read this?”Probably not very. Instead, here’s what I’d recommend: read it for yourself and see what God brings to mind about your own life and attitude. How do you express your worship privately? What does reading the Bible look like for you? How are you seeking to love and serve those around you, beginning with those in your local church? Don’t simply read it to try to determine everything that’s wrong in your church (or the one down the road). Let what you learn change you first. Then you’ll be in a better position to pass it along to others—and they may be more inclined to give its message serious consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVNIFHSQ9VKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143354461X#wasThisHelpful","ROVNIFHSQ9VKW","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the people I've not read nearly enough of is Francis Schaeffer. Maybe you're with me on that. But this is something I realized, after reading How Should We Then Live?, I realized I needed to correct. But where to start?While some might suggest starting with a seminal work like one of those found in Schaeffer's Trilogy—The God Who Is There, Escape From Reason, and He Is There and He Is Not Silent—I'd recommend taking a step back and getting a better sense of the man himself. And probably the best place to start is with Schaeffer on the Christian Life by William Edgar. Divided into three parts, Edgar examines Schaeffer by:1. Helping us understand Schaeffer the man and the era in which he lived;2. Summarizing the fundamental beliefs undergirding Schaeffer's views—his ""countercultural spirituality""—as well as their application; and3. Examining how Schaeffer lived out his faith, trusting God for all things.While I found much of the biographical sketch fascinating (more on it in a minute), it was the final part—Schaeffer's dependence upon the Lord for all things—that I found captivating. Francis Schaeffer was not a man who gave lip service to trusting God. He really believed it. And this really hit home when Edgar recounts a question Francis asked his wife, Edith, ""What if we woke up one morning and our Bibles were changed? What if all of the promises about prayer and the Holy Spirit were … eliminated from the text? What real difference would it make in our lives?"" (129)Cultivating a healthy prayer life has been one of the most challenging parts of my life as a Christian, and is probably my most significant area of weakness (aside from all the other ones). It’s not that I don’t believe in the importance of prayer, nor do I disbelieve in God’s working through it. Just the opposite—I take God at his word in regard to his promises, and I've seen him work quite powerfully and obviously through prayer. Yet, when it comes down to brass tacks, I still struggle with this disconnect, and prayerlessness can easily reign in my life if I’m not watchful. Schaeffer's rebuke, that far too many Christians sit in the ""chair of unfaith,"" stings (131).This, of course, has major implications in my personal life (to say nothing of my current and future ministry). But it is also where I took a great deal of encouragement from the Schaeffers' example. Edgar describes the Schaeffers (and indeed, all involved in the L'Abri work) as people who prayed like they meant it. Whether it was for the finances to ensure the lights would still be on or for the salvation of a visitor, they truly believed prayer made a difference. They trusted that God would indeed answer (132).How I'm seeking to apply this is through repentance and simple obedience in the area of prayer. Though not terribly profound, this means when I am asked to pray, or I feel any sort of compulsion to pray, I stop what I'm doing and pray at that moment. While this has lead to a few funny looks from my wife who might suggest praying about something and has been met with ""okay, let's do that,"" it's been a really, really positive experience for me.First, it's helping me to remember that—blasphemy aside—there is no wrong way to pray. Prayer is not magic; it is communication. And though reverence and respect should be obvious, it should reflect a true relationship.Second, it's helping me relearn the proper posture for ministry. I'm not some sort of super-person that can do all things through sheer force of will.Finally, it's a reminder that, if I want to see people move toward Christ, I must be praying that God would move them. I cannot make someone a Christian. I can no more make someone a genuine Christian than I can make a rock become a tree. But God can, and so I need to pray he will do it.But this isn't all I've seen and appreciated in Edgar's reflections on Schaeffer. One of the things Edgar does well is he doesn't create a picture of Schaeffer that pretties up his weaknesses. In fact, it's his recounting of Schaeffer's greatest spiritual crisis that made me respect him more. During the 1950s, Schaeffer became increasingly concerned with how he had been less than loving to those with whom he disagreed. Eventually, having been ""plunged into the depts of doubt,"" he came to the point where he had to ""rethink 'the whole matter of Christianity.'"" (53, 55)""He decided in the midst of this dark night of the soul that the only honest way forward was to rethink his entire theology and Christian commitment, even at the risk of finding it not true in the end."" (53)Some readers might be concerned with such a decision, but it's important to remember that doubt is not the enemy of faith in some respects—it can be the catalyst for a stronger commitment. It all depends on how we are approaching resolving our doubts though. Let's say I start having doubts about whether or not my faith is even real, if it's not just some happy clappy placebo effect that ultimately doesn't actually mean anything. If I just let my doubt linger, and never really deal with it, guess what? It's not really doubt: it's unbelief. But if I recognize it and decide to do what I can to resolve it, my doubt can actually be a catalyst for a stronger, more certain commitment at the end.Schaeffer reemerged a free man—one who recognized the need to balance truth and love, for they are inseparable. The journey through doubt resulted in a changed man, one who better reflected his savior. That's the role doubt can play in our lives: it drives us to cry along with the desperate father in Mark 9:24, ""Lord I believe; help my unbelief!"" Schaeffer knew, as that father did, that if we call to the Lord in this way, he will answer.Reading Schaeffer on the Christian Life has been good for my soul, and its compelling and challenging portrait of ""countercultural spirituality"" really looks like leaves me wanting more in all the right ways. I trust it will be the same for you as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5GFUYJ4NG47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433531399#wasThisHelpful","R3T5GFUYJ4NG47","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After writing online daily for six years, I’ve learned a valuable lesson: slander sells.If you want to get people’s attention, you’ve got to be willing to go for the click bait… or at least, that’s what I keep seeing other people do. Honestly, when controversies come about, the last thing I want to do is write (or read for that matter) is 14 articles on why so-and-so is a gospel-denying liberal who probably voted for Obama and would gladly do so again, or whatever it is that people are doing this week.Although my example is a bit ridiculous (though, sadly, not by much), I’ve seen the approach doesn’t actually help with encouraging discussion and offering correction. Instead, it causes people—particularly offenders and defenders—to dig their heels in and double-down. Even if the people who are angrily blogging are right about whatever they’re writing about, the vitriol with which they write obscures their point.This is something I appreciated about Nicholas Perrin’s tact in Lost in Transmission. This relatively short book was released a number of years ago to address the criticisms of Bart Erhman, he of Misquoting Jesus fame (so it might be strange to see something close to resembling a review of it at this stage).Perrin has two goals in this book: the first is to challenge Christians to not be frightened of challenges to their faith. For, “when people succumb to that temptation of ignoring challenges to their faith, they are in the end demonstrating that they are more committed to the feeling of having a lock on truth than they are to truth itself” (XXI).This is something that too many of us, I suspect, would affirm yet practically deny. How quickly do we get our back up when someone challenges our position on a particular issue, regardless of significance? Are we able to engage thoughtfully with critique or do we immediately get our rage on?There isn’t an easy answer to this question, at least not for me. I know there have been far too many times when I’ve behaved like an arrogant so-and-so because I thought I was right (and sometimes I even was). But my “rightness” was really just being unwilling to be challenged. And this simply will not do: if we’re serious about the truth, then we need to be serious about the truth. If we’re unwilling to be challenged, how do we expect to grow in our faith?Second, Perrin wants to demonstrate why we need not fear—and he does this by illustrating the insufficiency of the challenges put forward by Erhman. But he doesn’t do this with mockery, but civil engagement. It is clear he’s read Erhman carefully, for he understands the heart of the matter. As a scholar, Erhman long ago succumbed to the “deeply ingrained pressure toward historical agnosticism (we can’t know what Jesus really said)” (60). This, in turn fuels religious agnosticism—that if we can’t know what Jesus said, we can’t know if what he said was true and therefore we can’t know who he really is.If we can know what Jesus said, that puts us in a position whereby we must decide on Jesus. Either he was who he and his followers claimed him to be, or he was not. But if we cannot get back to Jesus because his words and very identity have been all but lost in transmission, then this keeps alive a corresponding agnosticism when it comes to weighing Jesus’ claims against other counteroffers. (60-61)Now, even in his many errors, Erhman has long been a defender against those who would try to argue that we cannot know if Jesus even existed at all (something many of his critics have even given him praise for). Erhman’s issue is not Jesus’ existence, but whether we can know much, if anything, about him.Thus, he offers the gnostic writings in all their peculiar glory as alternative “Christianities” that didn’t gain prominence simply because the sects promoting what we now consider orthodoxy won the fight. But, as Perrin writes, “it was not the Christians who were sitting in the second-century equivalent of smoke-filled rooms, cutting deals as to what constituted right belief and what should be in the canon” (160).Power belonged to the Romans, not to the Christians. But the Gnostics had nothing to fear from Rome:""The Gnostics wanted to have Jesus, but at the very point at which identifying with Jesus’ mission became politically or socially awkward, the Gnostics had a way of transmuting Jesus into their own ideal of a starry-eyed mystic or Greek philosopher."" (161)It’s easier to turn Jesus into something other than Jesus than to follow Jesus when it’s not advantageous. This is what we’re seeing in our own day as people lament the decline of Christianity in the West. But that’s not what’s happening: people who didn’t believe anyway are now just admitting they don’t believe. There’s no social benefit to professing to be Christian (at least culturally), so it’s better to not do it at all.As I said before, this is a relatively old book—and, honestly, I’d recommend The Heresy of Orthodoxy by Köstenberger and Kruger ahead of this if you’re looking for an evangelical critique of Erhman. But it’s it’s still one worth reading. Why? Because although it is not as thorough a refutation as some might like, in reading it, you get to learn how to approach controversial or destructive teaching with respectful engagement.This is something I’ve tried to do for the majority of my time as a blogger (although I know there are times when I’ve failed in it). Nevertheless, it is the approach I prefer to take when possible.Probably the most difficult aspect of this is the fact that this sort of engagement requires actually reading opposing viewpoints carefully and fairly. If anything, this is probably the most difficult thing to do. It’s easy to pick up a book by someone like Rachel Held Evans1 and have pretty good sense of what it’s going to be about going in. It’s quite another to go in knowing we’re likely going to disagree with it, and still do our best to give it a fair reading.That’s what I want to see when I engage with the ideas of others. It’s what I want to see when any Christian seriously engages with anyone’s thoughts. Ad hominem attacks, mockery, and potentially jumping to conclusions… those are easy, and lazy, and really have no place in the Christian life. But to engage with someone else’s thoughts, and to actually try to understand where they’re coming from and be able to articulate it well enough that my “opponent” could say, “Yes, that’s what I believe”—to contend without being contentious—is much more difficult. It takes a great deal more patience, which, in all honesty is the most difficult part for me (again, primarily because it is so much easier to not). But I think it’s worth it. While there might be better rebuttals of Erhman on the market (and there are), there are few that provide as helpful an example of respectful engagement and disagreement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUGS6M1L20DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849929423#wasThisHelpful","RIUGS6M1L20DF","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of people are going to hate Collin Hansen’s new book, Blind Spots. Some are going to be upset because it seems too accommodating. Others are going to be upset because it’s not accommodating enough. Yet those who feel this way are the most in need of hearing what Hansen has to say.And in case you hadn’t already guessed, that includes all of us.You’re no doubt familiar with the concept of a physical blind spot—the place where you don’t have visibility in your vehicle. You’re also most likely familiar with the concept of psychological and emotional blind spots, too. We’re unaware of our own personality or behavioral ticks, though they are painfully obvious to everyone else (one of mine begins with, “The reality is…”). We have certain people we continue to think the best of, despite all the evidence to the contrary.Is it any surprise, then, that if we contend with physical, psychological and emotional blind spots, we would also have to address our theological ones?Regardless of where we land on the theological spectrum, we have our heroes—the people we look to, and tend to trust without hesitation. We have our systems of theology that we either wholesale reject or unquestioningly embrace. We even have churches we look at in our neighborhoods where we’d say, “They’re not a true church” (even if it’s just to ourselves).We look at the churches where people are doing good deeds, but no one is hearing about Jesus as lacking courage. We look at churches contending for the truth but ignoring the needs of others as lacking compassion. We look at churches that seem to be all about unbelievers or seekers, yet not about godly living as lacking conviction. Not only is this unfair, it’s dangerous. It presumes we have a lock on Christian truth. The only problem with that, of course, is  you. And me. And that guy over there.What we need to do is to learn to “see the faults in [ourselves];” because until we do, we “can’t appreciate how God has gifted other Christians” (26).Hansen argues the need for Christians to embrace courageous, compassionate and commissioned ministry—to pursue the Christian life with our heads, hearts and hands. But he is quick to clarify: We are not to pursue each in a balanced way, but to practice all three in “full, blessed abundance—in ourselves, our churches, and the church at large” (36).This is important: To pursue the lost is good. To practice compassion is good. To contend for the faith is good. All of these are completely and utterly biblical, and anyone who says otherwise may need to check themselves before they wreck themselves. But we can’t just be good at one. We need them all.Together. All the time. Among all of us.In other words, we need to pursue biblical unity.When it comes to the pursuit of unity, though, we are our own worst enemies. Unless it’s just me. I work for an organization where the staff are from all sorts of streams of evangelicalism (with a couple of mainliners and a Messianic Jew thrown in for good measure). We don’t agree on a lot of things. But we do agree on the majors (or at least most of them). But it’s easy to forget that. There are times when I find I have to remind myself not to make assumptions, and to remember that if I have a question or a concern, I don’t need to write out a theological treatise. I can just ask my question or have a conversation.Now think about your own experience: where do you see the need to pursue biblical unity to a greater degree? Where do you see God giving you opportunities to put into practice what you already know about it?Some critics will no doubt be quick to point out Hansen’s connection to The Gospel Coalition, a ministry that is often accused compromising the gospel (from the right) or corporatizing it (from the left and the right). And it’s fair to bring it up as Blind Spots is an explanation and application of the core convictions of TGC. However, it would be wrong to assume this book is a “do life and ministry the TGC way” piece of propaganda. It’s not an apologetic for that particular ministry, any more than it’s one author pointing out what everyone else is doing wrong without pointing to himself first (even if there are more “yous” than perhaps I would have used). No one gets a free pass, including the author himself. Why? Because no one is exempt from the need to walk humbly before God. Regardless of the level of responsibility we have or the position we hold, we are all called to humble ourselves and repent. To abide in Christ—to pursue unity in its biblical fullness by pursuing Christ (109). For that, Hansen says, is our best hope:""Abiding in Christ is the best defense against the blind spots that destroy our joy in following Jesus and set us against other believers with different gifts and callings. Abiding in Christ will protect you from growing discouraged and getting sidetracked in trying to obey Jesus’s commandments.… Whatever direction the world tries to steer us—toward retreat, compromise or assimilation—the Spirit points us to Jesus, the true north on our moral compass. Only when we abide in him will we resist the cares of the world and the snares of the flesh."" (111-112)So, do I really think a lot of people are going to hate this book? Okay, maybe not hate. But they will definitely have a hard time with it. Though it’s a small book, it offers much by way of challenges to our thinking. And regardless of the degree to which we agree with what Hansen writes, we need to consider what we are going to do once our blind spots are revealed. I can’t easily answer the question, not because there isn’t an answer, but because it’s one you can’t answer hastily. But it is worth answering—because when we do we will find ourselves better equipped to bear witness to Christ in the world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31ZX1ZPNU4VYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143354623X#wasThisHelpful","R31ZX1ZPNU4VYK","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Few issues cause more handwringing among Christians in our day than that of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. For some, it’s not a lack of clarity on what they believe, but about how to express it without being accused of being bigots. And so, many in this group, because they are uncertain of how to speak winsomely, say nothing.Others, the issue itself is extremely cloudy. They don’t really know or aren’t really sure what, if anything, the Bible says about the issue, and how to interpret what’s there. So when they read the arguments of affirming or revisionist authors, they have no idea how to respond or what to think. And because they aren’t grounded, they risk falling into serious error.You can see why pastor and author Kevin DeYoung would be compelled to write a book on the subject then, can’t you? Which is why What Does the Bible Really Teach About Homosexuality? exists. In this book, he wants to bolster the faith of those who know what they believe, but are unsure of how to communicate. He wants to bring clarity to those for whom the situation seems murky. And he wants to challenge those who, flying under the banner of Christ, would seek to revise what the Bible really says about homosexuality.Divided into two parts, DeYoung begins by first examining the texts which directly speak to humanity’s design and homosexual practice: Genesis 1-2, Genesis 19, Leviticus 18, 20, Romans 1, 1 Corinthians 6, and 1 Timothy 1. The inclusion of Genesis 1-2 might surprise some, since it is the creation account, but including it makes complete sense. After all, we can’t truly understand what the Bible says about homosexuality without first understanding how God created human beings.For the Christian, there is nothing more basic than this: humans were created unique in all of creation—the man and the woman were made in the image and likeness of God. They were made to be something like him, as unity in diversity. And this is repeated referenced all throughout the Bible. It is the foundation and framework of marriage in Ephesians 5, and in Jesus’ own teaching on divorce in Matthew 19:4-6. It is a picture of the gospel, and a type of the marriage that is to come in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 19). Thus, DeYoung writes,""Marriage, by its very nature, requires complementarity. The mystical union of Christ and the church—each “part” belonging to the other but neither interchangeable—cannot be pictured in marital union without the differentiation of male and female. If God wanted us to conclude that men and women were interchangeable in the marriage relationship, he not only gave us the wrong creation narrative; he gave us the wrong metanarrative."" (32)DeYoung’s point here is pretty simple: how you view the male-female relationship is inevitably going to influence whether the validity of same-sex marriage is even a question in your mind. If you function, as some Christians do, within the complementarian framework of gender—that is, each gender is uniquely designed to perform separate, but complementary functions—honestly, you’re probably not asking any questions about whether or not homosexual practice is compatible with Christian belief. In this framework, the two are not interchangeable, and therefore homosexual practice cannot be compatible with Christian belief. The conversation, therefore, shifts more toward answering the challenge winsomely.For the egalitarian, however, the challenge is significantly different. If you believe that gender distinctions fundamentally have no bearing on your role and responsibility, you’re more than likely having to deal first with the compatibility issue. I don’t say this to disparage those who do hold this viewpoint, but merely to show that what we believe about male-female relationships may have drastic affects on our starting point on this issue (and potentially our end point).Part two of the book focuses on answering the common objections to the historic orthodox view of homosexuality:• the Bible’s limited discussion of homosexuality in general;• the cultural distance argument (that is, the kind of homosexuality the Bible talks about isn’t the kind revisionists advocate the inclusion of);• our lack of condemnation of sins such as gluttony and divorce outside of the biblically permissible reasons;• the church being a safe place for broken people and sinners;• being on the wrong side of history;• the fairness of encouraging same-sex attracted Christians to commit to life-long celibacy; and• love as the overriding attribute and characteristic of God.Each topic, as should be expected, is handled very carefully, though DeYoung is not afraid to be a little jabby in places. On this point, it’s important to remember that DeYoung is not being hostile toward those who experience same-sex attraction, nor is he particularly hostile toward revisionist authors. What troubles him greatly—and shines through on every page of this book—is his overriding concern about the seemingly blind acceptance of false teaching in our midst, and the diminishment of the authority of Scripture as a result.This is especially apparent when DeYoung writes on the fairness issue, countering the oft-cited “good fruit/bad fruit” claims of of Matthew Vines and other authors who ask, “If embracing their sexuality were really a step away from God… why are so many ‘gay Christians’ spiritually flourishing?” (116) In other words, how can it be wrong if it’s yielding “good fruit”?The problem, DeYoung argues, is that the definition of “good fruit” proposed is wrong. In revisionist writing, experience has a tendency to trump the what Scripture says. Thus, the good fruit is fulfillment, satisfaction or personal happiness. It is a feeling. This is necessary for us to remember in a culture driven by experience—what we feel is not unimportant, but we cannot escape the fact that as fallen human beings with hearts and minds corrupted by sin, our feelings will lie to us. “The heart wants what the heart wants” is true enough; however, what the heart wants is not always what the heart needs. Tim Keller said it well in a recent conference message, when the heart wants something, the mind will find it reasonable and the emotions find desirable. Thus, we should probably be a little more clear about fruit is, biblically.Instead of a feeling, Matthew 7:21 reminds us, good fruit is obedience. One only bears fruit when doing the will of the Father. Thus, if one is doing something contrary to the will of God, it is bad fruit, regardless of what we feel. We must remember “there are no genuinely healthy trees apart from obedience to Christ and the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:16-24)” (118).As true as this is, and as beneficial as it is to be reminded of it, the reality is, as much as we might want them to, the revisionists aren’t likely to heed the warning DeYoung issues in this book. As I read the book, I kept thinking of how they might attempt to refute his claims. To be sure, those who hold the affirming position of same-sex relationships will almost certainly stand against it’s message, but those who do will be doing so on a shaky foundation.The place I could see those standing in opposition to this book’s message appealing to most readily is experience.Because DeYoung doesn’t deal with same-sex attraction personally, one could argue, he doesn’t have a basis for writing this book. It’s a desperate argument, and a poor one, but one could still attempt to make the case. However, we should always remember that experience does not trump the Bible. Experience, as I said earlier, doesn’t supersede truth. And one does not need firsthand experience of something to be able to speak intelligently about it. Do we really expect pastors to develop a porn addiction before they can speak out against it? Or get divorced? Or become a drunkard?And even if the argument were valid, one could just as easily point to Sam Allberry’s excellent book, Is God anti-gay?, which largely makes the same case as What Does the Bible Really Teach about Homosexuality?—but he does so as a man who experiences same-sex attraction. Nevertheless, no matter how winsomely communicated, and no matter how rigorously defended, revisionists will likely remain entrenched in their position, despite its intellectual and theological dishonesty.Whether they are uncertain of what to believe, or simply struggle to effective communicate the truth, this book will be a great help to its readers. What Does the Bible Really Teach about Homosexuality? offers clarity on disputed texts, pastoral responses to the common arguments, and most importantly, an urgent plea for evangelicals to hold fast to the truth in the face of mounting pressure to compromise. Lord willing, we will all carefully consider what DeYoung has to say in this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q880CPAYA7DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433549379#wasThisHelpful","R2Q880CPAYA7DL","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For pretty much the entirety of my adult life, I’ve loved good biographies and memoirs. Whether a modern celebrity like Neal Patrick Harris, a tech guru like Steve Jobs, a war hero like Louis Zamperini, or a mathematician like John Nash, it’s fascinating to learn the stories behind well-known (and not so well known) individuals.Before reading Fierce Convictions, I’d never actually heard of Hannah More. Unless you travel in very particular circles, it’s likely you have not either. After reading, I have only one thing to say: I really wish I’d known about her sooner. In this new biography, Karen Swallow Prior introduces readers to woman who was both an extremely gifted poet and playwright, and a person of deep conviction and compassion.One of the great accusations made against conservative evangelicals in our day is that we are “too heavenly minded to be of any earthly good.” Our concerns over doctrine, evidently, take precedence over any and all social action. And as is often the case, when we attempt to correct this assumption, slavery is raised. At the western form of slavery’s height in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were numerous Christians who believed it was acceptable to own slaves, including Jonathan Edwards. Though he ended his days a staunch abolitionist, John Newton continued in the slave trade for ten years after his conversion to Christ.And yet, when we look to Hannah More and her contemporaries (including her close friend, William Wilberforce) you get a different picture. More wasn’t an abolitionist in spite of her orthodox convictions—she was because of them. Throughout her life, this was one of her great passions, and her literary gifts were a valuable resource for the cause.""More’s abolitionist efforts over the decades were said to constitute 'one of the earliest propaganda campaigns for social reform in English history.' Indeed, it could be said that More was the mastermind behind some of the abolitionist movement’s most effective campaigns to sway public opinions. Imaginative literature, such as More’s antislavery writings, and other arts were essential to the abolitionist movement because, as has been noted, the slave trade was so hidden from the eyes of the people."" (133–134*)This reminds us of the power of the arts. We cannot deny the power of art, literature, and drama to transform the thinking of our culture. Indeed, we would be utter fools if we tried. Why? Because you change people’s ideas by presenting them in a different way. (And if you have any doubt about this, consider the rapid acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex marriage in the west. It almost certainly couldn’t have happened without its normalization through popular media.) Abolition would likely not have succeeded without the efforts of an individual like More—someone who was able to bring the issue before the people, so it was no longer hidden from their eyes. Because once you see, you have to do something about it.But her passion was not limited to abolition: she also desired that people know how to read. So More and her sisters started Sunday schools to teach the poor to read. And why did she do this? Not simply because she valued education (which she did), but because she believed the Scriptures were so important to the Christian life that people must be taught to read so they can read them for themselves (160).We dare not get caught up in silly notions that orthodox Christianity doesn’t lead to social action. The truth is quite the opposite; consistent belief always leads to action. Or, to say it another way, what we do is the fruit of what we believe. And More is a helpful example in this regard.Nevertheless, even though More was greatly concerned with education, seeing learning as the next best thing to religion, she was hardly a revolutionary in her day (and certainly not in ours). Despite her strong desire to teach her nation to read, she would not teach poor children to write. This was an area in which her culture’s influence was stronger than More’s Christian convictions.This is an important reminder for us: because we all exist within a specific cultural context, how we express our faith is going to be influenced by it. And undoubtedly, there will be some dreadful inconsistencies (as in the case of slavery in the west). Because of this, we need to approach how we express our faith and our values humbly. Perhaps we should be willing to extend grace to our brothers and sisters who wrongly advocated for the practice of slavery, or embraced classism and all that went along with it. Not excuse it, but acknowledge that just as we are troubled or appalled by these things, so too will our descendants by some of our own inconsistencies.In Fierce Convictions, Karen Swallow Prior has produced a wonderful treatment of one of the most important social reformers you’ve probably never heard of. It is superbly written, highly informative, and enjoyable to read. If you enjoy biographies, or if you’re concerned at all about the history of the abolition movement, you will be well served by this book.(*Note: page numbers refer to ARC edition of the book; page numbers may differ from the final published edition)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W3O6KWODP3JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400206251#wasThisHelpful","R3W3O6KWODP3JT","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you don’t know who Chelsen Vicari is, you’re probably not alone.You also risk missing out on someone very interesting.I first learned of Vicari, the Institute on Religion and Democracy’s evangelical program director, because of an article: “Why evangelicalism is so misunderstood by Rachel Held Evans and the Christian Left.”Clickbaity? Kinda. An interesting read? Definitely.So when I learned of her book, Distortion: How the New Christian Left is Twisting the Gospel and Damaging the Faith, I only had one question:Is this going to be really great or made of crazy?I blame the subtitle for this reaction—it’s an attention grabber, for sure. But because of it, it’s hard to imagine the book as being anything but one of these two extremes. And yet, that’s close what we find in Distortion: some really great insights mixed with a helping of… well, I’m not quite sure what to call it just yet.Vicari writes as a millennial pleading with fellow millennial believers to not abandon the culture wars, and embrace their role as salt and light in the world—to hold fast to the truth, despite the cost that comes with it.Much of what you’ll find in the book is familiar territory to those who’ve read existing literature about the crisis facing the American church in our day. But just because it’s familiar, doesn’t mean it’s not worth revisiting.Many, whether seeking to reach their neighbors for Christ or simply to live somewhat comfortably, have given up the fight as the culture has progressively slid away from Christianity. But, as Vicari writes, “Waving the white flag of defeat in the culture wars is not an option for today’s evangelicals because to do so would be to give up on the next generation’s walk with Christ” (7).This in itself is an important point: convictions matter. Truth matters. Whether it makes us uncomfortable or not, whether it’s convenient or not, if we want obey Jesus, we cannot compromise on the truth as found in God’s Word.And yet, this is exactly what American Christians are being encouraged to do, as the nation moves toward fully recognizing same-sex marriage, its government funds abortion clinics, and attempts to socially or legally penalize business owners who opt to not to accept work that would violate their consciences. In other words, as America continues its slow march away from its traditionally held beliefs, Christian convictions are increasingly costly. And for many young Christians, the old fights are distasteful anyway.But the strength Vicari consistently brings to many of the issues she addresses in Distortion is her willingness to point her finger at herself. She describes her own journey of having embraced an affirming viewpoint of homosexuality back toward the traditional view not with swagger, but with a sense of humility. It wasn’t peer pressure that drove her back, it was God’s Word.But she’s also willing to ask her fellow conservatives to own their failings, as she does on this same issue when she writes,""Christians must not look upon the same-sex marriage debate with a 'holier than thou' attitude. The truth is that churches stopped engaging and defending marriage and family long before same-sex marriage became front page news."" (65)There is, however, an irony in Distortion, and that is the decision to place support of the modern nation-state of Israel among the issues we must not compromise on. The irony here is in doing so, she’s majoring in a minor.What I mean by that is not to disregard the promises God made to Abraham, promises to bless those who blessed him and curse those who cursed him, but to remind us of the reality that the trajectory of the New Testament is that national Israel is not explicitly identified as God’s people. For, as Paul wrote, “not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel” (Romans 9:6). Additionally, Old Testament figures are frequently referred to as being, essentially, Christians, such as Moses who “considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward” (Hebrews 11:26).So we need to be careful here, don’t you think?While she tends to disregard the replacement view—that the church has replaced national Israel in the plans and purposes of God—she fails to seriously interact with any pastor or theologian outside of John Hagee. And here, perhaps, is the greater irony: approvingly affirming the teaching of a man who has, at best, distorted the gospel—if not outright denied it—while warning of the distortions of the Christian Left.A wiser approach to these matters would be to affirm what Scripture affirms as central to what is to come: that Jesus will return bodily, that he will remake this world, that he will dwell with us forever and ever, that sin and death will be no more, and that a countless multitude from every tribe, tongue and nation will worship him throughout eternity. In other words, in God’s kingdom, we focus less on nationalities and bloodlines and more on our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.My final comment about Distortion is more something to be aware of, rather than to be warned against: this is a very “American” book. For those of us who live in nations such as Canada, England, or Australia, there are many elements that are going to fall flat. Why? Because we’re not really people who are terribly concerned with our freedom—at least, not in the same way that our American friends are.After all, we live in far more socialist leaning contexts than most of you reading this. We are subjects of a monarch.2 Freedom in the American sense is a foreign concept to many of us. So for those of us on the outside, there’s a bit of a voyeuristic quality that comes with reading the book—there are elements that are totally relevant to us, but many others that we just can’t understand, but we can’t turn away from.In the end, Distortion is a very interesting read, largely because its author is an interesting writer. She’s a nice blend of strongly opinionated and thoughtful—and with time, I can only see that working to her benefit. As for Distortion itself, despite its shortcomings, it has a great deal worth considering, as long as you’re willing to wade through a bit of muck to get there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SAAQXQMQLMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162998020X#wasThisHelpful","R35SAAQXQMQLMA","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a dizzying number of marriage books available on the market—well over 150,000, in fact. And a few of them are even good.Clearly, we have a lot to talk about. With so many titles available, one has to wonder: what else is there to say? Can an author write a book on marriage that genuinely adds something of value? Thankfully, the answer is yes. And Matt Chandler’s latest, The Mingling of Souls: God’s Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption, is a great example. In its eight chapters, Chandler (assisted by Jared C. Wilson) offer readers biblical and helpful principles for love, marriage, and life together from the Song of Solomon.Though it is not as thorough in developing a theology of marriage as Keller’s The Meaning of Marriage, and is more typical in its approach than Chan’s You and Me Forever, I was surprised by The Mingling of Souls for four reasons:1. Chandler always—always—speaks well of his wife. You can tell a great deal about a man’s character by the way he speaks of his spouse. I’ve read so many books and articles on marriage where the (male) author paints himself as the victim, the faithful husband dealing with an unpleasant wife undeserving of his love. When he confesses sin in the marriage, it’s usually her sin he confesses.Friends, that’s probably not the person we want to go to for marriage advice.This is emphatically not Chandler’s approach. As I read the book, I was consistently impressed at how Chandler avoids putting himself in the position of the victim. He lays the problems in his marriage at his own feet, rather than at his wife’s. And even where he does bring up an example of something she did that was wrong, he doesn’t focus on her action, but on his own ungodly response.“The first seven years of our marriage were very difficult,” he writes. “I remember one occasion in particular because it marked a real turn in our marriage. I had said some very cruel things to Lauren that day. I was frustrated; I was angry. I thought she was selfish and self-absorbed, and I told her so. I admit with shame that I wanted to wound her” (202)""I’ll never forget this: Lauren came around the corner… and grabbed me. Then she pulled me really close to her, and she began sobbing. She cried and cried as she held me. She said, 'I don’t know what happened to you, but I’m not going anywhere.' … It broke me. It wounded me in the good way, in the right way. It startled me and helped me in a way I could never foresee or imagine.… and that’s when I said, 'I’m going to get help.'” (203)It’s easy for so many of us to point outside ourselves and treat our spouses as the problem in our marriages. It’s easy to play the victim. But to show the ugly side of yourself, to say, I was wrong or the problem is me, takes a great deal of courage and a tremendous amount of humility.2. Chandler spends more time on teaching us to fight fairly than on sex. The chapter on sex clocks in at 24 pages, where the next one on fighting fair is 33. So why spend so much time on the subject? Because we’re going to spend a lot more of our waking time disagreeing with one another in our marriages than we are going to in our bedrooms. Sorry for shattering the glass, there, newlyweds. And let’s be honest, most of us don’t know how to fight fairly. Most of us have never even seen a married couple fight well.And this is why we need to pay careful attention to the principles of fighting fairly presented. We need to be sure we’re fighting fair—we’re not speaking rashly or shaming our spouses, bringing up baggage or using children as leverage. And most importantly, we should strive for reconciliation—genuine, heartfelt reconciliation—as quickly as possible. “I’m not naive about the nature of some conflict… But as much as you are able as soon as you are able, make an effort to take at least part of the responsibility for the conflict, no matter how small that part may be” (167-168).3. Chandler writes as if the marriage bed is to be kept holy. Because, y’know, it is. Rather than following the now all-too-common approach to the Song of Solomon and treating it as a ham-fisted sex manual (there are no edicts issued about what you “should” do, you’ll be pleased to know, ladies), Chandler emphasizes the fact that sex is holy and should be treated as such. This, again, is extremely helpful because it redirects our attention.Rather than asking what we can or cannot do, Chandler encourages us to consider what does or does not bring God the most glory. And when God’s glory is our focus, a lot of our “can we” questions, are left behind.""[Sex] is meant to remind us of the God who gave it to us, who takes joy in unison with his people. We don’t need to overspiritualize sex to see it this way; we just need to approach it the way the Bible ordained and be grateful for it. Seeing sex as holy will also help us love our spouses more greatly."" (133-134)4. Chandler doesn’t write as one who’s got it all figured out. This is probably the most important thing about the book: Chandler’s tone is not like that of many books written by his contemporaries. He’s not the expert saying, “my marriage is great,” or even “my marriage used to be terrible, but now it’s awesome so go and do likewise.” Instead, he writes as one just like the rest of us—a man whose marriage has ups and downs, who is guilty of sinning against his wife, who frequently needs to ask her forgiveness, and who leans on the grace of God to be a good husband. And this, perhaps even more than its good teaching, is what makes the book worth reading.It’s tempting to take the easy path when writing about marriage, to only confess the “safe” sins. But to reveal serious sin, to continually point to yourself as the problem in conflict… This is fairly uncommon, even among Christian authors. Yet, it’s only when we do this that we really get to give thanks to God as we see how the gospel has been at work in the author’s life. For him to be able to say, “All the time, I find so much new sin in me of which I need to repent.… But I know that Go dis faithful and that he will get the glory” (197), and know that the author actually believes this to be true. That is what we need more of in our marriage books—and more importantly, in our marriages. And if there’s anything that makes The Mingling of Souls a valuable read, it’s this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24QDHE08NXN67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434706869#wasThisHelpful","R24QDHE08NXN67","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By now, if you haven't checked out the growing God's Word For You series of devotional commentaries from The Good Book Company, I honestly don't know if anything I say about the latest edition, Timothy Keller's Romans 8-16 For You, will convince you.Nevertheless, you really should check them—and this volume in particular—out.Like Romans 1-7 For You and the other volumes in this series, Romans 8-16 For You offers readers an engaging, thoughtful and practical look at one of the most contentious books of the Bible. And more specifically, one of the more contentious passages in one of the most contentious books of the Bible. For Romans is not a book with a, shall we say, light touch, and Keller fully embraces this in his treatment of the text.//Encourages and challenges the heart and mind//It's important, once again, to remember: this is not a detailed commentary (though it does quote from many of them, including John Stott's The Message of Romans, and Leon Morris' The Epistle to the Romans). But the strength of Romans 8-16 For You is not in the thoroughness of its commentary; rather it's in how the text encourages and challenges both the heart and mind.One of the best examples comes toward the end of this volume as Keller digs into Paul's practical teaching, the implications of his grand theology found in chapters 1–11: how do Christians relate to the government? This is an especially important question in our day, as western nations race back to the worldview of ancient Rome and Christians face public scorn, prosecution, and eventually persecution, for refusing to compromise on their convictions. For many, it's sorely tempting to take our ball and go home, hunker down in the bunker, or whatever other metaphor for disengaging from the culture at large you prefer. Yet, this is exactly what, according to Keller, Paul encourages us not to do.The command for every Christian is to submit to civil government, appears to be absolute, Keller writes, which isn't helped by Paul's putting ""the command in negative terms, ie: what the Christian is not to do: 'He who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted,' and to do so is to 'bring judgment' (v 2). The strength of this statement intensifies when we realize that Paul was talking of a very non-Christian government—the pagan Roman empire.""Remember, the Roman emperors were no fans of Christianity. The Christians caused too much trouble. Their presence was disruptive, they kept insisting that their religion was the only right one, and that could not stand. But this is the sort of state Paul told his original readers to submit to—a state that hated them! Thus, ""the default position of the Christian (every Christian) to the state (any state) is to submit.""But, there were hints, Keller argues, that this submission was not absolute. Instead, although we are to submit and engage in civil matters—paying our taxes, voting, serving in public office, and so on—we are also to evaluate the state. ""Paul’s radical principle is: we obey our government out of our Christian conscience, out of our obedience to God alone.""So let's consider for a moment: how does our attitude toward our governments reflect this radical principle? Do we submit begrudgingly in certain areas? Do we submit our taxes correctly, even when we know reporting everything means we may have to pay instead of receiving a return? Do we pray for our political leaders, or curse them? And when we speak out against the errors of our governments (as we should), do we do so with a gentle word, or with harshness (Proverbs 15:1)? In other words, even when we disagree, do we treat them with respect:""…we are not only to comply with civil authorities, but to do so in a way that shows them respect, honor, and courtesy. This is the same issue we face in the family and the church. We are to treat parents, ministers, and civil magistrates with deference. Even when the individuals in these positions are not worthy of much respect, we show respect to the authority structure that stands under and behind them.""//Intended for application//As with the other volumes of the God's Word For You series, Romans 8-16 For You is designed for application. Readers will find it most beneficial as they read this book with a Bible and journal alongside it, and really wrestle with the application questions provided throughout. Read it with the expectation of being encouraged and convicted, but be prepared to do something with those moments of conviction. Think with ""sober judgment"" (Romans 12:3) and what you read and discover lead to a change of heart, mind and actions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQ1NJEU76QPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1910307297#wasThisHelpful","REQ1NJEU76QPW","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There’s no shortage of good books on prayer. Martin Luther’s Simple Way to Pray, Answers to Prayer by George Müller, CH Spurgeon’s The Pastor in Prayer, A Call to Pray by J.C. Ryle… These are some of the finest books on prayer I’ve read, and Christians would be doing themselves a disservice in not reading them.While there are many wonderful classic books on prayer, I’ve noticed a severe lack of good modern books on the subject. Most modern books tend to fall into a couple of categories: wicked and stupid. The wicked ones accuse people who pray things like “if it’s Your will” of being cowards who are afraid to pray boldly. The stupid ones encourage us to pray like pagans.And then Tim Keller went and wrote a book on prayer. Keller, “wicked,” and “stupid,” are words that do not belong together. And he only further proves this in Prayer: Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with God.Keller offers us something different with Prayer—he doesn’t jump straight into the mechanics, but instead begins by helping readers understand prayer. He puts developing a right theology of prayer ahead of principles for its practice. This is important because most of us (likely) don’t have an articulated theology of prayer that goes beyond “I pray because I’m supposed to.”While that’s true, there’s significantly more to it than that. Prayer, Keller explains, is both an instinct and a spiritual gift. “As an instinct, prayer is a response to our innate but fragmentary knowledge of God… As a gift of the Spirit, however, prayer becomes the continuation of a conversation God has started” (50). So, on an instinctual level, the “I’m supposed to” is correct—we just don’t understand why. This instinct is why prayer is a nearly universal phenomenon; regardless of their specific beliefs, nearly all humans have a concept of prayer, though the forms and purposes differ drastically.But in describing prayer as a gift of the Spirit, Keller wants us to understand that prayer is both a conversation and encounter with God. It’s not “plunging into the abyss of unknowing and a state of wordless unconsciousness,” but something tethered to God’s Word, the place from which we learn of and hear from God. Thus, “if the goal of prayer is a real, personal connection with God, then it is only by immersion in the language of the Bible that we will learn to pray, perhaps as slowly as a child learns to speak” (55).Keller’s continual emphasis on keeping prayer connected to the Bible is important, and something sorely lacking today. What he doesn’t advocate for is a type of rote “just pray what the Bible says,” but to pray through the Scriptures as Luther encourages in his teaching on the subject. To let the Word guide and shape our prayers.Perhaps what I enjoy most about Prayer—beyond the simple, practical principles provided—is the fact that Keller doesn’t attempt to be original (which is what gets us all into so much trouble). Instead, he leans heavily on the wisdom of those who have gone before us—Augustine, Calvin, Luther, Owen, Edwards, Torrey, and, more recently, Lewis, Clowney, and Packer (with a dash of the Westminster Catechism thrown in for good measure).Could one ask for better influences?This is where the book’s strong emphasis on being tethered to the Word in prayer comes from. Augustine, the Reformers, the Puritans, and faithful modern saints understood this better than many of us do today. We tend to give a verbal hat tip, whereas they see the Scriptures as vitally important to our prayer life. Luther advocates for a spiritual riffing off of the Word in prayer—taking the words of, say, the Lord’s Prayer and making them our own. Calvin encourages us to hold a joyful fear of God in prayer; to always be reverential in our stance toward Him and pursue humility as we pray. And Clowney likewise suggests “prayer involves an honesty that has no real parallel in human relationships” (135)We repeatedly come to this conclusion throughout the book: if prayer is both an instinct and a gift, we need to pray in light of what God has said about Himself—and about us.All that being said, prayer is not “easy.” There are seasons when I have a very strong and healthy prayer life, but often it feels perfunctory and powerless. Often my own sinfulness, stubbornness, and even some insecurity are the cause. When the weight of the world feels as though its pressing down, it’s difficult to even know where to begin. When prayer feels forced and feeble, it’s hard to muster up the power to continually pursue it.And yet, this is what God desires of us. He wants us to embrace the struggle. because “prayer is awe, intimacy, struggle—yet the way to reality. There is nothing more important, or harder, or richer, or more life-altering. There is absolutely nothing so great as prayer” (32).As I read this book, I continually found myself surprised by how much I needed to underline; it’s rare to find a page in my copy where I don’t have a note, squiggle or marking of some sort because I was confronted or challenged by what I’d just read. And yet, I did not walk away from the book disheartened.Keller’s message, far from the pray more harder of so many of the “wicked” and “stupid” books available today, challenges us, but reminds us of the grace of God. This is what I believe those struggle in their prayer life desperately need. They don’t need another book to beat them up. They need encouragement and guidance. This is what Prayer offers. It is rich in its theology, winsome in its approach and wise in its application. There may be few good modern books on prayer, but Prayer is one of them—and among the finest I’ve read of any era.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38TMJYFBWHDYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954147#wasThisHelpful","R38TMJYFBWHDYD","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a hard time imagining what it's like to work in a ""healthy"" workplace. I mean, I know they exist. I even have friends who work in places they absolutely love. But I've worked in more unhealthy ones than not. And some have been downright toxic. Like, hearing the owner of a company I worked for curse a blue streak at my supervisor repeatedly. (Did I mention they lived together, too? Yeah, I worked in a soap opera.)If Rising Above a Toxic Workplace is any indication, it seems as though my experience isn't as out of the ordinary as I thought. In fact, according to Gallup, ""seven of ten US workers are either 'going through the motions' or flat-out hate their jobs"" (11). Thousands of people dread going to work every morning, wondering if they can survive another day, or if today will be the day they say ""when"" and resign. It's to these people that authors Gary Chapman, Paul White and Harold Myra primarily write this book, providing insight, encouragement and practical strategies for survival. What they'll find are numerous stories of men and women just like them who have faced the choice of how to cope—and when to quit.What these stories (which comprise the vast majority of the book) help us see are the choices before us. Consider Melanie's story of a coworker who was a victim of the Peter Principle—a cheeky description of one who ""keeps getting promoted till they reach the level of their incompetence. Often they are promoted into positions of power without the skills to exercise [it]"" (29).Melanie's colleague, Brenda, was one of these. When she was promoted, Brenda became ornery and ""even nasty… She was losing our respect,"" Melanie said (29). She would pick a staff member and harass her, and this continued until Melanie finally had enough and told her ""I love my job here, and I like you as a person, but I can't respect you as a boss. I'm no longer going to sacrifice my life here"" (30). And so she quit.But what's especially helpful in Melanie's story is the question that arises from it: although Melanie's husband suggested that Brenda had an evil streak, it might have been just as likely that she simply had no clue how to do her job. When people are overwhelmed, they perform out of their weaknesses, rather than their strengths. Thus, when a person with limited or no leadership skills is elevated to a management position, he or she is doomed to fail. This doesn't excuse the behavior, by any means, but it should help us consider our responses to these people.I once knew a man who was Peter Principled; he was a nice guy, fairly decent at the job he had, but he wasn't someone I would ever have considered a leader. He just wasn't wired that way. Yet, he wound up in a position he was completely ill-suited for. I knew the moment I heard about it he wouldn't last. And he didn't—the job crushed him.Why do I share that, and why do I find Melanie's story so helpful? Because it's a reminder that we should have sympathy even for bad bosses. Very often they're not bad people; they've just over their heads.We also need to remember that churches and non-profits are just as susceptible as any other organization to becoming toxic. ""Appeals to 'the cause' create pressures to conform to unhealthy codes. Poisons in ministry culture range from subtle fumes that slowly sicken to flames that scorch. Some workers suffer quietly for years while other get fired"" (54). (Sounds familiar, doesn't it?)As depressing as reading so many stories of toxic environments can be, we can also learn much from their example.First, as the authors point out in a survival strategy: toxic work environments naturally make people frustrated and angry. And if we're not careful, we can become bitter. And bitterness will only make us toxic, too. We need to ""find ways to nurture [our] inner reserves and gain perspective. Develop toughness, but resist embittered resentments"" (35). We can't ""let bad leadership start to sour [ours].""Second is to consider what's right. When the opportunity for a promotion comes our way (if it happens), we need to consider:Am I actually the right person for the job?Has God wired me for this sort of work?Do I have the necessary character and gifts?Just because an opportunity comes our way, it doesn't mean we need to say yes. For the good of our colleagues, organizations, families and selves, sometimes the best thing we can do is say ""no.""Finally, we need to remember that our workplace—whether we work in a church, charity, or multinational conglomerate—are all susceptible to having toxic cultures, and we are all responsible for how we contribute. Through our actions, we will either spread the toxicity, or we can can be a voice for health.Being part of healthy change is probably the hardest. In fact, it's much easier to continue on in patterns that tear down, rather than build up. And in some organizations, the healthiest thing we can do is leave. I know many people who have done this. But sometimes the hardest thing—staying and fighting for change, either until it happens or they get sick of you and you get fired—is the right thing to do. It's risky, but sometimes the risk is right.Rising Above a Toxic Workplace is one of the business culture books you see all-too-rarely: one that actually talks about the problems in a workplace as though they're problems by speaking to the people most affected by them. Whether your organization is healthy or toxic, and whether you are a leader or a staff member, this book will offer you many useful tools to help you see where you and your culture are at and develop a plan for change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XA87VREOMFJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J48B04Y#wasThisHelpful","R2XA87VREOMFJE","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got to hand it to Eric Mason: Beat God to the Punch may be the most provocative title I've seen in ages. In fact, that's is what made me take notice when I first learned of it, and when it eventually arrived in my mailbox. When I cracked the tiny book open, I immediately saw how well suited it was.According to its author, this is a book about God's wrath and coming judgment; or more accurately, the grace God offers to rescue us from it. Thus, playing off Paul's joyful declaration that every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:10-11), Mason writes Beat God to the Punch with a revivalist zeal, inviting men and women ""to bow now, by choice"" (1)—to submit themselves to the Lord and experience His grace.Chapters one to three, and chapter five, present a picture of what following Jesus means while striving to wow readers with grace. Using imagery from both first century Jewish practices, as well as drawing an analogy from hip-hop culture, Mason reminds readers that the struggle of discipleship is this: ""Over and over again, in our lives, our humanity will collide with His divinity. At the end of the day, a disciple must be transformed into wanting what the Lord wants for them"" (24-25).Our desires are always going to come into conflict with what the Lord has clearly laid out in His Word. We are all called to sacrifice all for His sake and follow Him. Essentially this means questions about our rights or what we think we want or deserve go out the window the moment we become Christians. We are to follow His example, be imitators of Him in order that we might grow to become like Him.And here's where grace comes in: we are graciously called to this life despite not being able to follow Jesus like this on our own. Mason reminds us that Jesus actually broke the pattern of the rabbi-student relationship, where students would ask to follow the teacher. Instead, Jesus, our great Teacher, comes to us and says, ""Follow me."" Not because God believes in us in particular, or because Jesus sees a glimmer of something in us—which is where Mason's argument surprisingly falls apart on page 17, when he describes Jesus' disciples as  knowing that ""their rabbi believed in them. And… they realized that God believed in them too.""(Suddenly, I feel like I'm watching a video of a kid shovelling a driveway.)Despite this flub, Mason comes back around to God's choosing us a little later in the book, giving us a much more rousing (and accurate) assessment, writing, ""God picks, by grace—according to His nature, His lovingkindness, withholding His wrath—to blow the minds of men, to create potential where there is none, in order for all of the glory to go to Him"" (44).This should excite us, shouldn't it? If a professing Christian isn't moved by the thought that God—through no efforts, actions or intentions of your own—chose to save you and call you His own and promises to keep you as His own, so that He might be glorified, there's something dreadfully wrong. This is not something we should look at lightly.We should be on our knees with a sense of wonder over this amazing grace. But what does it say about us if it doesn't?While the first three chapters flow naturally into the fifth, chapter four serves as a historical interlude. Here, Mason briefly surveys church history to gain a sense of perspective on how the Church has viewed grace through the ages. There's some interesting stuff here, particularly as he gives readers a sense of the loss and rediscovery of grace and the battles to protect its centrality to the faith in the lives and ministries of the likes of Augustine and the Reformers.Now, I've increasingly become a bit of a church history nerd, so I really dig stuff like this. I love seeing how different Christians have communicated grace through the years. It helps to give a more robust understanding of it both doctrinally and practically. But even so, the chapter doesn't move the ""story"" of the book forward.While there are elements I enjoy about this chapter, it might have been better served as the book's appendix.And then there's the inclusion of Charles Finney as ""sufficiently orthodox"" in his belief in God's grace in salvation, and that ""many differ on the semantics of his claim"" (75). Hardly a glowing endorsement, but I'll be honest, it threw me for a loop. To call Finney's view of grace an orthodox example, despite his view of the atonement being anything but… I can't quite wrap my mind around that.[1. Here's a good article assessing Finney's views by Eric Schumacher.] While I realize it's a one-page reference, and therefore not a large portion of the book, were it me writing or editing Beat God to the Punch, I would have removed it in a heartbeat. It's inclusion only hurts the author's credibility.Which brings me to the end of my thoughts on this book: I wanted to like Beat God to the Punch more than I actually did. It's not a bad book by any means. It's got some really great elements, but it's also kind of sloppy, and thus fails to throw the knock-out punch Mason hopes to. Would I say to anyone, ""Don't read this book?"" Nope. But it wouldn't be the first book I'd recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0TSM0WMRW9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N98FNGQ#wasThisHelpful","RD0TSM0WMRW9K","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nature abhors a vacuum. A bit cliché, perhaps, but true nonetheless, especially as we consider the cultural landscape of the West. As Christianity’s influence in wanes, something else is rising to take its place. But what? According to Peter Jones, it’s paganism, or Oneism. In The Pagan Heart of Today’s Culture, the latest in P&R and Westminster Theological Seminary’s Christian Answers to Hard Questions series, Jones introduces readers to this belief, grounding his study by showing the connections between three other isms—polytheism, Gnosticism, and postmodernism.“These three ways of thinking have become strangely connected,” he writes. “Together they help explain the nature of today’s pagan worldview and its opposition to the truth of the gospel” (5).Each of the isms described in this booklet represent pieces of a larger puzzle that, when seen together, describe a worldview ultimately about one thing: the end of distinctions. No longer will there be need for the distinction between male and female (sound familiar?), right or wrong, good or evil… “a rejection of the opposites is in fact…a fundamental aspect of religious paganism, so that postmodern philosophy fits surprisingly well with the religious yearnings for the morality and spirituality of inclusion—pantheistic ‘all is one’ wholeness” (9).This is seen not only in postmodernism, but gnosticism and polytheism as well. Ultimately, these ideas all coalesce in the end of the distinction between Creator and creation. And this is the great lie we see in Romans 1:25—that people exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshipped and served creatures instead of the Creator. That, in essence, is what Jones calls Oneism, and it is a deadly snare.Contrast this with Twoism, or, rather, biblical Christianity, a view that embraces distinction—male-female, right-wrong, Creator-creation. This, Jones says, is the only significant challenge to the rising tide of paganism, which is why there is such a strong effort to snuff it out in our day:""Twoism is the Achilles’ heel of their “all-is-one” fantasy. Twoism must therefore be spoken of and lived out with love, courage, and coherent clarity before a hostile world progressively enveloped by the delusion of the unifying Oneist lie. And as Paul implied so long ago, the future confrontation will be between not simply thinkers but spiritual worshipers, the worshipers of creation and the worshipers of the Creator."" (35)Jones’ challenge isn’t to engage in more culture wars in the sense some may fear. He’s not telling us to run around calling people pagans for doing yoga, for example. Instead, he’s challenging us to live out our faith as we’ve been called to—to be people who celebrate the differences between male and female, as well as between humans and the rest of creation, and who rejoice in the difference between God as our Creator and ourselves as created beings.This is something we so easily forget, isn’t it? That while we should be informed in our thinking, the call is not to be the best apologists out there and present the clearest argument: Our call is to be people who obey our transcendent Lord, the One through whom and for whom all things were created.The Pagan Heart of Today’s Culture does not represent the end of a journey, but the beginning of one. If you’re intrigued by the concepts of Oneism and Twoism, or if you’re confused by them, Jones unpacks these concepts in greater detail, particularly in One or Two and Gospel Truths, Pagan Lies, both of which I would highly encourage reading. However, if you’re looking for an accessible and solid starting point, this is the book to get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAM6IJO8R23GD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629950874#wasThisHelpful","RAM6IJO8R23GD","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you’ve read more than one or two Christian marriage books, you may have noticed they tend to follow a pretty standard template. For a marriage to be successful, husbands and wives need to:•Understand how God has intended them to be (with some sort of discussion of Genesis 2);• Have frequent sex;• See how their relationship represents the gospel (as per Ephesians 5); and• Have frequent sex. Frequently.And then Francis Chan went and wrote a marriage book. Or did he?Chan and his wife, Lisa, give readers a decidedly different take, one suggests that as good as it is it try to make your marriage better, our main focus—whether in marriage or singleness—needs to be something bigger: God. This is the big idea behind You and Me Forever: Marriage in Light of Eternity. The Chans want readers to picture marriage as a vehicle for mission, an opportunity for Christians to carry out our mission to make disciples of all the nations.Sounds pretty lofty, huh? So how’d they do?“As a pastor for over 20 years, I have come to the conclusion that most marriage problems are not really marriage problems. They are God problems,” Chan writes (20). “They can be traced back to one or both people having a poor relationship with God or a faulty understanding of Him.”This, among all the many wonderfully helpful things you’ll read in this book, is probably the most important—and also the most contentious. While sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, certainly, many of us are too quick to call everything a cigar.Or (to mix metaphors) we treat symptoms, but not illnesses. The problem with this is what happens when you leave an illness untreated? It only gets worse (and in some cases, eventually kills you).So think about it in a marriage: if a husband is domineering, it’s because something is deeply dysfunctional in his relationship with God, if one exists at all. If a wife commits adultery because another man understands her and makes her feel special, it’s because something is deeply dysfunctional in her relationship with God, looking to other people for affirmation instead of the Lord.The same can be said of virtually any problem we face. They all start with our relationship with God. And that’s what makes it so contentious. Chan’s tendency is to get to the heart of an issue right away, rather than easing his audience into that knowledge. And because of his, shall we say, abrupt style of springing such things upon us, it’s easy to be turned off. But the more you sit with what he says, the more you realize it’s true (most of the time, anyway).This theme continues throughout the book, as both Francis and Lisa continually remind readers that marriage is a tool for the spread of the gospel:""Beautiful people make beautiful marriages. Jesus is the most beautiful person to ever walk the earth. Your best shot at having a beautiful marriage is if both of you make it your goal to become like Jesus."" (91)""Our mission does not call us to neglect our marriages. But a marriage cannot be healthy unless we are seeking His kingdom and righteousness first (Matt. 6:33)."" (97)""Whether as individuals or as couples, our mission is to make as many disciples as we can during our time on earth… We should be constantly asking ourselves the question: How can we free up more time and resources for making disciples?"" (98-99)""There is an urgency to the period of time in which we live—after Jesus’ resurrection and before His second coming. We have callings from God, and those callings are bigger than our marriages. Seeking His kingdom must be our first priority, and if we’re not careful, marriage can get in the way."" (114)This, again, is a necessary reorientation for many of us (even if there are some cautions I want to address). We should be examining our lives from the perspective of our clearly stated purpose: to make disciples. If we are in Christ, each and every one of us is called to this in some way, shape or form. There is no denying it.And if we have children, mission starts at home. We want our kids to know the gospel, to see the beauty of Christ, to see Christianity as something more than just going to church for a couple hours on Sunday. We want them to see that it involves sacrifice, sometimes including sacrificing time with them for the sake of the gospel…But we also want them to see something else: sometimes the sacrifice we make is saying “no” to a good opportunity in order to be with them. Chan writes:""I work a lot. And I definitely travel more than most. Hardly a week goes by where I’m not jumping on a plane, wishing I could just stay home with my family. Some would call this bad parenting. I would argue that. I don’t neglect my children by any stretch of the imagination, but there are many times when I know God has called me to serve Him in ways that disrupt the family routine. I genuinely believe that it’s good for my kids to observe this."" (165)I sympathize with this a great deal. There are times in our lives when our family routine is disrupted. Because of work commitments or speaking engagements, I’m away from home probably five to six weeks of the year. While that might seem light in comparison to the schedules of many authors, speakers and pastors, we take it very seriously. When I have the opportunity to speak somewhere, we consider not only the opportunity, but the cost for our kids who are all very young. And there have been many times when I’ve had to say no to really good opportunities because where I’m most needed is at home playing cars on the floor with Hudson.(There was also the time I went to Nashville and back in 36 hours when Emily was days away from giving birth to the boy, but…)The point here is simply this: sometimes where we will be most effective for the sake of the mission will be away from home. But this is not license to “take care of the ministry and let God take care of your family,” as so many of a previous generation advocated (with their lives if not their words). I fear for the one who neglects his family in the name of Christ, because I can’t see it going well for them. Instead, what we need to do is find the right balance (in as much as something as unbalanced as ministry is). While we might have good opportunities to be used effectively away, sometimes it’s still best to be right here.You may have gotten to this point and thought, “Great, it sounds like Crazy Love: Marriage Edition.” As tempting as it might be to say, it’s not entirely true. Yes, it has all the emphases of “radical” Christianity that you see in Crazy Love, Radical and so many others. No, it’s not without it’s problems (personally, I do feel Chan’s explanation of disrupting the family routine could be better fleshed out). But in the end, You and Me Forever succeeds in giving us a different kind of marriage book—one that’s less about marriage and more about the gospel. And that, for me at least, is a welcome change of pace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRRJV6N99VPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990351408#wasThisHelpful","RHRRJV6N99VPX","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a lot of really great books out there on the trustworthiness of the Bible. Some of these tend to be on the academic side, demonstrating the historical reliability of the Scriptures, the formation of the canon and so on. Others are more devotional in nature, designed to edify and encourage believers as they seek to have confidence in this book which is so important.These approaches are good and helpful, but many readers want something that’s a bit more direct and to the point. This is what Barry Cooper offers in Can I Really Trust the Bible?, the latest in The Good Book Company’s Questions Christians Ask series. Over the book’s five chapters, Cooper offers compelling answers to three key questions:Does the Bible claim to be God’s word?Does the Bible seem to be God’s word?Does the Bible prove to be God’s word?These three questions absolutely essential to any serious study of the nature of the Bible. If the Bible does not claim to be, seem to be, or prove to be God’s word—if it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny—then we must reject the notion of the Bible being God’s word. If it’s a duck, we cannot call it a swan. And so we are wise to consider what the Bible says about itself in order to verify its nature.Which, of course, leads to that common critique many Christians face—the charge of circular reasoning. But, Cooper notes, “When you think about it, it’s impossible for any of us to avoid this kind of circularity in our arguments: we all appeal to authority of one kind or another, even when we don’t realise it.” He continues:""…if I say: 'The Bible is my highest authority because it can be proved rationally', the argument would be self-defeating. I’d be appealing to an authority other than the Bible (rationalism), implying that it (and not God’s word) was the real measure of trustworthiness.""This level of candor is refreshing to read in any book on this subject, and very much needed. We don’t need to deny that, yes, we’re use circular logic—why? Because (as Cooper notes above) appealing to anything other than the Bible implicitly places authority over the Bible in something other than the Bible.This doesn’t mean, though, that appeals to outside evidence are invalid. For example, one of the most common challenges to the Bible today is whether or not we can know for certain what it said in its original manuscripts. If we can’t have any certainty on this, we can’t have any real confidence that what is found in the Bible as we know it today is what was intended by its original authors. But the embarrassment of riches we have in the form of ancient manuscripts—some dating back to within just a few decades of the events described—are a wonderful example of how God’s people have faithfully maintained the message.…although we no longer have access to the original biblical documents, all is not lost. The truly enormous number of surviving copies enables experts to reconstruct the original with great accuracy. This process of comparing copies is called textual criticism, and as a result, scholars are able to say: “For over 99% of the words of the Bible, we know what the original manuscript said.”It’s appropriate to mention evidence like this, not as a gotcha, but to help illustrate the point: if early Christians didn’t believe the Bible was God’s word, why would they have been so meticulous in making copies, so much so that the variations that exist affect no major doctrine of the faith (and most are limited to things like typos)? Evidence of this sort doesn’t prove the point, but it does lend additional credibility to the point the Bible itself makes.Having said all that, readers should be aware that they’re unlikely to find anything they’ve not already read in any number of other books on this subject. The arguments are as solid as what you’ll find in Kevin DeYoung’s Taking God at His Word, R.C. Sproul’s Can I Trust the Bible? or Michael Kruger’s Canon Revisited. And while Cooper may not break new ground, Can I Really Trust the Bible? is a refreshing and encouraging read that would be excellent to share with those looking to study this important topic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDT0PS6CY981F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190955913X#wasThisHelpful","RDT0PS6CY981F","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can a dying church live again?It seems like such a simple question. As long as there are people present and the Bible is faithfully preached, there’s every chance. But even so, there is no guarantee. Conflict, turf wars, wounds from church splits, and numerous other challenges are very real threats attempts to revitalize, especially the dreaded seven words, “But we’ve always done it this way.”Can those obstacles be overcome? Yep. But it won’t be easy, which is why Replant: How a Dying Church Can Grow Again exists. In this short book, Mark DeVine and Darrin Patrick share the challenges facing prospective replanters through the story of DeVine’s efforts to rejuvenate First Calvary Baptist Church in Kansas City, Missouri.DeVine was, by his own admission, an unexpected choice for this job. He was primarily an academic—a seminary professor—not a vocational minister, nor a church planter. “What prepares a man to imagine that he can stroll into an old, proud, dying city church in the Midwest and have his way with it?” he asks.""What allows a man to suppose he can wrench the levers of power out of the hands of a small but entrenched and fierce pack of lay Christians habituated to having their way—to imagine he can do so despite decades of failed attempts at pastoral leadership?""Given what he and Patrick describe in this book, I’m not sure there’s anything that could prepare a man for such a task. DeVine found himself in the midst of a disaster: a church controlled by an elite few who intimidated congregation members, controlled committees and bullied their pastors into leaving. And this had to end:""The prevailing culture of the place, despite a superficial sheen of interest in the gospel, expended its energies largely in nostalgia, defense of personal perks and privileges, and the sabotage of would-be pastoral leadership. The more I researched the recent past of the church and examined its present state, the more convinced I became that only radical steps—including multiple and likely bitter confrontations with the lay cartel—held out much hope for spiritual revival.""As DeVine details the events that took place to eventually dismantle the lay cartel, readers see something pretty incredible: the rest of the congregation begins to stand up to them, as well. DeVine’s actions remind us of an important value: leaders shape the culture. When a leader cowers in the face of opposition, the congregation likewise cower. This is how the “cartel” took control of the church, in DeVine’s experience. It was because of a lack of strong leadership—not strong in the sense authority, but a humble confidence in the Lord. A willingness to be courageous in the face of opposition. And when a leader does that, it empowers the congregation to follow suit.In terms of practical value (specifically “how-tos”), Replant doesn’t have much to offer. It’s really not that kind of book, something the authors themselves readily admit. But that doesn’t mean there are no practical takeaways. Most are in the form of principles, such as the one above. There are some, however, that don’t sit quite as well.For example, early in the book, the authors assert that, “When churches settle into extended periods of decline, they sometimes adopt a defensive rhetoric that touts spiritual growth or spiritual health over numerical growth.” While there is an element of truth in this, without question, it’s not quite as clear cut as they make it seem. Some declining churches absolutely do adopt defensive rhetoric around spiritual growth. But many apparently thriving churches do the same around their numerical growth. The reality is a bit more complicated than that.Growing in numbers doesn’t equal gospel-fidelity, as any number of churches around North America bear witness. It’s hard to make a case that Lakewood Church is a bold outpost for the gospel since its pastor preaches another gospel. Numerous so-called evangelical megachurches—such as Elevation Church—seem more enamored with their rockstar pastor than with the Lord Jesus. And then there are churches like those of my friends’ Noel and Tim, churches that are intentional about making disciples, training leaders and sending out people in order to spread the gospel through church planting. Their congregations are small by some standards (around 200 or so, which really isn’t all that small), but they are gospel lights in their communities and seeing it spread.There are other curiosities as well—not necessarily good or bad, but things I’d love to have seen discussed in more depth. DeVine’s family was not with him while he served as the interim pastor of First Calvary. And this, he explains, was a good thing, for they were spared an enormous amount of hardship. But as I read, I wanted to know more about how that dynamic affected the family, even from afar. Of how much were they aware? Who did DeVine have to confide in and seek encouragement from during that time? The picture painted is, perhaps inadvertently, a continuation of the “leadership is lonely” paradigm, and that should not be.That’s not to say, however, that you should not read the book. In fact, I’d especially encourage those who are considering replanting to consider this. Every replanting situation is different, filled with its own peculiarities and personalities, after all; in some ways it might even more more difficult than planting an entirely new church. So those who are pursuing this mission are in short supply of encouragement. That’s really what this book has to offer: it’s the story of how one church was replanted and revitalized. And that should give readers hope that if it can happen in one church, it can happen in another—perhaps even their own. It won’t be easy, but it will be possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NS2YBV74V0P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781410320#wasThisHelpful","R1NS2YBV74V0P1","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Influence. Leverage relationships. Eschew formal authority. Develop compelling values… this is pretty much what you see in all the best-selling leadership books. And while it’s not all bad (although not all good, either), it begs the question: if influence is the silver bullet, why isn’t it working?Mark Sayers, senior leader of Red Church in Melbourne, Australia, may have stumbled onto the answer, and, as he writes in Facing Leviathan: Leadership, Influence, and Creating in a Cultural Storm, it’s less of an issue of technique or style than one of worldview.We are in the midst of a battle between what he describes as “mechanical” and “organic” values—a move away from traditional values surrounding leadership, which includes authority and power toward fluid, creative and (sometimes) leaderless leadership styles. And while some argue that this is our “evolving beyond” the modernist approach to life and leadership, Sayers argues it’s actually a reversion. It’s the reassertion of the values of Romanticism.“Romanticism arose in reaction to the Enlightenment,” he writes, “attempt[ing] to create an alternative to the mechanical worldview. It would base its ideology on the suspicion of power and structure… They preferred emotion and experience to reason and the empirical.” And while the Englightment (or modernist) vision imagines the leader as hero, “the Romantic vision imagines the creative genius as a heretic, always pushing the boundaries and breaking taboos” (26-27).Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Go take a look at any of the leadership books littering your shelves and you’ll see this conflict front and center. But Sayers goes deeper than the Romanticism vs Enlightenment ideology clash—those two are merely alternatives to the Christian worldview, options that fail to stand up against the true battle:""The real battle in which our culture is engage is not between the mechanical and the organic but rather between the pagan and Christian worldviews. A Christianity that attempts to model itself on the hero or the genius will be a faith that has little potential to speak the good news to the West. Instead, we must rediscover the truly radical vision of leadership found within the Bible. A model of leadership… that dared to proclaim in pagan streets and squares that God had lowered Himself to come and live in the mess and muck of human life, within history, in time, in human flesh."" (29)Christlike leadershipThe first and last chapters—and the passage above in particular—makes Facing Leviathan worth reading. Sayers succinctly and precisely identifies the battle within our world, and the struggle within leadership circles. We’re essentially fighting the right battle with the wrong weapons. We’re combating “leader as hero” with “leader as heretic,” preferring to be hip over being heard. And both approaches leave us—both leaders and followers—wanting.The leader as hero types quickly tend to veer into becoming overbearing and authoritarian. I once knew a man who seemed more like a supervillain than a human being in this regard, laughing maniacally whenever he learned an employee had purchased a car or a house. It meant, from his perspective, he owned them—they needed their jobs, and he delighted in that fact. Followers of this type often feel beaten down and abused. But I’ve also seen the leader as heretic, too, and it also quickly falls apart as they’re too busy deconstructing what already exists to figure out how to move forward. Followers of this type are typically frustrated by the lack of forward direction, which feeds into their distrust of authority, which then makes them even more frustrated, which then…We don’t need more heroes, and we definitely don’t need more heretics. We need something better. “We must become leaders who are deep in a society of the spectacle that produces shallowness” (115). In other words, we need leaders modelled after Christ. We need people who are, as Sayers calls them, rebuilders, those who are quietly “getting on with the job.”“Our culture of deconstruction no longer makes sense to them,” he writes. “The culture of deconstruction that has come to dominate the church no longer helps them. It hinders them. They are the rebuilders, partners with God in the rebuilding of His creational order” (217). These are the kinds of people we need to become, he argues, people less concerned with worrying about “moving from the mechanical values to the organic values,” and instead “living wholeheartedly for the God we find in the storm” (218). And out of that comes something compelling and beautiful, something deep in a sea of shallow. Maybe even leaders worth following.There is so much strength to Facing Leviathan, particularly when Sayers is exercising his considerable skills as a cultural commentator, that it’s hard to find much fault with the book. But what weaknesses do exist come from its author’s strengths.Sayers is clearly gifted as a cultural commentator, but is not nearly as gifted a biblical one, as demonstrated by his novel (but not entirely unorthodox) approach to Jonah throughout the book. Jonah isn’t the first book I’d go to tease out lessons on leadership, but maybe that’s just me. I’ve seen it done occasionally, but the results have always left me wanting. Jonah is a powerful illustration of the gospel, to be sure, but I’m not sure he really fits the mould of either the “heroic” or “heretic” leader. Instead, he, like the rest of us, is a deeply confused, broken, sinful, selfish, individual—one who desperately needs the saving work of the One whom he foreshadows.As borderline blasphemous as it might seem to say “I wish he hadn’t included discussion of this or that biblical passage,” I’d almost rather he’d have not bothered with it since it lessens the impact of the rest of his writing. His theologically informed reading of culture, the arts, and literature stands on its own.Nevertheless, I would not let this prevent me from recommending this book to most any reader, especially those in a position of influence (or leadership). By recasting our leadership principles as a conflict between worldviews, Sayers will surely cause its readers to rethink what they’ve read in the latest leadership bestseller—and perhaps reconsider their approach to Christlike leadership.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJR8PA3EPNSRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802410960#wasThisHelpful","RJR8PA3EPNSRF","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The doctrines of grace have an image problem.It’s easy to understand why: Those who embrace them, those Calvinists are a shifty bunch. If they’re not limiting salvation to a tiny handful of people, they’re trying to take over your local church like stealthy ninjas. Or something.Regardless of the silliness you sometimes see, especially in the blogosphere, about Calvinist conspiracies, hostile takeovers, and the joyful condemnation of sinners to hell, there is an almost complete lack of understanding as to what the doctrines of grace—sometimes called the five points of Calvinism—actually are.Clearly, Daniel Montgomery and Timothy Paul Jones have noticed this problem, and their new book, PROOF: Finding Freedom through the Intoxicating Joy of Irresistible Grace, seeks to remedy it by “awaken[ing] you from the delusion that life depends on you and free[ing] you to discover the intoxicating joy of God’s wild and free grace” (16). They do this by offering readers a fresh look at the doctrines of grace—by redefining them around grace.Rather than using the oft-repeated (and not entirely reflective of Reformed theology) acrostic TULIP, the authors redefine the doctrines of grace as PROOF:Planned grace—“God planned to show his grace to his chosen people… God’s eternal plan was to love his children and give us his very best” (31, 32).Resurrecting grace—“Apart from God’s single-handed gift of resurrecting grace, no human being will ever seek God because a death-defeating King who demands that we find our greatest joy in his Father’s fame is repulsive to the spiritually dead” (51).Outrageous grace—“God chose us … and secured us as his children without the slightest reliance on anything we have done or might do… All of his, from beginning to end, God accomplished not due to our deeds but ‘freely by his grace’” (74-75).Overcoming grace—“God unshackles us from the enslaving contagion of sin so that we glimpse the overwhelming beauty of Jesus and his kingdom” (91).Forever grace—“If you are God’s property—someone who has been transformed by God’s power—no one, not even you, can remove you from God’s hand.… What our perseverance provides is evidence that Jesus is present in our faith, working his works through us” (111-112, 116).Can you see why these doctrines have an image problem?But truly, the issue doesn’t come from the doctrines themselves—the issue comes from us. Every element of this acrostic points away from us and what we do to God and what He does. They put us in a position of utter dependency, of desperate need. And we hate that, don’t we?Years ago, I was teaching a children’s Sunday school class, and we discussed how we are Jesus’ sheep. A six-year-old girl—the pastor’s daughter!—went berserk when she heard this, defiantly declaring, “I am not a dumb sheep!”Let’s be honest, us grown-ups are no different. The idea of being a “sheep”—a dumb, defenseless animal, totally incapable of caring for itself—is offensive to us. And yet, this is how the Lord describes His people: as sheep in need of a shepherd. These doctrines only serve to reinforce that: to challenge our self-reliance and destroy any misconceptions as to whom all glory, honor and praise is due.Some might argue that redefining the acrostic doesn’t resolve the issue with these doctrines. But that all depends on your point of view. If you have an issue with the doctrines of grace, it doesn’t matter how they’re articulated, you’re going to reject them. If you see the wine as tainted, a new wineskin isn’t going to help.But what Montgomery and Jones do exceptionally well here is show us that this old wine is indeed the best. “Grace sets people free… Grace gives rest and peace… Grace leaves us with nothing to prove because, in Christ, everything that needs to be proven has already been provided” (143).""Like the pure rations that flashed in the tankards of eighteenth century sailors, the undiluted message of grace is intoxicating—so strong that it leaves us slaphappy, staggering, and singing for joy at the thought that God chose to love us precisely when there was nothing loveable about us. This joy is the fuel that drives Christian worship. When a church proclaims God’s undiluted grace, the deadly delusions of human religion are drowned in a flood of gospel-fueled freedom and intoxicating joy."" (22-23)There’s nothing stealth about the Calvinism in PROOF. There’s nothing hostile or conspiratorial. This is not a grim tome filled with condemnation. What Montgomery and Jones offer is a picture of grace—grace that is to be meditated upon, sung about, worshiped through. Pure, undiluted grace; the kind that truly changes lives, the kind that is meant to be engaged in all of life. This is the grace we all need. Come, discover it with fresh eyes, won’t you?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDX44VWRIB73V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310513898#wasThisHelpful","RDX44VWRIB73V","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I realize it’s probably a bad idea to have favorites when it comes to the Bible, but I kinda do. If I had to make a top five list for books of the Bible, Titus would be on it. For years, Titus has been one of my “go-to” reads—when I don’t know what to read, I turn there. And I always find something in its three chapters. In it, Paul is direct, challenging, encouraging… basically, everything you would expect from a message from an older man to a (presumably somewhat) younger one.But up until recently one of the things I had not added to my library was any sort of devotional material or commentaries of significance about this epistle. So, when I learned about the latest edition of The Good Book Company’s God’s Word For You series, Titus For You by Tim Chester, I was pretty excited. Even when I on occasion disagree with some of his emphases, I’ve always counted on Chester to offer faithful interpretations and thoughtful applications of the Scriptures.In this regard, Titus For You is no different. Like the previous volumes in this devotional commentary series, Titus For You offers readers a basic understanding of the text with lots of space for personal reflection and application. In this regard, again, Chester’s exposition is (as expected) clear and careful. In his explanatory notes, however, Chester intentionally focuses on an important aspect of Titus that’s easy to overlook—that “godliness shows that the truth is true.”“This truth that accords with godliness would be in contrast to other teachings that self-identify as ‘truths’, but do not produce godly lives,” he writes. “In this sense godliness authenticates the truth; godliness shows that the truth is true. Or, better still, it shows that the truth is living because of the fruit it produces.”This is important because it’s a necessary filter through which you need to see the rest of the book. Godliness authenticates truth—how we live affirms or denies what we profess to believe—and how we live is inevitably replicated in others. This is why character matters so much in the qualifications of elders, and why Paul encourages older godly men and women to teach and train the younger. We replicate what we’re like in others, for good or ill.And this is why limiting the demands of godliness is so dangerous. When we reduce godliness “from becoming Christlike to becoming a little less like our culture in a few ways,” we set up a false witness. We become known as people who don’t do certain things, as opposed to people who love Jesus and serve others wholeheartedly. “Christian maturity is exchanged for not sleeping around, not getting drunk, and turning up to Bible study,” which is just kind of sad.""We are all called to commend the gospel to one another so that we live gospel-shaped lives that are fit for purpose—the purpose of doing good. And we will only do this as we learn to live out the gospel, enjoying God’s good gifts in a way that brings glory to him and good to us. Legalistic abstention is no more the gospel of grace than licentious abuse is; and running to the first extreme in order to escape the other is to swap one error for another.""For me, the standout material in Titus For You, really comes toward the end of the book, as Chester reminds readers that salvation—and the godly living that is a result of it—is truly all of grace. And there is nothing better than grace:“There is nothing more that he could have given. He has given us himself,” Chester writes. “There is nothing more that he could have done. He has done everything.… There is nothing more that he could have promised.… He saved us to become heirs, looking forward with certain hope to an eternity spent enjoying everything that Christ deserves.”While Titus For You doesn’t break new ground, it would make a welcome addition to any reader’s devotional literature. This book, in a nutshell, is chock-full of simple, faithful encouragement, the sort that more us desperately need. That might not be terribly groundbreaking, but it certainly doesn’t go out of style.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPL8ZFWBW4MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9DHNGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JPL8ZFWBW4MF","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a pastor's kid, but if I were, there are two things I know to be true: First, I'd want everyone in our church to stop using the term ""PK,"" and second, I wouldn't want to be the kid of a famous pastor.Barnabas Piper didn't have much of a choice on either count. Born three years into his father's call to pastoral ministry, he'd known nothing but the PK life, and as the son of John Piper… Well, let's be honest: the fact that Barnabas hasn't dyed his hair purple and started running marathons in leather chaps may well be the surest evidence of God's grace.Okay, I'm probably exaggerating.A bit.Maybe.But one thing he makes clear in The Pastor's Kid: Finding Your Own Faith and Identity is the PK life is anything but simple:""The life of a PK is complex, occasionally messy, often frustrating, and sometimes downright maddening. It can be a curse and a bane. But being a PK can also be a profound blessing and provide wonderful grounding for a godly life. Often the greatest challenges are the greatest grounding and the biggest falls are the best blessings. This polarity exemplifies the challenge it is to be a PK."" (Kindle location 71)This polarity Piper describes—that being a PK can be simultaneously a blessing and a burden—is a theme that runs throughout this book. The insane expectations of simultaneously being perfect and the perfect rebel, as as though the PK will be the MVP in a game of Bible All-Star while at the same time wearing a beer helmet to church. Living in the fishbowl, where all eyes are on you (and often knowing private things they have no business knowing) because of Pastor Dad. The confusion of knowing a lot of Bible stories, but not knowing Jesus because Jesus has become boring:""Being around Jesus-related teaching, literature, and events all the time makes Jesus rote in the minds and hearts of PKs. Rote is mundane. When Jesus becomes mundane, He ceases being life-changing and life-giving. In the case of many PKs, He never was either of these; by their estimation, He was just a character in an overtold story. Instead of Savior and Lord, He becomes any number of other things, most of which take on the character of those who represent Him in the church."" (Kindle location 634)As a parent, that is probably the most terrifying thing for me when I think about my own children's spiritual health. They're not PKs, but they are in the bubble because of my job and my extra-curricular activities. They're exposed to a lot of Bible, a lot of books, a lot of discussion… and honestly, the last thing I want for them is to find Jesus boring.So what does it mean for me as a parent? I need to give them grace and space to figure stuff out as they grow. To wrestle, to ask questions. To meet the real Jesus at the end of it all because, ""only when Jesus becomes real to a PK can she begin to figure out what she is, who she is"" (Kindle location 648).This is where, from a  practical standpoint, the sixth chapter, ""Pastor and Child,"" is so helpful to me (even as a layperson). It's a simple reminder to be dad before being a pastor or ministry leader or anything else. To talk with instead of at. To have fun, have friends, to play and be silly. ""The greatest grace a pastor can show his children is not being a great pastor; it is being a parent who is fully invested, cares deeply, and shows it as well as he can"" (Kindle location 1110).Writing on a subject so closely tied to the author's life and experience can be touchy, especially one as complex as being a pastor's kid. It's easy to veer into bitterness, grumbling and complaining about how awful being a PK was. While that might even be true for some, this is not where Piper leaves readers. He's not bitter or jaded. He hasn't abandoned Christianity. He's not angry with his parents for giving their lives to church ministry. Instead, he is grateful:""…PKs are blessed to have parents who devote their lives to serving Jesus. It is a challenging calling, and not one person in the world’s history has figured out how to do it perfectly. It is a daunting life. But it is necessary and good and rewarding. So thank you, pastors (and spouses). You have given your lives to serving Jesus and His church, and that is a blessing."" (Kindle location 1343)If there's one key takeaway from the book, this is it. Despite its complexity, being a PK ultimately is a blessing, rather than a burden. Although some stumble and fall, and some try to run as far away as possible from the faith of their parents, they don't have to. They don't have to live up to false expectations, or let unkind and uncharitable comments become self-fulfilling prophecies.Instead, they can run full tilt toward Jesus, owning their responsibilities to ""honor Jesus, to honor our fathers and mothers, to love and support the church, and to go about our lives not as victims but as the redeemed"" (Kindle location 1394). This is what I see Barnabas Piper doing, both in The Pastor's Kid and when I interact with him online or when we happen to be in the same city (when we're not making smart-alecky comments, that is). And this is what I'd love to see for my kids who aren't PKs, as well as for all the PKs at our church and in all the faithful churches in our community. While none of us can make it happen for any one person, this book is sure to offer a great deal of healing for wounded pastor's kids and challenging encouragement along the way for their parents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BF8G80C764TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW4T9OI#wasThisHelpful","R1BF8G80C764TF","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like  every few minutes there’s another book, article, or message being released with “gospel” in the title. Usually it’s followed by a hyphen: “The gospel-driven life,” “gospel-centered ministry,” “gospel-influenced driving…” It’s not that any of these are bad (well, except the one I made up), but sometimes I wonder if we’re in danger of turning the gospel itself into a modifier for the thing we’re really talking about. When that happens, we risk leaving the gospel assumed.And you know what happens when you assume, right?Ray Ortlund is a man who doesn’t assume the gospel. The pastor of Immanuel Nashville, Ortlund is one of those guys who you read or hear, and think, “Wow… he really believes this.” He gets that what we believe about the gospel shapes us and the culture of our churches, that “gospel doctrine creates a gospel culture” (117). But what does that look like? This is what he aims to show readers, The Gospel: How the Church Portrays the Beauty of Christ.Loosely divided into two parts, The Gospel begins by exploring the deeply personal and epically cosmic purposes of the gospel. The gospel is about the eternal fate of individuals—but it is also about our churches and the world as a whole. This “both/and” Ortlund strikes is so necessary in our day when we need to introduce the God of the Bible to people with no frame of reference. People who have no concept of either an intimately personal God or a transcendent Creator who holds the universe together with but a word.So how does this shape our culture? “We see how massive God’s love really is, and so we give up our aloofness and come together to care for one another in real ways, even as God wonderfully cares for us” (37), and we see that it “creates churches of bright, resilient, rugged hope. It creates churches that face life as it is and are not defeated” (62).Is that not what the people of this world desperately need? I can’t help but think about the social awareness and action culture that’s sprung up around the millennials, a generation with just the right mix of nave optimism and arrogance to believe they can truly change the world. After all, they’ve been told this their whole lives. And this is the driving force behind so much of our social (network) activism, cause-creation, and all of these things—it’s all about living up to the ideal. (Or is that idol?)Is it any wonder that people are beginning to experience something called compassion-fatigue?The gospel, though, has so much hope for them (just as it does for every age generation). In the gospel, millennials (and, again, all people) find the answer to the problems of the world, which aren’t external factors to be managed, but internal realities that need to be transformed. That we’re not good people who need to think more positively, but bad people who think too highly of ourselves. And when we get this, we are free—free from the demands of (man-driven) performance, free to let go of the unwieldy burden of trying to make a better world, and give it to the One whose job it actually is.If that last paragraph made you squirm a little, you’re not alone. The idea of letting go of the pressure to perform, to “fix” the world, is scary. Simply because we struggle to believe it’s true. The gospel seems too good to be true, and embracing and building a gospel culture is intimidating. It means we’re constantly examining our own culture to see how it conforms to Christ, to see what assumptions we’re making and uproot areas of unbelief. We will meet resistance from within and from the world. We will face rejection and self-doubt… But even our faltering steps forward give the opportunity for something beautiful to spring to life.""If we have suffered the loss of all things in order to gain Christ—no egos to protect or scores to settle—we are free to receive his power, courage, and love. They outperform everything in this world, because they come from beyond this world. How compelling for our churches to say: 'We’re not taking one more step without the power, courage, and love of the gospel for the glory of Christ alone. No more status quo!'"" (104)Though particularly aimed at pastors and church leaders, The Gospel is valuable for any reader. It is not a how-to for ministry; it is a rallying cry for revival. It leaves you with a desire to see the kind of culture Ortlund talks about (and has nurtured at Immanuel) birthed in your own life and church. What we believe shapes how we live, and how we live reveals what we believe. And what I want—and what I hope shows increasingly with time—in my own life and in my church is a culture where grace is freely given and joyfully received. Where even as some are hardened to the gospel, others are softened and welcomed into God’s family. When that happens, when our gospel doctrine leads to a gospel culture, it’s a wonderful thing indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYIN3G3LQOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433540835#wasThisHelpful","R2JYIN3G3LQOQ","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul"" (Psalm 19:7). David wrote those words to describe the first five books of the Bible—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. These, he said, are ""perfect."" These ""revive"" the soul.Do we see the Law the way David did?I'm guessing, probably not.We tend to view the Law in one of two ways. The first is, we treat the Law merely as commands to be scrupulously obeyed in order to earn favor with God. We are trying to be ""good,"" which is moralism (or, legalism). The second option treats the Law as something to be rejected altogether; we are free in Christ and thus we become a law unto ourselves. This is licentiousness (which, arguably, is another form of legalism).Neither view respects the Law. Neither exhibits a love for the ""perfect"" Law. Neither revives the soul, as David says the Law does.But there is another option left to us, one that is better than anything moralism and licentiousness have to offer—delighting in the Law. This is the option available to all faithful Christians, the way the Lord wants us to see His Law, and what what Jerram Barrs wants us to see in his recent book of the same name.Barr's background teaching apologetics and outreach at Covenant Theological Seminary plays a significant role in the tone of Delighting in the Law of the Lord. Barr writes not as a typical academic, but one who is convicted that what he writes is true. He, like a good evangelist, wants to persuade us to see the goodness of the Law over the course of 24 chapters (which is, sadly, where he does become more of a traditional academic).So how'd he do?Well, here are a couple of the standout items from my perspective:The law is the definition of true humanness. Barr's connection of the Law to our being created as image bearers of God is perhaps the most helpful thing he describes in the entire book. The Law represents the character of God—and is therefore beautiful by virtue of this fact—which means it also shows us the nature of true humanity. With each commandment given, ""It's as if God is saying, 'This is my character: I am just; I am merciful; I am kind; I am faithful; I am generous. You are to be like me'"" (99). If humanity was intended to reflect God, it makes sense that the Law would show us what we were intended to be—and more importantly, that Christ would show us what it meant to be truly human in His perfect keeping of the Law.Legalism is the enemy of outreach. Where legalism—whether in rigorous rule keeping or in defiant rule-breaking—reigns, the gospel is not preached. Barr writes:""We must sit at Jesus' feet and recognize that all legalism is an implacable enemy of the gospel of grace. And we need to be prepared to fight against it, rather than bow to it or allow it to govern the life or outreach of our churches.… Attacking legalism is necessary to bring about the salvation of the legalists themselves by humbling them before the Lord, before his truth, and before his grace. Attacking legalism is also necessary in setting people free from the rules that legalists impose upon them.… This proclamation of liberty from legalism is one of the great friends of true proclamation of the gospel, both to the church and to the world."" (210)These are a couple of points from the book that, in hindsight are tremendously helpful, and if they're all you walk away with from the book, you will be very blessed indeed.However, I've got to be honest: I wasn't terribly enamored with this book while I read it. Don't get me wrong—it's well written, it's thoughtful, and there's a lot I agree with… but you know how sometimes the best way to describe a book is simply long? That's Delighting in the Law of the Lord. It took me five months to read—not because I'm a slow reader, but because it couldn't hold my attention. As harsh as it is it say, for a book on delighting in the Law, I didn't find myself terribly excited about what I was reading.Maybe the problem is me. In fact, it's a safe bet that at least some of the blame belongs there. But as much as I wanted to be riveted by the book, I just wasn't. I love the Law, I love seeing God's grace in the Law and recognizing how Christ came to fulfill the Law for me while also working it in me… But my time with this book didn't help with that. Having had a fairly significant amount of time away from the book (I finished reading it about two months ago), there's more that I appreciate from it, but it's definitely not a book that's for everyone.(3.5 of 5)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R991U1L9PJIQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433537133#wasThisHelpful","R991U1L9PJIQE","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As we sat in the school auditorium where our church meets, I could feel my wife seething beside me. Our pastor had come to a crucial text in one of the gospels—Jesus’ teaching on divorce. As we listened to our pastor strongly (and faithfully) teach on what the Bible says about marriage and divorce, Emily became increasingly agitated. Not because of anything that was said, but what hadn’t been: what about women who are being abused?To many, the Bible’s teaching on divorce seems too simplistic to deal with these issues. Bad counsel based on incomplete teaching leaves many women (and men) feeling trapped, with nowhere to turn when their spouses begin to spiritually, psychologically, physically or sexually abuse them. When the abuse somehow becomes their fault in the counselling session, or they’re too ashamed to even say anything at all—or don’t even know if it “counts.”Emily’s anger was birthed from experiences of these feelings in both her childhood and adolescent years, and her empathy for several friends who have experienced abuse in their marriages. If we’re to offer any sort of hope and encouragement to those suffering from domestic violence, we need to know what the Bible has to say to them.This is why books like Is It My Fault? are so necessary. From its opening pages, Justin and Lindsey Holcomb offer a compassionate and biblical look at the problem of domestic violence, beginning with five words victims need to hear: It is never your fault.""No matter what kind of abuse you have experienced, there is nothing you can do, nothing you can say, nothing you think that makes you deserving of it. There is no mistake you could have made and no sin you could have committed to make you deserving of violence.""You did not deserve this. And it is never your fault.""You did not ask for this. You should not be silenced. You are not worthless. You do not have to pretend like nothing happened. You are not damaged goods, forgotten or ignored by God, or 'getting what you deserve.'” (21)These truths should be obvious, but for someone in an abusive relationship, they’re anything but. And truthfully, I’m not sure how obvious they are to some of us who aren’t, either. For example, we tend to look at marital problems and try to figure out how divide responsibility for those problems equally between spouses. And while this is certainly true in the average problems that come with marriage and relationships, we need to be careful to not apply this too broadly. Sometimes, it really is the problem just one person—and in the case of domestic violence, in whatever form it takes, it is always the abuser’s fault.Although a bit of a loose example, consider the recent shootings in Santa Barbara, California, when 22-year-old Elliott Rodger stabbed three people to death, shot three more, and left 13 more injured, before killing himself. Why did he do it? Because “girls have never been attracted to me.” What surprised me with this wasn’t Rodger’s placing the blame for his yet-to-be-committed crimes on women, but because some online commenters seemed to agree, saying that if he wasn’t a virgin, maybe this wouldn’t have happened.Yeah. Someone actually said that.Keeping this in mind is especially important when you consider how tricky it can be to develop a concrete definition of domestic violence. You need a broad enough definition that captures the full spectrum of abuse, yet doesn’t leave every reader paranoid that they’re either being abused or an abuser themselves. How is it defined in Is It My Fault?""Domestic violence is a pattern of coercive, controlling, or abusive behavior that is used by one individual to gain or maintain power and control over another individual in the context of an intimate relationship. This includes any behaviors that frighten, intimidate, terrorize, exploit, manipulate, hurt, humiliate, blame, injure, or wound an intimate partner."" (57)Despite being a little clinical, and maybe a bit lawyer-y, this definition is very strong. I believe the key word here is “pattern.” An abuser isn’t necessarily someone who says something stupid and hurtful once (again, if that were the case, we would all be abusers). An abuser is someone who makes an intentional behavior of it. This doesn’t mean that sinful and hurtful words don’t need to be dealt with (they do!); it just means we ought not label the one-time offender—depending on the nature of their offense—as being guilty of domestic violence. (There’s no such thing as being just a little stabby.)The first several chapters of the book offer extremely necessary definitions and categories that readers may lack—beyond a definition of domestic violence, they may not know what the cycle of abuse looks like, or what types of personas exist among abusers, all of which the Holcombs provide. But the strength of the book really comes through when the authors turn to the Scriptures to show readers what God says about this issue. The picture shown here is of a God who “hates abuse, viewing it as sinful and unacceptable” (107), and “delights in rescuing the oppressed (2 Sam. 22:49)” (108).This isn’t always easy for us to believe, though. After all, in our day-to-day circumstances—especially those in abusive situations—struggle to see God at work. They cry out asking for the Lord to deliver them, just as David did many times in the psalms. But it’s the tension we all face. Suffering and pain are real, but deliverance is real, too, even if it doesn’t come when or how we might wish it did. Despite how it may seem at times, “God is not standing idly by to watch evil run its course he will not allow evil to have the final word. His response to evil and violence is redemption, renewal, and recreation” (113).What I appreciate throughout the authors’ reflections on several psalms is how they hold this tension. They don’t offer a pat “God’s in control,” although that would be easy to do. They dig into the reality of the pain, the difficulty of the circumstances. But they don’t leave us there. Instead, they redirect despair to hope, showing how we can be confident that God’s deliverance will come.This, arguably, may be the most important practical takeaway for readers (aside from the very helpful action plan in the appendices). When the darkness won’t seem to lift, we need the hope that God is not ignoring our circumstances. That God is at work, even when we can’t see it. That His promises are still true—and because His promises are true, hope cannot be extinguished.Is It My Fault? will provoke some strong feelings in its readers—anger that abuse happens at all, perhaps temptations toward seeking vengeance, and a longing for Jesus’ return and the coming of the new creation. What I hope it does is remind us all that none of us can stand by when abuse occurs in our homes or in our churches. In those situations, our goal should always be to bring hope into the darkness of abuse of all kinds. To humbly, earnestly and uncompromisingly call perpetrators to repentance, and allow them to experience the consequences of their actions. To offer compassion to victims and allow them to begin to experience some form of healing, while holding out the promise of the final restoration Jesus will bring when He comes to wipe every tear from every eye. This is what victims of abuse need, and by God’s grace, it’s what we can offer, if we’re willing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KDW73CJ5QKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802410243#wasThisHelpful","R11KDW73CJ5QKN","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My niece is heading off to college this fall. This is weird for me… partly because it reminds me how far away I am from my own teens and college years. But when I think of my niece, I don’t think of an almost 18-year-old getting ready to take a first step into adulthood. I sometimes still think of her as a six-year-old wanting to play dress-up and paint on the carpet with nail polish.But it also makes me realize that I really don’t have that long before one of my kids is ready to go to college. My oldest daughter is 7, and she’ll be 17 before we know it. So how do we start preparing ourselves—and eventually her—for that big milestone?That’s much of the heart behind Alex Chediak’s new book, Preparing Your Teens for College. Written as a series of 11 conversations to have with your teen over the course of several months (or years), this book addresses everything from encouraging your child to own their faith to how to save for tuition.A few thoughts on reading this book:1. You don’t actually have to read this book in order. Although it can be beneficial to read through it from start to finish, it’s not necessary. You might want to start off simply reading the most pressing topic for you at the moment.The section I most deeply resonated with during my read through (which was one I also turned to almost immediately upon opening the book) was the conversation on financial responsibility. I went to college almost entirely on student loans. I didn’t learn how to manage money during high school, so I had virtually no savings. I came out of school with a fairly sizeable debt load, but no skills on how to manage money. So that debt grew. And grew. And grew… It took a long time for me to learn how to manage money responsibly, and this is something I want to pass on to my kids, particularly the most foundational element—who our money actually belongs to:""Your teens don’t have much money yet. Now is the time for them to start thinking about money in a way that recognizes it all belongs to God, not us, and that we’re to use it to advance his purposes. Only from this firm foundation can they learn to properly manage it."" (202)This mindset is absolutely what I want for my kids. I want them to understand that how we use money is ultimately about furthering God’s purposes in the world, not satisfying our every passing fancy. Simply, because God desires for us to be generous and wise with the money He’s provided, we need to pray earnestly and think carefully about how we give, spend and save. This is2. You don’t need to have a teen to read this book. As I’ve mentioned, I don’t have teens yet. But I have one child who is fast becoming one. And in some ways, I feel like I’m the exact target audience for this book because what Chediak repeatedly encourages us to remember is that none of these conversations are one-and-done. They should happen over a long period of time, laying a foundation and building based on your child’s age and maturity.For example, I’m not going to have a conversation with my oldest daughter about sex right now. She isn’t really ready for an in-depth discussion on the topic. But I will (and have) talk to her about the purpose of boyfriends and girlfriends, and how the purpose is to get to know the person you’re going to marry, which is why we need to think carefully about who we spend time with.This principle of building on a foundation is important for every topic discussed, from encouraging godly friendships and maintaining sexual purity, to developing godly character and teens internalizing their faith.3. You’re going to be challenged to look at your parenting. This is especially true as you consider how to help your child discover his or her gifts and abilities or whether or not your child should go to college or university at all. Many of us have bought into the notion that wanting more for our kids means making sure they’re better educated or in a more distinguished field… But sometimes this is simply our own idolatry at work. We want to live out our unfulfilled dreams through our kids, instead of nurturing the unique person God has made them to be—and let them own that:""Perhaps you’ve always thought they’d make great doctors, or you have your sights set on them taking over the family business or going into ministry. Look for fruit in their lives and hearts to see if any of that makes sense. Whatever happens, remember that they are the ones who have to live wit the consequences. So give them space to own these decisions."" (286)4. It’s very “American.” This is not going to be an issue for the majority of the readers of the book, since they’re going to be Americans. But as a Canadian, there are a few things that don’t translate. These are mostly related to some of the practical tips on saving, terms related to degrees, and the like. This is a very minor quibble since, again, the author is an American writing to a primarily American audience. But it’s a good reminder for us non-Americans to focus more on the principles provided than the particulars.Preparing Your Teens for College is one of those books that you don’t know you need to read until you read it. It’s packed with practical wisdom, sound theology, necessary challenges and much-needed encouragement for parents. Whether college is weeks or years away, you will benefit from reading this book and starting the conversations that will help your child thrive in college and beyond.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPF30US201O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414383126#wasThisHelpful","RGPF30US201O2","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Heretic” is one of those words we struggle to use well. Often times, you see it used in one of two ways—either liberally or ironically. One equates all disagreement with apostasy, the other pretends disagreement doesn’t matter at all.Both rob the word of its power.Justin Holcomb understands the seriousness of heresy and what it means to call someone a heretic—it is “a weighty charge that [is] not made lightly, nor [is] it used whenever there [is] theological inaccuracy or impression” (14).So how do we learn to use this word wisely? By knowing what heresy really is. And so, we have Holcomb’s newly released Know the Heretics. This short book introduces readers to several heresies that have threatened the church throughout history, and how the controversies surrounding each—whether it be the requirement to obey the Law, the existence of original sin, or the Trinity itself—helped shape the church as it is today.It’s tempting to pretend that ancient heresies don’t matter anymore because, well, they’re ancient. But this tendency is our chronological snobbery at work. We like to think we’re beyond the problems of the ancient world; that because we are so much more advanced, we couldn’t possibly fall prey to the same errors our spiritual forbearers did.You know what they say about those who ignore the past, right?That’s why we need a book like this one. “This book is a case study of fourteen major events when the church made the right call—not for political or status reasons… but because orthodox teaching preserved Jesus’ message in the best sense, and the new teaching distorted it,” Holcomb writes (12).These case studies confront readers with our core problem: apathy. Take Sabellianism—a form of Modalism—for example. The reason this error gained ground so easily wasn’t because it was intellectually sound or vigorously defended. It gained ground simply because we have a tendency to be apathetic. The idea of the Trinity as best we understand it from Scripture—that there is one God who exists in three persons (Father, Son, Spirit)—is one of the chief areas in which our apathy reigns.It’s not that we don’t care, though. It’s just that the idea of the Trinity is too hard for us to comprehend fully. “Compared with the idea that God is merely one, the orthodox answer might seem overly complex and philosophical, or an unnecessary later addition to the authentic Christian faith” (85).So we wind up not thinking about it too much, and use really bad analogies to describe it—often ones that themselves find their roots in Sabellianism. But, as Holcomb notes, “Trinitarian theology…takes seriously the idea that God has revealed himself in Scripture and wants to be known, and that he has revealed himself in a certain way” (85). And so, the Bible forces us to answer the question of whether or not God is one or three.Just as practically, having a sense of the Trinity better helps us respond to the claims of other religious groups, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormons, who actually view biblical Christianity as Sabellian:""Since many of the errors that these groups ascribe to mainstream Christianity are actually Sabellian in nature, it is useful to know the middle road that orthodox doctrine strikes between unity and distinction. Being able to articulate concisely what the Trinity is, how it makes the best sense of Scripture and how it affects our salvation and the worship of God can be valuable in witnessing to others as well as developing our own relationship with God."" (86)The Trinity also helps us see the power of the gospel at work—in fact, it’s safe to argue that without the Trinity, there is no atonement. Only if Christ is God as well as man could He pay for the sins of the world. Without the three persons of the Godhead agreeing from before the foundations of the world to redeem and rescue sinners, we’re left with a deficient view of the gospel that sees it as some sort of back-up plan.These are the truths we ignore at our peril.Reading Know the Heretics is equally disheartening and encouraging. It’s disheartening simply because it’s easy to see the heresies of the past still making the rounds in our day, in one form or another, as (mostly) sincere people ask sincere questions, but accept wrong answers. These lies continue to be propagated, and men and women continue to be lead astray, thinking they know God when they are in fact rejecting Him.But it’s also encouraging because, in learning more about the heretics of the past, readers gain greater insights into God’s purposes in allowing these aberrant teachings to exist—to strengthen the Church’s understanding of the truth about—and love for—God. “In order to love God, one must know who God is… right belief about God—orthodoxy—matters quite a bit” (156).• Without the Marcionites, we may never have formally developed the canon of Scripture.• Without the many heresies surrounding the nature of God and Christ, we might never have had the doctrine of the Trinity clarified.•Without the Pelagian error, we might not have as significant an understanding of the grace of God in saving sinners.In that sense—and in that sense alone—we should be thankful the events and teachings Holcomb describes, not because falsehood is praiseworthy, but because the truth about God is.Particularly valuable for those taking their first steps into studying church history, Know the Heretics offers powerful insights into the past and practical relevance for today. Read it carefully, learn from the past, and be encouraged for the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TBT2J741LW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310515076#wasThisHelpful","R17TBT2J741LW0","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our church has always been very clear on stressing the need for evangelism. Whenever our local missions pastor preaches, it almost always turns into a sermon on evangelism (especially when he’s trying not to). We have a local missions team that goes out every week to open-air preach and interact with individuals on the streets of our city, sharing the gospel at every opportunity.But then, about a year ago, we did something really bold: we took all of our small groups through a personal evangelism workshop. And the response?*crickets•I was a small group leader at the time, taking my group through the course. It was really challenging material, but presented in a way that took a lot of the fear out of evangelism. But despite its initial “failure,” the impetus behind offering this training is a good one—a desire to create a healthy culture of evangelism, one where it’s seen as a normal part of the Christian life.I have a hunch Mack Stiles would stand up and cheer if he knew this was something our church attempted (and continues to nurture). Why? Because that’s exactly what his latest book, Evangelism: How the Whole Church Speaks of Jesus, is all about.If there’s one thing Stiles wants you to understand, it’s this: evangelism is not about programs or events. It’s not a technique or a specific kind of response. Many of our problems creating a healthy culture of evangelism stem from a lack of a biblical foundation. We count declarations of faith, hands raised, cards put in a bag, people walking down aisles… but do these things really mean anything? Maybe, but maybe not.Regardless, if we’re going to see a culture of evangelism take root, “we must be very careful to conform our evangelistic practices to the Bible, because this honors God,” he writes (24).And so, he begins by defining his terms—specifically, what evangelism means.“Evangelism is teaching the gospel with the aim to persuade,” Stiles writes. “This definition, small as it is, offers a far better balance in which to weigh our evangelistic practice than looking at how many people have responded to an appeal” (26-27).""…the definition does not require an immediate outward response. Walking an aisle, raising a hand, or even praying a prayer may tell us that evangelism has happened, but such actions are not what evangelism is.""Those four elements in Stiles’ definition are key: teach, gospel, aim, persuade. Without those, you don’t really have evangelism. Our goal in evangelism is to communicate the gospel with the purpose of persuading our hearers that it is true. That doesn’t mean browbeating or extorting a profession of faith out of them. It just means speaking with conviction about the truth of the gospel.This, I think, is one of the places we all get tripped up. We tend to speak almost apologetically about the gospel, or we wring our hands, break out into a sweat, and worry about saying the wrong thing. But this is also where it’s helpful to remember something crucial: “conversion is required, but conversion is a function of genuine faith, which is given by the Spirit” (37). In other words, you’re not responsible for the result. You’re only called to be faithful and speak.So what does a healthy culture of evangelism look like? Stiles is pretty honest that it’s impossible to instruct people on everything that goes into it, but he can describe the yearnings that surround it. He breaks these down into 11 points:1. A culture motivated by love for Jesus and His gospel2. A culture that is confident in the gospel3. A culture that understands the danger of entertainment4. A culture that sees people clearly5. A culture that pulls together as one6. A culture in which people teach one another7. A culture that models evangelism8. A culture in which people who are sharing their faith are celebrated9. A culture that knows how to affirm and celebrate new life10. A culture doing ministry that feels risky and is dangerous11. A culture that understands that the church is the chosen and best method of evangelismThere’s so much that could be said about each of these, but notice how they all work together. You can’t have a culture of evangelism without any of these points. If the people attending week in and week out aren’t passionate about sharing their faith, then no amount of encouragement from the pulpit is going to change that. It’s something that builds from within the body, and something that needs to be celebrated.Simple, but not.Creating a culture of evangelism isn’t a one-and-done thing. You can’t preach a series on evangelism or offer an occasional course, pat yourself on the back and say, “nailed it.” You have to be intentional about creating and cultivating the culture you want to see, but there’s only so much control any church leader really has.Why? Because “a culture of evangelism is grassroots, not top-down.”""In a culture of evangelism, people understand that the main task of the church is to be the church.… The church should cultivate a culture of evangelism. The members are sent out from the church to do evangelism."" (65-66)Do you feel the tension there? It’s so easy to fall into the trap of trying to force the change from the top or programmatize evangelism. But it doesn’t work that way. A church only becomes more evangelistic as its members become more evangelistic. And this is big, scary stuff. Church leaders can and should model it, but the members have to own it.Thankfully, it’s a vision that I believe every faithful Christian can own. We should want this for our churches. We should want to be the kind of people who take risks in order to share the gospel with others, who understand that entertainment doesn’t equal ministry, that God truly rejoices when one lost sheep is found. This is the vision Mack Stiles presents in Evangelism. It’s what I want to see in my own life and in the lives of all the members of my church. How about you?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPI8KWRVIPPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433544652#wasThisHelpful","R3NPI8KWRVIPPK","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bible is the most important—and most controversial—books ever written. Its message of world destroyed by human sinfulness and redeemed only through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is an affront to our modern sensibilities.So it’s no wonder this book is constantly under attack, is it? For centuries, skeptics of all stripes have done their level best to debunk the Bible’s reliability. And Christian scholars in kind have written many wonderful treatises expressing why the Bible can be trusted.The problem is, most of those treatises aren’t written to the people who need them: average people coming to church on Sunday morning. For the average Christian, there aren’t a lot of good, engaging books on the reliability of Scripture. So, Kevin DeYoung decided to write one.His latest, Taking God At His Word, offers readers an easily digestible look at what the Scriptures say about themselves and why we, as Christians, can and should trust them—and more than that, why we should love the Bible.Taking God At His Word begins with its conclusion: God’s people are not to simply assent to God’s Word, they are to love it. Our approach to the Bible is not to be one of dreary subservience, but of delighted submission, something illustrated in Psalm 119′s exuberant language. And this is DeYoung’s entire purpose in writing the book.""I want all that is in Psalm 119 to be an expression of all that is in our heads and in our hearts.… I want to convince you (and make sure I’m convinced myself) that the Bible makes no mistakes, can be understood, cannot be overturned, and is the most important word in your life, the most relevant thing you can read each day. Only when we are convinced of all this can we give a full-throated “Yes! Yes! Yes!” every time we read the Bible’s longest chapter."" (16)Note how careful DeYoung is to ground this delight: we’re not to come to the Bible with a subjective emotionalism; our feelings don’t guide how we are to view the Bible. Instead, because the Bible is true, clear, essential and authoritative we can feel an immense amount of joy and gladness!But that’s easier said than done, isn’t it? After all, many of us don’t live there, or if we do, it’s not all the time. But getting there is possible—not easy, but possible. It means we have to understand what the Bible says about itself.DeYoung’s knack for taking complex ideas and making them accessible is on full display as he unpacks what the Bible says about itself. In doing so, he outlines four essential truths about Scripture:1. God’s Word is enough. The Bible is sufficient for all our needs and to grow us into maturity as believers.2. God’s Word is clear. The Bible’s message can be accurately (if not completely) understood by ordinary people using ordinary means.3. God’s Word is final. The Bible is our ultimate authority over all matters, and we are to sit under its rule.4. God’s Word is necessary. We need the Bible in order to know God and to know the way of salvation.Entire books can easily be written on each of these four subjects (and have), but DeYoung gives readers just enough to be grounded and certain in how the Scriptures speak to each of these truths. Of them all, the one we see near constant attack on is the Bible’s authority—and often this challenge is made by undermining its clarity.Take homosexuality and same-sex marriage as an example. A number of well meaning professing believers want to believe homosexual practice is not in conflict with the Christian faith, and that this is not an issue clearly spoken of in Scripture. A few of the common arguments:• Maybe Paul wasn’t referring to monogamous homosexual relationships in Romans 1 and 1 Corinthians 6; maybe he was only speaking of nonconsensual acts.• Jesus didn’t really speak on the issue, so how can we know what Jesus would say?• Perhaps there is a trajectory that is set in motion through the gospel that would mean that even though Paul said it wasn’t acceptable, it is now.Notice the common traits: each argument attempts to obscure the clarity of Scripture, either by questioning the author’s clear intent or arguing from silence. And as soon as we lose the clarity of Scripture, we lose its authority. It’s the old serpent’s trick once again: “Did God really say…?”""God’s word is final. God’s word is understandable. God’s word is necessary. God’s word is enough. In every age, Christians will do battle wherever these attributes of Scripture are threatened and assaulted. But more importantly, on every day we will have to fight the fight of faith to really believe everything we know the Bible says about itself and, even more challenging, to live accordingly."" (93)Getting to the place of delight DeYoung advocates for is hard, but it’s necessary. We will continually be challenged from without and within on whether or not this book we claim is the Word of God is what it says it is. But we have good reason for confidence—not from external evidence (although we do), but from the Bible itself. Taking God At His Word does a wonderful job of reminding readers that this book is what it says it is: the knowable, necessary, authoritative and sufficient Word of God—the only place where we may learn of the One who has come to rescue us from our sin, and of the hope He offers for tomorrow.Friends, if this is really true, how can you not delight in it?Taking God At His Word is one of the few books I want to hand out to everyone I know. It really is that helpful. Its punchy and powerful message is exactly what so many new and mature believers need, and I trust it will be a great benefit to all who read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9YCVWW5VGF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFG0EPM#wasThisHelpful","RQ9YCVWW5VGF2","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I heard Justin Wise speak on social media I was impressed.It was the first session—actually the pre-conference workshop—at a conference for Christian creatives in Canada. Wise was speaking on how churches need to embrace their websites as their new front-door. And as he laid everything out, with tons of practical examples, I had two reactions:People really need to listen to this guyThis is going to be really hard for some folks to swallowMany of the people occupying the leadership roles in churches, non-profits, and for-profit entities are digital immigrants. They remember a time without Wi-Fi, Netflix, and Facebook. Many of them use social media, but struggle to understand how to do it. Others don’t bother with it at all, seeing it as a distraction, a fad, or a time-suck that gets in the way of getting real work/ministry done.But, Wise argues, digital communication is not a good thing for a church to engage in—it’s necessary if they’re actually serious about reaching people with the gospel. And that’s really the heart behind his book, The Social Church: A Theology of Digital Communication, where Wise unpacks the “why” of social media, with a bit of how sprinkled in along the way.If you could boil the why down to one thing, it’s really this: Churches need to be engaging social media—blogs, Facebook, Twitter, whatever the next thing is that’s going to take the world by storm—not because it’s hip and trendy, but because it’s about mission and ministry. Where people are, Christians must be as well. But the difference, and maybe the most challenging aspect of it, is that mission and ministry in social media requires two-way communication.“For many, many years, churches communicated in the same fashion you and I drive down a one-way street: traffic only moved one way,” Wise explains. “Churches broadcasted a message and never anticipated a moment where the congregation would start speaking back.”""But social media has changed this dynamic.…For the church, and virtually every other sector of society, the shift to social permanently turned the tables in the public’s favor. Social media gave people a voice, and they’re not going to give it up easily."" (30)This is the challenge many of us have when engaging social media. Because the expectation is two-way communication, you actually have to engage people. You have to talk to them when they talk back and share content that’s not all about you. And this is also where so many organizations—including some of the world’s biggest brands—fall on their faces. So if you’ve just realized that you’re doing the digital equivalent of shouting into an empty room, take heart: you’re not alone and you can change this.But in order to do it, you have to know the values of a social media culture, what it likes and dislikes. What it thinks, how it feels… This is, essentially, the “nasty” business of contextualization, becoming all things to all people so that some might be saved. And even as we seek to understand—or humbly admit we can’t make the leap ourselves and bring in people to help us—we find more opportunities to push back.Even as “online” and “offline” become increasingly blurred, we’re going to find ourselves having to confront the tendency to hide in the digital realm with more force. Humans were not meant to hide behind screens and smartphones (and yes, I understand the irony of me even saying this in a digital medium). Real relationships can form and be nurtured online, but the best kinds of relationships form in the real life.""I suppose the inherent danger of online communities is when there is a mistaken belief they can serve as a one-for-one replacement for in-person communities. They can’t (and shouldn’t). Offline trumps online. Having said that, online community is definitely preferable to no community whatsoever. Lives have been changed, saved, and redeemed all because gospel-centered online communities exist."" (155)You can see the tension here, can’t you? I think Wise is certainly correct that “digital community is better than no community” to some degree, but the fact that this also points us to a legitimate issue in our context: that even as we develop a sound theology of digital communication, we must develop a robust eccesiology to compliment it. This is the difficulty many of us have with idea of online services—while streaming the service can certainly beneficial, how do we challenge people to engage in reality?Years ago, I was part of an active hobby-focused online community. People would talk about the primary subject (comics), but would also delve into all kinds of other topics, including sharing deeply personal details about their lives (not in a TMI kind of way. Usually). Folks would meet at conventions for drinks. Users who lived in the same cities would get together every once in a while for a meal if the suggestion was tabled… But in the end, when someone stopped visiting the site, it was like they never existed. In an instant, those relationships were severed. The connections weren’t really all that deep.This is the challenge we face when we deal with the implications of online ministry. How do we build real connections that aren’t easy to sever? This is something Wise doesn’t thoroughly address in the book because, honestly, I don’t know if he or anyone else is equipped to put forward an answer. But make no mistake: if we’re serious about being gospel-minded, gospel-centered people who want to engage the digital realm for mission and ministry, this elephant in the room must be named and addressed.The Social Church is not the last word on social media and the church, nor should it be. Instead, it’s best to see this book as the continuation (or possibly the beginning) of of a conversation we’re not quite ready for: a much deeper discussion on how to do ministry in a simultaneously bigger and smaller world.

"Some time ago, an excellent article appeared online reminding us that “pixels are people.” Behind every podcast, blog, and book we consume, there is a living, breathing human being made in the image and likeness of God.Including those with whom we disagree.Perhaps nowhere is this point easier to forget than in the origins debate. For some, this is a clear dividing line—if you subscribe to evolution in any form, you’re selling out the gospel. Others would rather stick their fingers in their ears and run away than engage the conversation. The debate gets too heated too quickly, and, when we’re not careful, people get burned.This is what happened to Tim Stafford’s son, Silas. “Silas got burned by the fight over Genesis,” he writes in his latest book, The Adam Quest. Silas loved geology and chose to major in it in college, but his love for this scientific field began to cause friction with friends who insisted the earth is young.""If Silas wanted to be a serious Christian, he had to get out of geology. Whatever geologists believed about the age of the earth was completely wrong. . . . They could not let the subject alone. I imagine that they felt they were courageous Christians, speaking up for scriptural truth and refusing to let a friend go down the path of ungodliness. In practice, though, they drove Silas away from faith."" (2)Silas is by no means alone; many—on both side of the debate—have felt alienated from Christian fellowship over this matter. Their love of science and their faith seem at odds, and they’re unsure how to reconcile the two. But Stafford, senior writer for Christianity Today, wants to show them that science and sincere faith aren’t diametrically opposed. And he does so by humanizing the debate—introducing readers to 11 scientists, each of whom professes faith in Christ, and each of whom holds differing views on origins.This approach—which is the most compelling reason to read The Adam Quest—will surely frustrate many of its readers, even as it elates others. As long as a position remains an abstract concept, it’s easy to ignore the “human” factor. That is, we can quickly forget that our rhetoric in debating various views really does affect people. Like Silas’s friends, we don’t notice the effect of our words. We’re too busy trying to win an argument to realize we’re losing the person.But humanizing doesn’t just remind us of the people affected; it rounds out the perspectives on each view. Although Kurt Wise, Todd Wood, and Georgia Purdom espouse young earth creationism, by reading each’s story you begin to see their nuances to the position. You realize it’s built on something more than a literalistic approach to Scripture. These are not foolish, naïve men and women. They are extremely thoughtful, winsome, intelligent, and most importantly, humble. Nowhere does this characteristic shine more clearly than in Stafford’s profile of Wood:""Ending the war will involve repentance on all sides, [Wood] thinks. 'I can’t make somebody else repent of what he is doing wrong. I can only repent of what I am doing wrong. If I do that publicly enough, maybe I will inspire others. The quest stops being about saving the church and exposing heresy. It starts being about serving the Creator, which is what it was always supposed to be.' (45)Conversely, one can’t help but notice more than a hint of triumphalism in the attitudes of the advocates of intelligent design (ID), particularly Michael Behe. “I’m very optimistic ID will prevail. . . . Biology is getting more complex, not less, to levels we didn’t even know about when I wrote Darwin’s Black Box. Darwinism is toast, clearly.” (84) But where Behe is confident, ID proponent Fazale Rana’s optimism is far more tempered. “I don’t know that the ID community has ever really delivered on [a viable model].” Because many ID proponents prematurely went on the offensive, though, the scientific community reacted violently. “If they had kept the discussion at the academic level, it might be different” (101).And then there are the adherents to what Stafford calls “evolutionary creationism,” or more traditionally, theistic evolution. Again, much like the young earth creationists, these scientists profiled by Stafford speak with humility. A kind of wide-eyed excitement comes through in much of what they’re saying. Like their opposite numbers, they rightly marvel at the complexity of the world God has made, and they joyfully see scientific discovery as a means of discovering more about it.But what’s striking—and perhaps troubling—is how evolutionary creationists tend to approach the Bible. Mary Schweitzer, for example, whose claim to fame is discovering red blood cells in fossils (and whose work is regularly used in attempts to debunk evolution, much to her consternation), prefers to “let God be God,” believing there’s room in the Bible for an old Earth and a world populated by dinosaurs (115).Moreover, Darrell Falk, author of Coming to Peace with Science, states: “The sudden creation view is not compatible with scientific data. . . . It is contrary to almost all of science . . . it is something different, namely a particular view of Scripture. It is religion” (131). Falk can be read as having an almost subjective view of truth when it comes to Scripture. Because we’re not all going to agree, we should agree to disagree for the good of the church:""We must be patient with each other and allow each other to follow truth as we see it in Scripture. . . . When there is division in the church it will be difficult for the thirsty to find their way to Jesus."" (136)This point exposes the most significant problem with evolutionary creationism as a whole—the Bible. By requiring pain and death in the beginning, evolution tells a different story of the world than the Bible does. And only recently have “evolutionary creationists . . . begun to take this challenge with full seriousness” (205). Whether their alternative readings of Genesis merit serious consideration is another matter.Stafford firmly believes in the authority of Scripture, but he isn’t convinced the young earth creationist (YEC) view is the right one. If he had nothing else to go on, he says, he “would accept a YEC interpretation of Genesis” (206). Instead, he believes evolutionary creationism offers the greatest opportunity to bridge the gap and effectively end the culture war between faith and science—if it can begin taking the Bible seriously enough.But again, the problem is the Bible itself. The fact that scholars are devising alternate readings reveals the problem, to say nothing of the implications of such reinterpretations. It’s helpful for us to remember that no portion of Scripture exists in a vacuum. Each is part of a larger whole. When you begin to consider how much of the Bible lays its foundation on Genesis 1–3—the absolute sovereignty of God over all creation; marriage as one man and one woman; our rhythm of work and rest; the gospel itself—Christians are rightly skeptical of approaches that risk undermining essential truths.Which takes us back to the beginning of this review. The Adam Quest will not change anyone’s mind on how the earth and everything in it came to be. But it’s not meant to accomplish that goal. Instead, we need to consider the human factor in the argument. We are going to disagree with one another on origins. But by remembering our views on this matter don’t exist in abstract—behind them are flesh-and-blood image bearers—we’re far more likely to pursue earnest debate in a spirit of humility, seeking to win the person, not simply the argument. And if you take away nothing else away from The Adam Quest, I’m fairly certain its author—and maybe his son—will be thrilled.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFVQPGRUZ15B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205646#wasThisHelpful","REFVQPGRUZ15B","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s still remember the intensity of Zack’s confronting Jessie about her popping caffeine pills,1 or the time he got drunk at a party and totalled his dad’s car. The “very special episode” of our favorite sitcoms always served to drive home a moral lesson that would have made most later Star Trek writers cringe.Strangely, this is what we seem to do with the parables of Jesus:• We look at the parable of the good Samaritan and we see a moral impetus to love our neighbors…• We read the parable of the foolish builder and are told to always be sure to “count the cost” of our choices…• We hear the parable of the wise and foolish stewards and are reminded to use our gifts wisely……but if this is all we’re getting out of Jesus’ parables, we may need to look a little harder.“When these oft-repeated stories from Jesus strike us as sweet, heartwarming, or inspiring in the sentimental sense rather than the Spiritual sense, we can be sure we’ve misread them,” Jared Wilson writes in his latest, The Storytelling God:""A generation of churchgoers grew up hearing the parables taught more along the lines of moralistic fables—illustrations of how to do the right things God would have us do. And they are that. But they are more than that. Some of these narratives are only a few lines long, but every parable, long or short, is fathoms deep and designed to drive us to Jesus in awe, need, faith, and worship. When we treat them as “inspiring tales,” we make superficially insipid what ought to be Spiritually incisive.""Wilson’s point throughout this book is simple: the parables are not the “very special episodes” of Jesus’ teaching ministry—instead, they are tales designed see the glory of Jesus.Our difficulty, though, begins as one of definitions—what is a parable, exactly? In a nutshell, Wilson suggests that rather than simply seeing as short stories or sketches, we should understand Jesus’ parables as “wisdom scenes,” illustrations running alongside their points and meant to “reveal them in rather immediate ways.”Viewing the parables in this way allows us to embrace the multi-faceted approach Jesus often took in telling them, while at the same time forcing us to let go of our tendency to moralize them (or even relegate them to mere illustrations). Ultimately, this view drives home the purpose of the parables, which is to give us glimpses into what the kingdom of God (and God’s reign) looks like. And what that looks like is, for many, something wholly offensive.The most offensive aspect of Jesus’ parables is that, again and again, they point to Himself as the point of the story. He doesn’t simply tell the story of the Good Samaritan for us to “go and do likewise” (although this is certainly a necessary application), but to reveal to us how He is the true Good Samaritan who comes to the aid of His enemies at the cost of His own life. He tells us the parable of the prodigal son so that we might recognize the Father in the father, whose extravagant (or seemingly reckless) generosity in restoring His sons cannot be matched. He tells us of the man who sold all he had to purchase a field where he’d found a treasure because He is the treasure worth sacrificing all for.In fact, as Wilson convincingly argues, Jesus Himself can be seen as a living parable—""He is a living parable because he is the inscrutable, eternal, ineffable God become a man, dwelling among men, tempted like men, sacrificed for men. As the parables contain the Spiritual power of awakening or deadening within stories of the human experience, Christ is the Spirit-conceived power of God undergoing the human experience.""Read that again. It makes sense, doesn’t it? At a minimum, it certainly fits with the tenor of Scripture, feeling right at home with the constant call to turn away from ourselves. It attacks our tendency (or desire) to view these stories as being about us and what we do, reorienting us to their true purpose—not to provide a moral imperative (although one can easily see those in the parables), but to point us to the Storyteller.“Blessed are those who hear him and believe,” Wilson writes. “Condemned are those who are offended by him and disbelieve.”If The Storytelling God succeeds at anything, it’s putting to death the parables as “very special episodes” mindset. And this is exactly what we all need to get out of our heads. We can do more all we want, trying to earn our way into the Father’s good books—but it’s not going to earn us the brownie points we’re hoping to get. What Jesus offers us in the parables is so much more valuable than “do more betterer”—He offers us the better He’s done for us in His life, death and resurrection.He is the treasure we seek. He is the pearl of great price. He is the Shepherd who searches for His sheep and brings them home. Why would we want to settle for anything else?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GJV274DEV8FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433536684#wasThisHelpful","R2GJV274DEV8FH","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a year ago, I bought a new laptop, and the first time I turned it on it was magical. Well, maybe not, but it was pretty slick. It went super-fast, did everything I needed it to do… Then, a few months later, my new work computer arrived. And I started feeling a little bit of regret over my personal one. The “shininess” of my computer had worn off and it seemed kind of, well, average. It wasn’t nearly as rad in my eyes as it had been when I opened the box for the first time.I wonder if some of us see the Easter story that way. We’ve heard so many sermons on it—or preached so many—that it seems like we’re going through the motions. We say, “yay, Jesus is alive,” but really we’re thinking “alright, and now to run some errands!” This should never be. Woe to us who can look upon the death and resurrection of Jesus and say, “meh.”Thabiti Anyabwile is a man who has not lost his sense of wonder at the cross. He knows that beholding the glory of Jesus is something none of us can do without. This is the heart behind his latest book, Captivated: Beholding the Mystery of Jesus’ Death and Resurrection.In its five chapters (which originated as sermons preached at First Baptist Church, Grand Cayman) Anyabwile invites us to behold the wonder of the cross as he examines several key passages of Scripture:Jesus’ prayer in the garden (Matthew 26:42);Jesus’ cry from the cross (Matthew 27:42);Paul’s rejoicing over death’s impotence in the face of Christ’s victory (1 Cor. 15:50-58);The angels’ matter-of-fact questioning of the disciples at the empty tomb (Luke 24:5); andCleopas’ gentle rebuke to his new travelling companion along the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:18)Almost all of us at some point have asked the question, “is there no other way?” When we look at the cross, and all the events that lead up to it, we can’t help but wonder if God could have done things differently. If you’ve ever asked the question, fear not: you’re in good company. Jesus asked the same one as he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane.“My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.… if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” (Matthew 26:39, 42)Here is the Lord Jesus—the One who was with God and was God from eternity past—asking if He had to go to the cross. Jesus wanted the cup to pass. But more importantly, He wanted the Father’s will to be done. So, could it pass from Him? No. And this is such good news, Anyabwile reminds us. In fact, we should be glad the Father said no. He writes:""Because the Father answered no, sinners have a merciful and faithful High Priest perfectly intimate with all their weaknesses. We have One we can approach for grace. Because the Father answered no, we have One who stands between us in all our ungodliness and God in all His holiness to reconcile us and reunite us as friends rather than rebels. Because the Father answered no, those who have faith in Christ need never fear the Father’s wrath again; His anger has been fully satisfied in the Son’s atonement. Because the Father said no, we stand assured that our acceptance with God happened on completely legitimate grounds—no parlor tricks, no loopholes, no legal fiction, no injustice to threaten or question the exchange of our sin for Jesus’ righteousness. Because the Father said no, we will forever enjoy and share the glory of Father and Son in the unending, timeless age to come. I am so glad the Father said no.""Do you see the good news here? Anyabwile doesn’t resort to cheap parlor tricks or emotional platitudes to whoop readers up. Instead, he presents the gospel in all its glory. Over and over again, on page after page, the gospel shines through. And as you read the book, you can’t help but be caught up by its sermonic rhythm (appropriate, since it began as sermons). This makes for a captivating and fast-paced read—to some degree, almost a too fast one!Indeed, that might be my only complaint about this book. Because it’s a series of gospel meditations, readers should not expect an in-depth treatise on any of the texts examined, which would work against Anyabwile’s purposes anyway. But this is not to say that deeper examination and application isn’t encouraged—it’s just left in your hands, thanks to the book’s reflection questions (which you really need to use—they add so much to the reading experience!).Because we’re constantly inundated with “new,” we risk becoming a people who fail to take the time to enjoy what really matters. The gospel should never be something we move past, or shrug our shoulders at. This just won’t do. Whether you’ve struggled with familiarity or you’re consistently amazed at the cross, Captivated is a book that will be a great blessing to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D16W8K85ROH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I54CXYY#wasThisHelpful","R1D16W8K85ROH","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know what I’m really thankful for? That there are people starting to write on the relationship between the gospel and work. This is a subject in which western Christians desperately need to grow in our understanding. Many of us, me included, really struggle to do our work in a Christ exalting fashion. Many of us grumble and complain, and generally struggle to be satisfied in what we’re doing or even see the value in our jobs.Unless it’s just me who’s guilty of some of these?Sebastian Traeger and Greg Gilbert tackle this head-on in their new book, The Gospel at Work. Their goal in the book is simple: to help us see how working for Jesus gives meaning and purpose to all of our work, to recognize that “when glorifying Jesus is our primary motivation, our work — regardless of what that work is in its particulars — becomes an act of worship.”Traeger and Gilbert approach the subject from a different angle than, say, Tim Keller does in his excellent Every Good Endeavor (reviewed here). While one could argue that this is a matter of semantics, the authors are less concerned about delivering a fleshed-out theology of work, as opposed to digging into the practical issues related to how we look at work. In doing so, they spend the bulk of their time examining the twin errors of idolatry and idleness in work.“Our jobs become idols when we overidentify with them,” they write. “Our work becomes the primary consumer of our time, our attention, and our passions, as well as the primary means for measuring our happiness and our dissatisfaction in life.” The key word here is “primary.”When we give our all to the company at the expense of our families, when our minds are consumed by thoughts of work consistently, when we’re always looking at how we can position ourselves, or even when we see our work as being all about making a difference in the world… This is dangerous stuff, friends.When work is “primary,” everything else is secondary, and we’ll always be dissatisfied. There’s always a next step, always another rung on the ladder, always a new challenge to overcome… but it will never be enough.But idolatry in work is only one problem. The other is idleness. This, I believe, is the fundamental problem of many in my own generation. Where our parents’ and grandparents’ generation idolized work, we tend to treat it as a necessary evil. We “work to live”—treating it as something we have to do in order to do the things we want to do (again, unless it’s just me). So we don’t care about quality, we’re unreasonably frustrated by it, we segregate our jobs from our faith… Again, this is dangerous ground. Traeger and Gilbert write:""Being idle does not necessarily mean inactivity — a lack of productivity. It can be an inactivity of the heart, an inability or unwillingness to see or embrace God’s purposes in the work he’s given you to do.""I said I believe my generation tends to lean towards idleness in work. This is true. But many of us—including me—tend to flip-flop between idolatry and idleness. I know there are many times when I’m entirely too consumed with the goings-on in my workplace. When I see things that bother me, they tend to weigh heavily… but my solution at times is to escape into idleness. To try and check out to escape my frustrations (whether they’re warranted ones or not is an entirely different matter).What’s especially helpful for me is being reminding of this truth: “Ultimately you are in your job so you learn to love God and other people better. This is your new assignment.” Honestly, I’m working out a lot of the implications of this right now, a couple weeks after reading the book. But what I find helpful about it is it forces me to constantly confront my attitude and behavior.Am I upset about the right things?Am I spending time thinking about things that I don’t need to?Am I phoning in my work, instead of giving my all—even on projects I don’t particularly enjoy?Am I more concerned about accolades from coworkers than being satisfied with Christ’s?Clearly, The Gospel at Work gave me a great deal to consider on these matters. Not that I have a lot of answers, but I’m starting to work these things out.When we see what we do as an opportunity to learn to love the Lord and others with greater affection and Christlikeness, we can recognize that our workplaces are a mission field—even those of us who work in organizations operated by Christians. Those outside the bubble, have the opportunity to be respectfully bold witnesses for Christ among unbelieving colleagues, acting as people of integrity, building relationships, and (you knew this was coming) telling people about Jesus.Those inside the bubble are not off the hook either. We still have to show our love for Christ in what we do, and going to work at a place where everyone professes to believe in Jesus doesn’t cover that. It actually raises the stakes. In that environment, it reveals far more about the state of your heart to people who (at least in theory) have the same expectations you do, who know that work is a good and God-honoring thing. That your coworkers are people with dignity and value because they’ve been saved by Jesus for His purposes. But it’s a place where idleness so easily sets in, and a compromised witness quickly follows.The Gospel at Work may not be a theology of work proper, but make no mistake: it is as intensely theological as it is practical. Idleness and idolatry in work are theological problems and they’ve got serious practical implications. One makes work a burden, the other makes you work’s slave. But the gospel frees us from both idleness and idolatry. This book is a wonderful reminder of this, one I trust will be a great blessing to you as you read and apply it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BD36RPBRZ54V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310513979#wasThisHelpful","R2BD36RPBRZ54V","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ministry, it's easy to think of certain gifts as being more valuable than others. We look at one man's ability to handle the Scriptures and applaud. We look at another's ability to manage an organization and... well, often times we're not quite sure what to do. It's not that we don't appreciate those abilities. It's just we have a hard time thinking of them as having a purpose in ministry. And as a result, some Christians who want to use their gifts to bless their churches are left in a lurch.Invest: Your Gifts for His Mission by Sutton Turner is written for people like this. People with serious business skills and a heart for the church, but struggle to see how their gifts can be used to benefit the body. Turner uses his experience as the current executive pastor of Mars Hill Church to help business-minded believers see how they can work for the glory of God, perhaps by considering taking on the role of an executive pastor.A good reminder of the need for business savvy:The best thing about Invest is the refreshing reminder of the need for business savvy in ministry. ""Ministry"" should not be code for sloppy planning and procedures. But this is pretty common, sadly. Many who gravitate toward ministry roles tend to be people who want to spiritually guide people, but aren't particularly savvy with administration or business practices. It my never occur to them to think about things like licensing for the songs we sing on Sundays, or the tax regulations that need to be followed in order to maintain charitable status.So churches and parachurch ministries alike can greatly benefit from believers who are skilled and passionate about such things. People who care about what the organizational structure looks like and whether or not it actually works in practice, and who care about staff culture and dynamics. We need to be concerned about these things, and, thankfully, God has gifted certain individuals to be deeply passionate about them.While I appreciate the general premise of the book, there's a great deal about it I'm concerned about:An unnecessarily defensive tone:From the very beginning, Invest takes a defensive posture, most noticeably in Mark Driscoll's foreword, where he writes: ""Dear Bible Guy, please don't be yet another nerd who proof texts verses on lovers of money, lording it over like the Gentiles with curse words like `pragmatism' and 'it's all about the numbers' criticisms.""Now, I get that there are (allegedly) some who see any sort of focus on improving systems and structures as inherently ungodly, but I have to wonder: what's being accomplished by this approach?I want to think otherwise, but here's where the cynic in me goes: because Invest reeks of the ""big = better = blessed"" ideal that so dominates western thinking (more on that in a minute), it may be they're trying to get out in front of the potential criticism and turn it back around on the critics themselves. So, rather than the problem being a mindset within many mega churches in general or Mars Hill in particular, it's a problem with the reader who thinks all is not right in Seattle.A weak theology of work and ministry:A second concern is the theology of work and ministry described in the book, particularly as Turner differentiates between a ""job"" and ""ministry."" Consider his distinctions:""* If you want praise and recognition for what you do, it's a job. If no one else besides Jesus needs to commend your work, it's ministry.""* If you do the job as long as it does not cut into other things (such as hobbies, family activities, etc.), it's a job. If you are willing to make sacrifices in your personal schedule, it's ministry.""* If you compare your lot with others who have more free time, more money, and more possessions, it's a job. If you pray for others rather than compete with them, it's ministry.""* If it bothers you when the phone rings on evenings and weekends, it's a job. If you see random calls at odd hours as opportunities to serve with joy, it's ministry.""* If you want to quit because the work is too hard, the pressure is too great, or your performance is criticized, it's a job. If you stick it out--until Jesus clearly tells you that it's time to move on--it's ministry.""* If you use the church as a stepping-stone, a payday, or a gold star on your résumé, it's a job. If you're working for the church because you love Jesus and you want more people to meet him, get saved, and be transformed, then it's ministry.""There's definitely some truth to these examples. Turner is correct that both the ""work to live"" and ""live to work"" mindsets, or what another set of authors describe as idleness and idolatry in work, are unhealthy. The problem, of course, is the distinction between ""job"" and ""ministry"" is actually a false one. Vocational ministry roles are jobs, and we're kidding ourselves if we think differently.  Non-ministry jobs intrude on our personal lives all the time. So do ministry ones.It's a silly distinction, one which elevates a kind of work as being more important than others. This is ironic since Turner is trying to advocate for the importance of these non-traditional type ministry roles. You also need to be very careful as this is the kind of thinking that's lead so many men to sacrifice their families on the altar of ministry. They bought into the lie that if you take care of the ministry, God will take care of your family--a lie that destroyed both their ministries and their families.So yeah, do see what you do as a blessing; in fact, we should see every job as ministry. But don't create silly distinctions that God does not.A flawed view of fruitfulness:Invest seems to frequently elevate the mega-church as the ideal, rather than appreciate the small church. In speaking of his friend (and fellow Mars Hill pastor) Dave Bruskas' experiences as a pastor, Turner writes:""In Pastor Dave's case, everyone in the congregation was directly connected to him, and when he maxed out so did the church. Between the relational demands, the responsibilities of running church operations, and the pressure to compose a sermon every week, Pastor Dave did not have the capacity to create the systems and structure necessary to organize the work and, more importantly, develop leaders to share the load.""Again, there's some truth in this. Regardless of the size of the church, pastors need to be investing in leaders. They need to be working to keep the organization running as best as they can. But the stated assumption undergirding the example is that because Bruskas could himself only maintain about 150 relationships. Because Bruskas was maxed, the church maxed out, too.Now, here's my question: why do we assume a church should always be expanding numerically? Where do we see fruitful = big numbers in the Bible? Nowhere.And yet, this thinking plays into so much of what we see in Turner's description of his role as Driscoll's Executive Pastor. He describes the strategies currently at work within Mars Hill Church, from planting more satellite locations (rather than autonomous churches) to shaping Driscoll's public persona (I don't even know what to say about this), and it all comes back to the same thing: building a bigger Mars Hill.But no matter how many times we're told big does not mean better and does not mean blessed of God.So should you read Invest? There are going to be nuggets that readers will find beneficial, for sure. But honestly, unless you're looking to see how the mechanics of Mars Hill work and replicate that, you'll probably want to pass on this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNAWTG0WE9OG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDOBR9Y#wasThisHelpful","RNAWTG0WE9OG7","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Romans: it’s one of the most intimidating, confusing, and powerful books in the entirety of Scripture. In its 16 chapters, the apostle Paul casts a sweeping vision God’s redemptive purposes—”how God in the gospel makes sinners righteous, but also how this most precious gift of God is enjoyed in our lives,” writes Tim Keller in Romans 1-7 For You, “how it produces deep and massive changes in our behavior and even in our character.”In his typical irenic fashion, Keller unpacks the message of the first seven chapters of Romans, helping us see the beauty of the gospel and our desperate need for it.One of the most challenging issues we face reading Romans—and indeed, all of Scripture—is Paul’s emphatic decree that all of humanity is lost in when confronted by the justice of God.That we are all, “without excuse,” with no hope to be found in moralism or pleas of ignorance. “For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Paul wrote in Romans 3:22-23Open in Logos Bible Software (if available). But he doesn’t leave us without hope. For while all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God, all who are saved “are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 3:24Open in Logos Bible Software (if available)). Moralism doesn’t justify, nor does ignorance. Instead, it is only God’s grace, the gift of redemption found in Jesus. And this is such good news for all of us:God does not set his justice aside; he turns it onto himself. The cross does not represent a compromise between God’s wrath and his love; it does not satisfy each halfway. Rather, it satisfies each fully and in the very same action. On the cross, the wrath and love of God were both vindicated, both demonstrated, and both expressed perfectly. They both shine out, and are utterly fulfilled. The cross is a demonstration both of God’s justice, and of his justifying love (Romans 3:25-26Open in Logos Bible Software (if available)).Although all of Keller’s examination of Romans 1-7 is sound and edifying, perhaps no portion was more helpful to me personally than reading his view of the “wretched man” of Romans 7:7-25Open in Logos Bible Software (if available). Paul’s exposition of the effects of sin, the desire to do what is right, but being confounded by sin, has left many scratching their heads. Was he talking about Paul the unbeliever or Paul the believer?Keller believes—and I would be inclined to agree—that Paul was writing of his then-present experience as a Christian, and the conflicting desires we all wrestle with. He writes:""We have, in some sense, “multiple selves.” Sometimes we want to be this; sometimes we want to be that. Morally, most people feel “torn” between diverse selves as well. Freud went so far as to talk about an inner “libido” (filled with primal desires) and a “superego” (the conscience filled with social and familial standards). The great question we all face is: I have divergent desires, different “selves.” Which is my true self? What do I most want?""This is helpful for so many reasons (and not simply because of confirmation bias). The point of Paul’s writing about these truths, that he continued to struggle with sin—and if anything, as he grew older, became increasingly aware of his own sinfulness—is to push us toward deeper dependence upon the Lord Jesus.We are not justified and then left to our own devices to grow in holiness. If, to borrow an analogy, the gospel merely reset our righteousness back to zero, instead of giving us Christ’s, we’d still be damned. We do not do the things we want to do, and we do the things we don’t want to do. Paul’s point is simple, Keller says: “The unbeliever cannot keep the law (v 7-13); but neither can the believer!”""When we read God’s law properly, and when we look at our own lives honestly, we can only conclude that we are “wretched.” Without accepting this, we will never grasp the glory of the gospel. We will never truly appreciate the gospel of received righteousness. Only if our hearts truly cry at our wretchedness can we then know the hope and liberation of looking away from ourselves and to what God has done. Who will rescue Paul, and us? “Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (v 25).""Like the other volumes in the For You series, Romans 1-7 For You is not an exhaustive study of Paul’s epistle, nor is it intended to be. As I described the recently released Judges For You, this is a devotional commentary. Use it like one.Allow Keller’s insights in Romans 1-7 For You to inform your study. Glean helpful insights and illustrations to use in sermons or small group studies. But even as you do, read it with the good of your soul in mind, recognizing afresh all Christ has done on your behalf, and grasping anew the glory of the gospel in Romans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFWY15RGYXWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908762918#wasThisHelpful","R1LFWY15RGYXWF","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some books of the Bible are incredibly inspiring... others are downright disturbing. Judges definitely the latter. It's a painfully honest look at the fruit of spiritual decline and the depths of human depravity. This isn't a book you read to get a warm-fuzzy or for moral examples.Instead, writes Tim Keller, Judges reminds us that the Bible ""is about a God of mercy and long-suffering, who continually works in and through us despite our constant resistance to his purposes."" No human hero can rescue us--we need a divine one.That's what Judges For You is all about.In this book, Keller walks readers through this Old Testament book, tracing six key themes:1. God relentlessly offers his grace to people who do not deserve it, seek it, or even appreciate it after they've been saved by it.2. God wants lordship over every area of our lives, not just some.3. There is a tension between grace and law, between conditionality and unconditionality.4. There is a need for continual spiritual renewal in our lives here on earth, and a way to make that a reality.5. We need a true Savior, to which all human saviors point, through their flaws and strengths.6. God is in charge, no matter what it looks like.As we read through Judges, it's easy to see each of these themes at play in their half-hearted (at best!) following of the Lord. From the beginning, the Israelites failed to purge the Promised Land of idols, compromising their prosperity in the land--and most importantly, their commitment to the Lord. From there the cycle begins:The nation slips into idolatry, doing evil in the sight of the Lord. Angered by their sin, the Lord hands them over to their enemies, who oppress them. The people call out for rescue, and the Lord brings salvation through a chosen leader and peace is restored to the land... at least until the judge dies.The thorns dug deeper and deeper; the snares pulled Israel more and more tightly,"" Keller writes. ""The rebellion becomes worse, the oppression heavier, the repentance less heartfelt, the judges themselves more flawed, and the salvation and 'revivals they bring weaker.'... It is a reminder, of course, that we need something better than a human judge; something more permanent than a leader who dies; something that can deliver the soul, as well as the body.""This is arguably the most important point Keller makes in Judges For You, and it's one he comes back to again and again through the book as he guides readers through the stories of each increasingly flawed judge of Israel.This is best illustrated in his take two of the later judges, Gideon and Samson (two whom he devotes a considerable amount of space).Gideon in particular is one person I really struggle to know what to do with. On the one hand, he's listed as an example of faith in Hebrews 11, yet the end of his life hardly can be called an example of a faithful man. So what's the deal?The incident with the fleece is one of the things that's always bothered me about Gideon. It seems like in his two-fold request he's testing the Lord, asking for little signs and signals. But is he? Keller says no. ""Gideon... was asking for supernatural revelation from God to show him who he really is."" He continues:""This therefore is not about how to make a decision. This is about how we need to ask God to give us a big picture of who he is. Living in the period of history we do, we have the advantage over Gideon of knowing Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as he reveals himself in his word: ""In the past [including the time of Gideon] God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son"" (Hebrews 1:1-2).""Maybe I'm easy to please, but this is the first satisfying explanation of Gideon's actions I've read thus far (and I say this as someone who's leaned closer to viewing his actions as sinful testing). Gideon, Keller says, was asking ""for help to build up his faith.""When we, like Gideon, find ourselves doubting God's promises, or God's presence, we can ask him to point us again to his Son, saying: ""I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"" (Mark 9:24). This is what Gideon needed, and received. God will do the same for us.Nevertheless, as we see God rescue his wayward people through Gideon and turn him into the mighty warrior he declared him to be in Judges 6, we see a change in Gideon. He gradually becomes confident--and then overconfident. Pride takes root, as Keller points out in Gideon's responses to Ephraim's snubbing of his leadership and to Succoth and Peniel's refusal to help him in pursuing the Midianites. Against Ephraim he holds his tongue, but against Succoth and Peniel, he promises destruction.""This reveals that Gideon's diplomacy regarding Ephraim was not because he did not want to strike at them, but because he could not. And it reveals that, despite God making sure that the victory was so miraculous that everyone should have seen that it was given by God, not earned by Gideon, Gideon himself has forgotten ""the lesson of the 300."" He feels that he ought to receive admiration and honor for what he has done.""In other words, success destroyed him. And it only got worse as he set himself up as king over Israel (in practice, even if not in title). He took for himself multiple wives, made for himself an ephod (a priestly garment) had over 70 children, and even went so far as to name one Abimelech--""son of the king""!Yet Gideon, in his strengths and weaknesses, points us to Jesus. In his (positive) weakness, we see our dependency on Christ to build our faith. In his (negative) confidence, we see the humility of Christ--the King who had every right to demand service, but instead served.Ideal for personal and small group study, as well as an excellent aid in sermon preparation, Judges For You might best be called a devotional commentary. Through Keller's examination of the text and through the reader's personal study, he wants us to see the glory of Christ in and through Judges. To see our need for Him and to grow in our desire to worship and obey Him. It's hard not to walk away from the book seeing all of these things. Get this book and read carefully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QMV4FW0X0A9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=190876290X#wasThisHelpful","R1QMV4FW0X0A9Y","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're a culture with severe trust issues. Politicians have long struggled with this thing called honesty. Employers break their word when it's in the apparent best interests of the bottom line. Spouses break their vows in the pursuit of ""happiness.""So it makes sense that we'd take our trust issues and put them on God, doesn't it? When you strip away the nuances of so many of our doubts and questions about God, the thing we really want to know is:God can really be trusted?R.C. Sproul wants to give readers confidence on this matter. To know that the God of the Bible is a promise-making--and promise-keeping--God. His most recent book, The Promises of God: Discovering the One Who Keeps His Word, examines the promises God has made and why we have good reason to trust Him to keep it.When seeking to understand God's promises, you need to start with the concept of covenant. Our God is a covenant-making God. The concept, therefore, ""is integral and foundational to the divine revelation"" (9). But what does ""covenant"" mean and what are the covenants God makes?Sproul begins by explaining that while all covenants are, at a fundamental level, agreements between two parties or more parties (think wedding vows or industrial contracts), biblical covenants are unique in that they ""are established on the basis of a divine sanction. That is, they are established not on the foundation of promises made by equal parties, but on the foundation of the divine promise of God. In biblical covenants, it is God who declares the terms and makes the promises"" (11).While this might seem obvious to some, this is helpful to understand. Too often we seem to treat God's covenants as two-person agreements, as though we had a say in the drafting of the terms. But when you look at any biblical covenant--from the beginning of redemptive history to its end--you don't see negotiation taking place. You only ever see God say, ""This is my covenant with you.""From there, Sproul goes on to define the different covenants God makes throughout redemptive history: the Covenant of Redemption, the Creation Covenant, the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic Covenants, and finally the New Covenant.His placement of the covenant of redemption at the beginning of the list is no accident. Sproul explains:""The great truth that rests on the concept of the covenant of redemption is that redemption was not an afterthought in the plan of God. It was not God's Plan B, which He was forced to come up with to correct the mess humanity made out of creation. No, before He created the world, God had an eternal purpose of redemption, a plan for redeeming His people in this world, and all three persons of the Trinity were in complete agreement about it."" (30)This is where we get so messed up when we ask if God can be trusted--and this is where God's Word gives us so much encouragement and confidence. Because the plan of redemption was made before the world was ever created, we don't have to worry about whether or not it's going to work. There's no need to hedge our bets, as though there were even a small chance of error.Jesus promised before the world was that he would actively obey the Father's will and that he would passively accept the consequences of our failure to obey God's commands.""All of this was agreed upon in eternity before Christ ever became flesh and dwelled among us,"" Sproul writes. ""He agreed to do the work necessary for our redemption."" (32)So what's the need, then, of the remaining covenants? In a sense, the other covenants do two things:1. They provide the context in which the covenant of redemption is fulfilled; and2. They reveal the covenant of redemption in its fullness.Each covenant builds upon the next as God progressively reveals His will to His people. So the Creation covenant (that is, the Adamic or covenant of works) provides the basic backdrop for humanity's situation. It is the only covenant that applies to humanity in general, rather than specific groups or individuals.""Since Adam represented the entire human race in the covenant that God made with him, all human beings who descend from Adam participate in the Adamic covenant,"" Sproul explains.""As children of Adam, we are necessarily involved in a covenant relationship with God.... The question is whether we are covenant keepers or covenant breakers. We are all one or the other, but none of us is outside of the covenant."" 42-43)Do you see why this understanding is foundational to the redemptive story of the Bible? Because we're all within a covenant with God, whether we acknowledge it or not, we are all accountable to Him for our actions. This is why Paul could and does universally condemn humanity as ""children of wrath"" (Eph. 2:3), as being ""without excuse"" for failing to acknowledge God's person and commands (Rom. 1:20).And equally importantly, it's in light of the breaking of this first covenant that we see God's grace break forth into creation:* When God flooded the world and spared only Noah and his family, He showed infinite grace to them as well as to all of creation. In this covenant, we begin to see the cosmic scope of redemption.* In the Abrahamic Covenant, we see God promising unconditionally that Abraham the land of Canaan, that his descendants would become a great nation, and that from him, all nations would be blessed. This would be His work alone.* In the Mosaic Covenant, God gives His redeemed people the moral and ceremonial laws of what was to be a nation under His rule--a nation serving as a symbol of His consummated Kingdom.* In the Davidic Covenant, God promises that David's throne would be established forever and his Son would sit on the throne forever.And all the promises of God come to fruition in Jesus Christ. The covenants give the context for redemptive work of Christ. They help us understand the requirements for salvation, and they help us to see that only one Man has ever met those requirements. We are saved not by our works, not by our futile attempts to keep God's covenant, but by Christ's keeping the covenant on our behalf.Is that not the best news you could ask for?Can God be trusted? Absolutely. He kept His promises to Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and David--and He continues to keep His promises to us in Christ. What wonderful assurances comes from grasping this truth--it changes everything! Don't forget this truth. Don't overlook it or neglect it. Instead, read The Promises of God, let it guide your study of this important subject, and give thanks to the God who really does keep His Word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PV7FRSIQJT2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXDZRKK#wasThisHelpful","R2PV7FRSIQJT2Z","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's be honest: many Christians have done a poor job of showing love to the homosexual community and to those among us who deal with same-sex attraction. Far too many have used particular verses to hammer people into submission, rather than explain the Bible's position on sexuality as a whole.That's why we need books like Is God Anti-Gay? by Sam Allberry. In this short book, Allberry explains the biblical view of sexuality and addresses many of the common questions people ask about homosexuality. But more than that, this is a book about the gospel, and King Jesus' call demands upon the life of all who claim to follow Him.This is an important book for Allberry to write. He's is a pastor in the United Kingdom. He believes the Bible is true and authoritative in all it teaches.He's also a man who deals with same-sex attraction. So, as you can imagine, he knows about that which he writes. There's a real sensitivity in his approach, both from a pastoral perspective and also from that of one who has had to wrestle deeply with these issues.There are two areas that I personally found incredibly significant. The first is dealing with our tendency to place too much or too little emphasis on a given subject. When it comes to homosexuality, many want to take the (relatively) few references made to it and declare that it doesn't matter. But, Allberry writes, ""The Bible does not frequently make direct reference to how we are to care for creation, but that does not let us off the hook from following what is said in the places where it does.""Likewise, we need to remember that the Bible isn't fixated on homosexuality, despite how the media portrays Christians to be. ""[Homosexuality] is not what the Bible is `about'... [and] what the Bible says about homosexuality does not represent everything God wants to say to homosexual people; it is not the whole message of Christianity.""Allberry wants Christians to be balanced in their approach to the subject. We are to take it seriously because universally it is condemned throughout Scripture. There are no loop holes, no exceptions whatsoever. And yet, this is not the end of what we are to say.In fact, this is what too many of us miss. We spend a great deal of time explaining the sin part and wind up failing to show that the gospel is bigger and better. ""As society moves further and further away from its Christian moorings, the church is given more and more of an opportunity to model a counter-cultural alternative,"" he writes. We have the opportunity to show the world something better. And we do it by being clear on our message and lavishly generous in our relationships.This, I believe, is the key: when it comes right down to it, how we love one another within the church, especially those dealing with same sex attraction, is what will get people's attention. It's easy to write off someone you don't know as a bigot; it's a lot harder to do that to someone who has demonstrated great love for others.There's no doubt that if you raise concerns about same-sex marriage today, you're in for a whole heap of trouble.I live in Canada, where it's been legal for nearly a decade (it was pushed through in an outgoing Prime Minister's misguided attempt to create a legacy for himself). While society as a whole certainly hasn't crumbled around us--and, for the time being at least, polygamy and pedophilia are still crimes--if you oppose homosexuality (even considerately) it is risky business. Say the wrong thing to the wrong person and you're likely to be facing the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.That's the world we live in now--one that pressures us to back away from a biblical view of sexuality, to fudge on what the Bible actually does say about sex and marriage. And make no mistake, many do compromise. ""Jesus didn't say anything about homosexuality, so obviously it wasn't an issue for him,"" suggest some. ""If you're going to appeal to Leviticus, why aren't you stoning people who eat shellfish and wear poly-cotton blends?"" say others. The Bible is homophobic, outdated and needs to be set aside in favor of ""the new thing God is doing.""Allberry refuses to go there--he is unwilling to compromise on what the Bible says, even when it might be convenient for him. Instead, he reminds us of the simple truth: ""God's message for gay people is the same as his message for everyone. Repent and believe.""This is what we need to remember: Is God anti-gay? Not exactly. God is anti-sin. He is against all sin that is committed by his image-bearers, not simply homosexuality. God hates gluttony, gambling, and gossip, too.But the blood of Christ is sufficient to cover even the worst of sins. Homosexuals aren't a special class of sinner outside the reach of the grace of God. In Is God Anti-Gay?, Allberry does a tremendous job of equipping Christians to think biblically about homosexuality and, Lord willing, to use what they know to reach the homosexual community with the love of God and see them, like all sinners, ""repent and believe.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUHYVARES16J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908762314#wasThisHelpful","R3GUHYVARES16J","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christians don't really know what to do with questions. Some of us seem afraid to ask anything; others seem terrified to receive answers. But questions were never meant to be a source of angst nor a mask for unbelief.In his new book The End of Our Exploring, Matthew Lee Anderson challenges us to examine the heart behind our inquiries and embrace the God-glorifying design of asking questions--to see them as opportunities to edify and encourage, to grow in our faith.After reading this book, one thing is abundantly clear: Anderson is a uniter. He finally brings ""progressives"" and ""conservatives"" together--but it's not to hold hands and sing ""Kumbuyah."" Instead, he recognizes that both are guilty of the same thing: simplistically approaching questions.Many progressives tend to view certainty as the great enemy of faith; doubt is the mark of true faith and humility (ironically, they're very certain about this). Many conservatives, conversely, either see asking questions as either a sign of a shipwrecked faith or a rebellious spirit. If they don't eschew questions altogether, they do rush to be the answer police, giving (and gleefully receiving) an easy answer and moving on.But neither approach leads to maturity; both leave us childish in our approach to the Christian faith. ""If we want people to think adult thoughts, then we should stop catering to their felt needs for quick answers,"" he writes (74).But being simplistic about answers isn't the only problem--we have difficulty even coming up with the right questions. Anderson writes:""We Christians should not be so answers oriented that we render ourselves incapable of coming up with the questions ourselves. We might think it a miracle that anyone learned about the Bible before we had study guides, given our total dependence upon them. What questions could the early Christians have possibly asked without the prompts we now have? And how did readers ever learn from books without prepackaged questions at the end of each chapter? If we are going to move beyond being a community that simply regurgitates 'easy answers,' then we must also be willing to put an end to spoon feeding the questions."" (74)Do you get a sense of the difficult balance Anderson is trying to describe here? He is emphatic that we need to ask more and better questions about our faith, and especially the Bible--and we need to expect to have those questions answered.This will, naturally, take a great deal of work and wisdom to accomplish, in part because the process is so challenging for us. ""Good questions make the familiar seem strange to us,"" he writes. ""If we are willing to linger for a moment over the initial frustration of not immediately knowing the answer, we will find that a good question will revive our sense of wonder and enchantment at the world"" (87).This is something being a parent is forcing me to relearn. My kids ask a lot of questions. Like a lot a lot. I'm pretty sure I've been asked ""what's that"" or some variation around 1,036,782 times over the last six years. Sometimes my kids want the simple answer: ""It's a cat; it's a tree; it's a cookie."" And if I can be totally honest, sometimes it's really annoying to have to answer the same thing again and again. But sometimes when they ask a question, they're not looking for a simple answer. They need me to go deeper. They want to understand the world they're living in and their questions help them to do that.As we grow in the Christian faith, we're like my kids in a lot of ways. We start out asking a lot of questions because we don't really know much of anything. But as we get older, and as we receive good answers, we learn to ask better questions. ""When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways,"" as the Apostle Paul says (1 Cor. 13:11). That's what questioning well is supposed to help us do--to stop reasoning as children and instead reason as adults. To put away ""childish ways,"" and take questions and answers seriously.But, Anderson reminds us, that's not all there is to questioning well. ""Questioning well also means the question fits the things questioned as much as the moment"" (169). And this brings to light another issue--one not necessarily between theological camps but generational divides.Although there are always exceptions, when dealing with many members of the Boomer generation, I've noticed a tendency to see submitting oneself to questioning is a sign of weakness. Questions from younger generations--specifically their kids and grandkids, the Millennials--are often viewed as subversive or disloyal. Certainly there can be an element of this, especially for those of us who struggle with how to ask the right questions at the right time.But does the perception fit with reality?Not at all. ""Questioning will tend to be subversive in communities where questioning is not practiced,"" he writes. ""When inquiry is modeled and discipled, the gap between healthy questioning and subversive questioning will be easier to discern"" (148).As hard as it might be for some to hear, the first thing we need to do when we react negatively to questions is to examine ourselves--is it because of an insecurity on our part? If so, we would do well to remember ""it is not a sign of weakness when leaders submit themselves and their decisions to be questioned publicly, but a sign of their confidence and desire for integrity"" (133).I don't know if I've read a timelier book than The End of Our Exploring. Too many of us struggle to understand how to ask questions well or even understand the purpose of a question. But Anderson gives us a framework for asking the right questions in the right way that I'm sure will be valuable for years to come. This book is a wonderful gift to readers of all stripes; I can't recommend it highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R208RRA3UXP632/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802406521#wasThisHelpful","R208RRA3UXP632","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems the Sacraments are a source of confusion to many believers today. Much ink has been spilt on different views of baptism; many blog posts and debates have been had about how often to have communion... but of late, it seems too few people are talking about what the Lord's Supper actually is.How should we view the Lord's Supper? Is it a mere ritual, or is there something deeper behind it?To find an answer, sometimes the best thing to do is to look to the saints of old. The Mystery of the Lord's Supper offers the insights of Robert Bruce, one of Scotland's most influential spiritual leaders from the 16th century. This book collects five of his sermons addressing the sacraments in general, the particulars of the Lord's Supper and the preparation of our hearts.To some looking to study this important matter, Bruce's book might seem like an odd choice. The original sermons were preached in the late 16th century, with the Protestant Reformation in full swing and continuing to sweep across Europe. Because of this, much of the book is focused on refuting the Roman church's understanding of the Mass while explaining the Reformed (and more specifically the Presbyterian) view.An extremely beneficial element of his theology of the Lord's Supper actually comes from Bruce's understanding of the sacraments in general: They are a ""holy sign and seal that is annexed to the preached Word of God to seal up and confirm the truth contained in the same Word"" (33). It's not just that the Lord's Supper is a symbol or a sign--a concept that we have no problem understanding even today--it's a seal of a promise.Communion is more than a reminder of Christ's death for our sins, his body broken and blood shed. The ""mystery,"" according to Bruce, is the symbol is the image of the spiritual nourishment we are provided through the gospel--""In this Sacrament we have the fruits of Christ's death...the virtue of His sacrifice, the virtue of His passion"" (72). But we don't have these alone--we have the substance these fruits ""flow and proceed"" from. In the Lord's Supper, then, our spirit is nourished by the person of Christ, who is the one signified in the symbol.Clear as mud, right?Admittedly, Bruce's writing is not the easiest to digest and synthesize. There is much of the theology of the Lord's Supper he lays out that I doubt I've actually got a firm grasp on. Perhaps it's that Bruce is attempting to describe something that defies proper description. The mystery of the Lord's Supper is a mystery for a reason--nevertheless, an answer is there and meant to be found. It's not that Christ's presence is literally in the bread and wine (or juice depending on conviction) as in the Roman Catholic view; the bread is bread and the wine is wine. The form and substance are one and the same. And yet, Christ is really active and present in communion--there's more going on than merely going through a ritual.Like I said, clear as mud.Or maybe I'm a bit slow.What I found most helpful, perhaps moreso than his actual teaching on the Lord's Supper, is Bruce's teaching about how to prepare our hearts to partake. He takes Paul's command that every man should examine himself before coming to the table (1 Cor. 11:28) with the utmost seriousness (something perhaps we lack in our modern teaching). He frequently exhorts his readers to examine their consciences, not with a spirit of unhelpful introspection, but out of a desire to truly see where the affections of our hearts lie. I couldn't help but shudder a bit when I read these words:""Examine whether you have faith or not; examine it by your desire to pray, and by the way you discharge your own private grudges. If you are lacking in these things, remember that a heart void of prayer and full of rancour is a heart that is faithless and meet for hell."" (201)Do you see why careful examination of ourselves is so important? Our lives and our habits reveal more about us than we'd care to admit. Prayerlessness and a tendency toward bitterness (and particularly an unwillingness to be free of it) should be a source of great concern--and so when we find it in our hearts, we ought to flee to the Lord, calling to him as the father of the dying child did, ""I believe; help my unbelief!"" (Mark 9:24)That, friends, is what it means to examine yourself honestly. It's not a cursory view of yourself followed by an excuse or two about why your prayer life stinks (and I say that as one who's got kind of a crummy prayer life at the moment). Honest examination will lead us to turn to the Lord for help, to strive to reconcile with others; to flee from sin and pursue peace with God. The very things accomplished in that which the Lord's Supper signifies.This is a book that requires thoughtful, intentional reading. Bruce's theology of the Lord's Supper is meaty stuff. It takes time to digest (and in all honesty, I'm not entirely certain I've fully absorbed everything he communicates). Nevertheless, careful students will find his teaching--especially that on preparing our hearts to come to the table--a great blessing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6Z9X2CE1IT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1845500563#wasThisHelpful","R3L6Z9X2CE1IT9","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why am I here? What is the meaning of life? Do I have a purpose? Answers to such questions make up our worldview, and our worldview drives the course of our lives whether we're aware of it or not. For many of us, however, the stories of which we're a part are simply inadequate to answer these kinds of questions.In The Big Story, Justin Buzzard upholds the story of Scripture as the only one able to ""explain all the beauty and all the brokenness we see in this world, to make sense of our desires, dreams, and disappointments"" (11). He urges readers to consider the story they're living in, to recognize the gaps and failings of competing worldviews, and to embrace ""the old and ongoing story of the Bible.""Buzzard, lead pastor of Garden City Church in Silicon Valley, California, presents the Bible's narrative in five acts: Jesus, God, creation, rebellion, and rescue.Beginning with Jesus is the right decision, one unfortunately passed over by many books attempting to show the power in the story of redemption. He is, after all, the main character in this unfolding drama--and the whole point of the story. Whether for him or against him, everyone must somehow respond to him. His presence is too disruptive for us to remain neutral or silent. Buzzard makes this point clear: ""People have to respond to Jesus because . . . he doesn't leave things as they are; he both attracts people to himself and meddles with their lives"" (17).Anyone who has put his trust in Christ understands this process. Again, Buzzard writes, ""Jesus doesn't adjust to us, and he doesn't submit to our whims. We adjust to Jesus and submit to him. Jesus is King, not an accessory"" (115). Once again, Buzzard is exactly correct: King Jesus lovingly hates your status quo.Throughout the book, Buzzard's desire for the lost to come to know Jesus shines. He rightly reminds his readers that what they think about God is ""the most important thing about you. . . . What you believe (or don't believe) about God drives how you live"" (25). He desperately wants folks to see their place in a story that, first and foremost, begins with God:""We often insist on living as if we are the beginning, the origin, the primary character. We live life under the banner of 'In the beginning, me.' But the Bible doesn't begin with 'In the beginning, Justin,' or 'In the beginning, [insert your name here].' It boldly states, 'In the beginning, God.'"" (28)Clearly, there's a lot to like in The Big Story. Buzzard does a good job with key elements of the Bible's narrative and keeps the reader moving at a brisk pace. Likewise, he does an excellent job conveying the necessity of an urgent response.The Big Story faithfully focuses on eliciting a response to Jesus. Buzzard comes across as incredibly passionate in his desire to see people know his Savior. However, I fear his passion sometimes muddies the waters when it comes to the deepest problem facing humanity: sin.To be clear, Buzzard isn't systemically soft on sin, and there are places where strong language is employed--it's ""like a malignant tumor, one we are born with"" (74); it's ""sickness"" and ""rebellion"" (92). Nevertheless, the overwhelming view of sinners presented throughout the book is one of ""broken"" people who ""do not yet know Jesus."" They are described as trying to fill their ""emptiness with something other than God"" (32) or choosing ""to build [their] identity on things that hurt [them] and make [them] feel small and . . . dissatisfied"" (57). People need to know that ""the only being who thinks more about you than you, is God. And when he thinks of you, he thinks, very good"" (59).While there's certainly some truth to this point--idolatry is indeed the root of all sin--it's equally true that unrepentant sinners are far more than ""broken people."" The uncomfortable reality is that, apart from Christ, we're actively rebelling against God--not merely running away from him, but waging war against him. As Paul puts it, left to ourselves we are ""children of wrath"" (Eph. 2:3). This, I suppose, highlights a methdological flaw in Buzzard's book: it was unclear at times whether he was using certain language in reference to redeemed, repentant sinners or to unredeemed, unrepentant ones--those still in rebellion, still under the wrath of God.To write a book with two distinct audiences in mind--Christian and non-Christian--is no easy task, but Buzzard has done a fine job. Believers in particular will find helpful tips for using ""the big story"" to frame evangelistic conversations. Non-Christian readers should benefit from its generally solid overview of the major beats of the story of redemption. This is a good book that will hopefully be used to strengthen many and bring others to their knees in faith before Jesus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36S3F3ZFOIDRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802408575#wasThisHelpful","R36S3F3ZFOIDRS","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a rule, I don't like books about being a ""biblical man."" Too often they resort to describing a specific kind of guy: one who's wild at heart, wants to slay a dragon, climb a mountain and play with power tools.I am none of those things.In fact, I'm forbidden from using power tools because I'm so inept. So if those are the things that define being a biblical man, what does that make me?Fortunately, Eric Mason doesn't resort to trite depictions of being a man of God in his new book, Manhood Restored: How the Gospel Makes Men Whole. He gets that men aren't motivated by declarations, covenants and promise rings to do more and try harder to be better men. Manhood needs to be transformed by the gospel. And this book is about how the gospel does exactly that.Mason tackles four broad subjects, dealing with:1. God's original intent for mankind and sin's distortion of it2. ""daddy deliquency"" and the destruction of the family3. Jesus as the restorer and supreme example of biblical manhood4. a restored manhood's affect on worldview, sexuality, vision (think leadership), family and churchI was surprised at how frequently I found myself underlining and commenting in my copy of the book. Every chapter is saturated with rich biblical teaching on manhood, the seriousness of sin and our only hope: the gospel. When Mason tackles sin, for example, he pulls no punches:""We talk ourselves into thinking that sin is just a bad choice; it's not. It's much deeper than that for us, just as it was for Adam. When Adam chose willful rebellion against the law of God, he was choosing to forfeit his birthright by rejecting his calling to represent, be responsible, and enjoy his relationship with God, his wife, and the rest of creation. This single act placed in motion the initial and progressive fall of creation and its order, one whose effects still ravage every facet of the world today."" (12)This is so important because our language of ""bad choices"" or even our category of ""brokenness"" at times leads to a minimizing of the severity of sin: It's not that we make mistakes, but we willfully rebel against our creator--and the results are tragic as we can all too easily see in our world where about half of all kids go to bed without a dad at home.Arguably the standout chapter is the book's third, ""The Restorer of Manhood."" Here Mason combines two great truths essential to our understanding of biblical manhood and the Christian life in general: Jesus both exemplifies true manhood and restores us to a right relationship with God through his death and resurrection. Mason writes:""Jesus is the prototype man for men. All of us men are only as manly as it relates to the standard set by Jesus...God's design--His divine intent--is for those who are in Jesus to look like Jesus."" (45)And again:""Jesus, as the Son of Man, is not only inspirational--He is epic...He is fully God and yet truly and fully human. He is a man just like--and yet wholly unlike--us, all at the same time. So if we're looking for an example of manhood, we need look no further than the cross and the empty tomb. Jesus, over and over again, shows us what it means to really be a man."" (52)This is the key to a restored view of manhood. It's not about the comparison games or guilt-driven appeals to do more and try harder to be better men under our own strength. No, recovering and restoring manhood to God's original intention only happens when we look again and again to the cross.Manhood Restored is not a book intended to help you embrace your inner fisherman (who may or may not be a fisher of men). The vision of such books is far too small and Mason's goals are far loftier. By blending the Bible's rich theological foundation and helpful practical application, Mason offers what may be one of the most compelling and helpful of the recent crop of titles on the subject.I still don't like books on being a biblical man. But I do really like Manhood Restored. Read this book, share it with your friends and be encouraged as you see the role the gospel plays in restoring manhood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKB9FRNMG0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433679949#wasThisHelpful","R3RKB9FRNMG0V","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jesus is the Son of God... but exactly do we mean when we say that?The answer may not be as simple as we may think. After all, Jesus isn't the only person in Scripture referred to as God's son--Adam, is God's son (Luke 3:38), Israel (corporately) is God's son (Ex. 4:22), Solomon is God's son (1 Chron. 28:6), the Israelites (individually) are ""sons of God"" (Deut. 32:8), as are peacemakers (Matt. 5:9) and even the angels, in some sense (Job 2:1).""So in what way is Jesus's sonship like, or unlike, any of these?"" asks D.A. Carson in Jesus the Son of God: A Christological Title Often Overlooked, Sometimes Misunderstood, and Currently Disputed. ""Why should we think of him as God's only Son?"" (Kindle location 84)Carson knows there's good reason to understand Jesus in this sense--after all, how we understand Christ drastically affects our understanding of the Christian faith. If we get Jesus wrong, everything else collapses. And, as Carson points out, this necessarily includes understanding his sonship.Carson's examination of this important title is focused on the following areas:1. ""Son of God"" as a christological title2. ""Son of God"" in select passages3. ""Jesus the Son of God"" in Christian and Muslim contextsIn section one, Carson's goal is to remind readers that in the Bible ""`son(s) of God' can refer to a diverse range of beings"" not simply the second person of the Trinity (location 369). Thus it carries with it a diverse range of meanings, all of which are only understood within their context.Yet this also helps us get a better handle on the ways in which ""son of God"" is applied to Christ--sometimes as a catchall for various ideas (such as his role as the great high priest), often as a link to the promised Davidic king, sometimes as a reference to Jesus' role as the true and greater Israel, and most stunningly as overtly transparent assignments of divine status to Jesus and of his preexistence:""In [numerous] passages (e.g., Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22; John 14:9; 17:1-8; 1 John 5:20), Jesus is not the Son of God by virtue of being the ultimate Israel, nor is he the Son of God by virtue of being the Messiah, the ultimate Davidic king, nor is he the Son of God by virtue of being a perfect human being. Rather, he is the Son of God from eternity, simultaneously distinguishable from his heavenly Father yet one with him, the perfect Revealer of the living God."" (location 541)This is where much of today's debates are centered: Jesus' sonship in concert with his preexistence. The idea that Jesus is eternally God's son--and the idea that God has a son--is inflammatory to many, especially to Muslims who see it as an affront. A robust understanding of what it means for Jesus to be the Son of God allows us to better avoid the heresies of Arianism, Sabellianism (modalism) and tritheism; it also helps us to engage with the Muslim and explore his ""deeper criticism of the incarnation: the absolute distinction between God and his creation must not be breached"" ( location 1243).Where some have attempted to skirt the controversy over sonship language by expunging it from translations (replacing it with ""Messiah""), Carson reminds us that we lose something crucial when we do:""So what is being lost? ""Messiah"" conjures up anointing, as well as kingly and priestly offices; ""Son of God"" conjures up family identity, engendering (whether biological or as a metaphor for appointment), a relationship of love, and filial loyalty."" (location 1322)Simply, we're left with a smaller view of who God is. One who is significantly less personal, one who is far more aloof. But this is not the God of the Bible. There we see a God who comes into human history, who engages with his creation by taking on the form of man in order to redeem humanity.Simply, if we lose sonship we lose the gospel.But not only that, when we set aside this language we lose our connection to the church universal and become something other and deadly to the soul. As Carson writes,It is not a light thing to stand so aloof from the authority of those early councils and creeds that reflect so much sustained thought regarding how to think about God. This does not mean that those early councils and creeds necessarily got everything right. Nevertheless, the kind of biblicism that learns nothing from the great councils is in danger of becoming cultic. (location 1484)While by no means is Jesus the Son of God an exhaustive study of the significance of this key title of Jesus, Carson's concise examination is an important look at a neglected topic, and it's one I would commend to any serious student of God's Word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRCPWJLKCKJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433537966#wasThisHelpful","R3FRCPWJLKCKJJ","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While ""doctrine"" is a dirty word in some circles, there are times when I wonder if it's become a bit of a cliché in some of ours. Many of us in the ""new Calvinist/YRR/whatever-you-want-to-call-this"" movement love to talk about the importance of sound doctrine and why it matters. We have systematic theologies and commentaries, apologetics books and cultural critiques. But sometimes we forget to talk about what doctrine does in the life of the church, practically.In Sound Doctrine: How a Church Grows in the Love and Holiness of God, Bobby Jamieson doesn't give us another book on why doctrine is important. Instead, he reminds us how orthodoxy leads to a healthy church--one committed to the fulfilling of the Great Commission in the spirit of the great commandments.Jamieson, assistant editor of 9Marks and managing editor of the 9Marks Journal, hooked me the moment I read his definition of sound doctrine: ""Sound doctrine is a summary of the Bible's teaching that is both faithful to the Bible and useful for life"" (17).How many other clear and helpful definitions of sound doctrine have you encountered--definitions that balance knowledge and practice? We understand the first easily enough, but when we neglect the second we tend to get into trouble. Application testifies to how firmly we actually hold to our beliefs, confirming the genuineness of our convictions or betraying the hypocrisy of our hearts. For example, what effect does how we treat one another have on the outside world? Does it attract or repel? Do people look at our congregations and really see a group of believers committed to one another? We've all heard stories of ugly church splits, divisiveness, pride, and cliquishness that leave people saying, ""If that's what a church is, I'm out.""This is what sound doctrine lived out protects us from. It brings about greater unity when handled humbly. It increases our awe of the Lord and grows us in personal and corporate holiness. It drives our witness before the watching world and increases our love for one another.But understand: this isn't terribly radical stuff when you think about it--it's the basics of Christian discipleship (e.g., John 13:34-35; 15:12, 17; 1 John 3:11, 23; 4:7, 11-12). Jamieson writes:""Our churches should be characterized by a mutual love that extends to all those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and love, don't forget, is fueled by sound doctrine. If bitterness, gossip, and slander are tearing your church apart, sound doctrine is one of the most necessary tools for sewing it back together. If rivalries and divisions are suffocating the church's love, it needs to breathe anew the rich air of sound doctrine. In order to love the unlovely and to reconcile enemies, we must remember that God has done those very things for us in Christ."" (71)A church committed to faithful teaching--and equally committed to living out that teaching--can't not be characterized by a supernatural love that surpasses all understanding.I wonder if some of us have missed this point in our efforts to defend the truth from error. Particularly for those of us who live in our heads (like me), it's easy to distill holding to sound doctrine to simply defending facts. And while it's certainly no less than this defense, it's clearly much, much more. We need to wholeheartedly affirm the truth of Christianity, remaining united around the gospel and ""the doctrines that flow from and undergird the gospel"" (81). And we need to live in light of that same truth.The vapidity of our worship culture is a source of much consternation among conservative evangelicals. Puffy, fluffy songs that could as easily be about a girlfriend or boyfriend as about Jesus dominate the worship ""set."" ""Spirit keys"" intrude on the pastoral prayer, leaving you feeling like you're watching a special episode of Growing Pains rather than hearing the impassioned prayer of a shepherd for his flock.All of this, of course, comes from a desire to create an experience--to engage the congregation in worship. In doing so, though, many resort to trying to ""facilitate"" (read: ""manufacture"") an intense emotional experience. However, as Jamieson argues in what might be his strongest chapter, that approach misses the point of worship. Emotions are good things, but creating emotional experiences flips the object of the worship gathering from God to us.If you really want to engage people, you need to infuse your worship with sound doctrine. ""Sound doctrine teaches us to delight in God because it shows us how delightful God is,"" Jamieson writes. ""It holds before our eyes the perfections of his character, the abundance of his grace, and the majesty of his sovereign rule over all things"" (85).When I read this chapter, I wanted to cheer. (Regrettably I was on a plane and didn't sense my seatmates would've appreciated it.) Jamieson nails the relationship between doctrine and corporate worship--that we should lose ourselves in worship, but not in squishy sentimentality. We're to lose ourselves in awe of the God who is, who has called us to himself, and who saves and sanctifies us through his Word.Jamieson's book is thoughtful, helpful, and packed full of wisdom. It succeeds in reminding us that sound doctrine truly is for all of life--and it's a book you can't easily walk away from without feeling at least a touch of conviction. Indeed, we all too easily take the implications of our doctrine for granted.Read Sound Doctrine for your own well-being, work through it as a leadership team, and discuss it in your community groups. If you're serious about helping others see doctrine as essential to all of life, this book is a great starting point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9CHF2NAE8ID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433535890#wasThisHelpful","R3J9CHF2NAE8ID","A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SGH4Z9DIQNV2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a parent, you know how hard it can be to find good books for children.Kid's books tend to swing too far into the simplistic or go so far over the reader's heads that they lose interest. Balancing isn't easy, especially when you're trying to write a story for little people on a big subject: the love of God.In The Boy and the Ocean, Max Lucado offers a really sweet story of a mother and father describing the wondrousness of God's love as they play in the ocean and climb mountains. Throughout the book, Lucado repeats this refrain: ""God's love is like the ocean... It's always here. It's always deep. It never ends. God's love is special.""My middle daughter in particlar, Hannah, is quite fond of the book. She picked it up right away and asked to have it read to her daily for the better part of a week. The story is just right for a three-year-old's comprehension level, so parents will be pleased with the book in that regard. And because Lucado writes with a distinctly poetic rhythm, our kids tend to be mesmerized when we read it.Where the book really shines, though, is in the artwork. Illustrator T. Lively Fluharty's art is stunning. We loved his work in The Barber Who Wanted to Pray and were thrilled to see it again in The Boy and the Ocean.We love great art and Fluharty's paintings alone make this book worth having in your family's collection.The story, like I said, is sweet--but that's all it is. Where the book falls short, unsurprisingly, is giving a real sense how special, how deep, how unending God's love really is.While Lucado does a nice job with the ""God's love is deep like the ocean,"" he doesn't take the opportunity to say ""and this is how God has shown us how deep his love truly is."" What you get is a half-truth in the book--one that parents are going to want to make sure they complete with their kids both during storytime and in the day-to-day.In the end, there are a lot worse books you could get for your kids than The Boy and the Ocean. A gospel-driven book, this is not; but it is an opening to a gospel conversation with your kids. And if that's what Lucado set out to do, then he's succeeded admirably.

"Secrets was a good choice for a nice summer chick lit read. A sort of soft sweet read, this one didn’t blow me away but I enjoyed it enough to make my way through 485 pages to get to the end.I think that what I liked most about Secrets was the setting…a small seaside town in England, it’s very essence so unique and different from all the towns around it. I loved Wolf beyond words…easily my favorite character in this tale. If I wasn’t a crazy cat lady…I’d want a dog just like him:) I was also charmed by all of Joe’s talk about bridges and the metaphors woven throughout. Amazing imagery both literally and figuratively.As with most small town tales, secondary characters add so much to the fabric of this story. I loved the realistic friendships that this one portrayed both between female friends and also the friendship that developed between Tess and Seb. To be honest a small part of me was actually rooting for Seb all along….Which leads me to the things that I didn’t like so much. Joe. I am so torn about Joe…parts of him, I fell in love with right along side Tess, but even larger parts completely turned me off. Maybe it is just that Freya North really got into the male mind and it’s not a place I enjoy! lol But I found that I could not tolerate Joe’s mindset in so many instances…it just completely turned me off to the point that I had to ignore huge parts of him to actually enjoy the “Happy Ending.”Also, this is a long one and I’ll be honest…I didn’t really feel as if all of that length was needed. The pacing was the second of my two main concerns with this read. I think this one could have been pared down and it would have made for a much more enjoyable read.All in all this was a fair experience, I don’t think I would necessarily recommend this book, but I might try another of the author’s offerings in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZMBM116IBVPW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402260148#wasThisHelpful","R2ZMBM116IBVPW","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And from there my interest in the story sort of flip flopped until I crossed the finish line. Strong writing from Fitzpatrick and great descriptives kept me entertained throughout but I was left with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.NOTE: Review Copy from Publisher, all thoughts and opinions my own","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6K7FPI04N46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442474262#wasThisHelpful","R3I6K7FPI04N46","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afterworlds had so much potential! Two stories built into one…both the story of young YA debut author Darcy and her move to NYC and the story within a story that was her novel about Lizzie and her trips to the Afterworld. Both stories seemed to have great potential…especially Darcy’s…I loved the chance to jump into the shoes of a new author and experience that through her. I really wanted this one to work but sadly it just fell flat for me.I can find no fault with Westerfeld’s writing but I never fully connected to any of the characters in either story and the plot just seemed to surreal and dreamlike top elicit any real feeling from me.

"City of Savages drew me in right from the synopsis and did not disappoint. It was fast paced…alternating POV’s between teens Phee and Sky and their mother (through her journal entries). I loved all of their voices and even more than that was drawn in immediately to the story of the city.  I wanted to know more about their current world and I was as anxious as the girls were to piece by piece learn the story of how this world had come to be.Full of action and adventure, heart and courage, and plenty of twists…Kelly won me over in this debut effort.  My only complaint was that we didn’t get even more of the city’s story…I really felt that in a way Manhattan was a living breathing character in this tale and I would have loved it if her story had been fleshed out even more.

"Purrfect Elements:*Laybourne’s writing style is to the point and easy to read making this a fast quick summer read. I was sucked in from the start and really wanted to know what was going to happen next…because believe me…if something sounds too good to be true…it usually is!!*With more than one important social issue at it’s core…Sweet is more than just another*The dual POV’s.  It worked here.  It was great to be able to see what was going on during the cruise from both Laurel & Tom’s perspectives.*Speaking of their perspectives…they both worked…especially Laurel’s. I’ve mentioned before that character development is one of Emmy’s strengths and I believe that show’s here.  Laurel and Viv are both such different people…yet they both…especially Laurel, stand true to their beliefs and they have such a great relationship.  I’m so proud of Laurel:)*The tension build up….the whole 1st half of the novel, we know something is coming…we just don’t know what…love that!Less than Purrfect Elements:*The secondary characters were not as strong as I would have liked…although they were all interesting  foils to Laurel and Tom.*The romance was a bit too much insta-love for my taste…even considering the forced confines and stress of the situation.8The last third of the book just threw me for a loop. I don’t want to give anything away…but I was right…something was coming…just not in exactly the way I expected! lolFinal Thoughts:This is a great summer read that has the ability to check multiple boxes all at once.  You’ve got Romance, horror and some great underlying commentary on multiple social issues ranging from our societies crazy focus on celebrities to our cultures skewed perspectives on body image.

"Despite the fact that I normally love stand alone novels, I was so thrilled to hear that Lynne was writing a sequel to Nil:) Although Nil did quite satisfactorily wrap up Charley and Thad's stories...we were still left with a lot of unanswered questions regarding the island itself and the fates of the remaining kids trapped there.Nil Unlocked is told from the dual perspectives of Rives (who I absolutely loved getting to know better) and Skye (a new comer to the island with a very interesting personal history that ties in. Both of these characters make great, interesting and reliable narrators who you can easily cheer for and feel for. There's no disconnect here!Action packed and thought provoking, Nil Unlocked sucked me in and captivated me until the very end. I loved that we actually got a lot of answers, but that Lynne Matson managed to still ask even more questions. I am not sure if we will see more of Nil in the future but either way I am sold on this world and Lynnes's story telling skills. I don't want to go into much detail because ...well..the questions and mystery are what make Nil Nil!Amazingly I actually think that Nil Unlocked topped NIL...and I feel that is very rare in a second in a series situation!Can I talk for just one moment about these amazing covers!

"Wow…just Wow. I wish I could get away with leaving it at that folks.Black Iris simply blew my mind…in more ways than one and let me assure you…all of them were good!I confess that I knew this would be one heck of a ride after reading Raeder’s Untouchable. I have yet to put together a readable review for that title. And Black Iris blew that clear out of the water.To start Leah’s writing is amazing…lyrical, poetic, descriptive…everything that my heart yearns for in a good read.“Falling for someone is like pulling a loose thread. It happens stitch by stitch. You feel whole most of the time even while the seams pop, the knots loosen, everything that holds you together coming undone. It feels incredible, this opening of yourself to the world. Not like the unraveling it is. Only afterward do you glance down at the tangle of string around your feet that used to be a person who was whole and self-contained and realize that love is not a thing that we create. It’s an undoing.”The pacing on this one is also just perfect…I simply could not put it down. I loved the way we jumped back and forth through time…slowly learning the full story. I will also confess that I felt this was also the one drawback to the novel. Much as I enjoyed the technique, I felt that it jumped a bit too much and often I had to really stop and think hard about where and when I was which took away from my reading bliss a little bit. That said…I wasn’t hindered too much and finished this read in record time.The plot kept me guessing all the way through and then surprised and blew my mind. The relationships were real and complicated and gritty and diverse and I loved each and every one even though I honestly could not find it in me to like even one of the characters! We know from the beginning that we are dealing with a troubled and potentially unreliable narrator:“I am not the heroine of this story. And I’m not trying to be cute. It’s the truth. I’m diagnosed borderline and seriously fucked-up. I hold grudges. I bottle my hate until it ferments into poison, and then I get high off the fumes. I’m completely dysfunctional and that’s the way I like it, so don’t expect a character arc where I finally find Redemption, Growth, and Change, or learn How to Forgive Myself and Others.”But what a fascinating one!! Laney doesn’t justify or explain herself and she owns up to every aspect of herself…if that’s not a strong individual – I don’t know what is.“If I was gay, I wouldn’t need an asterisk beside my name. I could stop worrying if the girl I like will bounce when she finds out I also like dick. I could have a coming-out party without people thinking I just want attention. I wouldn’t have to explain that I fall in love with minds, not genders or body parts. People wouldn’t say I’m ‘just a slut’ or ‘faking it’ or ‘undecided’ or ‘confused.’ I’m not confused. I don’t categorize people by who I’m allowed to like and who I’m allowed to love. Love doesn’t fit into boxes like that. It’s blurry, slippery, quantum. It’s only limited by our perceptions and before we slap a label on it and cram it into some category, everything is possible.”This book is crazy screwed up with all kinds of crazy people, crazy situations, crazy relationships and well…just all things crazy and I devoured every last word. I don’t know if this book is for everyone and it was certainly outside my comfort zone a bit, but I am so pleased I read it and hope that you do too!NOTE: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, all thoughts and opinions my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28OH6FBIPBGO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476786429#wasThisHelpful","R28OH6FBIPBGO5","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Truth About Jack by Jody Gehrman may be the cutest book I’ve read in a long long time! I literally caught myself stopping and reacting out loud multiple times while reading this one. Saying things like.. “Oh my gosh”… “Aawww” ..etc throughout.Dakota and Jack were both great characters. I liked them both…even Jack despite his deceit because I knew it was coming from a good place. He was a little bit of a stalker but seeing things from his viewpoint was a comfort and never left the reader fearing his motives. They are both fleshed out enough to be believable and likable without being too complex or angst ridden as so many YA characters tend to be.The secondary characters in this one really shine especially Atilla and Joaquin…I really loved them and wanted to know more of their back stories than we got in this one.The plot follows a predicable arc but overall this story is so sweet and cute with such great characters and Jody’s flawless writing style that you won’t mind that one bit.If you are looking for a super cute read with amazing prose don’t hesitate to pick up The Truth About Jack.NOTE: Review copy rcvd from publisher, all thoughts and opinions my own","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F38OUCWI54DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URW6ERE#wasThisHelpful","R2F38OUCWI54DX","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purrfect Elements:~Nora Roberts is one of my “Go to” authors. I have yet to read one of her books that I didn’t enjoy. The Liar follows predictable patterns and and is a smooth easy read.~Shelby is a really likable character – she shows such amazing inner strength in the face of what would appear to be an insurmountable obstacle and she does it with such class. One can’t help but like and respect her.~The secondary characters really make this story. Shelby has an amazingly supportive family. Her parents, grandparents and siblings are all wonderful in their own right…and put together add up to quite the loving ensemble.~Griffin…Griffin…Griffin! Could this man be any more perfect? He’s almost, but not quite, too good to be true. The way he interacted with Callie…made me swoon :)Less than Purrfect Elements:~The suspense part of the story left a little to be desired.

"This book was like a train wreck that I just could not stop watching. The fact that I kept reading regardless of the fact that I wasn’t particularly enjoying it is why I gave it 3.5 stars instead of 3.(Darn part of me wants to change that to 4 stars.  This book just has me so conflicted!! Ahhhh!!!!)I had no issues with Jamie McGuire’s writing style and found the book easy to read with adequate descriptives to keep me happy. The story progressed at a rapid pace or maybe that was just my heart as I read it?! LOLThere was something incredibly captivating about this incredibly dysfunctional relationship that I just could not put it down.  I was pulled in immediately and found myself must more invested in the characters than I thought possible.  Yes they were both broken.  Does that excuse all of their behavior? Absolutely not! Does it explain some of it? Perhaps.I found myself both rooting for them and against them. I had such anxiety and frustration reading parts of this. I hated parts of their relationship and the ways that they treated each other and the ways that they treated their friends. But there were other times that I just got goosebumps and sighed inside…I melted….Honestly, I still don’t know if I loved or hated this one….and maybe a part of me feels like I should hate it because I can’t condone all of the actions…but then again…that is why we read…to experience different things…and as we all know…we can’t really formulate any opinions of an author by the way their characters act…I’m rambling…I really just don’t know what to say about this one…except that the title is 100% spot on…this sure was a Beautiful Disaster!NOTE: Review copy obtained at the local library!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXQDAQ40OFWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JMKN4Y#wasThisHelpful","R2NXQDAQ40OFWR","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Garden Spells, the first in this “series” is one of my all time favorite reads.  So you can imagine how thrilled I was to learn that Sarah Addison Allen was finally writing a follow up.  I’ve enjoyed her other books but none resonated with me as much as Garden Spells did.First Frost picks up about 10 years after Garden Spells and a huge part of the story follows Sydney’s daughter Bay.  There are multiple story lines here though and Claire’s proves the most interesting to me although at times the path her story took seemed a bit too contrived for my taste.  I did love the fact that it presented her with the very real question of who she was and what exactly it is that makes her who she is.  Isn’t this a question that we all ask ourselves at one point or another?I also loved getting little glimpses into the “Waverly” men.  The men that married into this family and the unique and endearing qualities that they held which allowed them to thrive within that family and support their wives throughout. They were priceless additions to the story.And you all know that I love the magic and this is magical realism done just right.  It’s so subtle and behind the scenes yet pervasive enough to have an impact.  It never once steps over the line and comes on too strong and that subtlety allows for it to be completely believable without the need for suspension of disbelief.Most of all reading this story just felt like coming home.  When I held this book in my hands and jumped in no matter where I was, I felt as if I were curled on the sofa in my warmest blanket with a fresh cup of tea and a plate of chocolate chip cookies straight from the oven.First Frost did not disappoint.  There was the trademark lush prose and dreamy environs…the strong women and the subtle magic woven throughout.  Go ahead and pick it up…I doubt you’ll be disappointed.NOTE: Review copy from publisher, all opinions my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3JOM6KO0K0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDQXASE#wasThisHelpful","R2F3JOM6KO0K0G","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dearly Departed was only my 2nd or 3rd “Zombie” read and I am constantly surprised by how much I can enjoy a concept that I avoided so thoroughly in the past.I can find no issue with Lia Habel’s writing style…the prose flowed very well and for the most part the pacing of the book was spot on.  I loved the witty repartee and banter as well as the more thoughtful and introspective moments.  There was a portion toward the end that felt a bit slow…but it wasn’t too bad. The only thing that did bother me were the POVs. I felt that there were entirely too many…and though I love Dual POVs the four or five in this book (including secondary characters) was just a bit much. I would have been quite content to hear only from Nora and Bram.I absolutely loved the world building and the “science”  in this one…to be honest that is what made the book.  Habel went to great lengths to help us understand how this world came to be… Why the society had reverted to Victorian mores despite the technological advancements and some of the logistics behind the whole zombie issue.The plot seemed to be stretched thin a bit at times and some of the antagonists seemed a bit over the top…but it carried the book along and me along with it without too many problems.  I think that as with any dystopian, steam punk, zombie type book a bit of suspended disbelief must be employed.I still have to admit that I have a very hard time viewing zombies in any sort of romantic lens…so that part of the story fell a bit flat for me….though I loved the deeper issues that the “romance” allowed the characters and therefore the reader to explore.All in all an enjoyable read but I am not 100% sure I will pick up book 2 in the series.NOTE: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, all thoughts my own","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RKSMO2YUJJZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345523318#wasThisHelpful","R2RKSMO2YUJJZ8","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to read new Beth Revis since the Across The Universe series is one of my favorites and The Body Electric did not disappoint!  Although I never fully connected to Ella or any of the characters for that matter and the romance left a lot to be desired...this was still a huge win for me.The world building was phenomenal.  I loved the imagery of New Venice, the upper and lower levels,  the district of floating boats ...What can I say:  Beth Revis is a master storyteller and she builds such intricate, well developed and rich worlds.....I was sucked in from the beginning despite the slow pace at the onset of the novel.The writing is also fluid and colorful...there is something about Beth's writing that just makes me want to take my shoes off, curl up and dive in...I feel perfectly at home in her books and have to force myself to come up for air. I was sucked in from the beginning despite the slow pace at the onset of the novel.And then there is the ""science"".  Androids and nanobots, and reveries and floating cities.  What is already and what could really be?  She makes Science Fiction fun and accessible...and at the end...makes it feel so real that you'll start questioning where the science ends and the fiction begins.And can I mention the ""Easter Eggs""? I think I shouted out loud when I noticed the couple of Across The Universe tie ins. How cool that we have this wonderful stand alone book (Yes, you heard that right...I was thrilled to learn that this was a stand alone. Truth be told...I think there are just way too many series in YA literature!!) and yet we can still feel that connection to Across The Universe!!I wouldn't have minded a bit more explanation about Ella's hallucinations/reveries and her father...but honestly...the questions that I'm left with are part of why I enjoyed this so much.

"Five reasons to pick up Spell Booked:1. The Premise: Witches - Need I say more? You all know that Witches are my absolute favorite and this book sure delivered. Add in a few feline familiars and this was sure to be a hit with me:) Although I wasn't a fan of the idea of magic fading over time (I personally believe that it would only get stronger with experience and practice) , I did love how the Lavene's worked that kink into the premise of needing to find new witches to take over the coven.  Plus it made for some pretty funny moments to see how their magic faltered and some great moments to cheer when it didn't.  It also helped us focus on the importance of working together and building relationships which was what ultimately kept them all strong.2. The Main Characters - Mollie, Elsie, & Olivia are so quirky and lovable that I connected with them immediately even though the idea of retiring is far from where I am at in my life right now.3. The Setting - Small town, waterfront, a quaint business ...all the makings of a perfect backdrop!4. The Secondary Characters -Especially Mollie's husband.  I was so thrilled when Mollie finally clued him in to the paranormal world that she'd been hiding from him for all those years.5. The Friendships - As I stated previously, this book was all about relationships and how they make us better.  I loved how connected these three gals were:)A fun read though I didn't 100% connect with the main characters:)NoteReview copy from Author, All thoughts my own","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BF3IC3EHT6GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042526825X#wasThisHelpful","R2BF3IC3EHT6GY","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really liked the design of the Beam N Read. The light was simple to use…simple hang it around one’s neck and open to turn on. The light alone was nice and bright, but I loved it with the two filters. I think it did a great job of lighting the pages of my current read while keeping my hands free for holding the book and turning pages. When using the filters , I definitely felt as if the diffused light was perfect for reading without being so bright as to keep me awake and stimulated. A great thing for those of us who like to read to wind down at the end of a long day. I also loved that if I needed to get up to sneak to the kitchen or the bathroom…the light stayed on and lit my way perfectly…again no hands needed.The only one drawback was that it was a bit cumbersome if I had the blankets pulled up over my chest…but with a bit of situating I was able to get myself comfortable and the light lined up perfectly for my book.Product rcvd for review, all thoughts and opinions my own","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G03S736VC4EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KPJ1PA#wasThisHelpful","R2G03S736VC4EO","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another very cute and fun addition to the Lucky Harbor series:) Jill Shalvis delivers yet again with Chloe’s story in Head Over Heels. I actually enjoyed Chloe’s story almost as much as Maddie’s and even more than Tara’s. The charming small town setting with all of the sweet and kooky secondary characters just adds to the pleasure.All of Jill’s stories are so fun and easy to read, this one is no exception. The prose and dialogue just flows effortlessly , allowing the reader to get caught up in the emotions of the characters…and boy are there emotions aplenty here! We’re never really in doubt about how the story will end, but we’re so delighted with getting to know the characters better that one just can’t stop reading.Chloe is such an interesting character…she’s an independent thinker, free spirit who deep down actually craves roots and family and solidity. Sawyer is more than her match…he comes with his own unresolved issues and together they are pure fireworks.We also continue to see the growth and strength of the relationship between the three sisters and the three friends (Jax, Ford, & of course Sawyer). This is perhaps the best part of this series for me.Head Over Heels (Lucky Harbor #3) more than delivers!Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUCYN2YSNGSO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RCNGQW#wasThisHelpful","RUCYN2YSNGSO5","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sweetest Thing is a great follow up to Simply Irresistible (the 1st in the Lucky Harbor series). Shalvis manages to once again charm us with a great small town romance that has just enough of all the most important elements (family, friendship, humor, secrets, heat, etc.) to make this a win.Although I didn’t love Tara and her story quite as much as I did Maddie and hers, I was charmed and captivated throughout. Tara is a great character….a really strong woman with lots of hidden vulnerabilities. It was great to learn more about Tara and Ford’s past and see how they reconnected and strengthened their relationship. Although the synopsis makes this one sound as if it is a love triangle do not fear, I promise that is not at all the case.I also loved seeing more of Lucky Harbor and the developing relationships between the three sisters who are the focus of the series at this point.

"I usually love thrillers and romantic suspense, but there was just something so unsettling about this story that I forced myself to stop listening after about 45 minutes…even though, I’ll be honest…I was really captivated and wanted to know what was going to happen next. I just had such an uneasy feeling, a huge knot, in the pit of my stomach. I have to give huge kudos to Kepnes for being able to evoke such a raw feeling in me. I may eventually go back to this one…but I just didn’t enjoy the feeling I experienced while listening to it if that makes any sense…","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNV6291JDILP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGVH9LI#wasThisHelpful","RNV6291JDILP5","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Good:-I absolutely loved the way family relationships were brought into the forefront as Ardis and Wendel travel to Wendels Prussian home and familial ties were examined.-Wolfram…He may have had a bit part…but I loved him :) And his nickname-Wolfie:)-We really learned a lot more about Ardis and Wendel and their backstories and families.-The tech…from automatons to clockwork wasps that lay clockwork larvae to an amazingly awesome clockwork dragon…I loved it all.  Although, I admit that I am still clueless about steampunk, dieselpunk, clockwork, technomancy, magic and how it all connects or even what is what….I still was able to just put my questions aside and enjoy how cool it all was.-The non stop action.  Storms of Lazarus never slowed down…and because of that it was so hard to put down.-The romance continues developing quite nicely until we can feel almost secure…at least at points. And I can’t wait to see what the future holds based upon the new turn that was confirmed at the end.-Wendel has more of his incredibly sexy badass moments…and Ardis benefits from his protection a time or two…Yet the women are the true standouts in this book and I loved how tough they were!-The battle scene at the end as well as many of the action packed incidents kept me on the edge of my seat.-That cover is beyond awesome…I wouldn’t mind a bit of an older version of Wendel…but the over all effect is spectacular!The Not So Good:-The blushing.  One male character (Konstantin) blushed during each and every interaction he had with another male and he seemed fairly awkward. It was hard to believe he was in the position of authority that he held considering how submissively he behaved around everyone.-Some of the scenes seemed a bit forced…and the sentence structure sometimes seemed very staccato …most of the narrative is told with very short to the point sentences.***Spoiler alert***-The especially cagey way that Wendel was acting…especially around other men…but also around the vampire chick.  What the heck?  Just as he and Ardis are really deepening their relationship…a male ex…a male he appears to be currently interested in and and undead vixen are added to the mix? I consider myself fairly open minded..I enjoyed another budding romance that occurred…but it is hard for me to feel that Ardis is safe in this relationship if she has other women AND men to worry about!***End spoiler alert***Final Thoughts:A well written and fast paced sequel…Storms of Lazarus delivers lots of actions, great character development and lots of interesting tech. I’m not sure if there will be a 3rd book in this series…but I really hope that there is.  I have a feeling that we are building to an amazing conclusion.Note: Review copy rcvd from Author, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YO3TQC8L5MFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500491594#wasThisHelpful","R2YO3TQC8L5MFD","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:~Morley does an amazing job of keeping the reader actively wondering and pondering about the world she’s created.~All of the characters are so well fleshed out and multi-dimensional that at times it’s easy for the lines between good and bad, right and wrong to blur.~The amount of detail put into describing the silo and Dobbs was exemplary and made her life below that much more realistic and harrowing.~Even though I suspected the turn of events that occurred in the 2nd half of the book, I was still somehow surprised…I suppose Morley made me doubt myself and I love that I could never 100% accurately predict what was coming.~It’s easy to understand what Blythe is going through and feel for her.  The development of her character alone and how she grew and developed within the constraints of her abduction is amazing.The Not So Good:~I wish that a bit more of her early days, months and years below and been fleshed out to give a better feel for the psychological trauma that she went through.~I think that the transition between the 1st half of the book and the second could have been a bit smoother.  It almost felt as if I were reading two books.~I had trouble placing the time period for this book.  At times I assumed it was current small town America…but Blythe’s behavior and the details from before her abduction almost felt like it could have been the 50′s.Final Thoughts:What is Reality?  What is Myth?  I love books that make me think and keep me guessing.

"The Good:~Though this book didn’t have what I typically consider a cozy feel it more than made up for that with it’s wonderful quirkiness.~I loved Alanis and her sarcastic personality.  We get to know her little by little throughout the story and by the middle of the book I was completely in love with her character.~It’s no secret that paranormal cozies are one of my favorite genres and this one delivers without being too out there.  Is there really something to the Tarot? Or is at all about the readers ability to read not the cards but rather the customer?  I’ll let you decide, but either way…it makes for a great addition to the story.~Well written and incredibly entertaining, this one captured me from the first page and I was hooked until the end.~The interactions between Logan and Alanis were priceless.~It’s also no secret that I love “woowoo,” the Tarot card elements of this story fascinated me and have renewed my interest to break out the deck I bought years ago and learn.~Lots of clues were sprinkled throughout. You may or may not guess who done it…but regardless you’ll be entertained until the end.The Not So Good:~I wish that we had gotten to know a bit more about the town and it’s residents.  Unlike most  cozies, the town wasn’t really a “character” in this one…I suspect though that in future books in this series we’ll learn more about Berdache and the town folk.Final Thoughts:This book was very simply so much fun.

"After I Do takes us on the amazing journey of one couple from the very beginning to what might very well be the end....and you won't want to miss one moment of the trip.  We see their relationship progress from the first stages of infatuation, through first kisses, first apartments, first dog and on.  Unlike most conventional romance stories which end at the Happily Ever After, Taylor Jenkins Reid  takes us beyond that point in After I Do...to show us what happens after the HEA.  And it's not always pretty.We see Lauren and Ryan go from being the intimately connected couple that can't live without each other to a couple that almost can't even stand each other...and it's not an easy path to walk with them.  To see all the little things that added up to years of resentments and distaste...was both heartbreaking and frightening...because throughout...one can help but wonder...could this happen to me?The characters, the story, all of it was so wonderfully believable and easy to connect with.  I think that someone at any stage of a relationship or even hoping for a relationship would find it hard to put this one down.I laughed, I cried, I wondered why they made the hard choices they did, and most of all I rooted for them...and in doing so rooted for myself and every other married woman out there.Final Thoughts:This incredibly well written and thought provoking read will make you re-examine all of your relationships and how you define love. My first taste of Taylor Jenkins Reid, this certainly won't be my last.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WPEP8SHNR4IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476712840#wasThisHelpful","R2WPEP8SHNR4IW","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:~I love the small town setting of Crystal Haven…Eastman makes us feel as if we live there and know all the residents.~Clyde and her entire family are such an amazing bunch.  From Aunt Violet to Seth…this book would not be the same without the multiple generations all working together.~Witches…need I say more.  OK I’ll say a little more…I love the paranormal aspects of this series and the fact that all of the family members have such different talents.~Even the pets lend a hand..love Baxter and Tuffy:)~The friends and supporting cast (Diana, Thom, Alex, etc) all add so much to the story without taking anything away from the Fortune’s.~A sweet slowly, maybe too slowly at times, re-developing love between Clyde and Mac gives us a taste of romance without overpowering the plotline.The Not So Good:~I wish that there were a bit more of the paranormal elements and I wish that they were a bit more closely connected to the resolution of the mystery.  Sometimes it feels as if they are just thrown in there but aren’t really integral to the story.Final Thoughts:Dawn Eastman has created a wonderful setting and a great cast of characters that I can’t wait to spend time with again.

"Tin Star started out with so much potential. Though an enjoyable read, I did feel a bit let down. Cecil Castellucci gives us the amazing backdrop of an isolated space station and one lone human girl left to survive among not so friendly alien races with little to no hope for any sort of rescue.  The highlights of the story were the interpersonal relationships that developed many times despite, although a few times due to, the cultural differences and divides between the races on the station.Truthfully though, I found that this book seemed to be a lot longer than it actually was…the plot postponed and day to day life and survival taking the forefront… led to a pretty slow read.  Perhaps this is building up to a sequel?  I’m not sure if I would pick it up but I still feel that there is a lot of potential here that could be fashioned into something fantastic.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDI9HCYMNIMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596437758#wasThisHelpful","R1GDI9HCYMNIMV","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marcus Sedgwick has another winner. Young Adult that pushes the boundaries, She is Not Invisible is definitely a read that all ages would find engaging. Laureth is an amazing character. Precocious beyond her years and amazing by any standards…all that she accomplishes is mind boggling.  The kid brother with the unique “super power” who is loyal and supportive to a fault.  I loved the setting and the characterizations.  The way the main character rationalized, justified and then simply went with whatever came.  I loved them both.The plot was a bit thin, but I mostly didn’t mind.  It was merely the vehicle used to take Laureth and Benjamin on this amazing ride.  I loved all of the little peaks in the father’s notebook and the speculation about coincidences.  Quite different in tone and content than my previous Sedgwick read, Midwinterblood, this book nevertheless confirmed for me that Sedgwick deserves a place on my “Authors to Read” shelf.  This book is the ultimate YA road trip…but mixed with some mystery, a little thriller, and great philosophical debates…it crosses the divide easily into literary fiction.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VN2DDAM3VK0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596438010#wasThisHelpful","R1VN2DDAM3VK0T","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:~With a fascinating premise this YA Dystopia manages to stand a bit outside of the usual YA pack.~Fast paced and well written, I flew through this one. There was never a dull moment.~Thalia was a thoroughly likeable character, I couldn’t help but root for her. I loved that once her mind was opened she became a sponge, thirsting for more knowledge.~I loved many of the secondary characters including Betta, Yaz, and especially Grandma Apple.~The complex familial relationships and the muddled lines of right and wrong kept me invested. I like grey areas.~The lengths to which the corporation was willing to go to maintain its monopoly, rang sadly and frighteningly true.The Not So Good:~I had a really hard time believing in the technology and advancements presented in this world and that detracted from my overall experience.~The character of Basil was not really terribly well developed, what I felt I knew of him I didn’t really like-he was a follower who didn’t really evidence any true intelligence or desire to fight for what was right.~The romance developed way too quickly. Points off for insta-love.~Many of the adults felt like caricatures of characters.Final Thoughts:An entertaining and quick read that presents a new twist on YA dystopia but doesn’t live up to it’s full potential.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YVQDZZYHRJ0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250028299#wasThisHelpful","R1YVQDZZYHRJ0W","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:-I loved getting both Dean and Josie’s perspectives with the dual POV in Savage Drift.-The development of Josie’s character in this conclusion to the trilogy amazed me.  She’s struggling between what she was, what she thinks she is, and what she has the potential to become.  (And to be honest: in a  way aren’t we all)-Secondary characters again become small scene stealers…especially Mario.-The strength of friendship and family (even the Monument 14 redefined version) is inspiring-As with the previous books in this series, the writing style and pacing are spot on…I could not put this one down despite my desire to savor the conclusion-I was fascinated by the exploration of the long term effects of the chemical leak and how the governments were dealing with the falloutThe Not So Good:-I didn’t feel the same level of emotional intensity in Savage Drift that I did in the 1st two books in the series.-The last third of the book felt just a tad contrived, things were perhaps a bit too easy and the loose ends wrapped up faster than I’d have thought possible.Final Thoughts:I have so much love for this series! Emmy Laybourne paints a frighteningly realistic portrait of  ordinary teens coming of age during an extraordinary time.  The details and worldbuilding leave nothing to be desired and as I’ve long declared – the highlight of this series is the character development at which this author excels.

"With amazingly written science fiction and deep underlying questions, Dark Eden easily crosses the divide between Genre fiction and Literary fiction. Every aspect of this read simply blew me away.  The language is rich and deep...descriptive enough that I could feel myself completely immersed in this new Eden.  The characters are well developed and thoroughly interesting..I could not get enough of them or the back stories of the first settlers and how this small band of humans came to exist on such an inhospitable planet. The story and struggles of John Redlantern and all of the minor characters were full of  real depth and consequences...keeping me invested and reading long past my bedtime.I was absolutely fascinated to see how Beckett drew this new world, how the language and customs had developed and declined over the 150+ years since the landing.  All the ""new"" words and terms may be daunting at first but they add so much texture to the world building that I fear the picture he paints would be incomplete without them.  Becket explores the way religion and story telling, tradition and ritual inform the society and how it develops while still keeping the reader completely engaged and waiting to see where this tale will next turn.From one angle Dark Eden is pure YA Science Fiction...the coming of age story, the struggle to survive and to find ones place not only in this new world order but also within the hierarchy of society as it's developed.  This novel is so much more than that though.  Scratch the surface and we issues of societal decline, questions of gender roles, disabilities, sexuality and more.  I believe this book fully earns a place as literary fiction as well.Beyond thought provoking...gritty, complex, amazingly imaginative and completely compelling...one of my favorite reads so far this year!Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QK6BXMX01LU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO60AVO#wasThisHelpful","R2QK6BXMX01LU0","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:Flawlessly written, Kristin Hannah delivers another emotional roller coasterI loved Firefly Lane and the story of TullyandKate and was thrilled to see a follow up which further develops Tully’s storyThe character development (which I feel is Hannah’s best talent) shines yet again in Fly AwayHannah’s characters are sooo real – their stories may not be fun but they are 100% believable and relatableI was immediately drawn in to Tully’s back story and wanted to know moreBy the last quarter of this book I just could not put it down…I knew that something good was coming and it couldn’t get there fast enough for me:)Fly Away as with many of Kristin Hannah’s books really makes one think -Life and people’s actions are not so black and white as they may seem.  One never knows what true motivations and reasons people have for what they do and sayThat cover!!! Need I say more!The Not So Good:So full of angst and heartache, the first two thirds of this novel are gut wrenching, but if you can make it through…it is more than worth it.Final Thoughts:Kristin Hannah knocks another one out of the park with this intensely emotional follow up to Firefly Lane.

"The Good:Broken Arrows was a really fun quick read.  At only 174 pages, I flew through this one as I usually read books that are much longer. I feared at first that there wouldn’t be enough time to fully develop a good story in such a short period of time but my fears were soon laid to rest.Chelsey Butler manages to create a fun and whimsical setting complete with a town named Fable, a menagerie of supernatural beings, a cozy bed and breakfast and some great main and side characters.I absolutely loved the setting and was immediately taken back to the days that I myself wished to own a bed and breakfast – coupled with the murder mystery weekend that Cari plans…this was a dream setting.Cari was completely likeable and believable…as were all of the secondary characters. I’m really hoping to see more of them in the next book.The romance developed quickly but was also believable due to the backstory. I can’t wait to get to know Mike better.The Not So Good:I did feel that the writing could have been a bit more detailed.  Butler has a very pared down style that seems to limit itself more to the action of the characters than to description of the surroundings.  I think the book could have been even more charming had she painted more of a picture of the picturesque town and it’s inhabitants.The story ended very abruptly and left me hanging.  At the end I was left wondering where the last few chapters were!Final Thoughts:This was a cute light-hearted quick read that I read in almost one setting. Aside from the open ending,  I thoroughly enjoyed it and can’t wait to read the second book.Source: Author via Book Tour Host for Review","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18U3BLSK9UKTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1495469506#wasThisHelpful","R18U3BLSK9UKTK","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:-This well written book pulled me in and grabbed my attention from the first chapter and kept me reading late into the night.-The action was non stop. It never let up which made putting the book down near impossible.-The main character of Tate is completely believable.  A very smart and athletic teen who still makes inappropriate choices at times, but manages to handle an incredibly difficult situation with amazing aplomb.-The supporting characters are also key to Scan’s success. Christina especially shines as she selflessly stands by Tate’s side, despite not always being sure of where she stands with him.  She must be going through so much inner turmoil of her own, yet without her strength I doubt Tate would have lasted a day.-The MacGyver moments.  I loved Macgyver when I was a kid (Yes I am dating myself…lol) And there were just enough moments sprinkled throughout Scan when Tate pulls his own MacGyver moods to make me feel nostalgic.-This book is more than just action and aliens.  It makes one think: What does it mean to be human?The Not So Good:-Love the cover, but I don’t quite feel that it represents this book as well as it should, perhaps it’s foreshadowing for things to come?-The Cliff Hanger! Now we need to wait until 2015 to see what happens!Final Thoughts:I whipped through this book in no time and enjoyed every minute.  An action packed science fiction read with a smidge of romance, a lot of courage and ingenuity, and some crazy survivalists, Scan is sure to appeal to a wide variety of reader and even some non readers.  And if you need a good palate cleanser in between other reads, Scan fits the bill perfectly.NOTE: Review copy rcvd from publisher in exchange for this honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FODR4ZPXZFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399160655#wasThisHelpful","R20FODR4ZPXZFC","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes place quite a few years before the action in What's a Witch to Do? so in essence it is more like a prequel than a sequel.  I actually liked the idea of getting to now some of the secondary characters from the first book a little bit better.  And since I now know that this series is not a cozy mystery...my expectations going into this one were much more realistic and I didn't miss the cozy aspects as it did in the first in the series.The pacing  and writing style weren't effortless but neither did they really leave anything to be desired either. And the character and plot development were clear and easy to follow.I really had a hard time connecting to the characters in this one.  Generally I love real, flawed characters...but I just couldn't get Vivian or the choices she made...and Jason just fell a bit flat to me.  I also sort of felt that the whole story line was just a bit ho hum.

"Gorgeous illustrations accompany this charming tale of the woman in the shoe and what happens on a particularly gusty day.  I loved how one nursery rhyme ran into the next as errant items lost in the wind are paired with their owners and the woman and her family trek from locale to locale gathering up the lost items and attempting to return them.  I thought this a great (and fun) lesson about helping others and returning things that do not belong to you.I was a little perplexed at the end where it appeared that they never actually had the chance to return anything...and all was simply set right again by the wind?  I don't know...maybe I missed something...but I just felt that we didn't get that moral at the end to which we were being led.Overall though...you and your little ones won't regret the time spent with this lovely book.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AHSM1HDUQALC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805086889#wasThisHelpful","R2AHSM1HDUQALC","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sea of Tranquility captured me from the first chapter…I just could not stop listening.  Lesson learned again…I do like New Adult…despite my hesitations…with one caveat…I don’t like straight contemporary.  I need some torment, some angst…and Millay more than delivers that here.Katja Millay crafts an heartbreaking story of loss and pain and faith and hope all wrapped into a beautiful package.  The writing is fluid and descriptive and completely captivating. At times it almost feels like reading poetry…which I love. We spend most of our time inside our two main characters minds and learning from them, as little or as much as they are willing to share…and growing with them throughout the book as they slowly open up to each other and to us.Both of our main characters and POVs (we alternate between the two), Nastya and Josh, are incredibly broken individuals. They manage to put up quite believable facades to the rest of the world, but slowly over the course of the novel manage to connect with each other, open up and eventually reveal themselves for who they really are.  I loved both of them from the beginning. Smart and witty, quite a bit precocious…just how I like my Young Adult and New Adult characters.  These two will completely tear at your heartstrings…guaranteed. I’ll admit that as with many books, the miscommunications or things left unsaid that at times ended up leading to further problems, did bother me. Much less so with this book though…because I could so clearly see and feel what Josh and Nastya felt.  I could hold almost nothing against them.  I just wanted to scoop them both up and hug them tightly…I was that attached.Josh and Nastya make a great couple and the romance aspect of this novel was incredibly well done.  There was a lot more depth here though.  The whole mystery surrounding Nastya story and who she “really” was…the interactions with classmates and teachers…and ultimately the fight and growth that they each had to come to terms with their pasts and manage to overcome left me in tears by the conclusion.Secondary characters also add to this tale.  Drew and his family in particular are amazing…and to be honest I wouldn’t mind seeing Drew pop up in  a story of his own.  He and Josh have an amazing relationship…one that grows even stronger in The Sea of Tranquility.Bottom line this is an amazingly written story of two extremely broken teens,  who with each other, find solace, strength, hope and eventually the ability to be themselves. No review I write can do justice to this story…all I can leave you with is the strong recommendation to pick this one up.  I promise it will be a stand out.Narration Notes: Kirby Heyborne & Candace Thaxton did an amazing job and I’d not hesitate to pick up another book narrated by one of these two.  They completely captured the voices of our MCs and delivered more than just a straight narration but managed to convey all the feelings as well.Note: Review copy rcvd from Publisher, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QO4QZBBBFBGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R44MQ8#wasThisHelpful","R2QO4QZBBBFBGF","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cress, the third in Marissa Meyer's Lunar Chronicles, more than delivers. This installment starts off quickly and the pace maintains a rapid speed straight through until the end.... leaving the reader breathless and wanting more. Marissa Meyer's writing style is concise and smooth...giving us just enough descriptives without bogging us down...and thus keeping the reader engaged and unwilling to put this one down.Not only do we get to know Cinder, Kai, Wolf and Scarlet better but we are introduced to Crescent Moon and really get to know ""Captain"" Thorne in this book. Cress is simply an adorable character...very innocent, very naive and also incredibly brilliant. To top it off she is a true romantic at heart:) A great combination. And then there is Thorne *sigh*. I'll admit that he grated on me a bit at first...but then little by little his true colors came out and I was quite captivated and charmed in spite of myself.The plot moves much further along in Cress and we even get a little bit of a tease for The Lunar Chronicles Book 4 -Winter at the end. I can't wait to see how this tale plays out, can't wait to get to know Winter and can't wait to see more of Scarlet and Wolf (my personal favorites). If you've enjoyed this series thus far, I guarantee that Cress delivers. You won't regret picking it up.NOTE: Review copy rcvd from publisher .

"I’m not sure why I resisted New Adult book and issues books for so long.  From the moment I started listening to this one I was completely invested.  It made my drive to and from work just fly by and many times I’d have to force myself out of the car…I just didn’t want to stop listening. I didn’t know exactly what to expect based upon the cliche title (I have a bad habit of not reading a book’s synopsis before picking it up…just as I hate movie trailers) but this was not it…it was so much better than I expected.Mummert paints a picture that is at once completely believable and yet totally horrifying.  I felt for Cass from the very start and completely connected to her.  As her whole situation was slowly revealed I couldn’t help but weep with sympathy and frustration at all that she went through.  Did she make all the same choices that I’d like to think I would have in her shoes? No…but that didn’t make me like her any less.And Tucker, oh boy! I’ve always had a literary weakness for his type and he delivers –  tattoos, rock, smooth voice  and smooth moves and all.  But most of all…he is genuine…and that is what draws us and Cass in so deep.This book is the perfect combination of sweetness and angst, love and heartache…I couldn’t put it down and I couldn’t wait for more.Narration Notes:  Grace Grant delivered perfectly.  I completely bought into her as Cass and couldn’t imagine a better narrator.Note: Review copy received in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2FTVEKCNGOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476732027#wasThisHelpful","R1R2FTVEKCNGOX","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After loving the first in this series, I was a little let down by the sequel. I guess after all that Cass and Tucker went through in White Trash Beautiful…it would be hard to top.  White Trash Damaged deals with how Cass, Tucker, the band, and the new manager deal with life on the road.  I felt like we lost a little something from each of the old characters in this one.  The dynamic changed a bit and although it did enjoy this one, sometimes the plot just felt a bit too contrived.  I had a much harder time believing the low level angst here than I did the horror of book one.On the plus side though, we did get to know the rest of the band and some other secondary characters a whole lot better which made for some very interesting listening. I look forward to the conclusion of this trilogy as I suspect that we’ll delve more into some other characters lives and deal less with Cass and Tucker who’s story really could have ended with book one.Narration Notes: Grace Grant delivered yet again.  She is perfect for this series.Note: Review copy received in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS81LRYS21KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476732086#wasThisHelpful","R2OS81LRYS21KG","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Good:-I really enjoyed the gothic feel of  The Book of Blood and Shadow and the mystery that Wasserman immersed us in.-The setting was unique and fascinating...how many books can you name that are primarily set in Prague?-The writing style and descriptive narrative flowed quite well despite the slow pace...I wouldn't say this was a book that I couldn't put down, but it was certainly a book that I loved picking back up.-All of the main characters are nerds and language nerds at that. Even the ""popular girl"" is really masking an inner nerd:) I could not help but like them.-The glimpses into historic Prague and Elizabeth Westons life were incredibly interesting.-Eli - such a mystery but one that you'll really want to unwrap.The Not So Good:-By the end I was feeling that this was all a little far fetched and had to do my best to suspend disbelief (It was actually very easy to do!)-I never actually ""loved"" any of the characters or really felt connected.  That said I did really like and admire them even though I didn't have that full connection.Final Thoughts:I thoroughly enjoyed this read...complex characters, a fascinating mystery and amazing setting...all in all a winner! I recommend this to those who don't mind a slower paced book and who love Dan Brown's Robert Langdon (The DaVinci Code) series.  I know I'll be on the lookout for my next Robin Wasserman read.Source: Purchased for my Personal Library from another vendor","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3OUXX1KAGKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375868763#wasThisHelpful","RD3OUXX1KAGKZ","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erin Morgenstern paints a picture in black that is so vivid and strong that I can’t but pray to see it developed on the big screen while at the same time worrying that it will never ever manage to live up to the beauty that is The Night Circus. Amazingly complex…this novel spans multiple POVs and multiple time frames to tell the story of  Marco, Celia, and the Circus (which is so much more than a setting…it literally takes on a life of it’s own.) I loved the myriad of circus folk and hangers-on that we came to know and appreciate as well as this timeless love story.The Night Circus itself though wins the show here.

"Captivated from page one, I could not put The Night Strangers down.  It’s no secret that small town New England is my favorite setting…Bohjalian does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the town and distilling it into a character of it’s own. That said we also have a plethora of other fascinating personas populating this family and village.  We are slowly drawn in to the story of the Lintons and then the camera lens starts widening to encompass the whole of their small New England town.  All of the characters are so well drawn that we feel as if they are our own neighbors…so well known and yet..do any of us really know what goes on behind closed doors???And then there are the witches…Incredibly well written, haunting and and quite a bit disturbing, this page turner will keep you up late and you’ll barely regret it the next day.NOTE:  Review copy rcvd in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUW5XR3WL1GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307394999#wasThisHelpful","R1EUW5XR3WL1GE","A3B7Z6FWHW1PP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3B7Z6FWHW1PP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As someone who has also traveled the other way--the path of white magic and light beings and meditation and ascended Masters, then on to Masters that were supposed to be higher than the mere ascended ones...yada yads....I found this book interesting for the DARK SIDE information it contains and it DID help me have more discernment for ALL paths--especially those that profess to be  LIGHT paths, as Lucifer/Satan both are light bearers, and false light versus true light beyond duality etc. I found that information useful but there are a lot of BUTS:1. He doesn't tell the 'story' in a way that brings you along AS HE LEARNED. He keeps interrupting his own dialogue to insert ""Jesus is the only way"" into the progression of his story--which totally stops any real perceptions from his then-life view and keeps stopping the story, stopping how we learn through 'errors' and...2. It would have been much better to read of his progression through the dark side and AS HE BEGAN TO SEE THE ERRORS OF HIS WAYS, --as they happened--to then progress WITH HIM as he starts to understand how he has been mis-led, to read the REAL STORY, read  of his misgivings, that progress into insights, to seeing TRUTH etc...THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN IS SO JUMBLED AND POORLY WRITTEN THAT HIS 'STORY' BECOMES OBLITERATED FROM JUMPING TO THE END RESULT OF HIS JOURNEY OVER AND OVER w/SIDE COMMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION he throws into the mix RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TELLING 'HIS STORY'.He decided that Jesus is Lord and he was worshipping a false light in Lucifer--OK...BUT THAT HAPPENED SLOWLY, DOWN THE LINE!I would have much rather read that story uninterrupted by christian diatribe about Jesus interspersed throughout the book.NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG--I agree with his conclusions in some ways and not in others:He is very prejudiced racially and homophobic, making racial references that are 'tells' to how he sees the world NOT to Christian-like; condemning everyone who doesn't believe as HE DOES--in HIS PARTICULAR WAY OF BELIEVING IN JESUS--is somehow better than everyone else's Christianity...SO HOW IS HIS CHRISTIANITY ANY DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER DIVERGENT BRANDS OF CHRISTIANITY WHO ALL THINK THEY HAVE THE TRUTH?I would prefer to believe that Jesus is not a judgement hellfire and damnation being and he preached Divine Love--and that is he were here today, walking the planet--He would NEVER condemn anyone, but always show love in all situations.So while this was informative on Satanism and I saw how the path I followed for man years 'borrowed' a LOT of it and put it into a 'false light' path where members THOUGHT they were in the LIGHT...but were being mis-led...I wish he'd told the story as it happened, AS HE LEARNED THE HARD WAY. without 'spoiling' it by all the side notes and judgements and inserted rants.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE POWERFUL IN ITS MESSAGE!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PL5OIEU01LP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0937958417#wasThisHelpful","R29PL5OIEU01LP","A19NAKWN2HD289","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NAKWN2HD289?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this for epoxy resin to get bubbles out.While its a cheap alternative to the more expensive heat guns-it has some drawbacks too.1. The power of the heat is not that strong--it is HOT, but the 'air' doesn't push very well. On epoxy, it doesn't blend it very well. Burns the surface easily as there is just not enough AIR behind the heat.2. The tip stays hot a LONG time after turned off so BE CAREFUL! (kids, birds, your fingers...pets noses...)3.

"There are NOT as advertised. If you look CLOSELY at the pictures, you'll see why. The way it is made is awful. The finger pockets are wide and there is NO WEBBING SPACE SO NO NET 'PULL' between fingers which is what these are FOR!!! so, HOW will it work?DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!But the more $$ ones with true webbing between the fingers. I use these for bodysurfing swimming out in outside breaking Hawaiian surf and these would not work AT ALL--since they only cover the hand and add NO thrust to the stroke.

"I was dubious about this cheapy thing but it actually works! I placed it over my front door after spraying it with white plastic adhering paint very carefully to not get the on off keyhole or the sun parts so it would match my house trim. I went out and when I returned, after just hanging it several hours ago-- it was ON in the 'dim light mode' and was just great. The motion of me walking to my door turned it on bright mode--but even the dim was enough to SEE the keyhole in my door. EXACTLY what I needed it for. Electricity is highest rates in the USA in Hawaii, and I wanted to SEE my lock on my door well if I came home after dark w/o having to turn on lights in the daytime. The LED light is BRIGHT! It doesn't span that wide an area but it is great for what I needed it for. you'd need more than one for a walkway instead of a 'spot' light.CONS: Only thing that could be better is the on/off key is weird as you have to use a teeny metal piece sent with it I almost threw away...and the MODE has no identifying markers so you have no idea WHAT modes its on until you see it work. The little 'key' you poke into it to turn it on is a hassle. Wish it came in white too! THERE IS NO PEEL AND STICK FOR THIS ALTHOUGH IT STATES THERE IS! Many other reviewers noted that as well so the ad itself needs updating to be accurate.All in all? Great little contraption. Will add on if it doesn't last.22JAN 2015***DOESN'T LAST.

"THESE RUN SMALLI ordered a medium but they shipped a small/med size since there doesn't seem to BE a size medium. It barely fit my head. I have long hip length hair so when put up--it would not even go ON. I returned it for a size large which went on but the fit seems a bit off. The chin strap should be PADDED as it cinches right under your jaw and is VERY uncomfortable against the neck, especially the hard plastic snap. I padded mine and it is ok by threading a rubber diving hose over it and then finding a soft tube that worked better.This is one of the FEW neoprene hats with a DECENT BRIM, and here in Hawaii, we need all the shade we can get out there. I use it for bodysurfing and the waves knock it off a lot and the strap chokes me as the hat fills with water. So--ANOTHER  design change--this time I cut 2 small slashes over the ears so water has an EXIT. I put glue around the cut edges (wetsuit glue) to try and reinforce the raw edges so time will tell...It's a POOR DESIGN that needs work, but there just are NO hoods out there with straps that cover the BACK of the head (Most are skull-cap design) with a brim so ya take what ya can get!**Someone needs to design a better version with a leash divit too, padded strap, and ear vents with a REAL brim, not the floppy tiny thing most of these have.

Foot pocket is MUCH softer and comfy than the older version but so is the fin--it is not as stiff as the older blue ducks but still works well. I had a lot aof waves the first time I wore the new version from the extra thrust of the fins over Dafin in an outside overhead break. 5 stars for the comfort changes!

My all around fav but not for bigger outside breaks because of the amount of kicking needed with such a short fin. GREAT thrust but only for smaller waves some people wear em in big stuff but mostly lifeguards who run with them on so a short fin is a must. All the Hawaii guards have em.3. UDT fins: now are almost the same price if you ankles can handle them as they are STIFF blades and take power to kick with--for serious people with strong ankles and calves. INCREDIBLE thrust. My bro still wears these and he can power thru sections and come out into the face of the wave after getting covered in whitewater. Cannot do that with a 'normal' fin.

They'd be great for bodyboarding or shore break but nothing bigger outside as the kick was flimsy and the fin too flexible.

"PROS:1. These fin socks have a seam along the toe-line, NOT ONLY down the middle of the foot like most fin socks. The others eventually wear out at the toe area because there is stress from having the seam ONLY in the midfoot instead of around the toe-line--the toes poke thru eventually. NOT THESE BABIES.2. BECAUSE THESE HAVE A TOELINE SEAM, they don't wear out, don't shred in 4 months like the others do.GREAT!3. I wear them bodysurfing because they go over the ankle and help me not get any more scars from fins eating my ankles over the past 40 years! YAY! The usual bodysurf style fin socks are open heeled and the heel part slides up and down and still rubs.These are GREAT fin socks! no more scars!4.They stay on too. Some stretch out imediately and come off at the heel. These LAST.CONS:Run a bit small though. I wear a size 9 female shoe and a large fits my foot.

"I USE THIS FOR BODYSURFING HERE IN HAWAII WHEN WATER GETS COLD IN WINTER. I hesitated because of the 5/3mm but it is SO SOFT FLEXIBLE AND COMFY that I forgot all about even having it on. The shoulder cut is really hard to find and frees up the shoulders for paddling or swimming well WITH NO CHAFING.The only caveat was I think this runs small, as I'm a size 3-4 and took an 8 in this wetsuit  because of chest compression. It is made in china which steered me away at first--and perhaps sizing is different because of that, but order a larger size if you have breasts. The size 4 would not zipper up the chest (back) without compression that was almost painful. I ordered an 8 in an eBay auction (25.00!!!!) on a whim and it fit! SHOCKER!It has lasted over 2 years with continuous use from September-June and finally I poked a nail thru the leg when pulling it on so it has a puka that leaks now. So be CAREFUL of pulling it on because it is super soft stretchy and does tear. I pull up the legs to just below the knee so when I pull the body up, it has plenty of play so that will not happen again.I think the sizing is NOT uniform because some people say it is loose in the belly or chest--whereas mine was snug snug snug even in an 8--when I take a 2-4 size pants and have a 36"" bust. USUALLY smaller sized fit fine as they are stretchy on top--for some reason this one was way too tight in my usual size! good luck--its worth ordering because it is THE most comfy wetsuit I've even worn. The velcro on the neck wore out fast and i had a sail ship replace it for me--works fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31R515AFD1Y9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3YGZVY#wasThisHelpful","R31R515AFD1Y9","A19NAKWN2HD289","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NAKWN2HD289?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ONE OF THE BEST BODYSURFIN FINS OUT THEREWhy? Because they provide thrust and propulsion in big waves. You MUST KICK DIFFERENTLY AND GET USED TO THAT or you will think they are no good if you are USED TO SHORT FINS. These have length and you slow the kick as divers do to an in'between kick--slower than the flutter of short fin kicks and faster than really long diving fins. If you try and kick like you do with Slasher fins or short fins--you'll have NO power at all. So adjust your kick before you judge these! They have MUCH MORE thrust--you just have to learn how to use them properly. Go UP a size and order fin socks and the ankle strap pad type leashes too. FINS COME OFF IN SURF. Can't tell you how many freebies we find on the beach after someone goes out with a great pair of fins w/o a leash and loses them, never finding them until they wash up on the beack and some lucky finder gets em! worth the 10.00 extra!***Here's a comparison if you need one, since no one has written this. I've bodysurfed 40 years guys so I know what I'm talking about here in Hawaii in big waves too.1. Dafin: total comfort, smaller fin lifeguards here in Hawaii use (they can run in sand with them on)and are great on shorebreak breaks. I love Dafin COMFORT, as they don't tear up my ankles like duckfeet do. They are not as thrusty in rips in bigger surf. Although I've worn them in big waves, I prefer the thrust of the longer fins like ducks and UDT. but Dafin is still my favorite fin for comfort, and great performance in nearly any wave. I just need a longer fin in rips and bigger waves to do my best.2. Duckfoot fins:  I have VERY strong legs from many many years of bodysurfing here in Hawaii. We used to say ya haf to be a duck to WEAR them because we all have ankle scars from duckfeet. So Duckfoot changed, making the pocket softer but they are still NARROW. I wear a LARGE when I wear a 8.5 womans shoe--which is a 7 mens. I wear straps/fin socks to prevent the blisters that I have MANY scars all over my ankles from so that makes the size needed bigger---waaay back in the 70-80's they didn't make fin socks so we just wore old socks. We used silicone gel too. STILL tore up the ankles. Ducks used to be solid blue and REALLY stiff, then 2 tone, then 3 tone, then made in Mexico (trash) and now back to real rubber from Malaysia. The  softer foot pocket  of the ones made today--IF MADE IN MALAYSIA AND NOT MEXICO-- are good quality. Rubber is a commodity now and fins cost $$ because of this. The black and red version is good too but for bodyboarding as its shorter than regular models.3. Hydrotech2 fins: These are silicone fins that are good too (Tech2 fins) which are like Dafin in design with a bit wider foot pocket for all us barefoot luau footed people.They do NOT float so wear ankle padded straps--which make the fin smaller so keep that in mind size wise. These were too flexible for me and lost the thrust needed to get out swimming to outside breaks. I borrowed a pair from a friend after already ordering mine so sent them back. They'd be GREAT for shorebreak surf or bodyboarding but the thrust in outside surf was not there.4. Churchill fins, Slasher fins and similar models: These are shorebreak fins, with little thrust in bigger surf. We all wore them when we didn't have a choice, but there are better models (see above) out there. They are OK for bodyboarding, along with similarly shaped models made for boogie boarding and not bodysurfing unless you are a occasional bodysurfer who really doesn't get into larger waves or serious bodysurfing--because they are cheaper and comfy!5. Voit UDT fins:  The UDT ones are great for big waves too IF U CAN FIND THEM--the black and blue models, not the green/brown ones. The black-blue changed the foot pocket so it doesn't tear up the feet as much. They are the ultimate for big waves if you are strong enough to wear them. Makes your ankles thick and calves muscled. I don't have delicate ankles and I'm not fat--I have bodysurfin ankle  muscles (which I used to get teased about before it was 'cool' to be a strong athletic woman. Times have changed!!!)***As for the ducks made in Malaysia? Buy em while you can. Just buy UP a size and spare your ankles and WEAR FIN SOCKS. These work in rips and outside breaks better than Dafin! I'm 60 and still bodysurfing. aloha","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FRBEMLV2J1JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FDXBDK#wasThisHelpful","R3FRBEMLV2J1JG","A19NAKWN2HD289","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NAKWN2HD289?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one book that caused quite a spiritual-stir in 1939 when it was first published in France. Johnson had his racial views (those of the 'civilized world' of the day and quite prejudiced) and in later years these comments were edited out by the Bea group. I purchased this dilapidated cover 1st edition because I wanted to SEE EXACTLY what was removed--besides the racial slurs, i wanted to see if spiritual things were 'revised' to better reflect the yogic particular group he followed. I also wanted to compare the 'plaigerism' of Paul Twirtchell in the 1960's--as he (published by Eckankar, the religion he started) has been accused of plaigerizing this book verbatim for paragraph after paragraph--and I wanted to SEE the original edition, which David Lane, his main detractor who researched this, stated he used as source material.The book itself is an excellent treatise on the yoga of the Sound and Light--which Twitchell lifted for his soul travel Religion of the Light and Sound--Eckankar. Or, the sufi word: Ek ONG Kar.THIS BOOK IS A CLASSIC AND WORTH READING if you can get around the racial slurs and see the light in it! Those are gone in later editions...

"This is a teeny little book 7"" x 4"" , 108 tiny pages not including the 50 odd paged 'glossary'!!! It is varied 'Christmas messages' in print. There are many stories copied from other sources (Beezulbulb's tales)so not worth paying for reprints in his format. He does have one point that was a unique take away--that of not thinking of your 'higher self' and lower self' as seperate entities, alwaysasking that higher self to take over during meditation. He stresses getting quiet, still within to let that 'arise'--as it has nothing to do with the concept of two parts of ourselves and has to be experienced to be understood. Since I was always asking my higher self to 'take the reigns' that made sense to me to try and just shut up long enough to let IT rise within. INTERESTING, still experimenting with this in meditation/contemplation. One Pearl.He's a Christian so everything relates to Christianity, ""The word"", the John 1:1 quote over and over. Sorry---would rather read something else. There really isn't anything to learn here about the 'sound'--as he never really tells us anything except basic meditation ideas told in frilly overly long twisty sentences.Example: opened the book at random: page 84: VERBATIM, as written!During profound inner meditation, when the mind is totally quiet and in an absolute silence-within and without, not only in the superficial level, but also in all the different corridors, subconscious extracts, zones and lands-then the Essence, the precious element, escapes from within the bottle and fuses with the Being, the Innermost, in order to experience reality.As I said, REALLY flowery language. While interesting to read, I'd rather download it from a website where this is free than pay for it. I enjoy spiritual books , deciphering hidden meanings etc., but was disappointed in this one considering the price. It has good in it--just a high price tag. will try the library instead.

"To A. CUSTOMER:You must truly HATE Eckankar as you BASH every book by Harold Klemp no matter what. EVERY book has good and bad--some of Klemp's are better than others, some more for members, some more for the public. To have God be a higher being than one who demands sacrifice is not a BAD thing. It is a logical one--as no true GOD would demand such and most religions still worship the vengeful guy.... Klemp is trying to RAISE public awareness to a higher note.To say ""My God is better than your God"" would NOT be understood and isn't the POINT. But to softly let people realize God is LOVE--that opens the heart and helps people no matter WHAT Religious teaching they follow. It RAISES awareness.And, while the glowing 5 star reviewers are usually members of his organization--you are a disgruntled person who bashes everything and that isn't TRUE either.You have cut and pasted this SAME review on many other books by Klemp too.I'm posting this hoping others recognize your  ONE STAR reviews now under: A customer.I truly hope you find peace.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6Z4F0UAPPEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570431302#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6Z4F0UAPPEZ","A19NAKWN2HD289","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19NAKWN2HD289?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay this is a 1 star item unless the user does 3 mods or at least one mod and learn two procedures, then its a  star item. Anyone that says otherwise simply doesn't use the machine very much. I have gone through 3 of these, combined with all the other reviews of the same issue proves this is not a QC issue but simply a design and part issue from the get go.Do this at your own risk. These are just my experiences, nothing more.1) The overload protection switch on the front that Jet uses is the wrong size. Everyone know this sander constantly turns off. If you ask for a repair they will send you more switch and they will still stop the motor without taking off a 1/32"" . Simply bypass this overload protection switch. It's not needed. I have tested the current draw of the machine and the overload switch they use cut the machine out at less than 3 amps, this is a 7 amp motor!  After taking the switch out of the loop I can never get the sander to pull 7 amps anyhow, but if I really push it(like forcing an 1/8"" which no drum sander can ever do)the motor can stop. I thought oh crap I fried it, but the motor was not hot. I turned the machine off and on and it fired right back up so the motor itself must have some kind of protection! The last 4 months my house 15 amp circuit never blew(and I use a 12 foot cord!), the motor never gets hot and I never stalled the motor again becasue I simply dont need to take off that much at one time. I stick to a 1/4 turn at a time.. So after 4 months of use I can say its a safe mod FOR ME. Why in the world this doesn't have the sandmart system like the 16-32 and 22-44 (I won both) is beyond me.2) Learn to use the curved pliers technique as described in another review to tight the sanding belts or they will never stay tight. Or go to Woodmaster and purchase their sandpaper Velcro system and make the machine hook and loop. I just use the pliers.3) I have never had an issue with tracking of the conveyor. I know from my other Jet drum sanders that you must make super small adjustments and then run the machine for 5 minutes, then adjust again. Yes, it take that long for the tracking belt to adjust to the screw turns. After the conveyor was adjusted straight I have not had to pay with it since, for 4 months.4) The dust collection really should be on top like all the other drum sander, that in itself could warrant a star being taken off, I dint take one off for that only becasue I wanted people to understand that this is a good sander with user intervention and get their attention with the 4 stars. In other  words if there were zero issues just the placement  of the dust collection port could make this 4 stars.If you do the 3 things I mentioned this is a 4 or 5 star sander in in it's category. Off the rack one star. Now I know many will say I shouldn't have to do this and I agree, BUT there is just nothing as good on the market in this size right now. I have tried the Grizzly and the clones and this is the best if you do the mods.

"This saw is better in every respect than the old version. It cuts hardwood easier and I believe this is due to the increased RPM, it produces far less dust and the stand is better. The rip capacity is so much Superior to any other portable table saw and though the metal appears to be thinner for the saw body itself, it makes zero difference. And the rack and pinion on this and the flip fence, though at first glance seems flimsy, work perfectly and are actually quite solid! I don't understand the miter slot comments at all. There is no seam and the miter slot is perfect. I use an incra miter gauge and there is zero play and the slot is perfect in every way.Okay The saw is a 5 star, but after weeks of use and side by side with the Bosch, Rigid and other on the jobsite this saw has one annoying flaw. Sp 4 stars it is.It is just so unnecessarily loud. It is definitely notably more loud than every other table saw and any other tool on the job site for that matter. Anyone within 100 feet knows its this saw running and not any of the other brand table saws on the job site. Actually, my crew cant tell the difference between all but the Makita( which seems to be the most quiet) and this that screams like its in pain.There is just no reason this should be louder than my older version, it is loudest in class.Lack of accessories could have reduced this to a 4 star as well, but I still gave it 5 initially, until I got it o site next to the other saws.. But this noise issue is so sever it should be  factor in your purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93QC7KZIT31B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2CGXGG#wasThisHelpful","R93QC7KZIT31B","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the only true flush cut saw I have purchased off Amazon. This does not scratch the surrounding wood at all and there is no set on the teeth . I purchase other various brands claiming to be flush cut here on Amazon and all had a slight set to the teeth.  Though nice the shark saws are nowhere near as good as this as far as flush cutting. After using this I would not even consider the Shark flush cut saw a flush cut saw at all.This saw is a bit expensive but worth every penny if you want to cut a peg off a finished piece.

"I owned both Festool saws. The Festool TS55 was so underpowered I was unhappy. Then I sold it purchased the TS75 and I was very happy with the power, but it was  heavy for many applications. Then I purchased this Makita. WOW, this saw is so much more powerful than the TS 55 and so much more quiet. Yes I know about the Festools TS and why adn how they make that sound, but I hate it!Dollar for dollar and over all this saw blows the Festool TS 55 away, all versions. I only wish they made a larger Makita model and I would get rid of my Festool TS75 as well!This works great with my Festool rails.

"This head is great at my dads home where there is city water and the pressure is good to begin with, even then I had to remove the o ring though. So I give it 4 stars as it seems to indicate this head is for low pressure, but its actually more a so called high flow  then actually adding the feeling of pressure.I compared this Speakman unit in the amazon listing and compared it directly with the Fire Hydrant Shower Head, the Fire Hydrant head seems almost twice as powerful in my home. For me the best head on the market for low pressure isTHE FIRE HYDRANT SPA SHOWER HEADGoogle this term and you will find the company Water Management using the web site name ""take a shower"" that makes heads especially for low pressure. Take a look at You Tube and search for this Fire Hydrant Shower Head as well.

"Perfect in every way and IS 100% covered under warranty not sure why people keep saying its not.This bow rocks. When we opened it it was not ready to shoot, so I dont suggest taking it out and drawing on it or you probably will break it. Our had to be set up first. Once it was set up , just like the first unit this has p[roved to be an amazing bow for any price let alone 349.00! We didn't need the warrant on the first and I dont feel we will on the second so I would jump on this in a hear beat.Another thing is a couple people claim the bow broke like the first day and then they called to find out there was not warranty. Who would call the manufacturer if it broke the first day when Amazon will send a brand new on out for 30 days? Between this black op and the camouflage a few people claim it broke right away, then why in the world even call the manufacturer. One guy claimed it broke after 30 days, calling the manufacture at that point makes sense to me. My point is if there are  lemons and are breaking out of the box and you get one send the thing back to amazon free and get a new one dont bother with the manufacturer. These are worth going for a second unit to get a good one. And if it does not break in 30 days odds are it isn't going to break under the warranty period. If for some reason you need warranty work and they claim there is no warranty becasue it as purchased on Amazon scream and yell until they do smoothing becasue that is simply not true.

"For the first time ever I can go out all day and never worry about having to charge the phone.I use full brightness and have Bluetooth and GPS on 24/7. I use apps, email, surf the web and watch hulu etc. I can leave at 6am and come home at 2am and the phone still has charge.I think some people got lemons, just return and try again. PLUS, sometimes the numerical charge number on the phone jumps down fast, but then it stays at that number for hours. Some people may not be giving it a chance. I suggest letting it run out of charge all the way instead of thinking that once at 20% the phone is going to conk out fast, like with most other batteries. So give it a chance and let it run down to 5% or even let it turn off before you make the determination it does not at least double your charge rate. Even the heaviest user just has to get 50% more.Charge it new out of the box until its 100%, then wait another hour, Now start timing it and le run it down to 15% or even to 5%, if you dont have 20 hours then do it again. After that you will see if you dont look a the charge number you will get an entire day and then some. I say dont let the charge number worry you because at 20% I used to worry. With this I can go another 4 hours depending what I am doing. Basically you get double what you normally would. The 100% number on the phone will not change to 200%, how can it? You will get twice the charge time though.. Again, if you dont get the performance I am getting then just get another because mine is awesome. And it is no thicker than two other cases I tried!The only drawback is I dont feel that this is a really good ""protective"" case. Still better than stock, but its no Otterbox.I am so happy I an thinking of getting another stock battery and another one of these in white.And I agree with one other reviewer ignore the one star reviews they got lemons or didn't initially charge and recharge correctly. Or [possibly the one star reviewers really understood the S5 was very bad at holding a charged to begin with. Or they may even have a stick battery thats not good. This depends on a 100% functioning real SAMSUNG S 5 battery to work. SO if you dont get 8 hours on your S5 battery maybe get a new one before you try this . Remember, this uses BOT batteries at the same time.What I am getting at is my S5 battery was BRAND new, the phone phone was 1 day old when I started using this. Possibly the people with poor results are using batteries that are 5 or 6 months old or faulty in some other way to begin with. I recommended using this as soon as the new S5 battery goes through 2 or 3 full charges.I am going to try the competing product similar to this that also includes the wireless charging, I will post on how that works. The only drawback is that required an additional charging base. It has a cool factor but really what the diff then just plugging it in?  will soon find out.This is what I am trying next: Dyconn X5 Protective Power Case with Additional 2800 mAh Battery Extender and Wireless Charging Pad for Samsung Galaxy S5 - Retail Packaging - White","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7B6CUI170MA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2H7NKC#wasThisHelpful","R7B6CUI170MA2","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wont get into a detailed review becasue there are so many good ones. I will comment on my experience comparing my 7D against a Nikon. I tend to agree this camera is a 4 to 5 star, that might not be enough for me anymore.The still photos are simply not near as good as the Nikon 5100 and I assume up, but the camera overall has been good enough for me because the video is so cool with the STM lenses. I use the vid for the kids concerts! After almost a year using the 70D if I was going to do only still photography I might pass on the 70D and get the Nikon. Because I am starting to take a lot more stills I am now on the fence with this camera. If someone is going to do both stills and video this camera is a no brainer. The video on this is great for a camera.I have missed some shots and under certain conditions I just couldn't get good shots(different lighting inside) or it took a lot of work to get shots I could actually use. I love the camera, but still shots compared side by side with the Nikon 5100(discontinued)the 70D leaves a bit to be desired. If you dont see 8x10's side by side I doubt anyone would see a difference under most conditions. I was proved wrong by a Nikon owner in my home studio, I had to eat crow and that was difficult because I paid so much for the camera.My Canon 70D just does not take the pics the Nikon 5100 takes, I assume the 5200,  7100, 7200 are that much better. The still photos are not as sharp nor alive as the Nikons . Sometimes I have to take 50 pics of my products just to get 5 good pics with the 70D and I have to work at it. With my friends Nikon I basically press the shutter and 98% of the stills are useable. The Canon has about a 75% keep rate on average for family pics(far less for my product pics where I need be more picky) becasue many photos are out of focus. I am sure a pro could make of the difference in manual, but it's a whole lot of work. If the Nikon requires less manual setting control for the same shot that tells me this particular Canon is lagging behind. In short the Nikon just takes better stills, easier. On automatic the Nikon kills my 70D. I  wasn't happy about those results. No matter what, under perfect or non perfect conditions, for me at my house, the 70D at best only took stills almost as good as the Canon 70D, never better. And most often not near as good.Had my friend never bragged and come over and proved this to me I might be a lot happier. At least now I know that some of the poor shots I was(and am still) getting with my 70D are not be totally due to my inexperience(that's what I was attributing it to) because his Nikon gave me far less trouble and better results. He paid a whole let less for his camera as well. So many times I heard or read it's the user, that might be, but using the Nikon I produced better shots more often, it is what it is.I am not a pro so someone really good could probably get a lot more out of the 70d, but for now I am thinking of selling. It's hard becasue so many people want to pay me 50% and I will never sell it for that. I have all the STM lenses and am happy using those the most. The L glass lenses are basically crap with this camera, I am glad I didn't buy any L glass and just borrowed a few from a friend to try out. I have the best luck with the 135 STM lens by far.For vid this camera is great, no complaints at all. Tracking the kids faces for plays and staying in focus without a lot of noise is great and may be reason enough to get this camera if you dont want a separate camcorder and DLSR. In my opinion and after using it almost a year for straight still photography this is not the best choice of DSLR.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBF10ONDI150/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMS0KAC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBF10ONDI150","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When completed it will be as tight as a drum. Its tight enough to toss a ball at it and the ball will bounce right back to you.

These are the only set I have where I can tell the size at a glance from 2 feet away, other sockets I have to hold up to the light at an angle to see the size. They are very strong and I have never broken one and the fit is perfect on every bolt head. And I love the case that is provided, the sockets lock in to each space, there is no opening the box to sockets all over!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBSK0ADZ5DAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HGKR1E#wasThisHelpful","R2MBSK0ADZ5DAY","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall these are nice, but they are pretty large in size for the sound they give I was expecting a lot more. For the size that these are both the Bass and the overall volume are lacking. Using the same exact computer I get far more bass and volume using speakers I got on sale years ago for 8.99At full volume there is zero distortion and they are far better than the built in speaker in the desktop, but these speakers must not be very efficient because I have other rated 10 watt that again are much louder.(I latter discovered these are actually 5 watt RMS speakers - I guess I did not read close enough). These are awfully large for 5 watt speakers!I rate 3.5 stars, but I must round down. I see a lot of 5 star ratings, I am wondering how many of those people actually have other speakers to test side by side, Since I am testing against several sets of old speakers I have no advice for purchase here on Amazon today for this price point and configuration, but I am going to buy a few other sets and I will update at that time.If you are willing to spend about 12-15.00 more(only 11.00 more today) I can highly recommend these, they are better to my ear and have a higher volume than this set and like these very little distortion They do take up more space as there is a third speaker.http://www.amazon.com/Cyber-Acoustics-Subwoofer-Satellite-CA-3602a/dp/B0027VT6V4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393011629&sr=8-1&keywords=computer+speakers+2.1Okay these broke now after 3 months of use.

"These are of great quality and have perfect welds on every single unit I have. I purchased two sets of the 6 ton and one set each of the 2 and 3 ton. ALL, every single unit, has perfect welds.These are safe and I highly recommend them. To the people saying they are not safe, you simply received a bad run, but as of today 02/18/2014 all 8 individual units I have are perfect and I have been working under them woth peace of mind for the last week. Why not re-order? Every product has a few bad apples. Actually, even if the weld on these were not perfect(they are on mine) unless you went far over the rated weight I just cant see how these could possible fail, they are solid and stable.It's simple, if you do get one with a bad weld just replace it free using Amazon. These are as good as my older 80.00-100.00 units and I will not spend 80.00 on jack stands ever again!I will re-rate these in several months, but I don't see anything changing. For now 5 stars6, 3 and 2 ton preference:Without question my favorite are the 6 ton, they are so beefy and are always my first choice. They are a bit too tall for the sides of my 2000 Monte Carlo though.If the 6 ton are too tall as they are for my 2000 Monte(on the sides at least) and you are trying to decide between the 2 and 3 ton 100% go for the 3 ton. In my experience, at least for this jack stand line, there is nothing the 3 ton won't fit that the 2 ton will and the difference in build quality is substantial. Since the price difference is only 4.00 pass on the 2 ton, the 3 ton are far better and only 1.5"" total taller. I am not sure why they even make a 2 ton, I guess for the people who want to save 4.00, but the diff in price is not worth the durability difference. I suggest to pay the 4.00. Or maybe there are cars where the 1.5"" does makes a difference, but any jack I have ever used goes higher than the lowest setting on the 2 and 3 ton jack stands by several inches, even on the sides of a low vehicle. I consider my car very low and the 3 ton work fine. Obviously I prefer the 3 ton over the 2 by a far margin. Only use the 2 ton if you are forced into it they are simply not the value of the 3 ton stands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6IQJZTRRNIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00026Z3DQ#wasThisHelpful","R2R6IQJZTRRNIU","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE***Okay today(12-24-2013) I was experiencing an issue with the lens, well I finally figured it out to be an issue. It seemed sometimes I had to take the lens off and put it back on to get it to focus again. The focusing issue turned out to be caused by putting pressure on the lens when attaching it that made the difference. I thought I would check for an update before I returned it and and sure enough there is an update listed on the Canon site. Even though I just got this lens 3 weeks ago and it was new(not a refurb or used) it shipped with the original firmware. So I suggest anyone buying, even if today, check and see if it is firmware 1.1.0 or 1.1.1 or anything other than 1.2.0. - 1.2.0 is the current firmware for this lens and fixes the issue I described.FROM CANON: If pressure is applied to the lens barrel while the lens is mounted to the camera (pressure can be applied even while attaching the lens cap while carrying the camera with the lens attached in a bag), the auto-focusing function of the lens may stop working.This is EXACTLY what was happening to me. I almost sent the lens back because of this. Today I did the firmware update and the lens acts like it should now. I can't get it to stop focusing no matter how many times or how I attach the lens, so the update worked. You can find information on this issue here:[...]The info states the only Cameras that can be used for the firmware update are the Canon EOS-1D X (*1), Canon EOS 5D Mark III (*1,*2) or Canon EOS REBEL T4i, but I used a 70D and it worked fine. I believe anything from a T4i and newer(meaning T5i and SL1) can do the update as well as the 5D III and the 1D as stated. Anything else you can try, but I don't think it will work. Canon is supposedly doing firmware updates for the older Rebels(possibly they are already done) that will allow the STM lenses to be updated from them. You will have to contact Canon on that. I  would update the firmware on ANY camera to the most current before trying to update a lens anyhow though. It makes sense, the STM's came out about the same time as the T4i.Also, when you go to the firmware update page it only will list an update if you choose windows 7 in the drop down menu.I have Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 both 64 bit and thought I would give it a shot. The firmware update I downloaded listed for Windows 7-64 bit worked fine under both Windows 8 flavors and the lens now works perfectly.ORIGINAL REVIEW:At first I did not like the lens, but after learning about the camera more and when and how to use this lens I love it. Unlike the other STM lenses this is not internal focusing, of course at 40 mm there is little room for that. I bring this up becasue this may be why out of the other two STM lenses I have this one is the loudest. It's still not nearly as loud as any other non STM lens I have heard and the lens is not heard on video playback.  I think it's simply because the focusing is not internal. I may be wrong of course.This lens seems to me to be a bit sharper than the other STM lenses. Maybe on a full frame this could be a walk around lens, but on my canon 70D I prefer the 18-135 as my walk around lens and use this for portraits, close ups and inside the house family gatherings.If I am doing portraits in front of a drop background this lens gives me better pictures in its range than the 18-135 STM. But I still like the 18-135mm for full body shots if I have restricted space for me to move. For me being an amateur  I really need to find a sweet spot for my body positioning in relation to the subject and backdrop to get the most out of this lens(especially for a bokeh effect). But when I find the sweet spot the pictures sure are nice with this lens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I60W8IJGUD6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00894YP00#wasThisHelpful","R3I60W8IJGUD6O","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I abuse mine and use one everyday. They last about a year and I don't care! Out of all the similar products I have tried I like these best and every year I buy another one. Actually, I have two on back up at all times to give to my kids or friends as they need them for school ID's etc.They get 5 stars becasue I like the style best, but one star off becasue they do need to be replaced due to a rippage on the interior pocket after about a year of use. But this rip does not allow things to fall out and the cord has NEVER broken on me, it just lets the cards from one section get into another section.I gave one to my son and since all the kids want them for their school/lunch ID. They can put cash in the zipper and the ID/lunch card in the clear side and hide an ATM card in the last slot. Put it around their neck and then slip it in their shirt so no one can see it and they are good to go. Being able to safely carry a few bucks and ATM card so no on can see is really nice piece of mind, plus they have used these the kids have not lost an ID!  In the past I have always lost wallets, but becasue of these in the last 3 years I haven't, plus I love not having anything in my pockets!For the price they are probably a 5 star value, but that rippage issue has to be mentioned.

"The chums are always the best for me. They never fall off the glasses and they last and last. I only replace them because I lose my glasses or just need another pair. I never had them wear out on me. The adjusting knob did break on my son once, that's one out of about 10 pairs and the last one I ordered was a bit short. It seemed shorter than my last ordered pair. I checked it against an old pair of the same ordered size and sure enough it was a bit shorter.

"I really like this. Though it actually two big for the lights I intended to use it for its so nice I am keeping it for future use. I set the gels in front of a light and they did get warm, but didn't melt at ll. For some reason the glow was not as consistent as I would like,  I could see a bright bulb(almost white spot) in the center instead of a glow of red, but that may be more to do with the type of bulb I am using. When I used the dimmer and changed some setting on my camera I did get the effect I wanted.The parts are metal and I think the honeycomb grill is really nice. The Gels are also set in metal frames and the thumb screws on the back are nice and big. This has a great build quality, even if these cost twice as much I think I would like them,.It's tough to tel whether the grill is metal or plastic, but if its plastic its good enough to fool me into thinking its metal.

"Bulbs found here: Julius Studio dot com - search JDDHere is the link, amazon may erase it:[...]Mine work great, I even bought more. I think some of the lower star reviews have more to do with peoples expectations. In my mind these are ACCENT lights! With two lights,stands and bulbs, plus the barn doors for 65.00(61.00 in my case) and  a dimmer they seem to me to be designed for accent lighting.As accent lighting these are 4 or 5 star. For lighting up your subject with nothing else, they are 2 star. For this price, configured the way they are with 150 watt low spectrum bulbs and with a dimmer it should be apparent to most these are for accent lighting only. And as accent lighting they are great for the price!The cords are not very long and of course the stands are not that great, I could see some buying these just for the top portion and setting the stands aside. All these type of lights get hot, even expensive lights get hot. The difference is the more expensive lights have better cords, insulation and parts to handle the heat. So be careful and simply turn them off as much as you can. In other words don't leave them on and go to lunch, that's probably good advice for any light anyhow. And I would not never leave these lights on without someone being present.If you need these as your main lighting source, pass on them. If you want some small accent lighting go for it!I believe the bulbs have an E14 thread:Search ebay for ""120Volt JULIUS STUDIO Light Bulb E14 Base JDD150W Frost Bulb"" or google ""JULIUS STUDIO Light Bulb 120Volt E14 Base"" and I think you will find them. Any link I give outside of amazon gets deleted.ebay seems to sell several variations, 150 watt to 250 watt both frosted and clear.Light bulbs included are:JDD Type120V 150WE14 Screw BaseI give these 5 stars because they do what I believe they are designed to do and the price makes them a good value. If they cost 65.00 for each set up instead of for two set ups I would give them 3.5 stars because of the fairly poor stand quality. I paid 61.00 including shipping for two set ups so I have to give them 5 stars. I will update in a month or so.NOTE AFTER many hours use: Okay after using these a bit I take that back about the stands. They may not be the best, but they are really good stands from a value standpoint. For value they are 5 stars for sure. Some pro stand cost 150.00 to 500.00 so compared to all stands they are 2.0 to 2.5 stars. Its tough to compare something like these to great lifetime quality stands that pro use on a pro set.  Still, 61.00 for two stands,barn doors and bulbs, value has to be considered so I am still at a 5 star rating as a set.  The bulbs are still going strong after 8 hours. I don't lug my stuff around so for people that do the stands are what they are and probably wont take tossing around very much. Then again wont these pay for themselves after one shoot? If they don't you are not charging enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JR3S0DY8JXJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F37CM2#wasThisHelpful","R2JR3S0DY8JXJG","A37CEYB95LK6R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37CEYB95LK6R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay mine had minor wrinkles along the edge. Plus, I think it could be even more black. So 1/2 star off  for the wrinkle edges and 1/2 star off for my perception of true black.I guess this is the most black of any paper I could find so I sent  my 53"" roll back and ordered the 107"" roll.

The 53""  roll is just not wide enough anyhow, especially if the edges are bad like the roll I received.If you are going back and forth just go 107"" if you have room.

You can slip the ziploc in the saddlebag pocket first, but I don't.  I like to weigh each bag to 9.5 lbs on my scale so they are balanced.Using the freezer bags instead of putting the sand directly in the saddlebags works great.

"I grew up in Washington State, and learned our state history in the public schools I attended. Lip service was given to the role of the Indians, but it was mainly the white man's story; the story of the settlers. Messages from Frank's Landing is a readable account of Billy Frank, Jr., a Nisqually Indian who saw the devastating effects of the treaties his people were for forced to sign, and who decided to do something about improving the condition of his people, his river and most importantly, the salmon.This is an important book, and very accessible for the average reader. You will get a clearer picture of ""the other side of the story,"" while getting some insight to an individual who played a key role in the controversial 1974 Boldt Fishing Rights Decision. This decision ended up becoming the template for similar treaties and decisions around the world.We've come a long way since the devastating days of logging and development of the post World War II era, but as more people move into this region, we have a long way to go.

"Although I haven't read the full version of this inspiring true story and biography, I didn't feel like I missed anything in this young adult (condensed) version of the book. It has all the drama of excitingly described boat races, as well as the pathos of a difficult childhood.I grew up about a mile from the Montlake Cut and the Husky Boathouse, where many of the events in this book took place (although my childhood was 20 years later). And I've been to, or near, many of the locations described here, and I found them to be true to the geography and history I know. I have a minor quibble with saying the boathouse is on Lake Washington, when locals would say it's on Union Bay (which is connected to Lake Washington). Also the area where Joe Rantz goes out in a canoe with is fiancée is Foster Slough, which is not named specifically.I will be recommending this book to the teachers of Washington State history at the school where I am the librarian, as so many aspects of our state history are brought up in this saga: a childhood in various locales around the state, farming, logging, mining, the creation and building of the Grand Coulee Dam, and of course the development of a competitive rowing crew that became the first entry from Washington State in the Olympics, not to mention that they won, much to excitement of our whole state back (and much of the nation) in 1936!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAUS44JZMP5IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451475925#wasThisHelpful","RAUS44JZMP5IG","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is Willie Nelson talking to you about his life, his 4 marriages, his infidelities, his music, his drinking and eventual love affair with pot, his gambling, golf, music festivals (called ""picnics""), Farm Aid, his causes including the legalization of marijuana, the environment and the family farm, and his relationships with various recording companies, fellow performers and songwriters, and the long hard road he took before he experienced success in the music industry. If you expected Willie to clean up his language or leave out some of the dirt, then don't read this book.But if you want to read about one of the most creative minds in the music industry, about a songwriter who is always, I mean always, thinking about the next song, and if you want to learn how many of those hit songs were written, then read on. If you want to read about a guy who recorded 24, yes 24, albums between the ages of 70 and 80, and who shows no signs of slowing down, then read on. If you want to read about a man who still acknowledges the faith of his youth, the one that he learned about in a little Methodist Church in a small west Texas town, even though he's adapted that faith over the years, then read on.Even though my lifestyle is quite different from that of Willie Nelson, and even though I currently don't have any of his recordings in my collection (having lost Willie when I abandoned vinyl nearly a decade ago), I found this book inspiring on many levels. I am a songwriter, and I always love reading and hearing about how songwriters get their ideas, and how they put songs together. Willie delivers in this intimate account of his life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RI4WMCNA9011/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316403555#wasThisHelpful","R2RI4WMCNA9011","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of the World War II stories I've read over the years (as well as WWII movies I've seen) were written while the war was still fresh, and the story is often propelled by a sense of patriotism. This one is thoroughly researched and written at the end of the life of the protagonist, Louis Zamperini, and provides a more holistic perspective.Zamperini lived a fascinating life prior to his enlistment in the Army Air Corps during WWII, growing up as the child of Italian immigrants in Torrance, California, where he, after living the life of a troubled youth, turned his life around to become a famous runner, and eventually Olympic athlete who competed in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany. Zamperini intersected with history several times in his early years, which adds to the fascination of his story.He is trained as bomber and is sent to the Pacific Theater to fight Japan. After a successful bombing run during which his B-24 (""Super Man"") barely made it back, being riddled with so many bullet holes. Then his crew is sent in a rescue mission in another B-24 (""The Green Hornet"") that does not make it and he is one of three survivors of a crash landing at sea, where he spends 47 days adrift in his life raft, barely surviving thirst and starvation.His raft drifts into Japanese territory, and he and his one surviving companion, the pilot, are taken captive. He is moved from one POW camp to another, where the conditions become progressively worse.""War is hell"" is an often heard phrase, but in Zamperini's case (and in those of others who were imprisoned in Japanese POW camps) ""hell"" is almost an understatement. Descriptions of the prisoners treatment is vivid and horrible (and presented from various angles).The bulk of the latter part of the book describes life in the camps, the final days of war in Japan with American bombers fire-bombing the country, with the eventual use of Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Zamperini is released, and eventually returns stateside. After the war he meets and marries his wife, even as his life is slipping into alcoholism as a way of dealing with the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that pervades his life.As his life is about to fall apart, he experiences a spiritual change that brings healing and eventually leads him to ""forgive"" his captors.This is probably the most powerful World War II book I've ever read (actually listened to) and is one that I would highly recommend. It is sobering, but also redemptive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROS0X1N5MVRV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812974492#wasThisHelpful","ROS0X1N5MVRV8","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Memory of Old Jack is the tale of a Kentucky tobacco farmer looking back on his life near the end of it in 1952. He has made many mistakes, poor decisions, and while paying the consequences of those decisions had gradually learned from them. Old Jack is the last of his breed, before the new ways of farming with tractors took over during World War II. His was a life of horse and mule and doing things by hand. It was a life of hard work, connected to the land he loved.The story is slow, much like life behind a mule-drawn wagon would be slow. But it gives you time to mull over the events of the day while appreciating the beauty that surrounds you.This is the sixth book in the Port William series that I have read (actually listened to as an audiobook) this summer. Needless to say, I’m drawn to the writings of Wendell Berry, an author that had escaped my attention until recently. Berry has much to say in his fiction about the way things were, and the way they have changed, not necessarily for the better. There is a sad nostalgic undercurrent to his writing, but also a hope that we could return to the more honest values of the past. I feel like my life has changed, in ways I have yet to recognize, by my summer in Port William.Old Jack reminds me of a rancher I had the opportunity to work for in the summer of 1965. Yes, he drove a tractor, but his work ethic and the love of the land still harkened back to an earlier era. Guys like Old Jack lived all over the country, providing the country with the honest harvest we once enjoyed, and which we long for again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DIZ723J2RGMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582430438#wasThisHelpful","R2DIZ723J2RGMY","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jaber Crow is the fifth novel in the Port William series by Wendell Berry that I have listened to this summer. Needless to say, I love this author and this series. I am drawn to his sense of place, the “membership” of the community, to a simpler time of small farms and a small town, where relationships and hard work were valued.But Jaber Crow, in my opinion, rises above all the others on many different levels. In addition to covering a larger chunk of time (basically from World War I to the late 1960s) and a slightly larger chunk of Kentucky geography, this novel provides an opportunity to engage in the thoughts of Wendell Berry on a number of topics, from changing farming practices, the Economy, war, life, death, love, philosophy and theology, as seen through the eyes of the Port William town barber and lifelong bachelor.I’m glad that I read several other Port William books before I got to Jaber Crow, but if you were to read only one book in the series, this would be the one I’d recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DW9MB6MED7Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582431604#wasThisHelpful","R28DW9MB6MED7Z","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third Wendell Berry novel I've listened to as an audiobook this summer, based on the recommendations of a couple of people I respect dearly. I have not been disappointed. My favorite, to date, is Hannah Coulter, but I think perhaps the protagonist in this one is the ""place"" or at least the ""membership"" (as he calls it) of Port William. In this novel I felt like I got to know more about the various characters that appeared in Hannah Coulter, as well as Andy Catlett.I'm not really sure why this book is considered ""Christian"" fiction, other than that there is no profanity, sex, gratuitous violence, etc. The faith of some of these individuals is incidental to the story, and by today's standards we might question the practice of tobacco growing and smoking which pervades the pages of these novels. One of my favorite characters, Jaber Crow, is one who has walked away from the faith.But these Port William stories take place on the home front during World War II. One gets a glimpse of how the war provides the backdrop to those who are waiting, while working and farming, back home. And one sees the world as it is changing. Today we don't think too much about how WWII changed everything in our culture, but from this perspective one gets a glimpse of the ""old ways"" and the ""new ways.""I worked on a ranch in 1965, twenty years after the end of World War II, and the owner was from the generation that saw the transition from the old ways to the new ways. Listening to A Place on Earth, I felt like I knew some of these people, with their work ethic, their ingenuity, their sense of place on earth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWT02R4RNA2NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582431248#wasThisHelpful","RWT02R4RNA2NX","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I had finished this short volume a few years ago, but just picked it up and found my bookmark halfway through.It is a significant work, not just because it addresses the issue of same-sex attraction from the perspective of the Orthodox Christian faith, but because one could also infer the traditional Christian view of various other sexual sins (fornication, adultery, masturbation, pornography, etc.). What is refreshing is that Fr. Thomas Hopko clearly articulates the Orthodox view that sin is a disease, one that requires a cure, and that can be cured, within the context of the sacred hospital, the Church, and the medicine, the Holy Mysteries, that the Church prescribes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KYZ7CTGKZQAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1888212756#wasThisHelpful","R3KYZ7CTGKZQAX","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw this film on PBS about ten years ago, and have thought about it many times. I mean, what little boy doesn't dream of building his own cabin out in the woods? And what man still wonders if he could, given the opportunity.Well, now I have a friend, in his late 20s, who just bought a piece of property and is planning to build his own cabin to live in, much as Richard Proenneke did in Alaska in 1968. My friend is inspired and influenced by this film and the accompanying book, and he gladly loaned it to me to watch.I was as inspired by this film the second time around, and now I'd like to read the book to find out ""the rest of the story.""There is much to appreciate here, but probably most inspiring to me is the way Proenneke gathers his materials, constructs his tools and builds his cabin. He is obviously a master carpenter putting together a lifetime of skills (while in his 50s) in the remote wilderness of Alaska. Even his self-filming techniques are interesting, especially in this day of people taking ""selfless"" all the time.I highly recommend this film to those who love the outdoors in general, Alaska in particular, or who can appreciate a man who pursues his dream to live a life of self-sufficiency.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8HXMOVMSO7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PUAFG#wasThisHelpful","R2K8HXMOVMSO7P","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have have taught private guitar lessons since 1969, and I have led more Christmas sing-alongs than I can count over the years. As a result, I have collected a ton of songbooks, and in the early years have added the chords myself. This is the best collection I've found, to-date, that has all the best holiday songs, both sacred and secular, and for the most part, in guitar-friendly keys.The book is not without it's minor shortcomings. In some cases, not all the verses of well-known songs are included. In other cases, I would've selected different chords, chord progressions, or I would've named the chords differently. But this is now the book I go to to start with. I always compare against the best-known recordings of the songs, and make my changes accordingly. In some cases, I end up changing the key altogether.Most recently, my students wanted to learn ""Last Christmas,"" but the version in this book is based on the Wham (George Michael) version from the 1980s. These young people wanted the Taylor Swift version, which is in a different key, but it's also easier to play.This is still a great book, and I would definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUGYD8JALTTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0634018183#wasThisHelpful","R1LUGYD8JALTTD","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2011, I read Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure for health reasons, and made the switch to the whole foods plant-based diet. Although I had been a ""part-time vegetarian,"" the first several weeks were tough, but it got easier, especially as I got healthier, lost weight, increased energy and got off several medications.Since that time I have become more and more convinced that this is the best lifestyle for me, and have been picking up more and more books to better equip me. I've become a fan of Lindsay Nixon (The Happy Herbivore) and we love her The Happy Herbivore Cookbook: Over 175 Delicious Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes, as well as her other titles. I've enjoyed books by Rip Essenstyn, including My Beef with Meat: The Healthiest Argument for Eating a Plant-Strong Diet--Plus 140 New Engine 2 Recipes.Lately I've read Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition, by T. Colin Campbell, author of The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health. And I recently decided to take a look at this volume by Dr. McDougall. While all of the above authors fall into the same food camp, McDougall stresses the importance of complex carbohydrates (starches) in our diet. He clearly points out the all around the world, healthy populations base their diets on starches (whether it's corn, wheat, potatoes, rice, taro root or other starches).In the diet he promotes here, he says you can eat as much as you want, until you feel full. And you will not only lose weight, but will get healthy in the process. I'm already convinced that it's true, because I've been following him on Facebook and have given this modification to my diet a try for several months. I feel more satisfied, and I have not gained back any of the weight I lost when I first began the diet.In these pages, Dr. McDougall tells the story of his personal journey in discovering this way of eating, and how he eventually started his own clinic in northern California. He addresses the poisons of meat, the healing power of the starch-based diet, the politics of food, and how, with our current American diet, we are eating our planet to death. He addresses questions about where you get your protein and calcium on a plant-based diet. And he discuses the problems of fish, as well as how you can be an unhealthy fat vegan (I know some, and what he says makes perfect sense).He also explains why it makes sense to get away from supplements, and he talks about the benefits (yes, benefits) of salt and sugar.The latter third of this volume is a cookbook by his wife, Mary McDougall. I have not tried any of these yet, but as I skim through the pages, they look delicious, easy to make, and completely in line with other plant-based cookbooks I've been using.While I can heartily recommend all the books mentioned above, I think this one by Dr. McDougall would be an excellent starting point. Give it a try. You have nothing to lose but your weight!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAHKHHT4ZD0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623360277#wasThisHelpful","RMAHKHHT4ZD0C","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frederica Mathewes-Green is uniquely qualified to explain the Jesus Prayer to our contemporary culture. Before becoming a successful author, blogger and podcaster on topics mainly explaining Eastern Christianity to our Western Culture, she lived the life of a hippie, feminist, and explorer of various religious and mystical traditions, before having a profound spiritual experience that eventually led her and her husband to seminary.Her husband became a priest in the Episcopal Church, where he served for many years, before departing and joining the Eastern Orthodox Church, where he is now a priest. It was at that point that Frederica began writing about their new spiritual home.Frederica did not begin writing this book about the Jesus Prayer until at least 15 years after she had been seeking a life of ""unceasing prayer,"" with many of those years under the guidance of a spiritual father. She has also thoughtfully studied the classic texts on the subject from sources such as Mount Athos (Greece), Russia, as well as the Desert Fathers, and she makes many references to this literature, her spiritual father, as well as her own experience.Following the introduction, the book is divided into two parts. Part one covers history, Scripture, the meaning of mercy; terms, concepts and context; and heart, mind, and what she calls ""the little radio"" (or the nous). Part two covers numerous questions and answers she has received over the years on the Jesus Prayer, and provides many practical, as well as theological explanations.I have been saying the Jesus Prayer for many years, I have read several books and articles on the Jesus Prayer, and I have visited Orthodox monasteries, but I found that Frederica clarified many things I didn't know before. Frederica has the uncanny ability to take something as spiritually deep as ""unceasing prayer"" and translate it into something that most of us raised in the West can comprehend. This is especially helpful, since some of the literature available is awkwardly translated from other languages.This book is filled with memorable passages, and I will just quote a few from the introduction to whet your appetite:""...you should `warm up you heart' before beginning the Jesus Prayer..."" (page xi)""The practice of saying the Jesus Prayer is accurately termed a spiritual discipline; it a disciplined learning process, like learning to play the cello."" (page xii)""The prayer is not designed to generate fancy mystical experiences or soppy emotions."" (page xiii)""The Prayer's goal is to help you keep always in touch with the presence of God."" (page xiii)""The effect of the Prayer is to knock you down in your mind. Then you discover that it is safe to be knocked down, safe to be humble, because God's love is everywhere, filling the world with his light and life. The Prayer will make you into a child."" (page xvi)If you are interested in deepening your prayer life, in learning how to live a life of ""unceasing prayer, or if you are simply curious to know more about what the Jesus Prayer is, this is the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1BEO1M2V3VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557256594#wasThisHelpful","R2V1BEO1M2V3VE","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure: I have known the poet for many years.So, how does one review a collection of poems by a friend; an anthology spanning 21 years, from 1985 to 2006? To put it simply, it's like mining for gold.I found some of these poems hard work, in my case too much work, to fully digest and comprehend. I would've benefited with an introduction, a guide, to explain the subtleties of language and context, but such a guide was not available on these pages.But it was worth mining through these works to find the gold, those pieces that shimmer and shine and are worth every ounce of their weight.The author was one of my guides into the Orthodox Christian faith in the late 1990s. And many of these poems continue to elucidate the richness of this faith, this spirituality, this life that I continue to embrace, more fully, as he does himself.One poem, one that I posted by my desk for many years, is indicative of the spiritual depth found here:Setting OutPilgrim: What is it that you do here?Monk: We fall, and we get up again.In time, even the slowest pilgrim mightarticulate a turn. Given time enough,the slowest pilgrim--even he--mightregister some small measure of belatedprogress. The road was, more or less, lesscompelling than the hut, but as the benefitof time allowed the hut's distractions to attaina vaguely musty scent, and all the novelknickknacks to acquire a fine veneer of bone-white dust, the road became then somewhat moreattractive, and as the weather made a timelyif quite brief concession, the pilgrim took this allto be an open invitation to set out.--Scott CairnsNot all of these poems are about Scott's spiritual pilgrimage. Another poem (""A Prior Despair"") that resonated particularly with me was about the loss of love, and his search for finding it again. I guess that's a journey of a different kind, but one that I could relate to.So, if you pick up this volume, be prepared to do some mining. You'll be rewarded for the effort!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46QHBDOWBTTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557255032#wasThisHelpful","R46QHBDOWBTTB","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short Trip to the Edge reviewDisclosure: I have known the author since 1975, when he was a Baptist teen preparing for college.I purchased my autographed copy of this book at a poetry reading in downtown Seattle in 2008. For a variety of reasons I did not read it until 2013.When I finally opened it, I assumed it was going to be an autobiographical travelogue of Scott's first visit to Mount Athos, the Holy Mountain in Greece which is inhabited by Orthodox Christian monks in various monasteries. What I did not realize is that this volume covers three visits to Mount Athos, the final one with his then 14 year-old son, interspersed by one visit to Saint Anthony's Monastery in Arizona, all within the time frame of 9 months.I was correct in my assumption that this book is autobiographical, but it is much more. In these pages, Scott talks about his search for unceasing prayer, as well as his desire to find a spiritual father on Mount Athos. Scott weaves in pieces of his personal journey, including his childhood in a conservative Baptist church in Tacoma, Washington, and his sojourns in Presbyterian and Episcopal churches, before ""coming home"" to the Orthodox Church. And while Scott is weaving these pieces into the narrative, he also introduces the reader to some of the theology and practices of the Orthodox faith, as observed on the Holy Mountain, as well as from his life and readings back home. (There is a helpful glossary in the back of the book.)After reading the first chapter, I decided I needed to get out my pencil to underline memorable passages, and now looking back over the pages I see there are many. In one such passage he quotes Father Iakovos (one of the monks he visits several times) who tells his son, ""Just as our lungs breathe air, so our souls breathe prayer. Our souls cannot develop, cannot survive without prayer.""Who should read this book? I recommend it to Orthodox Christians, especially converts like me, who want to learn more about this faith, and especially about what it's like on Mount Athos. More specifically, I recommend it to women who are not allowed to visit Mount Athos; this is as close as they'll get. And I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a thoughtful spiritual autobiography (which I do).I think anyone who is not Orthodox, or who is not at least a bit familiar with the Orthodox faith, may (at times) go, ""Huh?"" It may even seem slow and dry to those readers, at least until they realize that the slowness and quietness of the book is part of the point.In these pages, Scott makes reference to The Way of the Pilgrim, one of the spiritual classics, along the lines of Pilgrim's Progress, for Orthodox Christians. I recommend checking that volume out, but also Father Arseny, 1893-1973: Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father : Being the Narratives Compiled by the Servant of God Alexander Concerning His Spiritual Father and Everyday Saints and Other Stories for very different perspectives on the Orthodox faith.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WSJIEJOOT5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060843225#wasThisHelpful","R7WSJIEJOOT5Q","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The beauty of Billy Collins' poetry is its profound simplicity. He takes seemingly mundane events like wearing hats (or not wearing hats), remembering his father, running over a snake in the road, or forgetting a poem he had written in his head, and turning them into something to look at, think about and even laugh at.His poems are not humorous poems in the traditional sense of the word, but many, if not most, have a humorus twist at the end.I read this volume over the course of several months, taking it with me while eating lunch outside, while waiting for a doctor's appointment, or getting a meal at a nearby restaurant, and each time I felt like I had taken a friend with me to chat about life while doing these things.After reading poems by Billy Collins, one looks at life just a little more differently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LEYVBSGTVLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0822956705#wasThisHelpful","R19LEYVBSGTVLX","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book about ten years ago, while on a road trip, and it's been quietly calling me ever since. I finally heeded the call, picked it up, and enjoyed it, even though it is not at all what I thought it would be.I am a writer, not on the stature of someone like Dillard, but I keep a journal, I write songs (and sometimes poetry), I write reviews here on Amazon.com, I have published a journal off and for more than 30 years, and I write in the my line of work as a school librarian. Some people are driven to write, and I'm one of them. That's why I liked this book.Annie Dillard gives insight into how she works, rather struggles, as a writer. She seeks the quiet places, such as a cabin in the San Juan Islands, to get her work done. While she says she draws inspiration from reading literature, this little volume proves that she also gets inspiration from the non-writers she meets, such a local ferryman, and a stunt pilot (who also happens to be a geologist).Halfway through reading this volume, I decided to pick up a pen and underline some of the memorable quotes that she provides. I wish I had done it from the beginning.Here is one (from page 70):""A well-known writer got collared by a university student who asked, 'Do you think I could be a writer?''Well,' the writer said, 'I don't know.... Do you like sentences?'The writer could see the student's amazement. Sentences? Do I like sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him once how he came to be a painter. He said, 'I liked the smell of paint.'""Another quite I liked appears on pages 78-79:""One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something  better. These things fill from behind, from  beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.""In closing I want to remark on the sense of place of this book. I'm from Washington State, where much of this book takes place. Not only that, I was in Bellingham in the mid-1970s, and I know that what she writes about is true to this locality. Mount Baker steaming, the stunt pilot flying from the Cascades to the San Juans, the glaciers in this region, the tides and currents of Puget Sound, the solitude on some of our remote islands, and some of the local characters she encounters.This book is filled with the raw emotion of a writer who both loves and hates writing. It's a struggle for her, which is an encouragement for people like me who write as an avocation, and sometimes wish we could do something else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPX7OTG9SYLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060919884#wasThisHelpful","RRPX7OTG9SYLM","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a former pessimist, who was able to change his personal set point a few years ago with the help of of positive psychology, I was curious to see what Andrew Weil would have to say on the subject of happiness. I listened to the audiobook on my commute, and wish that I had a hard copy to take note of some of his helpful tips. Andrew Weil had a great reading voice, and it adds to the audio experience to hear the author read his own work.I give the book four stars because it starts at as a book on how to combat depression, not exactly what the title suggests, and as a result he spends a lot of time discussing various medications and nutritional supplements. I was about to give up on the book, when it got better.I believe Weil is at his best here when he gives suggestions on changes you can make in your life (apart from medications and supplements) to raise your personal set point. While he goes into detail in what he calls ""secular spirituality,"" I found that most of what he says translates well into my own Christian spirituality.He has great advice in areas of gratitude, forgivenss, silence, nature, beauty, breathing, visualization and other things that resonate with where I'm at and the happiness I've experienced over the past several years. I was particularly pleased to see him recommend some of the practices of positive psychology. The ""three good things"" excercise was what turned my life around.In addition to my problems with all the medications and supplements, I would also quibble with some of his nutritional advice. I have been on a low-fat whole foods plant based diet for the past two years, and believe that if you are eating a well-rounded selection of fruits, vegetables and grains, you will need very few supplements. I think he's right on when he says you should reduce, and eliminate processed foods.So with a few reservations, I can recommend this book. Overall it really works, as I've already incorporated most of the advice he gives here. I just need to excercise a bit more, and I'm working on that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FMCVY5Z13ZJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619693011#wasThisHelpful","R3FMCVY5Z13ZJQ","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book about food and nutrition I've read this summer. The others are Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition and My Beef with Meat: The Healthiest Argument for Eating a Plant-Strong Diet--Plus 140 New Engine 2 Recipes, which I recommend along with this one by Michael Moss.The following quote by Moss (on page 337) pretty much summarizes what Salt Sugar Fat is all about:""It had taken me three and a half years of prying into the food industry's operations to come to terms with the full range of institutional forces that compel even the best companies to churn out foods that undermine a healthy diet. Most critical, of course, is the deep dependence the industry has on salt, sugar, and fat. Almost every one of the hundreds of people I interviewed in the course of writing this book--bench chemists, nutrition scientists, behavioral biologists, food technicians, marketing executives, packaging designers, chief executives, lobbyists--make the point that companies won't be giving these three up, in any real way, without a major fight. Salt, sugar, and fat are the foundations of processed food, and the overriding question the companies have in determining the formulations of their products is how much they need to achieve the maximum allure.""Another quote that summarizes another minor, but notable, theme throughout the book (on page 341) is:""On a personal level, I found that many of the executives I talked to go out of their way to avoid their own products.""Quite telling, don't you think?While I had been personally weaning myself from various processed foods for decades, it wasn't until I adopted the whole foods plant based diet two years ago (advocated in both other books mentioned above) that I went the route of ""no exceptions"" on processed and fast food. This book by Moss, simply confirms my decision and gives me more reasons to stay the course. Thank you, Michael Moss, for a well researched, well written book that should help many people become healthier, as they free themselves from their addictions to salt, sugar, and fat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TASMEEEC4YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400069807#wasThisHelpful","R16TASMEEEC4YE","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been learning, and performing, songs by the Beatles since I was 14 years old (and that was in 1964). In those days I always tried to learn the pieces note perfect. In later years I began doing interpretations or arrangements of these songs, but when someone asks me to play a song by the Beatles, I usually grab ""Norwegian Wood,"" or ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,"" because I know people want to hear these songs like the originals.Recently, a group of high school students asked me if they could learn, and perform, the entire Abbey Road album. So I bought a copy of these scores to help me along.These scores were an invaluable tool, but I still had to do some extra work to communicate what was in them to these students.Here are a few things that come to mind:1. These songs are not in album order, and that includes the ""medley"" songs on Abbey Road. What a pain, especially when the transitions are not accurately notated.2. Sometimes the chord name is not accurate, so I had to tweak a few of these.3. I did not always agree with the notation or tab on the guitar solos. In one song, they attribute the solo to two guitars, when it is clearly one on the recording.4. The vocals are written an octave higher than the actual range. This is fine for people who can read treble clef, but I had to renotate some of the vocals so that the singers could see their parts more accurately.I'm not saying these things as a complaint, but as a way of saying this is an excellent guide to the work of the Beatles, but it's not perfect, and will still require your attention. The book has been an invaluable tool, and I plan to use it more in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QZNJ6YZ21NXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0793518326#wasThisHelpful","R2QZNJ6YZ21NXJ","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then they return to each home and he prepares meals.Having been on this dient for nearly two years (as of this writing), I remember that initial overwhelmed feeling I had of what to eat, what not to eat, what to clear out of my kitchen, what to buy, etc. This video clealy shows the ""deer in the headlights"" look on the faces of these two families. But in the end they are eating delicious meals prepared by Rip.I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to see how these families are faring six months or a year later, but for a hastily prepared video, this program explains a alot.I was alarmed to see Rip using his hands to spread out many of the ingredients, not spoons or spatulas. Some people might be disgusted with the excessive amount of fingers in the food. But Rip is a healthy, likeable guy, and this is easily forgiven.I hope that someday there is a sequel to see how these families did. This was worth watching two years after getting started to see how far we've come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORW5N56TSMPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064EEJN0#wasThisHelpful","RORW5N56TSMPS","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a physician who says he had a problem with food addictions, presents a convincing argument that processed foods and fast foods are now created to make us addicted to eating more food.This is the young adult version of The End of Overeating, by the same author, but it works well as a book for anyone interested in this subject from middle school ages on up.I received my copy as part of a subscription service for my high school library. The subject matter caught my attention, because I've been a fat-free vegan for nearly two years. It was a quick read, and supports much of what I've read elsewhere in recent years. I already have several people waiting in line to read our copy.While the book is an indictment of the food industry, he does not demand that they change, but that we change the way we think about food. His final chapters give helpful tips on how to take control of our own eating habits.I will be recommending this book to our foods classes and to anyone concerned about diet. My friends who are not vegan will appreciate this book.Once you make the change to eating real food, you may want to look for cookbooks by The Happy Herbivore (Lindsay S. Nixon). Her first cookbook is The Happy Herbivore Cookbook: Over 175 Delicious Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GUCRUDF7VEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596438312#wasThisHelpful","R8GUCRUDF7VEW","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frankly, I found this book (which I listened to as an audiobook) to be too well written to be taken as ""proof"" of anything. It has the feel of a very well-written novel..a short one, one that got my attention, but not one that provided proof of anything other than a testimony of the author's own supposed experience.I find it too convenient that the author has a website, selling other products, is connected with some other ""New Age"" foundation, and is a hot item on the speakers circuit (including Oprah).But even while I have my doubts about this book, it has opened the door for me to think about near death experiences (NDE) more and to perhaps examine some of the literature on the topic.In the mean time, I will return to the writings by and about Orthodox Christian monastics who confront their own mortality on a daily basis and who have very similar profound spiritual experiences.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35F6U2T56IMCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442359315#wasThisHelpful","R35F6U2T56IMCJ","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It would be a mistake to think of the sacrifices of Lent in purely negative terms--in terms of struggle and deprivation. We are to think of Lent as liberation. Lent calls us to sacrifice many of those things which, while they tend to occupy such a central position in our lives, are in reality things we can do without. Lent is thus a rediscovery of that which is most essential in our lives. In this rediscovery, we return to God and to the very meaning of life (Meditations for Great Lent, page 88).""This little book, with short chapters, gets at the heart of Great Lent, using quotes from the hymnody of the Orthodox Church, as well as quotes from Scripture. The author presents powerful meditations (or homilies) emphasizing humility, repentance, ascetic love, fasting from sin, not judging, the passions and virtues, joy, the cross and resurrection and the journey to Pascha.Since we are encouraged to do more spiritual reading during Great Lent, this is a great one to add to your annual list of readings. It is quick and easy, yet profound, and will do much to prepare your heart for the journey (even if you start this book late in Lent, it's never too late).For someone who wants a more in depth discussion of services of Great Lent in the Orthodox Church, I would also recommend Great Lent: Journey to Pascha.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D4MMH7C6V6GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936270609#wasThisHelpful","R2D4MMH7C6V6GI","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while a book is destined to become a spiritual classic, one that is appreciated not only by Orthodox Christians, but for people of all persuasions, whether they be Orthodox, Protestant, Catholic, I would even say atheist. This is such a book.It was recommended to me by my priest, but I quickly discovered that many people in my circle of friends and acquaintances were already reading it (or had just finished it) and all were enthused by what they read.Here we have a Russian Orthodox monk and priest, writing about the lives in and around his monastery; a monastery that not only survived, but also thrived, during the anti-Christian Communist Soviet reign of Russia. Each chapter is a story, a peak into someone's life, someone who is an ""ordinary saint.""This book fills me with hope and urges me to press on in my own fallible spiritual walk. Life is a journey, one that hopefully draws us closer to God, but one in which we all stumble and make mistakes.I will add this to my list of favorite spiritual classics. It's right up there with Father Arseny, 1893-1973: Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father : Being the Narratives Compiled by the Servant of God Alexander Concerning His Spiritual Father, The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality and Wounded by Love: The Life and Wisdom of Elder Porphyrios.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F241XMXPD8ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZM6MM8#wasThisHelpful","R1F241XMXPD8ZO","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"80 pages of text, including many sidebars, plus several appendixes about the life and work of American Indian poet and author, Sherman Alexie, provide an excellent introduction for young adult readers.The book covers some of the same material that is found in Alexie's best-selling young adult novel, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and transferring to nearby Reardan High School to further his education and play basketball. It was in a creative writing class at Washington State University that Alexie found his calling as a writer.This book would be excellent for students (or even adults) who want a brief overview of Sherman Alexie's life and career. I have heard him speak, and the humorous Alexie I experienced is clearly evident on these pages.Alexie describes himself as following in his grandmother's footsteps as a teller of tales when he says, ""I was doing something old fashioned.

"At times silly, a times profound.At times spiritual, at times an acid-trip.At times biographical, at times a fantasy.A bit of Liverpool, a bit of London, also Hamburg.A bit of India, California, Virgin Islands and Hawaii,Even New York.There are enough memorable quotes in this volume to plough through the stranger moments,And there is enough humor in the strange moments to keep you entertained,After all Eric Idle is here as well.At first I was ignoring the facsimiles of the handwritten lyrics,But then I was drawn to them to see how some of these songs evolved.I enjoyed the book. I think it's mainly for the die-hard Harrison fan, one who knows most of his songs. I connected better with his comments when I knew the song than the tunes I didn't know.I was a huge Beatles fan (saw them twice), but not as big a George fan in the post-Beatles days, other than his ""hits."" Also I became a follower of Jesus about the time he became a follower of Krishna, so much of his material was foreign to me. But like I said, if I knew the song, I enjoyed his comments about it more.As a songwriter, I enjoyed learning about George's songwriting process.

"I recently acquired this book for our public high school library. Although this book has been favorably reviewed for high school students, I was wondering how her private life would be presented in this volume aimed at young adult readers. While it would receive a PG13 rating if it were a film, the main point of the book can be summarized in the following quote from the last chapter:""Fame had nurtured and encouraged Janis's wild, over-the-top behavior. People loved when she swaggered onto the stage with a bottle of Southern Comfort or waxed lyrical about getting high. And, along the way, she became as hooked on adulation as she was on drugs and alcohol. It was the attention she craved all her life, from her lonely high school days to her spirited college days to her crazy days in San Francisco, speeding around town in her psychedelic Porsche. To feed her voracious need for more love and praise, she became ever more outrageous. She took greater and greater personal risks until, finally, sheer carelessness caught up with her..."" (Janis Joplin: Rise Up Singing, page 99).Janis was an awesome blues singer. I saw her shortly after she joined Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1966. But her life went out of control, resulting in her untimely death. This books celebrates the music, while providing a cautionary tale for readers that ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" can lead down a dark path to addiction, and in this case, eventually death.For a young person wanting to better understand what Janis was all about, or to get a better understanding of the psychedelic music scene in the late Sixties, this volume does an amazing job of showing it as it was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBQ4SGLRT0VLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MXBT0S#wasThisHelpful","RBQ4SGLRT0VLN","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Many revere Guevara for treating the sick and standing up for the poor. But few care to discuss the brutality he exhibited as a guerilla leader or his support of Fidel Castro, who imposed a harsh dictatorship on millions of Cuban people. In life Che Guevara was a political contradiction. In death he will always be young, brave, and defiant (Stuart A. Kallen, Che Guevara: You Win or You Die; page 75).While there is much to be learned about Che Guevara from this short volume (88 pages, including a timeline, glossary, and ""who's who?""), it shies away from ""the brutality he exhibited as a guerilla leader.""I decided to read this title after it was sent to my high school library by one of my suppliers. One of my colleagues fled Castro's Cuba at age 10 and raised questions about a book that would treat Guevara as an ""international icon.""

While Armstrong claims that Islam is a peaceful religion, I was still struck by the amount of violence throughout the history of Islam.I found her chapter on ""fundamentalism"" to be fascinating, as she compares the fundamentalism of all the world's major monotheistic religions.

How does David Wilcox know what I was feeling many years ago?Another one is ""Strong Chemistry"" which talks about the addictive nature of some relationships.""Advertising Man"" is a humorous tyrade against the tobacco industry specifically, but could also be interpreted to speak against any ads that promote a product that does not enhance a healthy lifestyle.""Covert War"" observes a mom and dad's relationship falling apart. I think he must've seen this firsthand.""Daddy's Money"" pokes fun at rich girls who have it all.And ""Rusty Old American Dream"" pays homage to the great gas guzzlers of the past...done in a 50s or 60s Chuck Berry rock and roll style.Every tune is great on this album, but some have worn out for me personally.Like I said, I have graduated to other David Wilcox albums, and each one contains more ""best of"" songs on them.

"I read the first edition of The Diary of a Young Girl in my early teens back in the 1960s. It was a book that had a huge impact on my life, partly because I was born in Amsterdam (after the war) to parents who helped save Jews during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands (1940-45).Anne Frank has stayed with me for nearly 50 years. Recently, as I was preparing to tell my parents' story to high school history classes, I decided to revisit the book, and checked out the audiobook verson of the ""definitive edition."" Wow!Not only is this edition about 30% larger, containing more of Anne's thoughts about her mother, living in close proximity to others, and her own sexual awakening as a young girl, it is probably the best audiobook I've ever heard. After completing the book, I learned that Selma Blair received a well-deserved Grammy award for this performance.What I noticed about the book this time around is how incredibly articulate Anne Frank is; at how perceptive she is of her surroundings, as well as herself as a growing young lady; and at how observant she is of her place in history.I have kept a journal most of my life, and I think it is the fact that I read this book as young teen that influenced me to do so.

In a nutshell, I couldn't wait for it to end.It felt a bit like a poorly designed amusement ride, with two characters in the car, waiting for each new obstacle or scary thing to happen to them.

"Fever, 1793 is an excellent piece of historical fiction written for young adults, one that adults would enjoy, as well. Laurie Halse Anderson obviously did her homework in preparing for this tale about a young teen who has to work in the coffee house run by her mother and grandfather during the time that Philadelphia is the temporary home of the new nation's capitol.With a mosquito buzzing around in the first paragraph, a hint to what is about to come, an epidemic of Yellow Fever breaks out, eventually killing thousands of people in town over the course of the summer of 1793. Mattie's world crumbles around her, with her mother disappearing, presumed dead, and her grandfather, after helping her survive the fever, dies at the hands of burglars.Anderson weaves together many historical elements, and characters, such as George Washington and Benjamin Rush, a famous Philadelphia physician, along with the daily lives, foods, shopping habits, jobs, medical practices, and travel into a believable work of fiction. There is a bit of love story sifted into the plot, but not enough to turn off boys, in my opinion. On the other hand, there is enough gruesome detail, and even some violence, to appeal to young male readers.I will be recommending this work to young people in my high school library who enjoy historical fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW0TAAM8Z43OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689848919#wasThisHelpful","RW0TAAM8Z43OM","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Higher Ground is quirky. It jumps around a bit and makes one wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. There are several stories behind the story that don't quite get told, such as when this Evangelical group went from church to ""house church"" and then back to church, again. But since I lived through those times and saw many events like this in my own life, I found it easy to connect the dots.Higher Ground was disturbing for me as someone who saw a fair amount of abuse in the Evangelical scene, and as someone who finally escaped it. I know several people who are suffering emotional and spiritual scars from their times in that scene, and this film helped bring some of that stuff to the surface.Higher Ground is thought-provoking, just because of what I said above. I spent more time talking about this film afterwards than any other in recent times, probably just because I lived through similar things as the protagonist in this story. I came to the concusion that her ""Higher Ground"" was actually questioning what was going on around her.I wouldn't call this a ""must see,"" as some other reviewers here. I'm glad I saw it, as it gave me a chance to reflect (once again) on some stuff in my own personal history with the Evangelical scene.

"I mainly got hold of this volume to follow up on the Rabbit series. The other short stories help to underscore the impression I got of Updike reading the earlier Rabbit novels: he writes extensivevly about the effects of the sexual revolution on middle America.It's not a pretty sight, but as I look around me, I see that virtually everyone I know has been impacted by it, directly or indirectly. I think that's why I kept returning to the Rabbit series.In the final novella, we see Rabbit's son, his illegitimate daughter, his estranged daughter-in-law, and the son of one of his previous flings converge for an imperfect, but still hopeful, celebration on the eve of the new millenium. Rabbit's many imperfections are brought to the surface and to put it simply, he's described at one point as ""selfish."" He's one that leaves a lot of collateral damage behind after his selfish escapades.That pretty much sums up the mess that Rabbit has created and that the next generation has inherited. Like I said in a previous review: ""Isn't he a bit like you and me.""I'm done with Rabbit for now, but I'm glad I finally experienced this character, who is about as famous as Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye; another person you enjoy reading about but would never really want to know...or be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ITKOMTOKYKJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345442016#wasThisHelpful","R3ITKOMTOKYKJF","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last summer I returned to my birthplace of Holland, which I had not seen since I was three years old in 1953. After checking out several travel guides, we decided to mainly use this one by Rick Steves. I suppose it helps that I live about 45 minutes from his headquarters and we stopped into his shop a couple of times to pick up travel gear.We spent two weeks in the Netherlands, staying overnight in four locations, three of which we got out of this book. The book did an accurate job of describing these bed and breakfasts and hotels, and we were not disappointed (although one hotel was a bit of a letdown after we got the best room in the previous hotel).We stayed near Arnhem, and in Amsterdam, Delft and Haarlem. Based on the book, we enjoyed museums, canal tours, restaurants, walks, bike rides, and we learned how to navigate the airport, the trains and the trams. There is no way you can do everything that is recommended in the book, but Steves and his companions make it very helpful to plan the trip, and to make adjustments in the itinerary once you're on the way.The one shortcoming is that not enough of the country is covered in the book. We spent a delightful day in Zutphen, looking up family history, and found it to be a town that any tourist would enjoy, but there is no mention of it on these pages. We also considered a side trip to Groningen, but again there was no mention of that region in this book.Holland may be small, but in our two weeks we discovered that there are distinctive characteristics to each region, and one could easily spend a long time in this country and just barely scratch the surface. Hopefully Steves will consider doing a longer book in the future, because he does such a good job at what he has already covered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20UB96UFFH23N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598807684#wasThisHelpful","R20UB96UFFH23N","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been listening to the Rabbit audiobooks from my library out of sequence, but it's been a fascinating ride. Rarely has a protagonist and series captured my attention the way Rabbit has.I'm still not sure why. Updike places Rabbit, his son Nelson, girlfriend Jill, ""houseguest"" Skeeter, wandering wife Janice, and a host of secondary characters solidly in the context of middle-class America in 1969. Updike's eye for detail from this period is impeccible.But it's Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom and his aimless hedonistic life, and his poor decisions that lead to disastrous results that propell the story along.As the book was wrapping up the lyrics of ""Nowhere Man,"" by the Beatles  popped into my head. Perhaps this is why Rabbit's story appeals to me:He's a real nowhere man,Sitting in his nowhere land,Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.Doesn't have a point of view.Knows not where he's going to.Isn't he a bit like you and me?","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CF2BX4A9Y0E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449911934#wasThisHelpful","R1CF2BX4A9Y0E6","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first encountered From I-ville to You-ville while dining with the monks in the trapeza (dining hall) of the Monastery of St. John of San Francisco back in 2007. It is the practice of the monks to read spiritually uplifting books during the meal, and this delightful children's book was selected after they finished a much heavier theological treatise. The monks, and the guests (including me) were delighted at the powerful message of embracing selflessness told so beautifully and simply.I bought a copy at the monastery bookstore, and brought it home and put it in my bookcase until tonight, more than four years later. Yesterday I finished another book that made reference to this one, so I pulled it out, and we decided to make it our read-aloud entertainment for New Year's Eve. There are no children in our household. Just two aging Christians seeking a deeper walk with God.We were delighted at this allegory about a boy from I-ville named Stubborn who meets a girl from You-ville named Serenity. She invites him to come visit, which he does. He finds it difficult to get there at first, but he reaches his destination where he undergoes a transformation. When he eventually returns home a year later, he has to face the reaction of those in You-ville to the changes in his life.Highly recommended for Christians of all persuasions. Children, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1233X7RPNG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9608677866#wasThisHelpful","R1F1233X7RPNG0","A3APYWXL54R4R6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3APYWXL54R4R6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an EXCELLENT brush.  It is made for water to be channeled up the extension.  The water is then channeled through 6 or so spray nozzles built into the brush.

"Well I have tried several inexpensive DVRs in the past weeks.  Trying to get an IPC NVR solution that costs less than $250.  I found this solution as the best so far.  The best part is the company actually responded to my emails.  I have several ideas that will make this baby ""The Best Bang for the Buck"".  Since I have quite a few emails form them already I think they will be very responsive.I was able to get it up and running quickly with my nine Onif 2.1 profile S cameras. The DVR found all of the cameras (Onvif) but only setup 2 of them. I had to manually enter the RTSP data for the rest of the cameras. The firmware was 20150124 just as reference. Packaging was great.  It even came with a mouse, black to match NVR.  It had a bigger Power Supply then any of the others.  Make sure to get a hard drive that is made for surveillance.  I am using a  WD Purple.  WD Red should also work well.I am a retired computer scientist from the USAF so I have background in this area. The real data on this unit is that you are able to get 1280 x 800 size videos at 2 mbs. The frame rate drops down to ~15 fps on my cameras. I have tested the unit with Vivotek FD8361, Vivotek FD8134v (2 of these setup with Onvif), Vivotek IP8336W and a HD Foscam.  The recorder function I needed was just always record all channels and it was very easy to setup.  If you setup a trigger (motion) to record you should be able to get a bunch of days more on the hard drive.I  tried the playback function and it was good.  I will have a couple of things for their wish list.Hints:  If your cameras don't setup you might need to try RTSP instead of Onvif.  Your can verify your RTSP connection using Quicktime URL:  Keep your streams at 2 mbs or less.  I use 1 mbs for the wireless cameras.  The manual stays it can go up to 6M mbs in HD modes.  I used 1280 x 800 resolution and Constant Bit Rate (CBR).  Tried 30 fps and after reviewing data dropped down to 15 fps because the 30 fbs was not buying me anymore data with all 9 cameras running.  You should not have any problem if you camera is Onvif 2.4.  Mine are 2.1.Cons (these could be important).  With this revision I did not see that you could record to a NAS Server.  It seems you can record to a USB (I did not try).  You better have skinny HMDI and USB connectors, not much room there.  There is no custom window configuration so you need to select one of theirs.  Also the viewing window has some limitations on how any camera show video at one time.  For instance the 3x3 window only showed video on 5 channels.  The other 4 were blank, but if you double clicked on the blank ones they would go to single window and show video from that channel.The websites of interest are www.brovotech.com & www.ezvis.net.  The company actually answered a few of my question thru Amazon email connect.I will keep this thread current for a while since I just had the DVR one day.  More to come.  Ask question if you would like.Update (4 june 2015) - I have nearly a month of camera (9 cameras) recorded.  All is still working well.  Hopefully a new firmware will come out soon with a couple of minor bugs fixed.  I have recommended this recorder to a few folks.  Quite sure there is not a better ONVIF recorder for the money.Best,GadgetBTW - I am the guy whose wife won't let him run for politics because I have a bad habit of calling a ""turd"" a ""turd.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LCV4ZZKP78YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RZJ0A4A#wasThisHelpful","R1LCV4ZZKP78YM","AP911T3KQ6L9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP911T3KQ6L9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I sawed poles that were 8-10"" and a bunch of heavy treated boards.  The saw worked wonderfully.  After 2 days of cleaning up tons of debris, I cleaned the saw up and was astonished when my neighbor (Tim the Tool Man) asked to borrow it because with the high water his electric corded saw was a little scary.

The outside bolts did not line up with the factory holes and the sides were both 1/2"" too long and hit the front of the fender points.  In order to use this someone would have to cut the sides and extend the mounting holes.  Sadly they missed the boat here.  I was 5 star on the other 4 Wade clear bug deflectors, but this was a complete miss.Folks be careful if you attach this to your car.  Not only might it crack, but you could scratch your vehicle.Gadget","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDMWKAJNMMHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU3EN6M#wasThisHelpful","RXDMWKAJNMMHF","AP911T3KQ6L9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP911T3KQ6L9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hope the title got your attention.  I ordered this popcorn machine in last week.  Had a big function and needed it overnighted to me.  The packaging was ok, not quite as heavy as I would have liked.  No damage from shipping so I still gave it a thumbs up.  The visible damage on the machine was the SS bottom of the door.  It had a couple of dings.  Nothing  could have damaged it in shipping so I guess it was packed with dings.  I plan to take a photo and ask company if they can replace for free.So the only slight negative items have now been identified.  I want everyone to know that this is a fantastic machine.  Assembly was about 15 minutes.  The machine did not come with any free popcorn so I also purchased a 12 pack of GNP from amazon.  Followed the directions on the pack and made our first batch,  it was fantastic.  The next night we made 5 batches for the crowd attending our back yard movie night, and it was a big hit.  Many folks said they wanted to borrow it for an event they were having.Some tips for buyers:* Don't get clean happy on the kettle.  Every batch seemed to get better and I think there is credit in all the suggests to treat the kettle like a cast iron skillet.* Remember that the machine separates into 2 parts.  It takes a lot less room if set on a existing table top if the area is cramped* When cleaning out, take a piece of thick paper and use it to clean out the bottom window area where corn residue gets between glass and bottom rail.  THEN take out bottom panel (2 small screws) and VACUUM out all residue before wiping clean.* When making corn preheat for 4 mins then add ingredients.  Make sure to turn on rotator immediately.  Listen to the corn pop, when the popping starts to slow down turn off heater.  When it is barely popping turn off rotator and immediately dump kettle.  We did not have any burned corn following these simple instructions.I hope all buyers find this helpful, enjoy the popcorn !!Gadget","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AK8DUCT7PSB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UDXQO4#wasThisHelpful","R3AK8DUCT7PSB4","AP911T3KQ6L9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP911T3KQ6L9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well where do I start.  First of all my product shipped from China which took 20 days.  Second when it came in the LED was inop.  The VERY bright side of this transaction is that I had timely communication with a technician in china and he was able to ship me a replacement at no charge.  I like the light a lot.  It is 200 - 300 lumens (not 1000) and compares easily with a Surefire light I had in the service.  The quality may not be as good but again this light cost $10.  My Surefire I had cost much more than $100 more.  My wife and I each use one of this on our nightstand for emergency use.  When we travel they will go with us because if you ever had a total black out like we have had it can be life saving.I did notice that this light is now Amazon Prime, so I ordered a spare and I will test it and report back if any problems.ThanksUPDATE - This replacement light went bad in 2 weeks.  Remember Amazon only has a 30 day warranty and it takes 20 days to ship.  Duh !!  So if it is not DOA you basically get no warranty.  I will say I ordered two more lights and plan to use for parts.

When I went to open the manufactures box I noticed that the flaps and inter box were ripped up some.  Checked out the exterior and all look ok.  I went on line the internet to see if any pointers on install were available.  I immediately found the scope for $20 less.  I checked with Amazon to see about price match.  They said NO, but I could send it back.  I then decided install scope on handgun after ordering the correct rings from Amazon.  Decided the $20 wasn't worth all the fuss.  When I went to adjust the scope I was livid.  No adjustment collar or knob was on the side (see video).  The was the deal breaker, sending this puppy back !!I feel kind of bad that my last few reviews were negative.

" 2:34 MinsI purchased this unit from amazon 4 days ago.  I even made a video because hearing is believing.  First of all this unit works very well.  It has filled the bucket 5 or 6 times in an air conditioned Florida home showing 53% humidity.  Since we turned on this unit we are down to 44% inside humidity.  The construction observed is very good (we did look at Lowe's and Home Depot units which were poorly constructed), features are good but the thing sounds like a freight train passing by.  Also remember that the air coming out of the unit is warmer than the air going in 72.8 deg in and 91 deg out, another problem with the unit in the living area.  A good modification would be a dual gauge showing both the setting and the room humidity level.  Truth be told we will probably have to return the unit because it is just too loud for a living area.

"This is the toughest reusable bag I own.  I have been using a few bags I purchased from Whole Foods but they didn't machine wash very well and the straps could not withstand heavy items.  These bags are awesome.  I have washed them a couple times already and of course they held up because they are made of 100% cotton.  Other bags I have are not made of natural fabrics.  I use them at farmers markets because they don't do so well at the grocery story with boxed items like cereals, crackers, and canned goods.  The bags just aren't that wide, so you will likely need all three bags if you buy a lot of these items.  I use them to carry books, clothes, craft supplies, and fruits/veggies.  They are also very handy when traveling. The baroque patterned bag is my favorite and I get plenty of compliments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSBMH4JS7B6FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGQAA2U#wasThisHelpful","RSBMH4JS7B6FC","AG6TX1ZJHLMO7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6TX1ZJHLMO7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Australian Shepherd and she is very well behaved.  She has been through agility and obedience training, however, she does have issues with walking too fast on the leash with my elderly parents.I got this training aid in hopes of correcting my dog from pulling on the leash.  I used static correction at first - at a medium level - and she learned quickly.  I am now using the tone button and my Aussie responds very well with the commands.I was hoping that my dog would be able navigate the agility course without me running next to her using the push-to-talk feature.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite work very well.  She first thought that it was cruel ventriloquist act and she would stop and look around to see where the voices were coming from.  She eventually learned to ignore my voice altogether.This unit is quite effective when used with positive reinforcements. I have also used as a less cruel bark collar and my dog responded positively.I don't have a second unit to pair it with, but that feature would be amazing to have for multiple dogs.The Training System is very easy to use after you read the instructions. I tried to use it without reading the directions and I that is how I found out the intensity of the stimulation to my dog.  :-)  I also agree with a previous reviewer in that the remote is fairly large to keep in a pocket.  The remote isn't rechargeable so keep the AAA batteries handy.I feel the price of this unit is too high and would be better priced around $50 less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179UP5HQFDAZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFW0LY0#wasThisHelpful","R179UP5HQFDAZW","AG6TX1ZJHLMO7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6TX1ZJHLMO7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not very handy, but I have installed a few fans in my day. Even so, working on fans is always a pain, and always harder than I expect it to be. That being said, I installed the programmable control without too much muss or fuss, and I lived to tell the tale.Now that the product is installed, I am really excited. Just being able to control the light and fan with the remote control is a BIG advantage. Once the weather warms up, I envision programming the fan to shut off in the middle of the night after I have fallen asleep, and the house has cooled down.

"My first thought this is a pricy bottle of cologne for the size.  I kind of thought that Calvin Klein was less than scents I have been using (spice bomb and tom ford).  Once I put the Euphoria I realized I had misjudged and that this scent held up to what I perceived to be more expensive scents.  First off this is a case of a little goes a long way as there is some serious holding power with Euphoria.  The scent to me is a perfect day scent and comes across as very clean and crisp and makes me think of outdoors.  5 hours later when my Tom Ford scent as faded the Calvin Klein is still going strong.  Like I previously mentioned the scent is fresh and clean (perhaps the smell of freshly washed linens?) but still manly enough.

"This product is much better than Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray.  My sister has wavy hair and this spray gives her locks that beachy, wavy look by just scrunching her hair after spraying the product.  I, on the other hand, have very straight hair.  I use this too to give my hair the beach look.  I twist clumps of my hair and use a hot iron to give the curl.  The spray helps hold in the waves and works great.  Yes there is oil in this as stated in the name, but it doesn't give my hair any greasy feel.  The scent is light and very pleasant.

"I received this in exchange for a review.  This is a total score for me as I already use the Art of Shaving products.The first thing you should ask yourself is....is it worth it?  Do you want a great shave, do you need a badger brush and do you want to smell nice?The next is can you afford it and if you answer yes than you need to pull the trigger.I currently use a twezzerman badger brush its nice but I lose bristles every time it is used.  The art of shaving brush takes a beating and does not lose a hair.  Even tried to pull out a bristle and they are packed in tight.The cream will last you at least 4 months of regular use.  Its really a case of a little goes a long way.  You will lather up better than you ever have.The aftershave makes you feel nice and smell nice.  My wife loves it after I shave.Shaving with these products will produce the best shave of your life (as long as  you have a nice blade).  You will also smell nice.I prefer the Lemon scent over Lavender but that is a matter of choice.Is it worth it...yes.  Its cheaper to buy the pack than to buy each item individually.The product is top notch and sold at plenty of high end stores in fact Art of Shaving even has their own store in Las Vegas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DF6PUIGXY0IV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I2XL88#wasThisHelpful","R2DF6PUIGXY0IV","AG6TX1ZJHLMO7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6TX1ZJHLMO7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although my skin has yet to show major signs of aging, I know that I must start thinking about preventing mother nature from taking control.  The SKII Essential Power Eye Cream is a good choice.  The cream comes with a spatula for easy scooping from the cream pot and it absorbs quickly under my eyes and over my lids. The cream has a very faint but pleasant scent and it is lightweight when applied.  It is not greasy and has a luxurious feel.  After the first week of use, I have noticed some firming of my eyelids and the area under my eyes look less sunken in.  I truly believe that over time and consistent use of the product, that the early signs of my crows feet on the corners of my eyes will diminish.

"I would like to start off with the packaging, the box looked like it had been through the war.  It was tattered and torn.  It was a bit difficult to maneuver the rolled up mattress in the plastic bag to get the mattress situated.  Once opened, the mattress began taking shape.  I searched and could not find any instructions. I have friends who purchased memory foam mattresses and they had to let them rise and air out for 24 hours.  I assumed the same applied to this bed as well.  The odor isn't too bad but definitely needs to be aired out.  After the 24 hour period, I noticed there was still a dip in part of the mattress that hadn't quite risen.  I figured it need longer to rise.  After a week, the dip is still there.  It feels like part of the mattress’ foam core is missing.  You can feel the hole.  The mattress feels cool to the touch, but once you lay on it there is nothing cooling about it.  After you place the mattress pad and fitted sheet on the bed it was as “cool” as any other mattress.  It was too soft for me, I would have preferred it to be a bit firmer. The mattress does have a zippered cover which is nice, so you can take it off to wash it.  The mattress does come with a 25 year limited warranty and probably would have fixed the defect in the mattress if I wasn’t so disappointed with it.  I am sure this mattress would be good for those who like a softer mattress, but it wasn’t for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R193MIPKG50V22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGC29ZA#wasThisHelpful","R193MIPKG50V22","AG6TX1ZJHLMO7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6TX1ZJHLMO7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I don't believe this Soundbar will replace my main TVs current sound system, I do believe that the speaker really packs a punch.  I put it in my bedroom because my flat screen TVs speakers were barely audible and the sound quality is poor.  This system is great because I can use it with with Bluetooth or when connected to my TV.When taking it out of the box, it seems like is it is big and bulky, but when you set it up, it doesn't seem as cumbersome.  The Orbitsound also comes with a subwoofer, whereas most other quality speakers have you buy it separately.  I am not tech savvy and I can attest that other reviewers are correct in saying that the set-up is sooo easy!.  There is a quick set-up guide and it is simple and all you need to know to work your speakers.  It also comes with all the wires needed so no need to buy 'em.I didn't try the speakers on my laptop, tablet, or computer, but I am sure you will find it just as easy to pair the Bluetooth or use the auxiliary cords.I HIGHLY recommend this Soundbar.

"I am an avid Febreze consumer and I have tried room deodorizers, air fresheners, soaps, cleaners etc  and all are great products with great scents. When I saw Febreze was paired with Unstopables, I knew I had to give it a try.  I use the Unstopables in my laundry and I have had compliments on the fabulous smell coming from my clothes.  I thought the scent would be similar.  Unfortunately, the Fresh and Flirty scent of this Air Freshener was not quite the same scent as the Unstopable in wash scent booster.This freshener comes with a double oil glass container. While the warmer's design is more attractive than other Glade or Airwick dispensers, it makes the scent super strong.  I first put this in a smaller living room connected to the kitchen.  The scent was indeed overpowering at the lowest strength setting.  I had to move it to a much larger room with vaulted ceilings.  It is still very powerful.  I have only had the warmer in the wall for a few days.  If the scent continues this strong, it is hard to imagine it will last the 60 days as stated on the box.  If it does, then this item is amazing and well worth the price tag.  If it doesn't, then definitely not worth the purchase.  I will update my review when I am out of oil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SWR4S7CSCKL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBGPJFE#wasThisHelpful","R2SWR4S7CSCKL1","AG6TX1ZJHLMO7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG6TX1ZJHLMO7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the privilege of reading and reviewing Melissa Spoelstra's ""Jeremiah: Daring to Hope..."" study book and it honestly set a high standard for me as far a faith study books so when I saw this book become available, I grabbed it up. ""Joseph"" isn't as intense for me as ""Jeremiah"" was but as it is about ""The Journey to Forgiveness"" by using Joseph as the core focus for teaching, it seems right that it was a bit gentler on my senses. Spoelstra doesn't skimp on the reading and exercises which I love but overall, it just seemed to have a more natural flow for me.

"Gena Showalter is a hit-and-miss for me. When I love her books, I really love them (and hat tip to a commenter from a few years back who told me not to ignore her earliest work because that has some of her best work). But when I'm not crazy about a book, it isn't dislike as much as ambivalence. Still, when I saw that this book, I figured ""Why not?"" because there are other paranormal adult fiction writers whose YA work I enjoy consistently (Kelley Armstrong is the strongest example).I expected to be a little behind the ball when I saw ""A Mad Zombie Party"" was a Book 4 of a series but a little research showed me that it is a spin off of sorts. It actually seems a mix of side story, spin off and sequel in that it features character(s) of the main series in lead roles where the antagonist (Anima Industries) that has been defeated stirs up again. Some of the teen speak did throw me off a bit because it did seem a bit forced  and maybe a little too cute sometimes for me. That said, there is still a nice charm to the proceedings and I did like the premise that it is an action adventure story that is also about moving forward. I liked Frosty, Milla and Kat. It was an interesting dynamic of a triangle that was and wasn't since Kat is deceased and that there is a bigger problem in that they have to battle Anima again.I liked the story enough to throw the first three books of the series on my wish list so maybe with the holidays coming up, I'll start the series from the beginning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKIHURH4DGBHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211821#wasThisHelpful","RKIHURH4DGBHS","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was more curious than anything because even after reading, I still have trouble with the idea of not having a plan B for anything that has to do with my finances (once burned, twice burned, how many times does it take to get burned is my motto), but Vigeland does lay out some interesting ideas that are within reach. There was some parts that I skimmed on (like the entire chapter called ""The Eat Pray Love Thing"") but  others I paid more attention to.

"I am a hit-and-miss reader when it comes certain types of fantasy novels set in a certain century of Britain. Simply put, I hated ""Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"" and I've never understood its popularity and it scarred me so I always gingerly approach historical fantasy set in Britain, save for a few authors.So it was that I selected Zen Cho's ""Sorcerer to the Crown"" with some reservations.And I ended up loving it. Witty, intelligent and deceptive in its social commentary, it is the kind of story that one hopes will be good but rarely hits all the notes that you want, but for me, this one did. Zacharias Wythe is a former slave who taken in by Sir Stephen Wythe, who was England's Sorcerer Royal. Upon his death, Zacharias inherits the position. Due to his color and status, Zacharias has few allies and must prove his worth more than he would have otherwise.Then there is Prunella Gentlewoman, whose birth and status is shaky as well. She is staying at a school for young women who have magic but must learn to suppress their magical abilities because women can't handle such things. When Zacharias speaks at Prunella's school, an incident occurs and he becomes a de facto guardian of sorts who will take her to London under the pretext of helping her to land a husband but also so she can become his apprentice.The premise is great as is the world that author Cho builds. It is a lived in world that is both familiar and fantastic. The themes woven in the story are present but not too heavy handed with room for wit and charm without sacrificing intrigue. I'm repeating myself, but I loved it and I want to read it again already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMGX05TJVVF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425283372#wasThisHelpful","R3KMGX05TJVVF9","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected Billy Coffey's ""The Curse of Crow Hollow"" for the title alone. I was a little confused that it was in the Christian section but while there is faith elements, the author blends several genres to tell an engrossing thriller of a story.Told in what seems a mix of first and second person, there is still a definite narrator who is probably unreliable which sets the right tone of the story. It is set in Crow Holler, a small town in the Appalachians. Living up on the mountain near Crow Holler is Alvaretta Graves, an old woman who may or may not be a witch but whose 'curse' upon the town at her husband's death still affects the folks who live there. When a group of teenagers inadvertently cross her path, they become ensnared in the curse and after that, it seems to be as present than ever before.It is a psychological thriller as well as a folklore supernatural one. It makes you wonder if the curse is self-fulfilling or an actual curse or maybe a bit of both. Coffey does a fine job of setting the place, the people and the plot on a path that is creepy and atmospheric. The pace can drag at times but overall, I found it to be engaging and eye catching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBKSO66LD3KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718026772#wasThisHelpful","R2HBKSO66LD3KB","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca Alexander's ""The Secrets of Blood and Bone"" is a book two of sorts in the story of Jackdaw Hammond, a woman who seems to have a life that is entwined with the supernatural. I didn't read the first book and I didn't feel too handicapped by that, it still felt a little like I may have had a better understanding of Jack's situation.After the events of the first book, Jack is looking for a place to hide and she thinks she's found it in a seemingly isolated home. Of course, that isn't going to happen as she still has others who are interested in her in the worst kind of way. It seems that a way out may lay in the long dead Edward Kelley and his path in the 16th century that led him to Venice.Told in two viewpoints that alternate between present day Jack and 16th century Edward, it was an interesting back and forth. I liked the pacing that Alexander laid out. There were a few things that raised a brow but nothing that tripped up a read that had a good sustained tension and an ending that was pretty well done.If there is another book to follow, I think I may pick that one up on the strength of this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4L7Z5U6GVLYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140707#wasThisHelpful","R4L7Z5U6GVLYY","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected Kaplan's TOEFL for two reasons: 1) curiosity and 2) my English skills are rusty (even if I am a native speaker). Prepping for this test seems like the same as the citizenship test in that if you don't have to take either, you don't know how hard they really are. While going through the various sections, I realized how weak my English skills had become, especially when I got to the chapter on ""Listening"". That chapter kicked my ego to the curb.I went through the book with a neighbor who had taken the test some years ago and she said that if she'd had a book like this, it definitely would have helped. She went to classes to prep for the test and she'd still recommend it, but the book provides extra guidance that she would have preferred to have.So whether you need to prepare for the test and you want to bring your English skills back up to snuff, this is a great book to have to practice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GNCSW51CH2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625233418#wasThisHelpful","R13GNCSW51CH2V","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rae Carson's ""Walk on Earth a Stranger"" has a great setting (1849 California Gold Rush) and a pretty good heroine in Lee Westfall. It is a mix of historical fiction, alternate history, and fantasy (paranormal) so that was intriguing too. Yet, the pacing was somewhat uneven so it made it hard to get into the rhythm.Lee is a loner but okay with her life until her parents are murdered. Her subsequent guardian is, of course, not the best person to be a guardian which sets her off on her own. The gift of sensing gold is part of the story but seemed more for flavoring. There is a familiarity to Lee's story (and the end is left open given that this will be a trilogy). I'm not that picky about familiar stories because that's just the way it goes and presentation can make up for a lot, but with the uneven pacing, it didn't quite grab me as I thought it would.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLT9C0VIDCI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242911#wasThisHelpful","R2CLT9C0VIDCI8","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This leads to a confrontation which brings her daughter, Polly, into the fray when she backs her mother up by getting physical with the principal. A bit of convoluted shenanigans (which I didn't mind at all) and the mother and daughter set off to Caroline's home town where she will face up to the friend who dumped her back in the day. I love that it isn't a guy that she is going to face, but a female friend because man, friendship break ups are hard to articulate in getting over yet they leave scars.It isn't an overly deep book but I liked how easy it was to relate to Caroline. Some of the culture nods by Polly was a bit annoying but it is easy to pass over and focus on the parts that were enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5PJEW085361O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006309#wasThisHelpful","R5PJEW085361O","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Rocket"" wasn't what I expected but it was interesting in how it was pragmatic and readable. Some lessons aren't really new but the presentation and content helps the reader reassess concepts that are familiar while taking in concepts that may be less familiar. It was more about branding but almost every business now has to have some kind of branding whether it is a physical product or a 'how it feels' product. In that sense, I had a bit of push-back but eventually, I pushed aside my bias and the ideas became easier to digest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXLX0DYQ54GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1259585425#wasThisHelpful","RGXLX0DYQ54GI","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like most people of a certain age, I lament that Christmas just 'isn't the same' as when I was younger. It often just seems like another holiday now. I often feel like Superbowl Sunday gets more attention than Christmas. So it was with that in mind that I selected Rob Burkhart's ""Five Questions of Christmas"". Although I'm reviewing it now, it was really meant for me to start reading on Thanksgiving Day to remind me of what Christmas (and the season) is about. I enjoyed it so much that I'm still sticking to that plan.Burkhart writes with a mix of theology and narrative so it is both easy to read but it isn't empty reading. It challenges and makes you think. I could stop reading to take time to go over a point and then pick up later. It also stayed on point for each question which is always nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZGOQ3IRL74Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881295#wasThisHelpful","R22ZGOQ3IRL74Q","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ellen Byron's ""Plantation Shudders"" is an easy going, charming murder mystery read. Maggie Crozat has returned home to the family's bed and breakfast Louisiana plantation. With a houseful of guests, a few meet their demise which puts Maggie and her family under suspicion. To help clear her name, Maggie starts to investigate and of course there is a handsome detective, Bo Durant, to help her out.The most violent that this book gets is that some characters will die because this is a murder mystery. Otherwise, it is the kind of murder mystery that made for enjoyable tv watching on a Sunday evening like ""Murder She Wrote"". The mystery isn't too mysterious but I really didn't mind because the characters were likable and the reading was easy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4ODKTYB0235/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1629532509#wasThisHelpful","RP4ODKTYB0235","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a sucker for the girl who went away but comes back home to lick wounds just to find that home is probably not the best place to have gone to.  In Brenda Novak's ""The Secret Sister"", Maisey is home to Fairhairn, North Carolina. It is an island so everyone knows everybody. Her first love is also back on the island and Rafe has a daughter. Her mother is not a very nice person so Maisey doesn't stay at the family home. Her brother is also back and he's a bit messed up himself, but Keith (the brother) being home means that when Maisey finds some pictures that trigger memories of a sister, Keith can corroborate this memory. So there is the 'secret sister' of the title.I honestly went into this book with some high hopes but the writing is a bit clunky. I didn't warm to any of the characters. I didn't really find the romance between Rafe and Maisey particularly compelling. It isn't a bad book or story, but I just didn't take to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OZPYDYLJF2O2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317803#wasThisHelpful","R2OZPYDYLJF2O2","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Hannah Arendt passed away, I didn't know anything about her but I remember my mother speaking about her because my mother was going to college so Arendt was a topic. As I got older, the name would come up from time to time wo when this book came to my attention, I thought I would try it. I've read a few of the books in the Icons line and I liked them so that was more incentive.Anne C. Heller's ""Hannah Arendt"" is the kind of biography I like when I am not familiar with someone but need to catch up quick but Wikipedia won't do. This is why I like the Icons line. It starts in Jerusalem when Eichmann was brought to trial and would be the subject of Arendt's ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"". It then goes into her early life and key moments to the post-publication time of the Eichmann book.This is an easy, quick book to read. Just enough depth to get a good feel for Ms Arendt although not so much that it'd overwhelm. I got a good idea on how contradictory Arendt's life could seem. I think if I were younger, I'd be more judgmental but being older, I think I understand better how contradictions can exist for someone like Arendt.I'm not sure if the book makes me want to take Arendt's writings, but I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Arendt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C2HZE9QK1SA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054445619X#wasThisHelpful","R1C2HZE9QK1SA9","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was doing great with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S that I was using to go over ""Samsung Galaxy Tab S for Dummies"" but the one thing that the book can't help you with is when someone takes the device away from you. BUT while I did have the device, the book really helped me learn how to use. Simple (and colorful!) is the best way to go with learning the basics and author Gookin really focuses on that which is how to get to the settings to social media to working the camera to posting some thing online. There is a chapter on maintenance as well.As always, the ""For Dummies"" line strength is in its simplicity. If you want complex, this isn't the book for you, but if you want to get started fast without a lot of useless instruction cluttering the pages and brain, this is the book for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KCKAZGO4Z7AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119005744#wasThisHelpful","R2KCKAZGO4Z7AM","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoyed ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" when I watched it some years ago, so when I saw this come across my dash, I figured ""what the heck?"" and selected it. Truth be though, I'm not a Star Wars aficionado so Christie Golden ""Star Wars: Dark Disciple"" is my first Star Wars book that I am reading.It was quite enjoyable. A solid 4 star for me in this story about how a former Sith/now bounty hunter Asajj Ventress is brought in by the Jedi to help get close to a Sith Lord. In doing so, she and Jedi, Quinlan Vos, are paired up on the mission and the adventure heats up in more ways than one.I don't remember all the details of the Clone Wars but I didn't feel it was necessary that I needed to in order to enjoy this story. Pacing was good; characterizations were great; and the action was just the right amount. I like the moral gray that surrounds the mission and the Jedi in particular. To be honest, this book actually makes me want to delve a bit more into other books set in the universe.But even if I don't go further into the Star Wars universe, I'm glad that I was given the opportunity to read this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29LUQ7A0NGF0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345511530#wasThisHelpful","R29LUQ7A0NGF0Q","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am not sure why I selected this book to read because I have never read a Robin Hobb book before and by admitting that, please take the rating with a big gulp of salt because I am sort of at a loss on how to review the book properly. I did like it but I believe to fully appreciate this story of Fitz, an assassin, and his old friend, the Fool, the reader has to read, at the very least, the first book of this trilogy (Fool's Assassin) and also to have time to read it properly than rush through it as I did. Hobb's writing is beautiful and that was enough to keep me going even when I sometimes felt completely lost.So I guess that would be my recommendation: Read the first book in the series first and then decide whether to take this one on.

"I selected ""Days of Awe"" because I kept thinking that the author's name seemed familiar. Lauren Fox also writes like someone that I feel like I've read before. It is almost eerie the deja vu that I felt while reading this story of Isabel ""Iz"" Moore and her time of mourning and growing.The story opens as she is dealing with the death of her best friend, Josie. There are layers surrounding Josie's accident that comes from the layers of closeness that Iz and Josie. Having lost a dear friend, this aspect of the novel had resonance for me. The story has a time skip to a year later and Iz's life is in worse shape. She's separated from her husband; distant with her childhood friend, Mark, who was also Josie's husband; and her relationship with her soon-to-hit-puberty daughter, Hannah, is hit-and-miss.It is her mother, Helene, who nudges Iz to come back to the fully living again.As noted before, there is a familiarity to Fox's writing that made me feel like I was dropped right into this woman's life. Iz's ambivalence; her awkwardness; and her coping mechanisms to what happens around her read very real for me. About the only part of the story that I wasn't as keen on was the ending which seemed a little too neat and tidy, but otherwise, it was a solid read for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBW1E2V2C2ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307268128#wasThisHelpful","R1BBW1E2V2C2ZD","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My little microwave came in today (super fast shipping at a really good price) and it is exactly what I needed since my old micro was on its final leg (only the express defrost was working). It is a small microwave which helps me save space. It is a perfect size for my home because there are only two of us and we use the microwave for prep work and/or small meals to warm up. It is a light item so it needed to have something placed on top to keep it from sliding a bit when I opened the front door but I had something on my old micro so it isn't a change for me.So far, I warmed up my corn chowder soup from lunch with ease. My son used it to make popcorn. We haven't had micro popcorn in a really long time. The front panel is a bit small so I think people with not great eyesight may want to consider that. If you look at it straight on and in good lighting, it isn't so bad but if it is at an angle with low lighting, the panel labels are a bit hard to discern.

"A few moments after I selected Brian Hiner's ""First, Fast, Fearless"", I went into a ""Oh man, why did I do that?!"" There is so much Navy SEAL stuff out there that it is getting to be almost a parody and I wondered if this would be the same.It isn't. It is a very well done, focused book on leadership that is readable and relatable. Yes, author Hines has worked with SEALs and that influences his points. It is neither rah-rah stuff nor theories that go over the head. It is a practical guide in which the word 'practical' actually means something. While it is focused on leadership, I felt that a team person would also find good advice in the book. I'm not a natural leader, so I often look for ways to be a better teammate and in that respect, I found a lot to admire here.Some may quibble about the lack of gender neutral terms (Hines uses 'brotherhood' a lot), but I didn't mind and I am a woman. For me, it is the ideas and advice that matter and how useful it can be because to me, that's the part that matters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T6PIXENW7NZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071844880#wasThisHelpful","R3T6PIXENW7NZE","A2SY92ZXU2FOEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SY92ZXU2FOEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like other reviewers have noted, this cotton blanket is not the ivory shade marked on the package and noted in Amazon description. Luckily, I prefer this almost-white shade so it works for me.I love everything about it and am pleased that it is a more medium weight, rather than heavy because I like to use these as spreads in summer and spring. I like the little diamond pattern and love the perfect hemming on all four sides. Another big plus is that it has no loose threads or flaws that I can see.I notice that when I've been to ER at Kaiser, they use cotton sheets, very light-weight but comfortable. I get the same comfort from this fine Eddie Bauer blanket. I do not feel smothered as I do with other materials such as flannel or polyester weaves.I am very happy to have this blanket in exchange for an honest review.

"When I got these professional Kimberly Clark towels I was planning to use them like paper towels, but once I received them I saw what an injustice that would be to these fine, heavy-duty, more absorbent towels.I am saving these for tougher jobs... and I'm finding there are more of those tasks in our household than one would think.

Thus, we have used these professional towels to clean up paint spatters, paint brushes, spilled drinks, grease-spots on the driveway, etc. Those were previously clean-up jobs for old ""rags"" made from discarded clothing or bedding.  (Or for paper towels that are meant for lighter jobs, thus requiring too many for the  tougher work... not to mention  they tear too easily.)My favorite use of these towels is to clean little hand-prints off the sliding-glass door... in between visits from our regular window cleaner.I received a 100-count box of these sturdy, helpful towels in exchange for an honest review. I hope this review helps customers make up their minds. I know I will be buying more in the future because I want to keep a supply in the kitchen and in the garage.

"Every kid loves Thomas and yours will love this unique Holiday Train. I know my grandson loves it. It's so different from the usual flat-track. He squeals when it goes up and down like a roller coaster.This set has the cutest station and the colorful Christmas decor is perfect.I just received this yesterday and couldn't wait to set it up to show Devon... and play with it myself. It was easy to set up and is a lot of fun, believe me. To see Thomas's face on front of the engine is as much fun as opening a Christmas present.Talk about Christmas in July... Well, this is it...

"Now that we are getting older we no longer go to the trouble of preparing our meals outdoors the ""rough"" way. We wait for the kids to come over to deal with the bbq coals, the fire, cleaning the grill and all that ""hard"" stuff. :-)We admit we miss the ""tang"" of the grilled burgers at times, but our new George Foreman grill serves up some mighty tasty food... without the mess.As you must have surmised, I love this grill and wouldn't trade it for the world. The convenience of having it in my kitchen is priceless to me. So we have to tilt the pan a bit to clean the grill, and wish the grill were removable, but that's nothing compared to the previous fuss of working with our old-fashioned grill.Now don't take me wrong, I love getting outdoors for barbecues with the kids when they are here; wouldn't trade those memories. I am speaking only of convenience for when one reaches a ""certain"" age. :-)This grill with the ceramic grill plates and easy timer is adequate for our needs at this time in our lives. And it's quick and efficient.Like other reviewers, I felt the stand was a bit wobbly (too light for the heavy lid), so we removed the legs and now use it on a wrought iron table that fits very nicely at the end of our counter. If you decide to do this, be sure the table you use is fireproof...One more note: When cooking fish that can smell-up the house, it's nice to be able to take this outside for those special occasions.All in all, this grill is so perfect for our needs that I will not delete a star because of the ""leg problem.""I appreciate receiving this as a gift in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 27, 2015Author of ""Six-Pack of Blood"" (with Barbara Watkins)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16UITKM1JG9ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUXO#wasThisHelpful","R16UITKM1JG9ZH","A3MFU0GVZUVH3K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFU0GVZUVH3K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this backpack; perfect size for me. Not too large, not too small... But what I like best about it is that I can also use it for a purse, thus getting double use from it.It's very up-to-date with the popular nail-head design; not gaudy with too may nail-heads like some products I see.

"Burt's Bees does it again!  I'm very pleased with this product because it's convenient, easy to use and each sheet is larger than expected. This extra size makes it possible for me to not ony cleanse my face but my front and back neck areas also. Due to typing so much, my neck tends to get still and sore. You'd be surprised how refreshing these cleansing towelettes are.As for the exfoliating towelettes, they certainly do a good job getting the deeper grit that somehow develops on our skin. My skin feels better already and I've only used them two days. I feel CLEAN...So they take a little getting used to as you learn how to best remove just one at a time, but that is a minor inconvenience for a product that makes me feel so refreshed.Scents have never bothered me, but since my daughter visits often and has sensitive skin, I thoroughly appreciate that these are odor-free. This makes it possible for me to leave a package on the bathroom sink for all guests to use. How convenient and thoughtful is that? :-)Thanks, Burt's Bees for another helpful addition to my skin-care regimen.I received these free for an honest review, and I will definitely keep myself supplied with them.

I have the clapboard leaning on some books on my bookshelf and can now read it clearly.

"Not only is this little green lantern handy to have around, it's also light-weight and quite attractive.I mainly accepted the offer to receive this free in exchange for an honest review because I wanted to use it on our patio on pleasant evenings when we sit outside and enjoy the balmy evenings. It's much more cozy than electric lights. But I soon found my son borrowing it for camping outings. It seems he had misplaced his big, red lantern and was in a hurry, so I loaned it to him.I missed it, so was a bit grumpy when he returned it a month later. But all ended well because he ordered two for himself. :-)This Star-light is wonderful; I enjoy the smaller size and am surprised that it lights up an entire room and has three settings: for bright, for dim and a third one for blinking. I have ordered another one to keep in the car in case of a roadside emergency.This practical lantern has already come in handy during a power outage. I live in an area where we only have one or two outages a year, but as luck (bad luck) would have it, we had an outage in the past month since I've had this handy lantern. Must say that we appreciated having this around. We keep it in the den where we usually play games or read during outages. Yes, it sheds ample light... And it certainly beats the hand-held flashlights we used before. We still keep plenty of those around so we each have one in order to navigate from room to room when needed, but this lantern is our first choice for the main gathering room.As you can tell, I'm sold on this lantern, and recommend it highly.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, May 15, 2015Author of ""Six-Pack of Blood"" (co-author Barbara Watkins)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POQ3XVGROA94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPTKQ7M#wasThisHelpful","R3POQ3XVGROA94","A3MFU0GVZUVH3K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFU0GVZUVH3K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this sassy color. It's perfect for showing off on FaceBook. I love taking pictures of myself in big hats, flashy sunglasses, bangle bracelets and various shades of nail polish..I just received this special nail color yesterday and while it's not as bright orange as the catalog page depicts, it's a lovely shade of orange. I wasted no time applying it to one hand. That was yesterday and I still haven't gotten around to doing the other hand. Shame on me, but I'm not going anywhere...It was easy to apply and looks stunning to me. Some say it looks better against darker skin, but I'm very fair. Since my neighbor is darker, we tried it on her and agreed that it looks equally great on both of us. Thus concluding that this color will look good on women of all nationalities.. On her, it reminds me of tropical fruit; on me, it reminds me of Easter eggs... (Does that make sense?)I also took time to remove this polish from one finger with polish remover and am happy to report it was easily removed. That's another plus, IMO.Anyway, with this sassy color, Essie has made a new customer of me.Highly recommended to everyone but the most conservative women.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, May 15, 2015Author of ""The Search for Bobby McGee""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86YVLDMP0CFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJ6X35I#wasThisHelpful","R86YVLDMP0CFI","A3MFU0GVZUVH3K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFU0GVZUVH3K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read the words ""silk"" and Geoffrey Beene in the same sentence, I just had to order this product. I didn't even need to see it to know it was quality because Beene is world-renowned for fine design and quality. All his designs are hot commodities around the world.Out of curiosity about the price and to learn the color of the piping on these classic, luxurious pajamas, I visited the Amazon catalog page and was not surprised at the expensive price tag... but as my mother always said, ""You get what you pay for.""Since this is a free gift for an honest review, for once I didn't have to be concerned about price, which makes these pajamas even sweeter.My son loves them, saying they are the softest, most comfortable that he has ever worn. Like most young people, he likes to wear the pants with various t-shirts... but not the top. That works for me because I like to wear the top half of men's pajamas. Always have! The loose fit makes them even more comfy... and cute, IMO. (Makes me feel like Suzanne Sommers in ""Three's Company."" )  :-)My son and I are both delighted with these elegant pajamas.

"100% satisfied with this well-crafted and designed grab bar. I have had one in the master bath for about five years with no sign of weakening or corrosion, so am comfortable putting this one in the guest bathroom.The first one is installed in horizontal position because I always shower, rather than bathe. It works perfectly and I feel so secure at my advanced age.My son installed this new one in the guest bathroom in slanting position to allow for some guests bathing and some showering. That way it's comfortable and easy to grasp for anyone. In addition, we often have the grandkids overnight, and while we don't think of them as needing a grab bar, they certainly do. Kids tend to get excited and play around in tub, so it's an extra safe-guard in case they get rowdy and lose their balance.My son said it was easy to install and only took him about ten minutes. Wonderful!Needless to add, I love this product. It's another little way of making life comfortable and safer.Thanks to the trusted brand of Moen for supplying quality bath fixtures.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, May 14, 2015Author of ""The Search for Bobby McGee""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SS7A33NTSUX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGBQEEO#wasThisHelpful","R3SS7A33NTSUX5","A3MFU0GVZUVH3K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFU0GVZUVH3K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tired of the market flooded with vampire books, so had not read one in ages. But this one attracted me and quickly lured me into the lives of these likable, believable characters.I eagerly followed the complex Vampire-versus-Chasers plot, and quickly got involved in the blossoming romance between opposites who are sworn enemies.

"I prefer tea over coffee and start each of my days with a hot cup.

"This arrived today and I had to try it right away. My neck and shoulder have been aching due to heavy typing and craning my head to adjust to the monitor... not to mention old age. :-) After installing the batteries (which gratefully came with this product) and reading the very clear instructions, I placed the two pads an inch apart on my shoulder, then settled in with my Kindle reader while waiting through the fifteen-minute therapy session. (I can go as long as thirty minutes, but opted to start with fifteen). Thirty minutes three times daily is recommended, but I hope I don't need itt that often.Omron Electrotherapy Max Power Relief machine has three settings: patting, rubbing and kneading. After trying all three, I enjoyed the kneading, so stuck with that.I'm very pleased with the results. My aches and pains are all gone and it even seemed to loosen up my hip area. So that's the next place I will work on. My shoulder and neck feel much better and it's been over three hours since I tried this. I love it for giving me a bit more freedom.Since my friend has back pain, she is next in line... after I do my hip. :-)This is an amazing little product... and has various degrees of pulsation from which to use. You can test from moderate to severe and I chose #13 because it was the setting that felt best to me. It's great to have the choice.I realize this is temporary relief, but I'll take what I can get.Thanks, Omron, for developing this easy-to-use, helpful product.Highly recommended.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, May 12, 2015Author of ""Six-Pack of Fear"" (co-author Barbara Watkins)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WOVCRPIBCMA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVPNZXU#wasThisHelpful","R2WOVCRPIBCMA2","A3MFU0GVZUVH3K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MFU0GVZUVH3K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cool, creative product that my whole family is having a lot of fun with.I, myself, am gray now and realize gray is harder to color, but playing with it is like enjoying a second childhood. :-) But my simple pleasure is only part of the reason I like this. I love coloring the grandkids's hair when they come visit. They love it so much that I am going to get them sets for their birthdays. If it gets too messy for their mothers, it is easy to clean up.My daughter reported that the girls even talked their father into letting them paint his bushy brows purple and give him orange sideburns. They took a photo of him... It's so cute, they want to post it on Facebook but don't want to upset him.Outside the fun factor of this, it's rather attractive on the younger girls, making great photo opportunities. Even boys who like Mohawks and such are using this product, I hear. It certainly beats dyed hair that goes through shabby stages as it grows out.Hair Chalk simply washes out with no hassle. The only thing I don't like is that it's not quite as easy to use as claimed. It takes a number of hard swipes to make it hold, even with damp hair... which turns out to be the easiest way to use it.I have no complaints against the packing; it was nicely wrapped with a very attractive cover that includes all details for proper use of these clever chalks. And I love the wide array of bright colors.For fun and a change of looks, I highly recommend hair chalk.

"Caught this on sale and am happy with it for what I paid.  I use it for my dress shoes, running shoes, sneakers, and some folded undershirts.  It holds more weight than I'd expected it to.  It attaches with a very strong Velcro flap so you don't have to take the closet rod down.. which is awesome.  One of my only complaints is the zipper, sub par at best and it gets caught.  The opening flap doesn't open very easily making it a pain to get my shoes out some mornings.Being that it's strong, you can probably get away with severely overloading this closet organizer.

"I read other reviews about it being a disaster trying to set this alarm clock.  I figured, ""What dummy can't figure out an alarm clock in 2015!""....SO.. it took this dummy about 30 minutes to get anywhere with this clock.  Even then, setting the alarm had me baffled.  I thought I was getting somewhere when it showed that the alarm was set, the correct time, and dimmed properly.  At this point I was excited about how awesomely the auto dimming feature worked.  Fast-forward....After a week of not being able to turn the alarm off, I've given up.  When it goes off, I hit multiple buttons that are placed poorly on the back that change settings and time while trying to make it shut up.  The alarm doesn't get very loud either.  I'm not THAT sound of a sleeper, but a short beeping at a 6/10 is about as loud as it gets.  Then lets discuss the awesome deal that includes the power cord.  Yes, you pay more for your clock to have a power cord... your electronic clock... power cord... pay more...what...the.......Anyway, this cord... that's about the length of my arm.  It forced me to resort to batteries (awesome battery life by the way) unless I wanted to keep my clock far away and at an angle.  Far away I can deal with.  However, if you are at virtually ANY angle and not staring head on... the screen appears solid white.Finally, the auto dimming feature.. yesss... let's compliment this piece of electronics.  This is something they nailed!  It dims to a comfortable setting based on surrounding light.  It's so nice, in fact, that I keep the clock on my night stand and use my phone as the alarm.  I've had it for months and not lost/gained time.. still running on the same batteries.. still functioning well as a clock.  For this reason it bumped from a 1 to a 2 star review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI9CT69CA3W7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHELTB0#wasThisHelpful","RI9CT69CA3W7R","A26JK2M10K48TM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26JK2M10K48TM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a simple, genius invention.  I work in the field and use it at least 15 times per work day, often for 30 minutes or more.  I keep it on the passenger floorboard and pull it out each time I use it.  While it would be awesome if it somehow folded flat after each use, I have no complaints.  The hooks concerned me at first and I felt that they were flimsy.. but they have held up well.  Most of the time I am using my tablet but it holds my laptop just as well.

"As far as compression goes, these shirts are great!  I can use them for running or mountain biking and stay cool/dry.  As far as the ever so common comparison to UA.. they aren't there in quality.  UA compression shirts are much more comfortable to me, lighter material, and dry a bit faster.  Then again, these are roughly 40% cheaper than the UA compression shirts I own.  I have a handful of white that I use as undershirts for work every day in the summer.  These Champion shirts seem to run short and I have a heck of a time keeping them tucked in.  The cut also seems awkward.. like it naturally rides up in the chest.  It's snug around the neck and bunches up constantly.Good shirts for the price, but they certainly aren't UA quality.

"I'm that guy who is terrified of impulse purchases, for this exact reason.  I purchased it using my amazon app without bothering with reviews, solely because I saw it in the Verizon store and figured it'd be a quality product.PROS.  It seems to be shockproof, and the phone fits in the case like a glove.  I've dropped it multiple times while out in the warehouse and it has been flawless as far as protection goes..  I never performed a waterproof test, but I've used it in the rain and for mountain biking / hiking... solid in that department..  The built in screen protector is pretty awesome, and serves it's purpose.  The edge of the case around the front provides great screen protection on face down drops or while setting it down roughly..  The earphone jack extension cord is convenient, and also prevents any water or dust from entering the case while listening to tunes..  The buttons feel great.  They are firm and you can feel the 'click' of the buttons without having to mash them.CONS.  Can't hear squat.  I've tried everything, and it's a pain to hear anybody while not on speaker phone..  Others cannot hear squat.  I have to open the charging port door for anybody to hear me without yelling.. thus defeating the purpose of a sealed case..  The earphone jack plug seals well, but ripped off after a couple weeks of use. It needs to be a much stronger material..  The case is bulky, and it is fairly uncomfortable while in my pocket.. so i'm stuck lugging it around in my hand or on my hip..  The fingerprint reader is virtually useless.  Since I've had the case, it hasn't read a fingerprint once.. not even enough to set it up..  The rubber insulator piece inside the charging port door can easily fall off and be lost..  The significant lip around the front of the case can make it hard touching the edges of the screen..  As I should have expected, playing music and using speakerphone can be a disaster and sounds very muffled or tinny,.  Lack of grip while holding it.. especially when wet or damp.  It also slides around if you set it down while driving.  (don't judge my driving!)Overall, the case performs if you want to protect it in a work environment.  If you want to use all of your features, look elsewhere.  I wish i'd looked at the reviews before dumping such a large amount of money on a phone case... shame on me I suppose.  Also, if your case breaks like mine did good luck with customer service.

"I had pretty high hopes for this, but was sadly let down when they frayed and shredded while trying to run them through the cassette.  They are also a bit overpriced for what they are, but I suppose people are used to paying for the name (that'll strike a chord with some i'm sure).  The one thing that these ARE great for is threading them through your rear derailleur gear and cleaning the springs or brake calipers.  They have a nice little shoe string end on each side making this process a piece of cake.  If you have a lot of grime or old grease in your cassette you will have to scrub it well with a brush first, otherwise the strings will be caked with grease and deemed useless after one pass.Ultimately you can create your own using a pack of microfiber cloths from the local auto parts store for a fraction of the cost.  It comes down to how often you clean your ride.  I spend a lot of time on messy trails and am pretty anal about cleaning/maintenance, so I'll tear through these pretty quick.  Not a bad product really, just not for me or those with filthy cassettes and chain rings.

I use this on my 26"" XC wheels and it fixed the problems I had with the stock plastic-like crappy rim tape.  This is a perfect fit for just about any MTB wheels.. wide enough to cover spoke holes with plenty to spare in width.  The adhesive on the tape holds it in place flawlessly, but can be removed easily without leaving sticky slimy melted residue from riding in hot weather.The hole is sized for a presta valve.

"Overall pretty good pump.  It's heavier and pumps slower than my Serfas TCPG Bicycle Floor Pump, but has an awesomely long hose that was the key selling point for me.  I'll keep this one in the shop and more than likely get another TCPG for in my truck.  The Joe Blow Race feels quite solid and has a nice wide base for those putting air in their tires after your cycling shoes are on.  The head mounts fine on both schrader and presta (can take a little fiddling sometimes) valves... and the pressure relief button is pretty cool feature.  Like I mentioned, the 4 foot hose was the key selling point for me and a sweet convenience.

But if I could do it all over again I'd just replace the hose with a longer one on my Serfas pump and save a bunch of money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TEGIOTYZUC8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3TD6Q6#wasThisHelpful","R2TEGIOTYZUC8H","A26JK2M10K48TM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26JK2M10K48TM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the best investments you can make with your MTB.  The lock-out comes in handy for those who get into some XC riding with many climbs, and the remote poploc is nice.  While I have an appreciation for the poploc system, the plastic is really flimsy and can be broken easily.  If you ride a lot in the winter like I do, be careful with it in cold weather.  As far as the fork goes, I have about 700 miles on it and it has performed flawlessly.  It's forgiving for those that push the limits like me (bless that blowoff while locked), and can be fine tuned for anybody whether you be a clyde or weight weenie.

"This is a pretty solid investment.  My bathroom sink didn't have a drain cover and I almost lost my wedding band down the drain multiple times.  I should have probably went with the smaller option, but I figured that this would come in handy later in life if I ever needed a drain cover for a tub.  It fits well even in the bathroom sink, even though the edge is close to the back side of the sink... if that makes sense.  The water drains quickly and it works well.

"These are exactly as advertised.  They are heavier than a jersey cotton, but slightly thinner than standard sweatpants.  The material has a bit of a course/stiff feeling to it as well, which makes it feel sturdy and strong.  The gray color is nice and doesn't stand out, which many people may enjoy while working out.  The stripes are also a little more subtle than other brands that use tacky colors.  The drawstring will pull through, so make sure you tie them off asap.  They're nice for everything from long road trips to playing ball in the fall or spring.  They don't necessarily breathe very well, so make sure you pack some athletic shorts if you tend to overheat easily.They fit in the waist and rear exactly as I had anticipated.  However, they were forever long.  So I ran them through the wash and dried the heck out of them in the drier.  It successfully knocked the length down to where they belong.

"These shorts are incredibly lightweight.  I could imagine they'd be very comfortable to play ball in during the hottest months.  Be aware that with the lightweight material comes a certain level of transparency.

Strap up and avoid the personal foul.  That said, they seem to run large.  I could have pulled mine half to my nips and they still would have been at my knees.

"This is a solid shoe bag, and serves it's intended purpose well.  I've used it to haul my gym shoes back and forth here and there without a problem.  My 10.5's fit in there snug width wise, but I have room to cram a pair of light shorts and tee-shirt on top.  I'm notorious for using items for everything but their intended purpose, so of course it's been everything from a carry-on bag for air travel to a storage sack mounted to my road bike for a quick ride to the store.  It does vent well with plenty of mesh, as long as you only have a pair of shoes in there allowing room to breathe.  The handle is VERY strong (I abuse my gear).  Best of all it cleans up well, so the possibilities are endless for this shoe bag.  The only downfall is that the zipper snags.  I had a heck of a time smoothly opening and closing the bag for the first several uses.. then it eased up.. and went back to being a pain in the butt.

"U.S. Polo should be embarrassed to have their name on this product.  I've used them for about 4 months and they are shot.  The seams pulled, the corners tore, the cotton feels like a cheap big box store tee-shirt, they are incredibly thin and see through, they're hot to lay on during warm nights, and they don't stay in place.

"These were almost the greatest pair of suspenders I've ever used for hiking... ALMOST.  There is this one major flaw.  The straps seem to work their way to my armpit area and it feels like they're cutting me into pieces.  In the winter this is tolerable because I hike with multiple base layers below the straps, but in the summer when there is minimal to no padding it's miserable.  If Perry were to put a very basic connecting piece to keep the straps in a comfortable position these suspenders would be incredible.As far as performance goes they do just fine.  While hiking or doing bushcraft things, I keep a fairly heavy ESSE in a leather case on my belt along with a sidearm.  The suspenders keep everything in place whether I'm hiking, kneeling, trailblazing, or rock scrambling.  I also am impressed by the fact that the plastic clips are TSA approved and don't slide off the belt while getting in and out of vehicles.  In fact, they seem to always stay in place.Great product if they'd fix the one major flaw.

Second shelf has my computer tower sitting sideways with a speaker on each side... and a PS3 on top of it.  Next two shelves have PS3 games and my not so extensive Stephen King collection.  Bottom shelf gives me a place for random items and a bin with electronics cables / adapters.I exceed the weight limit for this stand on the top two shelves alone, but it doesn't phase it.  The glass used in the shelf shows no sign of stress and is rather excellent quality.  In fact, everything about this tower is high quality!  I have two minor inconveniences and neither are very significant.  First, the studs that screw into the side beams and hold the shelf up.. they are smooth and can be a bear to get a grip on during assembly.  Secondly, the shelves aren't adjustable.  I assume they are assigned certain positions to maintain the structural strength of the tower overall, sooo deal with it.Yeah yeah, I know i'm not using it for it's intended purpose.

Look for 5 gallon bags or larger if you own a 4 gallon trash can, as you need extra to fold over the top of the can.

"The finish is actually quite attractive for being such an inexpensive particle board table.  It's painfully easy to put together... four bolts that come with the washers already on each one (allen wrench included).. and four screws for the bottom shelf.Three of the four bolts which hold the legs on went in smoothly, but one split the wooden brace that the leg screws into.  Not that big of a deal, and it seemed to hold up well even though the leg was only snugged down with one turn.  Onto the bottom shelf.. which is an absolutely ridiculous design.  You must pull the legs inward as you screw directly into the bottom of the shelf.  While you pull in, you must hold the shelf up and push against yourself.  In my case the shelf slipped from my hand while holding it up and screwing, and two of the four corners are now busted off.  With that rage ensued, the screws went flying, and I went after some wood glue.  I magic markered the exposed broken particle board so it would blend in and glued the shelf into place instead of screwing it in.. then let it set to dry.Long story short, the design of the bottom shelf is pathetic.  Had it mounted from the top it would have had better structural integrity and been a cinch to install while being worthy of a 4/5 star review.

"I've used the Cuban Crafters Stainless Perfecto Cutter for years, and decided to grab this as a spare for in the truck.  This cutter is solid and serves the purpose well, but I tend to smoke a variety of cigars.. including the occasional torpedo,  This means that the cutter will take two or three swipes and leave a bit of a mess.  The CC cuter has a hole in the backing that allows a torpedo to slide through a bit, then holds the clipping until I get out of the truck later.  The blades on this COHIBA are quite sharp, make a nice clean cut, and are high quality surgical stainless.  This cutter only cuts up to a 50 ring, but the CC cuts up to a 54... luckily I rarely enjoy large ring smokes.  The blades are set at a nice depth from the backing and it does provide a perfect cut most of the time.Over all this is a great cutter.  After all, how can you go wrong for only ten bucks or so.  In my personal opinion the Cuban Crafters is a much better option, but i'm satisfied with the Cohiba.  If you don't bother with torpedos and stick to 50 or smaller ring gauge.. this a solid selection!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVNZK7I6OYVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WHY1QK#wasThisHelpful","RDVNZK7I6OYVQ","A26JK2M10K48TM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26JK2M10K48TM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The color doesn't seem to fade over time, they don't really shrink much at all in the wash, and the thread quality is right on point.  They look like brand new after a month of wear and tear, which is promising.  Hopefully these last as long as the other jeans I own which cost nearly double that of these.

"I have a lot of Bluecell battery cases and use them for everything (backpacking, hunting, hiking, BOB, EDC, drawer organization).  The quality is right on point... sturdy plastic, strong snap closure, ect.  My beef is that the ridges cannot come up enough to hold CR123A batteries securely, otherwise it would intrude into the space needed for the 18650 batteries to fit comfortably.  They should market these as 18650 cases, and market a modified model to hold CR123A batteries tighter... but I suppose with that the cost would go up.  The colors are convenient so that you can easily tell which ones are used and new without confusion, or tell which ones you need at a quick glance.Don't get me wrong, these WILL hold CR123A batteries, four of them per box.  If you want to store them in a drawer or somewhere where they will lay undisturbed, these cases will be fine.  I wanted to throw them in my EDC for my flashlight, but they are just sloppy enough of a fit to bounce around and bang against each other in the case.HOWEVER, i've found a way to make them work.  The Bluecell hook and loop strap that comes with the battery case to hold it shut or keep them together can be folded and closed inside with the batteries (I uploaded a terrible photo).  This holds them perfectly in place!

"The coconut flavor of this tea is delicious!  It isn't overpowering, and doesn't taste like that sweet fake coconut flavoring... more like real fresh coconut.  When you open the pouch and take a whiff, it practically takes you to an immediate state of euphoria.  However, it isn't near as strong as it smells.  The coconut flavor is there, not quite as strong as I'd like, and the tea itself is rather weak.If you aren't into strong teas and prefer a mild coconut flavor, this certainly is for you.  I'll move on to another when I finish this and see if I can find something a bit stronger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RND07NLY8V5T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FCZM20#wasThisHelpful","RND07NLY8V5T7","A26JK2M10K48TM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26JK2M10K48TM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The zipper on this pouch needs to lead further down the sides.  It is a bit of a pain getting in there and reaching items in the bottom of the pouch because it only pulls open slightly.  There is a surprising amount of room in the pouch, and if you organize it well you can fit an impressive amount of stuff without significantly expanding it's profile.  The MOLLE loops would be better if the two on the edges were full width, that way it could be secured to the pack at wider points (Maxpedition Tac Ties will not fit the two outter loops).  This would make it less floppy and hold a tighter profile to the pack.Here is the major issue with this pouch.  The zipper has a material flap to protect it and keep dust/dirt out.  This flap snags EVERY time, and becomes incredibly frustrating.  I've seen where others took a knife and cut the flaps away, but this pouch if far to expensive to butcher right off the bat.  Hopefully it softens up over time, as most Maxpedition products do, and it won't be that bad.  I have quite a few Maxpedition items, and this is the first I've seen this zipper design.  Hopefully it is the last..","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUEW9SG0ACEPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037BBBM0#wasThisHelpful","RUEW9SG0ACEPA","A26JK2M10K48TM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26JK2M10K48TM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this little light, but have never used it on a key chain.  It hangs from a loop inside my EDC backpack, so I can just twist it quickly and have light inside.  It twists very easily, and though it hasn't happened yet, I fear that I will accidentally twist it the wrong direction and it will come apart.  Not the end of the world, but I wish there were some sort of safety to prevent twisting to the point of battery removal.  Then again, you have to twist pretty far before it gets to that point.  The key chain clip seems pretty secure, so I'm sure it would handle the every day abuse of being on a keyring.

"My Acer desktop stopped working after a power outage/surge.  I suspected the power supply was damaged so I looked online for something affordable and maybe slightly more powerful as a replacement.  I ended up ordering this and was a little worried about replacing it as I have never had done this before.  It was super easy.  The power supply fit perfectly in the old space.  The cables are nicely protected and long enough for even the longest distances.  The screws in the back of my case didn't match the power supply, but I managed to get one in tight enough to hold the power supply in place.  I read that some people said this power supply is loud.  Maybe my old original power supply was extraordinarily loud, but this new one is quieter than the one I had.  I hear no noise coming from it at all.  It is nearly silent and a big improvement from the original.  I can't comment on longevity as I have only owned this a few weeks.

"I wasn't sure if this was the right choice when I bought it.  I assumed the color display was one of those fancy gimmicks and the weather station wouldn't be very good as a whole.  But it was on sale and I gave it a shot.  I have had it for about a month now and I am really impressed.Readability is excellent.  Much better than the black and white LCD displays from prior stations.  You can see the temperature in and out across the whole room.  You can have the display on low or high brightness, or you can have it adjust itself.  I use this function and it basically turns to low brightness at night and back to high during the day.  Works quite well most of e time.I entered the pressure manually via the local airport pressure online, and it it has matched it ever since.  It finished learning and the forecast seems pretty accurate so far.My absolute favorite function is the fact that you can calibrate the in/out temperature and humidity individually.  I have never owned a weather station which can do this.  The in and outside temperature were off by a degree so I matched them to what my thermostat and other thermometers displayed which were all in the ballpark.  If you do this, allow the base station to be turned on for an hour or so, it seems it warms up once it is plugged in (I assume the electronics or display inside get a little warm) so allow it to settle before you calibrate it.  Originally I didn't bother using batteries but sure enough, the second night I had the station the power went out for a moment and it lost all calibration changes and the air pressure I entered.  I brought the sensor back inside for the day and re calibrated it all and then I added some batteries for back up.  No issues after that.I do wish the time display was bigger, and really, the only function I wish it had would be the ability to receive the atomic clock signal.  Then this weather station would be absolutely perfect.At this point I'm giving this five stars.  If it goes on sale again I will buy another for my father.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K1ATYS99220A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLDQFPY#wasThisHelpful","R3K1ATYS99220A","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this dish brush somewhere else.  Have had it for a few weeks.  I have to say, this is the worse dish brush I have ever come across.First, the few self dispensing brushes I have used always applied the soap to its own bristles so that the brush itself stayed soapy - makes sense.  This brush just squirts the stuff straight out onto whatever dish you may just be holding it over, or into the sink or the water, depending how you are aiming it.  I guess it works, but I prefer it the other way.  Also, even if you apply the same pressure in one push, sometimes you get a huge amount of soap, sometimes hardly any.Second, I'm not sure who designed this thing.  Sure, it works well for plates and silverware, but try washing a cup or glass with it.  Or a smaller pot.  There are no bristles at the front, so you don't really get the base of a cup or glass.  Same with a smaller pot.  On top of that, if you have a nice Teflon pot, you scratch it with the plastic border at the front of the brush.  The fact that this brush gets very thick quickly due to the reservoir also prohibits you from cleaning thinner glasses and cups.I'm going back to the cheaper regular dish brushes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N9BHPHUWHHP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CC91GK#wasThisHelpful","R1N9BHPHUWHHP4","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my Galaxy S3 for which I have a Laza extended battery which has a capacity of 4200mah.  I charged the charger all the way and then attached it to my phone which was down to 9% of battery power.  The charger filled my phone up to 86% in about three hours and then stopped and was completely empty - even the flashlight didn't work at that point.Unscientifically, this means it charged my phone around 77%.  That roughly means it charged my phone with 3200mah.  Seeing this is the first time I ever used the charger, I hope that performance will increase a little bit as the charger gets cycled a few more times.  For now I will give it four stars, as it is short 1200mah of what was quoted.  If this number goes up a bit over time, I will update my review and increase the number of stars.I'm actually ok with what this charger delivers.  This will extend my phone by a whole day with medium use.  I don't need much more and am willing to accept that it can't charge my battery all the way seeing that it is very light and compact as a trade off.  Anyone with a regular phone battery should see this charger top their phone off all the way with no problems at all.The light switch is very easy to operate and I can see this being a problem when in a bag or suitcase.  My solution is to take a penny and scotch tape it over the switch.  That will keep it from being turned on accidentally.Edit:A month later I did a identical test.  I waited until my phone was at 9% again.  Then charged it with this charger which I had topped off the day before.  It charged it to 88% this time in just under three hours.  No significant change there.  I guess 3200mah is what this charger will deliver.  It's still ok with me.  That's more than a day of power for me with the S3.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W1EUDLGFNIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DHLJEAG#wasThisHelpful","R35W1EUDLGFNIH","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The case fits very well too.  Of course the SIII is thicker and heavier now but I actually like that, it is easier to hold. I would highly recommend this.I have had a Laza extended battery for a HTC phone before, and it lasted two years with hardly any loss in capacity.

Actually, I think it is the best Keurig coffee I have had so far.  I usually get the San Francisco Bay coffee's.  They taste very good and are quite cheap making them a great every day coffee.  The Melitta coffee is too expensive for every day use, but if you want to treat yourself every now and then, it's a great choice.As for the taste, I like a stronger fuller coffee.  Most Keurig coffee pods are very weak, with very little body.  The San Francisco Bay cups have much more body and flavor than the average Keurig cups.

"I have been thinking about an adapter like this for years but was always turned off by many negative reviews.  Finally decided to try one and I'm glad I did.  Main reason really is that I am tired of paying the horrendous prices for CF cards when cards of similar capacity cost a fraction in the SD and MicroSD format.I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and sometimes a 7D.  I have tried several SD and SDHC cards of different capacities with it.  Works great with all of them.  Recently I got a great deal on a 32GB MicroSD card.  So I gave that a shot, put the MicroSD card in a SD adapter and plugged all that into this adapter.  Works like a charm.  I do have to add that I am not a high speed shooter, so I can't vouch for how well all these setups work when shooting high speed consecutively.I also have two different older 4GB Eye-Fi cards.  This adapter works with both of them.  I get about 8 feet distance with them before they stop uploading to my iPad 2.  I did not take the metal sides off like some suggest.  May try that someday.  But I didn't have to update any firmware either to get them to work.  My older Eye-Fi cards won't transmit RAW files, so to fix that, I shoot RAW plus small JPG, then the JPG gets sent to the iPad for immediate evaluation, and the RAW is stored on the card.  Have not really had enough time to use this setup for longer shoots, I will update if I run into heat or other problems.I uploaded a few pictures of the card in my 5DII and with the MicoSD card.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z7I8WZHR7WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0048W4RV4#wasThisHelpful","R10Z7I8WZHR7WG","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had to clean the gutters today, so I got my collapsible Werner ladder out.  I noticed that the locks on the ladder were really hard to pull out.

I had already bought a new one because the old one had become stiff.  You had to press really hard to get it going, and sort of had to pull on the trigger lever to shut it off again.  I applied some of this stuff, exercised it a little, and now it works like new again.It's not going to come as a surprise that I tell you I recommend this grease.

"I was a little worried, seeing all the reviews from the other manufacturer of the same looking box.  But figured I'd give it a try.I'm glad I did.  It works perfectly.  Plugged it in, red light comes on, paired it with the phone and password ""1234"" and the Torque app on my Android phone started communicating with it immediately.  It blinks a lot of lights when it's communicating.  Although, I don't really see them as in my car the adapter is turned with the lights toward the door when it's closed.  No big deal, it's probably better that way, no crazy blinking lights at night.  The adapter does become a little warm after use, but not hot.I have not decided yet if I should leave it plugged in when I don't drive.  The adapter stays on with one red light lit (obviously the OBDII port is active when the car is turned off for fault analysis etc...) but I'm not sure how much power the adapter is pulling when idle and I don't want to have a dead battery when I get in the car one morning.  If anyone has any insight to that, please do leave a comment.I also have a HP Touchpad with Android on it, and Torque is even more fun when using that since it's a much bigger display and you can have more gauges on one screen.  So if you have a Android tablet, give it a try.I was kind of disappointed that my 2012 Honda only displays about half the data which this adapter is able to show, but hey, it's still fun, and the one item I really wanted to see was MPG, and I got that.I also used it on another car which had the check engine light on.  It read the codes out perfectly, and I like the feature in Torque that if you have internet access you can get more detailed info on the codes.For the price of under $30 including the app, you really can't beat this combo, I highly recommend it.  Much cheaper than ScanGauge or similar items.I added a few pictures of the Scan Tool in my car with the Touchpad and Torque.Edit:I couldn't resist, I had to add a on/off switch to this adapter.  See the pictures I uploaded for details.  Doesn't take very long if you know how to solder.  Works like a charm now and I don't have to worry about it draining my battery.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYUOEIRC6VIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NLQAHS#wasThisHelpful","R2AYUOEIRC6VIL","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Received these a few days ago.  Very happy with them.  I was deciding between these and the Weathertech version.  Decided to save some money and went with the Husky's.  I'm glad I did.  These fit absolutely perfect, didn't have to cut or squeeze or push anything.  They have absolutely no odor which was a pleasant surprise.  The color isn't a perfect match to the interior tan color of the Accord, but it's close enough, it doesn't bother me one bit.  I thought the plastic would be more slippery, but my shoes really don't slide around much on them.  I'm sure the carpet has more friction, but you can't have everything I guess.  I have two friends who have Weathertech's in their cars.  They were both curious and inspected these closely and both said that they seem equal in quality to theirs.Of course the true test will be this winter.  I will update this review in the spring.  Hopefully they are as durable as they look.  I also added a few photos to the product images, maybe that will help someone picture how they look in their cars.Update:I have had these for a few years now.  They have held up nicely.  I take them out every spring and clean them thoroughly.  Yes, they are starting to look a little used.  There are some scratches on them, and some dark marks from shoes.  But the carpet has stayed dry and when you pull these out it looks like new.  I am glad I bought them and still highly recommend them.  Originally I thought I would remove them during the summer and put the original mats back in, but I decided to keep them in the car all year round now.

This one has done just that so far.I like that it plugs in, one less battery I have to worry about.  The base unit is hidden behind some shelves, and it's still loud enough to be heard throughout the house and send the cats running for cover.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUNCL9IV5VCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018QI2DW#wasThisHelpful","R3VUNCL9IV5VCS","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this the other day.  I desperately needed some more USB ports for all the gadgets which are accumulating around my computer these days.This mini hub seemed to fit the bill, cheap, good reviews, I gave it a shot.  In general I have to say it works quite well.  Windows 7 64bit recognized it right away.  Basic items such as jump drives which were plugged into the hub also worked as soon as the driver was installed.  So no problems there.Then I ran into a small glitch.  I play flight simulator and have a throttle and joystick attached to my computer.  Both are plugged directly into the computer USB ports, not into the hub.  But when the mini hub is plugged in, the throttle jumps around and is pretty much useless.  Not sure what the interaction is on the USB bus ports from a plugged in hub to a device plugged directly into the computer, but apparently it creates issues.  When I unplug it, it's fine.  I'm going to look into this issue, maybe there is some combination I can come up with which resolves this problem.One other minor complaint, the orange LED light which lights up when the mini hub is plugged in is really bright.  In a dark room, it is like a night light.  Probably wasn't necessary to make it that bright.All in all, it functions well, I'm hoping to fix this problem with my joystick, otherwise I will have to find another USB hub which I can leave permanently attached.  For now four stars...Update:Couldn't get rid of the problem.  So I'm not using it much.  It's a shame, but for most people this probably won't be an issue.  For my use, I will have to downgrade it to three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q103KFW1FLWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M0NURK#wasThisHelpful","R3Q103KFW1FLWJ","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few metal European four color pens which are nice, but not perfect.  So I decided to try this one.  I was pleasantly surprised, the mechanism for sliding the different colors in and out works very smooth.  I hardly ever used the green color of my older pens, so I won't miss it in this one.One thing I was surprised over was that this pen is pretty thick.  Thicker than the four color pens I have.  That doesn't make a lot of sense and I do wish it was a little thinner.  However, it still fits in my shirt pocket, so it's ok.This pen writes very nice.  Much better than the four color pens I have.  It writes thin and the ink runs smooth and bold, no typical lighter areas which you get on cheap ball point pens.The one thing which irks me the most is that I didn't receive the white version.  I really wanted the pocket clip to be transparent so that the pen would be less visible.  I'm not going to subtract that from the pen, because it's the sellers fault to have the wrong picture on the product page.  If you are looking for the white version, be sure to ask the seller or verify the model numbers I suppose.  I did post a picture of the black pen I received.Edit: Seems like they finally put the correct product picture on the items page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H1D46QUYJQ6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KIEGPM#wasThisHelpful","R1H1D46QUYJQ6H","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this.  My situation is that I am away from home randomly for a few days at a time.  So I wanted a feeder that I could turn on when I leave, and off when I am back.  I prefer feeding the cats myself when I am home, more accurate portion sizing and also wet food at times.  Either way, once you turn the unit off, it loses all information.  Time, feeding times and portion size.  I am by no means a newbie to technology and can program even a radio scanner from Radio Shack (that means something if you know what I am talking about), but this feeder is pretty tough to program.  So this is my point - every time I turn this feeder back on, I have to reprogram the time, the feeding schedule and the portion size.  I guess if I do this often enough, I will learn the programming steps, but it's a huge hassle.  I realize that I can program it to run for only so many days, but I sometimes don't make it home on the day I hope to, but the next day etc...I guess if you use this feeder 24/7, it does the job, but for someone who is in and out and wants to turn the unit off frequently, it's really not the perfect machine.Also, when I received it, one of the flaps on the bottom which are spring activated didn't seem to want to move.  I discovered it had some extra plastic from the manufacturing process and was sticking.  Had to use a knife to trim it down to the correct size.  Now it works fine.Update:I have had this feeder for about 4 months now.  I just changed the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I have to say, it really is a reliable feeder.  The batteries are still going strong, they are the original ones.  It has never failed to dispense food and even though I have never measured it scientifically, it seems to dispense more or less the same amount every time.  I do have to say that I usually keep it fairly full though.  I still hate the fact that I can't turn it off without reprogramming, if they were to fix that issue, this would be a wonderful machine.My concoction for feeding two cats is still holding up too, I did post a picture on this page of what that looks like.  I used two pieces of rain gutter downspout and a pedestal I made.  Both cats have lost some weight thanks to not having a never ending supply of dry food while I'm gone.Update:I made myself a little cheat sheet for the programming process, printed it out and stuck it on the fridge.  Maybe it will help someone.  I use two feeding times.  Also I use the default ""smallest"" feeding portion, so I don't have to change that:1) Turn feeder on.2) Within 90 seconds, set time:3) Press ""Clock"" to set hour / press ""Timer"" to set minute4) Press ""Set"" to confirm.5) Press ""Clock"" to toggle between 12/24 hours.6) Press ""Start"" to confirm clock settings.7) Display now shows ""1 07"" (first feeding at 0700)8) Press ""Set"" for two seconds until display flashes.9) Press ""Timer"" to set desired feeding time.10) Press ""Set"" to program second feeding time.11) Press ""Timer"" to set desired feeding time.12) Press ""Start"" to save and exit.[To change portion size:]14) Push VOL key to display portion size.15) Press and hold the SET key until the digit blinks.16) Press the VOL key to set the portion size. [ 1 = 1/4 cup, 2 = 1/2 cup etc... ]17) Press the START key to confirm.Another update:Had the feeder for 15 months now.  Still works perfectly.  I've gotten used to its few quirks and am very happy with it.  Yeah, still could use a better user interface, but hey...  The four D cell batteries are finally getting low.  They have been in the feeder for 15 months now and it has been on every day.  Not shabby.One more Update:Had the unit for nearly exactly two years now. Still working perfectly twice a day without a break.  Still on the second set of D cell batteries. I'm changing the rating to five stars.  I really can't complain.  Yeah, I still would love to be able to turn it off and not lose all the settings.  I also wish that you could control the dispensing amount a little more accurately, but that wouldn't be easy seeing the way this machine is built.  But for the money, you do get a good value.  Still recommended, a little more highly now.  We just took our two cats to the vet, our ""bigger"" cat went from 18 pounds to 12 pounds. The vet praised us telling us that most people don't manage to bring their cats back down to a healthy weight. We told her that the feeder did it...  Now we have to make a little extra manual feeding when we are home so they don't lose more weight. This is where a smaller incremental increase in portion size would come in handy. Going from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup is just too much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNI5ZZY171U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SBSNB0#wasThisHelpful","RKNI5ZZY171U","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for the perfect walk around lens for a long time.  I have gone through most of the kit lenses, from the original 18-55 which had horrible optics, the next generation which was slightly better, and then the 18-55 kit lens with IS which really is quite good.  I did buy a Canon 17-40L and was not impressed with the image quality and range on the crop cameras, so I returned it.  I rented the Canon 17-55 2.8 IS which was a good lens.  The 2.8 was nice, but the range wasn't that great and I didn't think the image quality on it was that amazing either.So I gave this lens a try, and it's certainly a keeper.  The range is great, 15mm really satisfies your wide angle needs.  85mm also does a decent job of zooming in when needed.  Image quality is nothing short of amazing.  I'm impressed every time I upload my images to the computer how good a lens with this zoom range can be.  Tack sharp, even in the corners.  Colors are nice.  Only thing I don't like about it is the vignetting.  The 7D does a decent job of correcting it in-camera, but it's still visible under certain conditions.  Nothing you can't fix post processing, but it would be nice if you didn't have to worry about it.Image stabilization works well, I can't attest to whether it does the 4 stops, but I can certainly hand hold some shots that I could normally not.Build quality is nice.  The lens is very well balanced, hefty enough to make it stable, light enough not to be a brick on your camera.  It does creep a little in the mid zoom range if you hold it up or down.  Doesn't bother me that much.I would highly recommend this lens, yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but hey, it's still worth the images you end up with in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4YD1CTA5DBUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NEGTTM#wasThisHelpful","R4YD1CTA5DBUS","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice bags, no doubt about it.  Well made and nice and plain.  Actually a tad small for shopping.  I'm giving it four stars because local stores are now selling very similar eco bags (granted, with their logos on them) for as little as one dollar per bag (Sears) which is a whole lot less than these.If you don't want a brand logo on your bags, these will do the job.

"I bought this book on a whim.  Oddly enough, I had just read Ender's Game online because it's supposed to be a great classic.  I have to admit it was.  It is very apparent that the author had also read Ender's game, as this seems to be a modern version of it.  The book is well written and the storyline is very captivating.  When I read a good book like that, I always expect a big ending, but this book didn't offer a big ending unfortunately.  It just sort of fizzled out.

"This was my first R/C plane.  My first flight actually went without a major crash.  Just a couple of hard landings in the grass which didn't break anything major.  Later on as I became better, I performed more daring stunts and it received some damage, but nothing that rendered it un-flyable. I find that repairing the Cub is kind of fun also, and as you take it apart and modify it you learn a lot about the plane itself.The replacement parts are also very affordable, so if you do actually destroy something, it can be replaced without too much financial pain.  Depending on how much you push the motor, you get to fly it about 10-15 minutes on one battery charge.I bought a Muvi Veho camera for it, and you can tell that the Cub struggles a little bit with the extra weight, but it still easily goes to altitude and takes fun airborne footage.I adjusted the elevator servo one notch so that it has more up travel than down.  This REALLY helps landing the Cub as you have more up elevator as you come in and during the rollout.I used the ACT crash protection once, and it stopped my prop on take off and the plane crashed, I never turned it on again...I think I have learned how to fly the Cub quite well now, being able to fly it inverted and buzz through the goal posts of the local (empty) soccer field.  I now want something that has more power for better climb performance and ailerons.  I'm looking at the T-28 Trojan form the same company.If you are thinking about getting into R/C airplanes, you really can't beat this Cub.  It takes a lot of abuse, is easy to fly and very affordable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28PCZ9LDHAXJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00283U1EC#wasThisHelpful","R28PCZ9LDHAXJM","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this about a year ago.  The unit has a lot of potential, but plenty of issues.First issue is that the remote control needs to be aimed DIRECTLY at the unit, or it will not work.  This can be very frustrating.The second most annoying feature is that you can not record something and watch something else at the same time.  That means that if my girlfriend has programmed the unit to record a certain show, I am forced to watch whatever she programmed in order to not interrupt her recording.This has some minor sub-issues.  If I am time shifting a live TV show, and a program is about to record, it will just start recording and stops the time shift without warning.  This drives me up the wall every time it happens.Another issue is that if the power fails, even for a second, the unit will lose the time setting and all timer programs disappear.  If you have let's say 10 shows programmed to record, it's really annoying to have to re-program them again every time there is bad weather.Changing channels also takes several seconds, which can be annoying.I never record anything on DVD, so I can't report on this feature.Besides these issues, the unit is great.  I use it with a roof antenna, and all the channels come in fantastic quality in HD.  When it does record shows, it works wonderful.I do wish there was more choice of DVR's out there.  I don't understand why there isn't.  For now, I don't see any better options out there than this unit","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R820A9EDJRLUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0020ZW8P8#wasThisHelpful","R820A9EDJRLUY","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Squeezebox on a bit of a whim because I was thoroughly tired of the local radio stations.  I also lived abroad for a long time, so the temptation to listen to my old ""home"" stations was big.  I was contemplating a HD radio, but that really would have just brought the local junk stations in clearer...All in all I am extremely happy with the Squeezebox.  I read some reviews here before I bought it, so I already opened a account with Logitech.  Start-up was easy, plug it in, find your wireless network, enter the password.  It did do a firmware update and then I was ready to play.The choices of stations are really overwhelming.  I didn't know what to listen to at first.  And this was only the ""Internet Radio"" option.I then added Pandora which was very simple.  Highly recommended.  Even more music choices and no commercials.I know there are even more things you can do with it, but right now I'm happy with the thousands of stations already available to me.I hooked the Squeezebox into my big stereo via a 3.5mm-RCA cable from the headphone jack in the Squeezebox to the AUX input in my stereo.  The sound from the Squeezebox alone is very nice, through the stereo it's amazing.I never tried the Alarm Clock functions of the Squeezebox, so I can't comment on those.The Squeezebox looks very nice.  No complaints there.  I also like the fact that the display dims and gets really dark when the room is dark, which I really like.  Most alarm clocks still light up the room at night, the Squeezebox does not.Reception around the house is great.  In my living room which is about 40 feet and two walls from the router, it reports full signal strength, better than my laptops.  Never had any reception problems.  Of course, it does take a little hit on the available internet bandwidth, but not enough to really notice or be bothersome.My biggest issue is that the Squeezebox only has 6 actual station memory buttons.  With the ability to have so many choices, they should have really tried to add some more buttons for simplicity.  It's not a deal killer though.  Also the whole search process (entering the letters via the wheel controller) can be tedious.  But again, I enjoy the new radio experience enough to overlook all that.If there was a Squeezebox II, I would like to see maybe a small pull out keyboard or a remote with a little keyboard.  That would be fantastic.But as for now, if you are contemplating getting a internet radio, you should really give this one a shot.  I am having way more fun with it than I thought I would.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGULR4OP3FZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LARRDK#wasThisHelpful","R2TGULR4OP3FZ0","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this flashlight on sale at a local store.  I am really impressed with it.  Despite the fact that it is smaller than my 2 AA LED Maglite, it is brighter.  It is nearly as bright as my 2 AA Inova Bolt flashlight.  Quite a performance.  The light it throws has a very strong center and then falls off quickly in contrast to the others which light up the area around it much more.It is odd that the description states that this light uses 3 AAA batteries.  There are other places on the internet which do the same.  Life Gear does have a 3 AAA light, but it looks different with a larger reflector and has the push button on the side, compared to this 1 AA one which has the switch on the back.If you need a compact but bright flashlight which doesn't cost a fortune, then this should fit the bill.

"I am a complete novice when it comes to underwater photography - not above water though...  So I had the G10 and was going to Belize on vacation for sun and fun and snorcheling.  I decided to buy this case as it actually seemed quite reasonable for what it offers. Let's get to it.I will list the cons first.* The plastic of the case is rather soft, so even though I only went on three snorcheling trips with it, I ended up with a ton of scratches on it, and I WAS trying to be very careful.* The plastic of the case - and across the display - is very glossy.  So when you are snorcheling close to the surface and the sun is shining, you can barely see anything on the display, it is just reflecting the brightness of the sea surface above you.  I assume this would not be as much of a problem if you are scuba diving and further down in the water.* Being spoiled from the ability to change just about any setting on this camera while it is in its case, it is a shame you can't manipulate the ring control in the back which changes aperture or shutter speed depending on which mode you are in.Neutral:* The flash works surprisingly well under water, however just for very short distances.  It is also very close to the lens so that if the water is not perfectly clear, it will light up every dirt molecule and render the picture worthless.* The case is surprisingly large.  Originally I thought this might be a nice combo for the beach or in general maybe in the rain - but the case is about the size of a Canon XTi with a 18-55mm lens on it and really too large to casually carry with you to the beach etc...  Also, at a beach in the sand I would be very worried again about scratching the plastic.* You should know your camera well because the labels on the buttons are just stamped into the clear plastic and you really can't decipher them under water.Positives:* Just about everything else.  The case is easy to use and all the buttons are accessible (except the ring as I mentioned).  The case is completely waterproof, I didn't have one hint of water inside it.  I did take it down to about 25 feet a few times.I really enjoyed taking my G10 under water.  It looks like I will keep my G10 for a long time since I don't think I will buy another underwater case anytime soon.  The G10/WP-DC28 combo will be my underwater kit for the extended future...I read a lot of reviews and tips and ended up buying a few silica gel packs from Ebay (very cheap) in order to keep possible fogging in the case to a minimum.  I never tried the case without the packs, so I don't know if fogging would have been a problem, but with a pack, I never saw any fogging.  I'm not a big fan of RAW with point and shoots, so I used JPG and the underwater setting of the G10.  This was a pretty good combo, and I didn't have to do a lot of color correcting in Photoshop.

"I bought this TV from Aldi's when it was on sale.  I was worried about the quality, but have to say that I am very happy with it.  I use it as my second TV in the bedroom.  The HD picture is beautiful.  However, to be picky, the backlight is not completely even and the blacks are not as black as most more expensive TV's these days. Then again, for the price I paid, I did not expect Sony or Samsung quality.  PS3 games also look gorgeous on this via HDMI.  The speakers are fairly weak, I had a leftover set of computer speakers which I plugged into this TV and it sounds great now.  If anyone has a region hack for this, I would appreciate it if you could post it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BRW2CDHL4F97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T8CJY8#wasThisHelpful","R1BRW2CDHL4F97","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this product directly from Lorex.  It was my first IP webcamera.Pros:I have to say that this camera is a LOT of fun.  I am away from home a lot and I can keep an eye on my place from anywhere in the world with this camera.  For this reason I love this little camera.The Web Interface is very nice.  A lot of options can be set including passwords for different types of users, framerates, motion sensitivity for sending email alerts etc...Cons:The image quality is quite low.  I can only get 320x200 out of it, I believe the info is a bit misleading since it says the server can support up to 640x480, but that's only the server box, not the camera.The lens is very poor, when I focus the camera, the left side of the image is focused on distance A, while the right side is focused on distance B.  You cannot get a evenly focused picture.The motion sensitivity is very basic.  I learned that on a camera which is exposed to any outside light, you need to be able to specify a area inside the picture which the camera observes.  Otherwise (like with this camera) you will receive a picture everytime a tree in the background moves in the wind, or a cloud moves in front of the sun.Also the video server box gets very hot, doesn't seem to be an issue, but it doesn't make me feel good leaving it unattended for a long time.Conclusion:Again, this is a great ""toy"".  If you just want to watch something when you are away and are not concerned about image quality, this may be a good solution for you.  I will keep using mine until it stops working.  I already have another camera, it's a wireless camera which is much more convenient since it doesn't have to be attached to my router via a cable.  If you want good image quality or flexible motion detection, I would not recommend this camera.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA6YWZ2AQMLD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007VJB2A#wasThisHelpful","RA6YWZ2AQMLD7","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got tired of the rabbit ears on my TV's.  I could only get fuzzy analog reception and only two digital channels.  I bought this DB2, clamped it to a tripod facing out the window in my attic.  Ran a quad shield RG6 cable into the basement into a RCA amplified splitter.  Now I get every HDTV channel in my area on three TV's in my house.  Went from about 6 analog to 25 digital channels, most in high definition.  I know the location made a huge difference since the rabbit ears were downstairs on the TV's, and the DB2 is in my attic, but either way, I am more than happy with this.  Only problem right now is channel 3 which only comes in fuzzy analog and 3.1 and 3.2 which don't come in at all, but when the changover occurs in February, they will move their frequency from VHF to UHF so I should be able to receive those too without a problem.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone trying to improve their signal strength, or get the bigger DB4 if you are further away from the transmitting towers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IL5HMLY5SCEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EHUE7I#wasThisHelpful","R3IL5HMLY5SCEM","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm surprised at the fairly low rating this antenna has gotten.  I have gone through a myriad of ""rabbit ears"" and this antenna is the best I have found so far.  I actually have two now for a TV in the living room and one in the bedroom.  What I like is that you don't need to re-tune every time you switch to a channel on a different band.  No, it doesn't come close to an outdoor antenna mounted high up, but it does pull in all my local channels.  Now that there are digital channels available, it also does quite good at pulling them in.  I would certainly recommend this antenna to someone who is looking for a indoor solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34L1L5H9Y5E04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ES8EG0#wasThisHelpful","R34L1L5H9Y5E04","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a ton of Casio watches, including three old alti-barometer watches.  When this series came out, I waited a while and then jumped on it.  It has everything one could want.  Well, it does everything it says it should, and very well.  However, after about one year of use, I'm running into problems.  I fly for a living, and this is the watch I take with me.  I usually go to Europe five times a month and I wear this watch, when I'm home in the US this watch sits by a window to charge up and receive the atomic clock.Well, the watch makes it to Europe, but on the return, it usually dies on me.  It goes from battery High indication to a dead screen with a flashing ""C"", meaning it went into power saver mode trying to recharge.  At this point it loses all information - time, date, altimeter settings etc...  The other day it started flashing an ""R"" and froze up.  Haven't found that in the manual yet.  But I'm giving up on it.  A watch is no good if it can't reliably show the time, and this one doesn't do that.My guess is that the rechargeable battery is dead.  The watch is out of warranty now, so I'm on my own with it.  I found a place online that sells these rechargeable batteries, I guess I could give that a try.  Still, disappointing, you would think a solar watch would work a whole lot longer than a regular battery.Edit:I bought a new rechargeable battery for nine dollars from a NY online store and changed it myself.  The watch works perfectly now and hasn't dipped below a ""High"" charge since and that has been about a year.  It has taken a lot of abuse in the last two years and still works great although the plastic on the sides is pretty scuffed.  I changed the rating to a five star rating now since it works as it should.  Still not pleased that Casio sent it out with a bad battery.  By the way, it does receive the German and British time signals perfectly.  Haven't tried the Japanese one yet.  It is a little annoying that the watch needs to be told that it is in a different country though, rather than scanning for a signal by itself.  I usually don't bother since the watch is accurate enough for a while without updating.  Like most Casio's, it runs fast a few seconds every month if it doesn't update.Update October 2011:It is now a few years later.  The watch still runs on the replacement rechargeable battery I bought and replaced back then and it's still always on ""High"".  It was definitely a bad battery I got from Casio.  The watch itself is holding up well.  The silver is starting to scratch off a little bit which makes it look not so pretty.  All functions still work and it has seen some abuse.  If it only was a little bit smaller.  But still happy with the purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLRQOUWAIX4I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WCOBJW#wasThisHelpful","RLRQOUWAIX4I8","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had the Meizu M6 for about a month now.  I am highly impressed.  My girlfriend has the Sansa e270 which I liked very much, and originally planned to get the e280 for myself.  However I read the reviews on the internet for the M6 and it sounded very interesting so I gave it a try.*The Meizu is very easy to use, the menu is clear and logical.  It is also very customizable.  The touch-pad is pretty intuitive.*You can drag and drop files onto the M6 as if it was an external storage device, very easy.*It can be charged via any USB port, or you can buy one of those wall-plug to USB adapters to charge it.  The battery life is amazing, definitely over 20 hours.*My player came with firmware version 1.00.x and I immediately went to Meizu's website and installed the current 2.00.x firmware.  Also very easy to do.*The display is very nice (I have the ""S"" version) and pictures look great on it.  You can even use GIF's.  I made my own backgrounds in Photoshop since you can make any picture on the player as your ""desktop"" background.*The FM tuner is the best yet that I have had on a CD/MP3 player.  You can actually listen to radio without it fading in and out.  I wish it had AM...*The sound quality is truly amazing.  Many, many sound options, including customizable equalizer, phase corrected equalizer, spatializer (with virtual 3D), bass boost, treble boost and ViBE.  Low's are strong and don't distort.  I don't think I have ever had a portable music playing device which sounded this good.*I have not tried to convert and/or play video on the M6 yet, so I cannot comment on that function.*The earphones which come with the player are better than average of what you usually get, but I don't like the fact that the wires are of a sticky rubber material.  They get tangled easily and also tend to stick to things and pull when you wear them.*One thing that bothers me is that all the accesories are sold by stores which only accept Paypal.  I would really like a case for my M6 but have not found a store which accepts credit card.*All in all I really enjoy this player.  I think it's the best bang for the buck out there right now.  I wish I would have bought the 8GB version, but maybe that's next.  I would highly recommend the M6.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3TCU9K0WPAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MCL62M#wasThisHelpful","R1S3TCU9K0WPAY","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need a small flashlight for work and have gone through many, many AA sized flashlights.  I just noticed these 2AA LED Maglites in the stores and decided to try one out.I wasn't sure how bright it would be because besides the 3 Watt label, Mag doesn't really state the brightness of the light.  When I got home I was pleasantly surprised.  This light is at least 5 times brighter than a regular 2AA Maglite and it is also brighter than any other (including LED) flashlights I have used.And what matters more, compared to the regular bulb Maglites, the beam on the LED light focuses perfectly to an even circle.  No more dark areas.The one thing I miss is the little hole in the endcap which can be used for lanyards or keyrings.  Also the LED version is a tad bit longer than the bulb version, but for the huge performance gain, I'll gladly have a slightly larger flashlight.I can't comment on the battery usage yet, as I haven't had to change batteries yet, a good sign...  And I am so glad that I don't have to worry about the little bulbs burning out every so often anymore.I can highly recommend this light, it's well worth the money if you need a good flashlight.  I do wish that the other colors were available as shown on Mag's website.  Amazon or any other local stores just seem to have the black version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNVW7A5KW6JVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GTQPCW#wasThisHelpful","RNVW7A5KW6JVC","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My original reaction when I received the watch was disappointment.  I have owned and still own many Casio's, from cheap basic ones to fancy altimeter/compass/temp ones.  Even though Casio's are not top of the line, they usually give a solid quality appearance.This watch came in a very cheap box and display stand with a sticker which kind of looks like it's a knock off.  The Amazon watch warranty card confused me even more but then I saw in the back of the lengthy Casio manual that there is a Casio warranty on it and you can register the watch online.Another thing I thought was disappointing is that the face had no plastic protection on it and has many tiny scratches.  Nothing noticable, just when you really look close in the sunlight.  A cheap piece of plastic sure would have done the trick...  I wonder if I got a return.  Would appreciate it if someone who got this or a similar watch could comment and let me know if they had plastic on their face.The manual is very elaborate and detailed, which is nice.  The watch did not come synchronized, but after some reading and about 4 minutes later it was right on the second compared with another atomic clock.The grey plastic back is also somewhat disappointing.  I have never seen that on any Casio's.What is not stated in the description is that this watch will also receive the British time signal from Rugby, England.  I will have to test that next time I'm over there.Seeing that I spent twentyfive bucks on it on a friday sale, I can't really complain.  But I don't think I would spend a dollar more on it.Would I recommend it?  I don't know.  If you need a cheap atomic watch with no thrills and you get it for the same price, it might be allright.  Otherwise I would spend a little more for a ""regular"" Casio Waveceptor watch.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6CD8XS87PEHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KPWC1K#wasThisHelpful","R6CD8XS87PEHT","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little suspicious at first, with very few reviews around and Whistler not exactly being a known GPS maker.However, I am glad to say that I am very happy with this purchase.  It comes with a 1GB SD card which is filled with all of USA Navteq maps (Canada is on a included DVD if needed).The receiver is very good, it locks on inside my house where other units have not.  It does however take on the longish side to lock-on at cold start.Routing is good, and re-routes are instantaneous.  It's pretty easy to select an address or POI's.  It has the usual route customizations like include/exclude ferries, highways, toll roads, and you can select shortest, quickest, major, local etc... routings.  You can select to avoid certain roads or make intermediate stops.The display is bright and easy to read (and cutomizable with different colors), however it is not non-glare.The touch screen works very well, including touch panning and such.I wish the actual display screen was more customizable, like expensive Garmin units, I would like to see altitude at all times for example, but you can't ask for everything I suppose.  The altitude is visible on the GPS Status screen though.It has a built in battery which seems to last for a few hours, so you don't need to always plug it in or you can take it ""for a walk"".The fact that it plays MP3's and displays pictures is nice, but I will not use that function.In order to turn the unit off you need to exit the GPS function rather than just shutting it down, sort of like Windows (I believe it runs Windows CE or a version thereof) and that's a little annoying.I sort of surprised myself by buying this since I have always had Garmin units before, but I have to say that I am very happy and would buy this again.And commenting on the other reviewer, my unit does not seem to be off by a certain amount of feet, however, if you are in a driveway, it does want to lock on a road until you are about 20 feet away, but I believe this is normal for automotive GPS units.And about the speed issue, mot cars show a slightly faster than actual speed, so I would say your GPS is the one that is accurate, not your car speedometer.Just heard back from Whistler customer support.  They say they will have map updates about every year.  I also asked if they would have European maps, and they said most likely not...","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27S9JCCK9D2QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F8TTI6#wasThisHelpful","R27S9JCCK9D2QL","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, you actually get a good value.  The small leather case is very nice and does a good job of protecting the e200 series.  The only ""bad"" thing that can be said about this kit is that the small case is a little on the thick side, and it makes the already tiny buttons even harder to push.  The screen protector is hard to attach, especially bubble free, but once it's done it completes the protection for the player very well.  The large case is nice if you take it somewhere without using it, otherwise it's too bulky to carry around.  The cloth is also very soft and cleans the player well.

"I have used my little Motorola MP3 player for a few years until I found something I would really be happy with.  The e270 is it.  I am extremely impressed.  I love the fact that I can drag and drop files onto it without using more software to clog up my computer.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I flashed it to the newest firmware and it really does everything I want it to do.  The little screen is great, easy to read and bright enough on a sunny day.  I figured out how to do my own album art and upload pictures but in the end, it's all about how easy it is to use and how good it sounds.  In those categories it excels.  There are two small issues, one is that every now and then (maybe every 100 songs) a song only plays on one channel, this can be fixed by restarting the song.  I'm sure this is a firmware issue and hopefully it will be addressed at some point.  The other thing is that the buttons around the dial are a little on the small side and can be hard to push.I bought the Sansa E200 Travel Case Kit which is very nice, and a Trekstor USB charger which works beautifully.All in all I am very pleased and future firmware revisions can only make this player even better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AT3QRU7RQL7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETTFRG#wasThisHelpful","R1AT3QRU7RQL7K","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this camera so I that I wouldn't have to carry my Rebel XT everywhere with me.I am very happy with the quality of the pictures.  They still somehow do have the look of a cheaper digital camera.  I'm not sure what exactly it is, slightly higher JPG compression, or just more noise.  But I can immerdiately tell the difference between Rebel XT pictures and A700 pictures.  I'm being a little picky though, overall the results are really good.My major complaint is the flash recycle time.  It's really horrific.  About 5 seconds for me with rechargeable NiMH batteries.  That's a long time if you want to catch a specific shot...  It's a good thing I don't do much flash photography.Yes, the noise does get pretty bad at 800, but it's still better than not having a picture at all.  You can reduce the noise somewhat later with software.This camera does clip highlights pretty bad.  I find that annoying at times.  Areas of light within a darker shot are completely washed out.  This really shouldn't be the case in this generation camera.I'm not sure what the people with the E18 error are talking about, this camera has not been on the market for a year, heck, barely 6 months...I always use custom functions and usually shoot in Av mode with the highest quality and 80 or 100 ISO to get the best results possible.  I love how this camera is nearly as flexible with options as an SLR.To summarize, this is a very good camera.  I would buy it again (unless something newer and better was available).  If this camera had a shorter flash recycle time and didn't clip highlights as much as it does, I would have given it 5 stars.4 Months Later:I have used this camera quite a bit and it has travelled with me to a lot of places.  Unfortunately the automatic lens shade got stuck and would not work anymore.  I sent the camera to Canon and it was repaired under warranty and returned to me within a week.  Great customer service.  If I would do it all over again right now, I would probably get the Canon A700 IS or the A 640 which will all be released this October (2006).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHW38PPJKVBRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EMWD9U#wasThisHelpful","RHW38PPJKVBRS","AEUW6VD9XCVWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEUW6VD9XCVWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stealth of Nations delves into an area where formal economics seldom ventures: the so-called shadow economy which works behind the scenes in most nations, but particularly in the developing world.The book's chapters on Nigeria are particularly instructive, since the entire nation is built on this informal economy (which Neuwirth calls System D).  Without a fully functioning government, infrastructure, power grid, or legal system, Nigerians have found ways to make a living despite these formidable obstacles.Neuwrith believes that nearly half the workers of the world labor under System D, and System D is now tied with the legitimate economy in ways that are nearly impossible to eradicate.  At the conclusion of the book, he offers suggestions on how to make System D enterprises more firmly a part of the above board economy.Neuwirth weaves individual stories of people involved in Systems D with wider issues with great dexterity.

In Inner Hunger, the narrator is completely innocent of her world, her history, and her place within her largely silent family.  This is one of the factors which contributes to the narrator’s struggles with eating disorders.If Inner Hunger is about personal and family ignorance, The Lucky Child is about the unflinching investigation of clan and self.  Apostolides tells the story of her family during the Greek Italian War of 1940, through the Nazi occupation of Greece starting in 1941,  into the post-war period and Greece's costly civil war, and well until the narrator’s father leaves Greece for the United States.The Lucky Child is written in spare yet beautiful prose, as if Apostolides does not wish to hide her intentions behind florid words.  Here and there we get glimpse of both the promise and impossibility of writing history.  In one part, a teacher is guiding student’s through Homer, explaining origins of The Odyssey as oral tales, sung by traveling bards.  With the arrival of the written word, the Homeric stories became forever framed by the written word.  The teacher explains: “It is a tragedy… the tragedy of the written word.  To get this work of art, we must end its evolution.  We must deny the complexities of its past, and seal it from whatever future interpretations might possibly have developed.”In Inner Hunger there is pain and ignorance, but the promise of a story unfolding and evolving.  In The Lucky Child Apostolides performs a Homeric act, finally writing down the saga of her family.  She provides the version that will become canonical for all time – but there is a sense of sadness in this necessary act.  For to write her family story is to seal off its evolution.  But not to write is to lose that history entirely.The Lucky Child is the result of this uneasy comprise between memory and writing.  The result is a great success.  The novel charts a course through history that combines a gripping story with a complex set of questions about the art of storytelling itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0CTTYRDVNF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=189446947X#wasThisHelpful","RI0CTTYRDVNF3","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz is a luminary among modern orthodox-Chasidic writers.  He has written a number of works on mysticism, Talmud, prayer, mussar, among other topics.  In My Rebbe, he writes about his long associated with Menachem Mendel Schneerson, z”l, the last Chabad Rebbe.Part memoir, part history, this book holds some interest.  It is not nearly as encyclopedic at Joseph Teluskin’s: Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History.  But it has an intimacy which Teluskin’s book lacks, as Steinsaltz was an active Lubavitcher and had a long term association with the Rebbe.So, if you want to get a more brisk, intimate feel of the Rebbe’s life than Teluskin’s large work, then this an excellent book.  For a more comprehensive treatment, go for Teluskin.  Of course, you can read both with no harm done to yourself!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3114DTGYKG76G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592643817#wasThisHelpful","R3114DTGYKG76G","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to Pray as a Jew is a comprehensive guide to the orthodox siddur.  For those who attend orthodox services, or prayer at home, this book does not have all that much to offer; it does delve a bit into the history of the siddur's composition, but not to any great extent.For the rank beginner, the major drawback of this book is that the author does not explain the siddur in order, but by level of importance.

"In Little Cat, Tamara Faith Berger attempts, with a great deal of success, to take the genre of pornographic writing and blend or elevate it with elements of literary fiction.When the two novellas in this collection (Lie With Me, and The Way of the Whore) are the most successful is not when the prose exhibits the pure mannerisms of pornography.  Rather, it is when Berger takes the vast, strange, twisted and grand topic of human female sexuality and twists our view of it on its head, creating new angles, giving the reader fresh viewpoints and unusual, disturbing vistas of this all too human pursuit we think we know so well.That is when these two book rises above the confines, demands and expectation of the genre.

"The Life and Though of A.D. Gordon: Pioneer, Philosopher and Prophet of Modern Israel, by Hebert H. Rose, was written in 1964 to chronicle A.D. Gordon,an early Zionist figure who left a unique mark on the movement.  He was, in many ways, the paradigm of the New Jew being created in Palestine in early twentieth century.  He was an intellectual, but he advocated the sanctity of physical work.  He was from the middle class, but wished to create a land of laboring Hebrews.  He was a Socialist who coordinated Zionist nationalism with collective ideals.It is easy to mythologize Gordon.  In a modern Israel that is very far from its ideological roots, and is split into many secular and religious factions, Gordon looks back to an early era of rough and ready idealism; a time when Zionism had yet to bloody its nose on too many intractable facts on the ground.  Gordon’s status is a myth, but at this point in the history of Israel I find it a pleasing one, uncluttered by too many conflicting details.Unfortunately, Rose buries Gordon under the weight of contextualization. There is some straight biography, but he is far more interested in showing the readers Gordon’s intellectual influence and precursors.  So in the end, the reader gets only a small taste of A.D. Gordon.  The man is buried in the thing he tried to escape --- crippling abstract thought.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6OP3VZ4TJ2ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DMHN8#wasThisHelpful","R6OP3VZ4TJ2ET","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until the Mashiach Rabbi Nachman’s Biography: An Annotated Chronology, is a work by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, most known for his books on Jewish meditation.  He was one of the figures who started the movement to bring meditation to the front and center of Jewish practice, and in a sense, much of Jewish meditation practiced today can look to him as their forefather.  He died quite young in 1983 at 48, but left behind an impressive array of writings.He was also one of the first  to translate Rebbe Nachman into English, and had an early association with the Breslov Research Institute.  He helped spread the Rebbe's ideas to a wider audience and is one of the reasons Breslov has grown so much in the last forty year.This work is a rather dispassionate look at the Rebbe's life, death and legacy.  Kaplan appears to have combed through the Rebbe’s work and that of his followers to provide a nearly day by day account of the Rebbe’s life.Instead of a dry rendition of the Rebbe life we would suspect, we instead see how dynamic a world Rebbe Nachman inhabited.  He was always on the move, traveling here and there to his far flung communities.  We get a picture not of a man sitting at his study, writing books (all things he did do) but a traveling man creating a divine community.  This community, he believed, was a harbinger of the coming of the Mashiach (hence the title of this book).For anyone who wants to read about the sweep of Rebbe Nachman’s life without psychoanalysis of his complex personality (as in Arthur Green’s fine book) this is an excellent treatment.  A better illustration of the birth and growth of Breslov Chasidim I do not know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10GTUPZ4DZBH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0930213084#wasThisHelpful","R10GTUPZ4DZBH3","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marianne Apostolides’ book Inner Hunger hits home for me in an unusual way.  Not directly because of the subject matter of bulimia and anorexia. Rather, she grew up in my suburban New York City town and her brother was in my class. So I can't help but see her struggles against the wider canvas of my home town's culture of indifference and a lack compassion.In Apostolides’s book, the community is in part responsible for her disorders.  She does not write about any organized response to her terrible pain from the school or community.  In the culture of upper middle class achievement of Garden City, painful displays of emotion are best hidden, as they deviate from the prevalent narrative of the town.  For me, this hits hard.Her book is powerfully written and deeply moving.  The pain and agony of her condition is only offset by the gradual recovery of her emotional life and widening sense of self-understanding -- of the realization that she must confront her pain directly, and not through any buffer.  This is hard life lesson, one many of us never learn.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQWNK060UBGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393333256#wasThisHelpful","R1BQWNK060UBGV","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am late on the Freakonomics bandwagon.  It appears that the franchise (a blog, a a sequel, a radio show, a movie!) is finally over, and it is most likely a very good thing.When I worked with Economics students a first year PhD student, with a firm conviction of his own superiority propelled by his  lack of skills (he failed out after the qualifying exams) kept a secret blog (a very early 2000s phenomenon, which held a fascination it no longer holds) trashed this book in the blog, and all attempts to creating a pop or even understandable economics.He was wrong; as he was wrong about his own chances in the program, as no doubt  he is wrong about many things right now. Popularization of a particular field in the form of a book is not some bastardization that sullies the sacred art of economics, physics, or chemistry.  Rather, it is the ultimate challenge to expose a broader audience to the importance of a discipline.  It is not bastardization as much as proselytization.Freakonomics only fails in its extreme dogmatism.  The book propose the not very novel idea that the authors are completely right about particular topics they examine while everyone else is wrong.  Yet we all know that in any field of study, differences of opinion, questioning of study methods, research design, and interpretation of data are the bread and butter of organized and scientific inquiry. Without it, we have articles of faith, and not free and open inquiry.And this is where Freakonomics fails.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L5QJPS69W0WT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060731338#wasThisHelpful","R1L5QJPS69W0WT","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, Dr. Judy Melinek, in tandem with her husband, have written a more than average account of her time as an apprentice medical examiner, which overlapped with the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9-11.Parts of this book may make the squeamish cringe.  She explains that many of her tools can also be found in a butcher shop; when she depicts how a brain is cut into thin slices for examination, I imagined deli slicer working on a breast of turkey .  Melinek does an admirable job illustrating how a medical examiner must treat the human body as a scene for clues; and how the medical examiner must divorce him or herself emotionally from the job of dismembering the human body.The only time she admits to losing her professional guard is when victims of American Airlines Flight 587 in 2001 were brought to the morgue.  A bag marked “body parts” instead contains small children.  Pregnant herself, she steps back, unable to further look.  A male colleague performed the autopsies in her stead.

"One would be hard pressed to find a more homoerotic novel, masquerading as quite a different tale, than Melville's Billy Budd. Certainly homo-eroticism is a deep concern in all of Melville’s books, even Moby Dick.  Yet Billy Budd surpasses them all; the entire plot, the strange attraction which the crew members find in the young sailor Billy Budd, is the beat of the entire narrative.  His beauty is his salient feature, his good nature his secondary charm.  Combined, he is called an Adonis by the narrator; it is explained that if he removed his clothes, he would be as perfectly formed as Adam.  An older sailor calls him baby, a play on his name Billy, but also as a show of affection.Billy Budd’s strange stutter, his wild homicide, his execution… do you they all really fall back on his great beauty, both the power conveyed by it, and the inability of other men to bear it without artifice or subterfuge?  This is a difficult question to answer.I suppose this is part of the ongoing fascination with this small, strange novel.  There are Melville’s famous asides on topics not completely related to the plot, and the plot itself has an odd, jumpy feel, as if Melville is trying to fit congruent into a seamless whole.  Anyone who has read Moby Dick will find this familiar.So what we get is an odd novel with implausible events and murky, human motivations.  In other words, a work by Melville.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35F5D2VIULLL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M96SEMY#wasThisHelpful","R35F5D2VIULLL8","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading this novel long ago in college at 19, I approach it now at 45, and see the profound distrust of life in this novel, and the creeping sense that life and death are both intertwined, with horrifying results.Victor Frankenstein creates his creature from strong dread of death.  He creates life, a function reserved for God and women.  What he gets disgusts him to his very marrow, so much so that he flees the creature immediately after its creation.This sets in motion yet more bizarre actions and reactions.  The creature evolves to be more fully human than its creator, only to be emotionally crushed by the burden of loneliness and rejection.  He then becomes the “demon” in Frankenstein’s terms, an entity to be destroyed.  He too takes life, as he is unable to create it after Frankenstein denies him a mate.Finally, in grand Romantic style, they pursue each other to the ends of the earth, Frankenstein intent on destroying the life he made, while the creature finds meaning only in the (negative) attention his creator bestows.Frankenstein is Romantic in the high tradition of the word.  Nature is the abiding substance, but it has a dark, menacing element.  There is ice, rock and towering mountains as the backdrop of the struggle between man and his creature.  If nature is Nature, then it is morally blind, indifferent to the struggles of the living.So this novel is far more than a critique of human technological hubris, but of the Romantic dream of creation as the ultimate human goal.  With creation comes death. This novel is replete with images of birth, and abortion.  They are all tied together and can’t be torn apart.Shelly's vision is grand,horrible, and enduring:  we all must live with the entities we create.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27AP1ZJ580S45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503262421#wasThisHelpful","R27AP1ZJ580S45","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American Rust by Phillip Meyer starts with great promise: a dark novel about young people living in a fading rust belt town, the novel has all the pieces arranged to create a work that is both penetrating and interesting; a work that provides commentary on a part of the American situation while keeping an eye on character and plot.But Meyer, a very good writer, stumbles on many elements.  Some of the characters provide internal monologues, or more correctly, an altered stream of consciousness on the Joycean side.  But Meyer never quite pulls it off quite successfully: rather than feeling we are in the character’s mind, there is simply the sense that Meyer is trying to pull off a technique he can’t quite master.  Rather than a flow of thoughts, we get choppy sentences. This ruins the sense of flow in the novel in many places.There are also implausible scenarios involving police procedures, incarceration, and crime investigations.  These are less problematic, unless you are a stickler for such things.  If you are, it seems that Meyer wants to force his plot along certain lines to prove social and political points --- not to provide veracity to his story. In the process, he cuts the legs out from his plot.Certainly, his characters are interesting, but they suffer from a degree of under treatment.  It is only partially clear why Poe did not take his football scholarship.  Billy English stays to take care of his ailing father, despite his being a genius, and despite the fact that father and son dislike each other;  there is little interplay to suggest some deeper meaning behind their attachment or estrangement.  Poe is willing to take a murder rap for Billy, because of his love for Lee, yet there is no sense that the duo has a love so strong that Billy would do such a thing.  Poe is given chivalrous impulses he never earns.  The main problem is that Meyer has his characters perform acts before he has laid the necessary motivations and groundwork for them to do so.Meyer appears to have put the cart before the horse: he wanted to write a social story, an important statement about America, but he allowed the social critique to dominate plot and character, and as such, the novel underachieves and disappoints.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WXY5RUCZMWNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385527527#wasThisHelpful","R2WXY5RUCZMWNF","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Wild Faith: Jewish Ways into Wilderness, Wilderness Ways into Judaism, by Rabbi Mike Comins, purports to offer new ways for Jewish people to find a Jewish identity outside the (sometimes) stifling confines of the synagogue or domestic routines.In this effort alone, the book is an admirable venture.  Judaism has far too long been shackled by a formulaic approach to it religious elements ---  fixed and immutable, indoors, related to study and practice.  Often good, but not merely enough for a fully engaged religious life; sure, here and there in the history of Judaism, individuals have ventured forth into the wilderness to find G-d.  If we bracket off the obvious examples in the bible, and the holiday of Sukkot, we have such people as Safed group of mystics in the seventeenth century, singing int in the fields to greet the Sabbath Bride, or Rebbe Nachman sitting in the woods in the nineteenth century, talking passionately to G-d.But A Wild Faith really is not about such “casual” encounters with G-d as found in nature, and nature as found in G-d.  Rabbi Comins has a program for finding the divine outside the walls of the synagogue, no doubt bolstered, informed, and even propelled by his Torah Trek program.I simply do not think a Jew needs such a book or program to go out into nature and experience G-d.  One does not need to be guided toward this path, only opened up to the option that you can put down the siddur, look out the window at clouds, and think about our place in the world.It is as easy as that.  What comes next is a hard, lifelong pursuit, but you do not not need a view of the Grand Canyon or have an experienced wilderness guide to find God in nature.  Rabbi Comins book may help many people along this path --- but seemed superfluous to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R284IABEOIX0VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580233163#wasThisHelpful","R284IABEOIX0VZ","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics by Richard Thaler, explores the author's role in the creation of Behavioral Economics, a field which challenges the assumptions of much of classical economics.Economics is based on the assumption that people make rational decisions that optimize their decisions.  This assumption provides a handy set of axiomatic points to move from, creating all manner of theories of how people go about making choices.  It has the enhanced predictive power of other sciences which proceed from a unified theory to explain the varying phenomenon of nature.Thaler details the problems with  rational theory.  He explores the early stages of his career as an economist, when he collected counter-instances to the theory of rational expectations.  This leads to the first tentative attempts to form other theories about people's choices and behavior which do not make assumptions about their complete rationality.  Theories like sunk costs and the fungible nature of money appear to be completely out of sync when tested against the reality of how people consider expenses and money. People make mistakes that are not in their best interests because they do not have complete information, or they act upon emotion rather than correct information.This book shows the inherent bias in any scientific community. Researchers base their entire careers on looking at a field in a certain way, and are very reluctant to set that view aside. Reputation, position, and power can retard the progress of scientific inquiry. Thaler’s book shows that if enough effort is put behind gathering counter-instances in a field, eventually even the most ardent critic must take note.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQ9WLJQURIIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393080943#wasThisHelpful","R1DQ9WLJQURIIW","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In Joan of Arc: A Life Transfigured, Kathryn Harrison takes on a rather formidable character in the western imagination.  We all think we know something about Joan of Arc, either from graphic art, or more commonly, movies, but as Harrison shows, the story of her life has far more complexities than any popular rendition can provide.Harrison is both charmed and cursed in her study of Joan.  Unlike many other mythical figures, there happens to be a great deal of contemporary documents related to her, mainly from her trail for heresy.  Every word she and her inquisitors uttered was transcribed.  Also, over twenty years after her execution, yet another trial took place to exonerate her; there, those who  knew her as a little girl, a divine messenger, and a warrior --- of all ---testified and their words were transcribed.Yet both sources have serious flaws.  The first trial was made under duress; Joan was kept in appalling conditions, with little food or water, and subject to hostile questions repeatedly asked. Under these trying circumstances, Joan often changed her answers.  The second trial occurred twenty-years after her execution, when the cult of Joan of Arc was on the rise.  She was already becoming the national symbol of a resurgent France, and fading memories were influenced by this growing luster.Despite this, Harrison does an excellent job of steering through the primary source material, always patient with the documents, always critical of their veracity as she uses them to develop a coherent narrative of one of the most important women of all time.  In the end, her book weaves deftly about these various threads, because both the history and the legend of Joan of Arc are key to understanding who she was, what she accomplished, and her six-hundred year legacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTN4Q45H0MSI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385531206#wasThisHelpful","RTN4Q45H0MSI5","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Visions of a Compassionate World by Menachem Ekstein is purported to be a work of Polish Chasid between the world wars.  Ekstein wrote this book as a meditation manual.  In this regard, it is successful. Visions presents all the major methods of meditation, giving clear and concise examples of both theory and practice.The problem is, the book has a very contemporary tone and feel.  There is nothing about it that suggests a Chasid in 1930 would have written it, let alone a secular Jew engaged in meditation.  All of the theories and practices in this work are well-known in contemporary Jewish and non-Jewish circles.

This book is not so much a how-to venture on the tactics of waging a guerrilla war; the reader does not get instructions, say, on how to blow up train tracks. Rather, the book explains how to create a guerrilla band, organize its members, keep them supplied, and most importantly, provide them with the proper political education so they can view the armed struggle (in this case, against the Japanese) from the proper prospective.Although Mao writes very much about a national unity campaign against the Japanese (the combined efforts of the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists) this all important political element instilled in the fighters and the peasants who provide them with food and supplies is of obvious and overwhelming importance.This is apparent by looking at Chinese history after World War II.  Mao struggle against the Nationalists, who had superior numbers and firepower, led to his victory.  This little book provided some of the ideological base for unforeseen upset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YH1E7PV64TD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=956310014X#wasThisHelpful","R2YH1E7PV64TD","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rabbi Arthur Green’s short book, Judaism’s Ten Best Ideas, will hold no surprises for the person well versed in Judaism.Green goes over very common, but essential notions.  These are Simhah, Joy, Tzelem Elohim, creation in God’s image, Halakah, walking the path of formal, rule orientated Judaism, Tikkum Olam, repairing the world, Shabbat, Tesuvah, returning to G-d, Torah, Talmud Torah, or education, L’Hayyim, accepting death and affirming life, and Ehad,  Hear O’Israel, the affirmation that God is One.His exploration of these key ideas bears his indelible stamp.  Even if you are very familiar with religious Judaism, this book is still a bright and fresh look at some common notions.  If you are a beginner, this is a great place to start and also a compliment to any ongoing studies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9BGGRPDYDMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580238033#wasThisHelpful","R1O9BGGRPDYDMN","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Again, the lure of the Dover Thrift Book catches me...This time, it is ""Great Russian Short Stories.""  Featured here are some of the heavy hitters in Russian literature from the nineteenth and early twentieth century.  Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky, Dostoevsky and others.Some are very familiar, like the frequently anthologized Tolstoy story “How Much Land Does a Man Need?” and the heartrendingly simple story of love out of reach in Chekhov “The Lady with the Toy Dog.”There are also some surprises.  Dostoevsky’s feverish “White Nights” arrives in the collection like a punch to the jaw.  His stamp is so indelibly printed on this story that it stands nearly alone in the collection.  Perhaps the other story that comes near to its dark vision is Andreyev’s “Lazarus” a strange tale of Lazarus’ post-resurrection life that very much resembles death.Again, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can have all these stories .  These are the greats of a previous era in Russian literature at your finger tips.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSURDL5PLXLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A0B0BVC#wasThisHelpful","R3PSURDL5PLXLS","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Six Easy Pieces by Richard Feynman, the noted, Nobel Prize winning physicist, becomes an interesting case for the reader.  They are ‘easy’ in there is not much elaborate mathematical detail about the topics Feynman discusses (atoms, quantum physics, astronomy, etc.) and the beginning essays are, in fact, quite easy.But as one reads, the 'easy' pieces get harder, and my late high school and early college science classes quickly failed me.  Interesting, this is what is said in the preface.These lectures were prepared for a freshman physics class and Feynman prepared them as introductory material.  But as the semester went on, we are told, more and more freshman dropped the course, and more faculty and graduate students attended.  They wanted to see Feynman explain complicated topics in a simple way, in itself a difficult task.So, unless you have a decent background in physics, these lectures will leave you way behind at the mid-point.  This is not to say that the lectures fail (although they did not accomplish their original purpose) but it is to say that this is not a great introduction to physics for the novice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C269MUTKOW8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OVEYNU#wasThisHelpful","R2C269MUTKOW8G","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"William Schneidewind’s “A Social History of Hebrew” attempts a very difficult task, to take create a social history of a language that exists only in text form.  The author gives reasons why this is a difficult task, and they seem legitimate.  He also gives other reasons why this is possible. I am not qualified to judge if he is correct.After reading much about the history of Hebrew, it strikes me that despite major discoveries in archeology, the discovery and examination of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and advances in the historical study of the bible, how little certainty exists in the field.  Things like dating, influences and the social context of Hebrew in various pre-modern eras are not know, and new discoveries do little but create more questions which may never be known.Despite this, the non-specialist can read Schneidewind’s book and get a great deal out of it.  It is a semi-technical explanation of the history of Hebrew, and with a bit of background, a reader can gain much insight into the social context of the language from its formation until its rebirth as a living language in Israel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R61VB7RBCYRWF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GGSFZW8#wasThisHelpful","R61VB7RBCYRWF","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a tremendous enthusiast for the work of Rabbi Arthur Green, so it is really no surprise that I found his Speaking Torah: Spiritual Teachings from Around the Maggid’s Table a deeply informative and engaging book.For years Rabbi Green has been a leader in the so-called Neo-Chasidic movement.  Deeply engaged in Chasidic texts, this group of rabbis and writers find the spiritual teachings of Chasidism informative, but downplay their firm commitment to halakah, religious law, and the social organization of their lives.  Green and others are trying to capture the original commitment of Chasidism, which was designed to innovate and stir Jews to reaching higher spiritual levels by radically reinterpreting Jewish teachings and life.So for Green and his co-editors, the spiritual in the subtitle is a very operative term.  They take elements of Chasidic teaching where Torah portions are given ""spiritual"" rather than strictly phyiscal interpretations.  Really, it is fascinating to watch the interpretative work that Green lays out for us.  It is part allegory, part metaphor, a strong element of Hebrew wordplay (which is pointed out in the text) and a dose of religious creativity.After every chapter there is a short explanatory paragraph laying out the salient points of the passage. After each major section, Green and his editors break out and discuss the text, sharing their sometimes conflicting opinions.  This adds yet another layer to the book: modern scholars of the Torah are taking nineteenth century Chasidic texts meant to be applied to real life and applying them to our time.This book is an excellent way to navigate the difficult realm of early Chasidic literature.  If you can’t read Hebrew and catch the wordplay, a book like this (in two volumes) is essential to understanding what is going on.And what is going on?  Simply put, that God is everywhere, that his Torah is everything, and we are all connected.  If we understand the Torah correctly, if we obey not just its physical demands but also its spiritual meaning, this door opens up for us. Of course this sounds easy.  Getting to this understanding and living with it is the challenge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JIRT1W0M40D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580236685#wasThisHelpful","R37JIRT1W0M40D","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yehoshue Perle’s Everyday Jews: Scenes from a Vanished Life carries with it the full weight of its subtitle.  Published in 1935, Perle would die in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.  So it becomes hard to judge this book without that the tight, constricting lens of the Holocaust as its unwritten end point.  Like so many writers who perished in the Shoah, their work takes on a new glow, because we read each word with the full awareness that the end is near.Despite this, and despite its depressing passages replete with poverty, ignorance, and struggle, Perle manages to write a novel that is not without humor.  The creeping darkness of the novel's world is lightened by Mendl, the twelve year old protagonist’s observations of life.So, despite the expert eye of the Mendl, his keen observations of life around him, this novel becomes a bildungsroman, a coming of age novel, and this is fully confirmed by the end.No doubt Perle was setting his character up to deal with the competing and harsh demands of the Eastern European world between the wars.  And these demands, no doubt, would have murdered him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSZW301E8DAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FFQOAZ0#wasThisHelpful","R3PSZW301E8DAH","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this book Anderson takes a look at the enduring legend of T.E. Lawrence, probably one of the few authentic heroes to come out of the First World War.  For a conflict known for its mass anonymous slaughter, Lawrence appeared to be a figure from another age.  Riding with Arab horsemen or on camels, his myth harkened back to an earlier age of warfare.But Anderson quickly disabuses us of this notion. Lawrence was a complex man, by turns kind and cruel, affectionate and aloof,  he committed treason and war crimes.  Far from being a fully commanding figure, he was guided by the events of the time as much as he guided them.  Anderson does an excellent job portraying a complex man in a complex manner.Anderson also investigates three other adventurers in the Middle East at this time to give Lawrence some context: a German spy, an American oilman, and a Jewish agronomist. With the exception of the agronomist, all are in their twenties.  They are young men in the Middle East because of the call to adventure, but also because they fail to fit in to the upper levels of their respective societies.  In the Middle East they can remake themselves.  They were not as successful as Lawrence, but he paid a very heavy price for his transformation.All in all, Anderson provides a gripping account of the time and the place.  Perhaps he spreads the material too thin at times, and the narrative thrust of the book falls flat.  But these times and places are few.  Overall this is a compelling read, giving an excellent sense of the time and place and people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21U4GD7N7F41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BH0VSPI#wasThisHelpful","R21U4GD7N7F41","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leonardo and The Last Supper by Ross King is just what it purports to be, a detailed history of Leonardo da Vinci and his most famous painting.In the process, King gets into the politics of the day, the details of the renaissance as a movement, a set of ideals, a frame of mind.  There is a great deal of discussion of The Last Supper, but this book definitely contextualizes the work in the time and in Leonardo’s life.Actual time spent on the painting is fleeting, but fascinating.  The long history of its decline, catastrophic “restorations,” its near destruction by a bomb in the Second World War, and its final, definitive and controversial restoration are treated, but only briskly.This book is much more about Leonardo and his world than The Last Supper.  But it presents a fascinating painting and a fascinating world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHG01OVJ0EEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AW5HQW#wasThisHelpful","R2GHG01OVJ0EEM","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Book of Blessings is Martha Falk’s widely ambitious siddur, or prayer book, designed to reformat Jewish liturgical service, and with it, Jewish notions of God, Israel and its election, male and female roles, the notion of a personal divinity, the position of Judaism regarding the natural world, to name only a few.Falk’s motivations for creating this siddur are outlined both at the beginning of this book, and in greater depth at the conclusion.  She cites a quote from Arthur Green, a luminary in the world of Jewish Renewal and non-dualistic Judaism. Green says that even though he believes that there is no such entity as a God separable from the world or people or the things in it, he still uses the language of liturgy that presumes such a separation of objects.  Falk admires Green's work, but finds this a strange position to take.So, the reader should keep this in mind when using The Book of Blessings.  It has little resemblance to many siddurim out there.  Even the siddur of the Reconstructionist movement is not as bold at replacing the formulas for blessings and most aspects of liturgical language found in traditional prayer books which presume a personal God and a personal supplicant.So, this siddur will speak to many people.  Other people will read it and see it as fundamentally un-Jewish, despite the extensive Hebrew.  The siddur you want is for you to decide.  In our world, we are Jews by choice, and with that in mind, we get to choose our prayers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TUK6PB9OHW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807010170#wasThisHelpful","R36TUK6PB9OHW9","A11DCTGTPS7M0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11DCTGTPS7M0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love Lazy Ones! They are--hands down--the most comfortable pajama pants ever. Don't let the Amazon label fool you though. I have a set of this style of Lazy Ones (with the cell phone pocket), and they are *not* womens sized. They are a slightly baggy Juniors! So if you are purchasing, order 1 size up from what you'd get in womens--especially if you like your PJ pants to fit relaxed. I didn't care for the shirt in this set and sent it back as I ordered it separately, but the pants are wonderful. I love the colors and the different fox poses are pleasantly silly. Lazy Ones make exceptionally long PJ pants. This is great if you are super tall, but if you are petite like me it's really helpful to know how to hem (YouTube tutorials are glorious for such) or have a friend who does. I'm 5'2"", ordered a large, and had to remove 3.5"" inches off the bottom--and probably could have gotten away with taking off another inch. They are very much worth the trouble, though.

"I love Lazy One PJs (enough that I buy this after having the ""Toadally Tired"" jammies for a year) and I love foxes so this PJ set seemed perfect. But I did not care for this top. Fits fine when you order one size up from womens (it's actually a slightly baggy Juniors shirt, but Amazon has it mislabeled). The colors of the fox on the shirt really don't match the foxes on the PJ bottoms. It is bright orange. The foxes on the PJ bottoms are more of a pretty dark orangish red. The pea soup color with cut of the top itself was not flattering for me and it seemed the graphic of the fox on the shirt wasn't that interesting as the foxes were on the pants. It would have been better if Lazy one made the shirt in a camo green (a tank top might have been neat) and/or had the fox in a more interesting pose (or maybe just enlarged). Then it'd still match the trees on the pants and be more fun. Glad I bought the pants separately as I love them.

"Really love the way this fits. It seems to taper at the top and be looser on the bottom so it's fitted, but is still loose and it breaths. The back of the shirt is longer than the front so it covers more of your bottom (something useful if you are self-conscious in running shorts/tights). Some of the more subdued colors look great if you are wearing them with casual wear (like leggings)—which cuts down on laundry if you plan your workouts at the end of the day. The fabric is tough, snag-free and washes well, but it is nice and thin. I haven't had problems with any lack of wicking and I disagree with the one reviewer that it works the same as cotton (it does not hang onto sweat). However, it may not wick as well as singlets that have a looser weave in their fabric so it might not be something to wear if you are running in super hot/humid weather (we are talking 90F+ with 75% or more humidity). I tend to avoid running in those kinds of conditions though (early mornings or after dark for me on summer days) so it works well for my runs. My only big gripe is it is a bit low cut in the neckline which shows off a little bit of higher cut sports bras (I use a Juno) or a little cleavage if you are wearing a lower-cut bra. Perhaps Asics will improve this in the next version? Otherwise, it's a pretty great. It's a really comfortable and versatile running/workout top. Totally worth buying on sale. I have purchased it in other colors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R56QVPM69VT2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPNWEKG#wasThisHelpful","R56QVPM69VT2L","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I almost feel naked when I wear mine.I am 5'2"" and 145 pounds. I ordered the large, and they felt too loose around the waist. Exchanged for a medium. It still feels loose, but comfy and doesn't feel like it's going to fall down (the large did). It was super long, but felt so good when I put it on I decided to cancel the return. I took about 3 inches off the bottom (I could have probably gotten away with 2) using a great hem tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKhjaAMN8JM. It mostly took time pinning these, but it was pretty easy to trim them down and worth it—given how well made and affordable they are.Now they fit great and look wonderful.

While they are shorter (2.5"" inseam) they actually worked wonderfully as board shorts and held up beautifully in the salt water. So my recommendation for those of us ladies who can't find good board shorts (unless you are a surfer who would need much a heavier stitched item that understandably costs much more $$$) is take a look at highly-reviewed running wear to take the the beach. It's built to get wet and the good stuff does not chafe (us runners have a thing about that). Some of the more fitted thinner tops can even work well as rashguards, too. Just remember running gear is fine for salt or fresh water (as it needs to survive in excessive ""salty water"" to begin with), but it may not survive in chlorine (really does anything? :) ).","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VALZCAX4NUCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006V766JA#wasThisHelpful","R3VALZCAX4NUCP","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love this series! Can't wait to swipe (borrow) the book once my young daughter tires of it. She's already read it about 4 times. It's fun, whimsical and refreshing. While the story is a similar kind of plot as Calvin and Hobbes (a child and his/her talking animal friend), it really shines on it's own. The art is colorful, fun, and original. The characters are cute, fun, and silly, but also intelligent and 3-dimensional at the same time. Lots of witty banter and magical fun. I also really like that the unicorn (Marigold) can actually be seen by Phoebe's parents. It is totally worth a owning—especially if you have a little girl (or you yourself reading funny, smart comics about sarcastic unicorns and their girls).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21S9WP6ZB3JDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449470769#wasThisHelpful","R21S9WP6ZB3JDW","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for a cheap pedal to replace pedals on a child's bike that were broken these are fine. If you are looking to get your kid something that is more ergonomic and spins better on their bike, keep looking. These are the same design as the cheapy kid bike pedals with the added positive they are made by resin (more durable) versus cheap plastic.

"I have a hard time with large bags. I'm only 5'2"", and I have narrow shoulders so straps tend to slip off easily if they are too long. And then most somewhat large purses either look comical on me or give me the appearance of carrying a diaper bag (we are well past that stage).However, as I care full-time for a young child I needed something that was large and easy to carry. I was also hoping to find something unique and somewhat environmentally-friendly. Often I carry my sundries (a little makeup, my wallet/keys), sunscreen/hand cleaner, a small first aid kit, several little activity books (love Dover for that purpose), wipes, some folded reusable bags, my iPhone, and sometimes a Boogie Board (to keep my daughter engaged on long trips), mints, and/or my Kindle (to keep me engaged during my kid's long classes). And it'd be nice to still have room for a small snack, too.On a whim, I decided to try a cotton Hobo bag. They seem to be spacious, durable, and they fit along with a person's form very nicely (solving my issues with it ""looking"" too big and falling off my shoulder), and they have unique looks. I liked the simpleness and colors on this bag. I also like it isn't covered with a bunch of Ohm and peace symbols (no offense to my fellow yoga- and peace-lovers). I was very pleased with the aesthetics when I received it. It is indeed colorful and unique. However, I wasn't completely sure it would fit my needs.At first, I thought it only had one pocket (on the inside). I didn't see the cell phone pocket right away. It's there! It's made from the same fabric as the handle so it blends in very nicely. It barely fits my iPhone 4s with a bulky Otterbox so it may fit larger phones if their covers/skins aren't thick. But even with the cell phone, it was very easy to lose things inside in the bag. The perfect solution was a purse organizer! Amazon sells them for $6-10, and they are wonder! They come in different colors, have handles to easily pull them out of the purse, and fit perfectly inside a larger bag like this.Now I that can find all my things, this purse is perfect! It's beautiful, the strap stays put where ever I wear it (I can do cross body or just put it on one side), and it fits all my stuff with loads of room to boot! This may be one of the smartest purchases I made. I will certainly look for more bags in this style in the future!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTA30GIY0W2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007HI95NG#wasThisHelpful","R1JTA30GIY0W2X","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a bike that is a girl's bike that isn't covered in Barbies and Disney Princesses (and 401 other commercial things), look no further. This beautiful little bike is colorful and unique. And truthfully? This bike can probably be used for boys, too, if you want to take the time to remove the decals (if they are too feminine for your/his taste). It is a very fun and cute bike! It is very reasonably priced for what you getWe purchased this bike for my daughter's birthday. She is turning six and is small for her age. She has just outgrown her 12"" bike this year and we wanted to get her something larger so she didn't have to struggle to pedal. She initially loved a couple that had handbrakes but completely went crazy over this one.We haven't given it to her yet. I bought it a couple weeks early before her birthday we had shipping problems or the bike came missing pieces so we could easily make an exchange if necessary. It wasn't though. Everything came in tact, and Amazon surprised me by double-boxing it so my daughter didn't know what it was when it was delivered.It went together *very* easily. It came with a very thick instruction manual, but I really didn't need it to figure it out. Most of the parts came pre-installed—except the minor accessories (tassles, doll seat, basket, etc...), handlebars, the pedals, the seat, and the front tire. Also, the tires were partially inflated (as most new bike tires are for shipping). I was easily able to do it all myself in less than an hour. The most difficult thing to install was the doll seat. I couldn't find instructions on how to do it and it does need to be held up to be bolted in. Luckily I figured out if you stuff a towel between the doll seat bracket and the back tire, it will stay put while being bolted down.Pros:• The frame is very sturdy and well-made• The bike is super easy to assemble• Excellent comfy seat• Unique and colorful• Fun cruiser design• Coaster brakes work fantasticallyCons• Chainguard is cheap plastic and will end up scratched up in no time—plus has the potential to be broken• The designs are just decals—not paint—and have the potential to peel off• The tassels are really cheap and will fall apart or tatter up in a year. Ours lost a ""string"" right out of the box.• The pedals don't move very easily and are small cheap plastic.• No back reflector. Front reflector is not easy to see with basket.• Doll seat seatbelt has no instructions (though it's not hard to figure out the installation). It has a *horrible* wimpy velcro satin ribbon that will come undone in a heartbeat.• No optional handle brake• No kickstand^ Almost all of the issues above can be resolved and are worth dealing with as the bike is very inexpensive to begin with. Amazon sells a number of 1/2"" bike pedals that are 10 times better. I am looking at Ebay for possibly replacing the chainguard (they seem to have a few metal chainguards that fit kid's bikes—including some colorful ones). It won't have the same design, but since this bike is so colorful to begin with I don't see it being a problem finding a chainguard to match.The tassels can also easily be replaced. So can the doll seat belt. I'm looking into buying a brlghtly-color buckling dog collar from a dollar store to use instead of the satin ribbon. Got to protect those dollies! Likewise, I'm looking into buying stick-on reflectors for the back of the doll seat and to go in front of the basket.Finally - The little girl on the decals is super cute, but she doesn't look like most kids. She is a red-headed caucasian with blue-eyes—great if you have a kid that looks like that (or don't mind), but many of us who do not are concerned with the overuse of blue-eyed kid images (yes, I sometimes overthink these things as a mom of a little girl).Luckily, sharpies are quite useful in this case, and I plan to make the girl into a brown-eyed brunette like my daughter. This may also work for parents who have darker-skinned children. The hair can probably be changed to anything but blonde (it's auburn/orange). Test on it carefully first, but as it is a decal it shouldn't mark up the frame.Very excited and cannot wait to give it to our daughter for her birthday. Will post an update after we do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIGKBPUCR8O5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQE9OQY#wasThisHelpful","RIGKBPUCR8O5J","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's in the daylight spectrum so as expected it's very bright, but not obnoxious to me as some fluorescent bulbs can be. We bought it for a lamp with a very obscure bulb in it as 4-pins in this style are very difficult to obtain at only 18 Watts.

"We *love* this lamp! It's been a wonderful bedroom lamp since my daughter was a baby, and is still going strong after nearly six years. It's a shame they aren't produced any more, and we can't find the company, though. The top bulb finally burnt out and we couldn't locate a replacement that was exactly the same. The closest we could find is the Eiko 05148. It is sold here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00218VP08/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.It is compatible with the part it plugs into, but the base that's part of the lamp (the fox's tail) did not have a large enough hole for the base of the bulb to fit into. I had to take the lamp apart (there are about 8-9 screws) and use my Dremel to carefully widen the hole. Viola! The bulb fits. To slip it out, I used a flathead screwdriver along the base (with the lamp unplugged of course). Hope this helps anyone who comes back here to find a new bulb for their lovely fox lamp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O3B9LJ65K920/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YHCCB4#wasThisHelpful","R2O3B9LJ65K920","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The animation is great, but I'm really not impressed with the rest of what I see so far. The animation design seems to be an echo of Avatar (Niko is kind of an Aang copy), Samurai Jack (mostly the background designs), and Kung Fu Panda (come on, the little weird sidekick animal is totally the Sensai).Then there's the fact seven characters were introduced and none of them were female--not even a bad guy. The only sign you see of a female is the girl on the coin, and that comes off as the boring quest for the Princess trope. This is rather pre-90s, and it's pretty lame when you are both a woman and a parent of a little girl. I do not want my child growing up feeling excluded when she watches action cartoons.I see it could have potential for evolving. Some of the jokes were funny and the voice acting was decent (though Niko over-annunciates).

"My guy taunted me when I wore my plush fleece pajama bottoms--frequently calling me Ms. Fuzzy Pants. I told him if I found a pair of plush fleece men's pajamas he would regret those words as he would not be able to keep himself from wearing them. I looked high and low. Most ""plush fleece"" men's PJs we found are regular thinner fleece--not thick and fuzzy. I was thrilled to find that Wrangler made a set.We both agree they are high quality and are very well-sewn with nice thick fleece. We had no problems with holes another reviewer did. However, they didn't fit my husband comfortably (gave him a wedgie) so we went a size. Also, they did not have a fly (something he usually prefers).My husband says they are super comfortable, and he really enjoys wearing them. They may not be hot pink and covered with leopard spots like mine, but I have a feeling I will no longer be teased about having ""fuzzy pants"" at night (or at least I can tease ""Mr. Fuzzy Pants"" back).

"Love, love, LOVE this bag! I have been looking for one that works for forever. Although I've enjoyed the style of other Kavus (I have their ropebag and Keeper) this is the best one.First off, it's very ergonomic. I have narrow shoulders, and straps usually slip off easy. This one stays put. It is also very lightweight (like most of the cotton bags).Second, the style is very nice. It's unique and very compact looking--which is a plus if you are a petite woman like me as most sizable purses look like duffel bags when I carry them. I took a chance on the Rose Garden pattern as it was on sale, and the pictures do not do it justice. It's way prettier and more vibrant in person.Finally, for a compact bag—the Seattle Sling holds A LOT of stuff! Pockets, pockets everywhere! There's even enough room left over for my over-sized wallet and keychain. The strap pocket has plenty of room for my iPhone 4s (which is inside a gigantic Otterbox case).What can I say?

"I bought this to possibly replace a lovely Columbia plush fleece hoodie that is lovely but will be worn out after this winter. It's okay, but not at all comparable. It's not worth the price I paid--even on sale (maybe $15). The fit is correct (I wear small/medium women's clothes and a medium fit okay). The arms are too long if you are petite (I'm 5'2"").The material is soft, but because of the type of fleece it is it looks a bit bulky when you put it on. The inside seams are rather thick so it takes away from the comfort. The cut is okay, but not particularly fashionable nor anything I couldn't already buy locally for half the price.

I considered a different brand that my dogs' trainers and some of our dog friends use (Doggone Good), but was tickled pink to discover OllyDog offers this Pro Version for less.

I also prefer the way OllyDog looks (the colors and designs are very vibrant), though they are both great treat pouches when it comes to functionalityThis has many pockets, and the magnetic enclosure is easy to access but snaps right shut to keep treats in and opportunistic dogs out.

"Perfect! Purchased for my daughter's ice skating class. I wanted her to have a headband to keep her ears warm, but allow heat out of the top of her head as she will be wearing a helmet at first. These really fit the bill! Given the price and great reputation of TurtleFur it seemed like a no-brainer to buy this set as headbands and hats are too often lost, and this 6-pack cost about as much as 2-3 Turtlefur headbands elsewhere. They are very soft, well-made and will last a while. They fit well on my daughter's head (she is a 5 year old with a slightly larger than average noggin), but can stretch out to snuggly-but-comfortably fit me. I use fleece headbands often for distance running during the winter and can tell these will be great as winter activewear (warm, but sweat-wicking). The colors are great and exactly as pictured.

"These strings have a really decent sound—considering they run $10-15 a set. They are clear, rich, but not twangy--as frequently be the case with steel strings. The color coding is great, too. Makes installation very easy. They are good beginner strings for a child or beginning adult student. Much better than spending $50+ a pop to replace strings every 6 months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UMQ3E58YZ7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D08IE#wasThisHelpful","R21UMQ3E58YZ7W","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm new to ukuleles, but somewhat seasoned with other instruments as I own a couple violins, a djembe, a couple blues harmonicas, and a very nice rosewood soprano recorder. What can I say? It's adorable! It is bright-colored and playful all over—including dolphins behind the pegs.It seems to be sturdy and well-made, too, has nice strong pegs that stay put, and carries the sound well. A very good deal for the sale price I paid of 27 clams.As a few people have said, it'd be wise to invest in some decent strings. Will be replacing ours soon. You can get a good set from just under $5 to $8. Haven't tried the DVD yet (will add to this review when we do), but we're planning to buy a book and a couple extra picks, too. The gig bag and pitch pipe are worthless. The pitch pipe was seriously out of tune and will end up becoming my daughter's plaything for her music drawer. :) The bag is just plastic. So really the only extra that may be worthwhile is the DVD, but even without the DVD the uke is a good deal when it's on sale.Invest $10-15 for a good padded bag and a good electric tuner—or get a tuning App for your smartphone (there are a few good free ones for the iPhone).Overall, I'm actually happy with this little instrument. A unique and playful first ukulele for someone who's a beginner or has a child who might want to learn strings. A nice little purchase. Will update as I learn to play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R96FF6IIJ5ZTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001SN7R3G#wasThisHelpful","R96FF6IIJ5ZTR","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I really want to educate my daughter about life and reproduction, I feel this book fell very short. Part of the problem was they tried to fit too much in at once, and over-played humor/cute characters--probably in an attempt to make parents feel more comfortable. To me, it just seemed really dumbed-down--even though the authors used the correct terminology and attempted to include all subjects about reproduction and relationships (almost to a fault).The result is I ended up with a headache trying to read it to my 5 year old.  It's a shame. The illustrations had potential to be decent, but there's just so much squished in it, and too often there are jokes where jokes really shouldn't belong.For instance, the spread on conception was a horrible overly cartoony mess. Strangely, my daughter found the personified sperms and egg were terrifying (which I found amusing but still respected her need to skip it). Even if she wasn't scared of them, I'd probably skip it, though, as I find personified body parts to be the type of thing that can be confusing for younger children. I really don't want my daughter growing up believing sperm and eggs have eyes. :)The only pages we really found useful were the ones that showed the similarities and differences between boys and girls (if only I could white out the stupid bird and bee cartoon characters). The other chapters (the ones on good touch/bad touch and friends) were okay, but really needed to be their own books--and they were also very much cheapened with the bird and bee cartoon characters. Molestation and boundaries are not something that should be joked about like that at all.For reproduction-and only reproduction, I like this book for small children: http://www.amazon.com/How-Babies-Made-Andrew-Andry/dp/B0018JVVPK/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1405026426&sr=1-3&keywords=how+babies+are+madeIt's harder to find, but even a used version is worth owning.It's doesn't dumb down the subject, but it is not terribly over-descriptive/graphic either. Still looking for a decent one about the similarities/differences boys and girls. For Good/Bad touch types of subject, we like ""Your Body Belongs to You.""""It's Not the Stork,"" however, will be returned. I appreciate what the authors are attempting to do, but it just doesn't work for us.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8W5ER5W3WMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763633313#wasThisHelpful","RY8W5ER5W3WMX","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"They cost a little more than I usually spend on PJs, but were well worth it. They are my favorite pair now. So cute! They are Juniors so I sized up. I'm usually a women's Medium and bought a Large. They shrunk a little in the wash so they now fit very well except they are a bit long on me (I'm 5'2""). So if you are taller, you won't be disappointed. If you petite and don't want to hem them, the bottoms actually look cute rolled and seem to stay put. They are funny, different, hold their color very well in the wash, appear that they are going to be very durable, and are very comfy (but not baggy). They are 100% cotton and very breathable to sleep in (something I look for in PJs).

"Normally, I'm not too picky about offgassing plastic, but these made me gag out of the package. I also noticed that there were scratches and peeling on the design right away. The paint/dye doesn't look like it's bonded well with the plastic. Those issues aside, they'd probably look good on a narrow-to-normal foot (I have wide feet and the edges of my feet overlapped a little), and they seemed comfortable for the very brief time I had them on.

"These are okay. It's wonderful they are made from recycled material and are environmentally-friendly, and the colors are nice.

"Aaaaarg! It's a dog--not a baby!!!! And while I'm a firm-believer in great baby carriers, I wouldn't even use an outward facing carrier like this on a baby (dangling legs are bad for their hips and it's bad for their brains not to be able to turn away when they are overstimulated or afraid). Too many people treat little dogs as babies instead of canines--a big reason a lot of them end up on Craigslist and the shelter. But I digress.This product is not good for our canine companions. It is especially bad for small dogs--including ones who are shy (and many small dogs are). It doesn't allow them to retreat if someone approaches them (and *lots* of people want to approach cute toy breeds--including those who have no clue or care about your pup's personal space). Also, a dog will not be able to use body language. This is bad because it can lead to fear-biting.And not only unhealthy for socialization, but it's unhealthy for a dog's skeletal system. Dogs are not built to be carried around vertically like humans are. You run the risk of compressing the spine--and as reviewers have mentioned this puts pressure on the neck--which is extra bad for littles dogs as it can lead to collapsed tracheas. Another issue is over-heating. Unlike human babies, dogs do not sweat through most of their body and are covered with fur. They are much more prone to overheating and a lot less likely to show it as animals hide feeling ill.Instead of buying a ""cutesy"" gimmick product like this, find a good harness for your little pup and invest in good positive training classes. Positive training classes are truly the best way to bond with your little pup, and both you and your furry love will be happier (and healthier) in the long-run.Grew up with 20 dogs. Have had 5 great dogs in our family--including 3 pomeranians (two of whom were 7 or less pounds).","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WBOJAI9AO7CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064GABKI#wasThisHelpful","R1WBOJAI9AO7CL","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very surprised by these reviews. Wondering how many of them are actually from people who have owned Moving Comfort bras. Or perhaps the quality has drastically changed?The design of this item is maybe a little like Moving Comfort (like the velcro bra straps), but the quality is not comparable. It's made from very cheap itchy nylon-like material. There is also no way it's properly a high-impact bra as it's very stretchy like a swimsuit. Maybe appropriate for a yoga class--NOT for running or aerobic activities of any kind.Go buy the real thing on sale.

"Super awesome sweater! Very well-made and cute, but make sure you either try one out from Chilly Dogs locally or order from a place that has free returns. These tend to be sized very small (go up one—preferably two—sizes to be safe). We have a 11 pound pom/sheltie mix who ended up in a medium after we went through a couple exchanges from a local store.  He is very long and fluffy so these are things to take into account.I bought this sweater in an extra large for our 31 pound 9-month old Whippet-lab mix. He tends to be tall and broad-chested for his size (IOW - he's easily mistakable for a 40+ pound dog) and will be growing a little more so I sized up even beyond what I thought would fit him. It fits him very nicely and will still look great if he puts on 5-10 pounds. Because they have no sleeves and are very high cut on the bottom (perfect for male dogs) you can't go wrong getting one that's a bit bigger.It's a great sweater otherwise. Nice, soft, and thick. Definitely wash it in cold and delicate (if not hand-wash) as the red will probably bleed. The hoodie is adorable, and Chilly Dogs are probably the only pet apparel I've had that actually have hoodies that stay on the dogs' heads. It's also very comfortable for our dogs. The seams are nice and thin (though still well-sewn), and the wool isn't scratchy—even to me (I'm a little sensitive to wool). This one has a cute design on it. Definitely a must for any fan of monkeys or sock monkeys. A nice comfy way to take goofy dog pictures that is well-made enough to actually be useable and enjoyable for the dog during a cold winter walk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGV70R3CJPSFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007B2SRXC#wasThisHelpful","RGV70R3CJPSFU","A45V752HS8PQI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A45V752HS8PQI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this book when it first came out (2001, the same year I moved to Cathedral City) and I enjoyed the read.  I sold my copy at a garage sale shortly thereafter, and recently I thought it might be fun to read again, so I did a search, and found one for sale by a private seller in Colorado.  I bought the book, and when it arrived, it was a little spooky to find my original garage sale price tag sticker still on the front of the book (cue Twilight Zone music).  Anyway, I read it again, and enjoyed it probably a little more than the first time, because some of the landmarks in the book are more familiar to me now (as well as some of the events, like the new civic center and the tearing down of much of the lower Cove with invocation of eminent domain).  I know some original reviewers compared this book to the incredible Tales of the City; as an original HUGE fan of that serial and later Armisted Maupin's string of books, I think the comparison is overly kind, but then, aside from this book's easy-flowing, easy-to-read style I don't think that's what the author of Cathedral City was going for.  Note: I also remember there was a sequel, but the only thing I remember about it was that it wasn't as enjoyable to me as the original book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H3I2QHNE9QMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1575668491#wasThisHelpful","R3H3I2QHNE9QMJ","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first moved to Cathedral City in 2001, but I have been visiting the Palm Springs/Cathedral City area for about 45 years, so I've seen a LOT of changes. Mr. Hillery clearly spent a long, long time and a lot of effort putting this little book together, and for a tiny little town like CC, I'm certain there's not a lot of historical information to pull from; clearly much of his content was gleaned from photos and stories he worked very hard to compile.  The book is dry, without a bunch of superlatives, reading more like minutes from town meetings than a history book, but it's full of little bits and pieces of homey information that are fun for someone who has been around for a while.  A few maps showing some of the locations he refers to would have been helpful; when he refers to certain locations and buildings, I'm not always sure where they fit in.  Mr. Hillery makes it clear that his book ends in 1981 when the city was incorporated; what would be really nice is if he or someone else were to continue on from 1981 to the present.  Cathedral City has a really interesting more recent past, and it would be fun to read more about the buildings, companies, people and politics that have gone into making it what it was in 1981 to what it is today.  Well done job by an author with passion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L2Y5LLP3W5AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478731974#wasThisHelpful","R3L2Y5LLP3W5AX","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kind of amazing how easy and how well this thing works.  So far we've made a number of recipes from the slim recipe book that comes with it, and everything has turned out really well.  Nicely made, feels like it will last a long time, though with all of its newfangled electronic sensors and settings, only time will tell.  Easy to clean.  Our favorite so far is to cut a pork loin roast or thick chuck roast into 3-4 pieces, pour a big can of enchilada sauce (green for pork, red for beef) over the meat, and hit the 'meat/stew' button.  It automatically comes on and cooks for 30 minutes, and it's delicious.  Dump it in a tortilla, pour some of the sauce over it, a little cheese, and BAM!  Easy and delicious.

"Had this about a month and so far, very happy with it.  I bought it to replace a Cuisinart model of the same basic type, and I must say I was bowled over when I unpacked this and found the burr part (the section that screws down into the base) was EXACTLY the same as the Cuisinart.  EXACTLY...the heads were interchangeable with the bases.  Which worries me a bit, since it was somewhere in the gearing that the Cuisinart burned up after being used just a couple of times a week for 4-5 years.  I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that this one lasts longer.  But on to the good stuff:  for those who hate the way the ground coffee chamber gets static electricity and you end up with ground coffee all over the counter, the chamber here is smoother (or something) and the problem is probably 10% of what it was with the Cuisinart.  Also, I love the way the ground coffee chamber slides into place with a satisfying little click, as opposed to the Cuisinart, which had to be kind of finessed in and never felt really nice.  I know, weird, but sometimes it's those little indefinable things that make a difference.  And third, I love how this unit can be turned off simply by pushing the power button again.  Say you want to make a slightly stronger pot of coffee.  You can run the setting you have it set for, and then when it shuts off, turn it on for another 10 seconds (for example) and then hit the button again to turn it off.  On the Cuisinart, you had to slide the cups setting all the way to the left, and then pray you put it back in the right place when you wanted to run it again.  I'm very happy with this unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271S7WFFXATU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T6EJS0#wasThisHelpful","R271S7WFFXATU1","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She's got a bunch of YouTube videos, and she's got one of the most beautiful voices around; her style brings very fond memories of another favorite singer, Jane Olivor.

"Perfect for my needs.  I bought two of these for the check-in counters in two of our medical clinics for patient satisfaction surveys.  Know that these are made of very lightweight metal (one corner of one of the boxes I received was bent from shipping, but I easily bent it back).  If just left to stand on a counter they are easily moved around (and carried away, if someone wanted to). But for our needs, they're just fine. They come with screws to mount to a wall if desired (we didn't), and the lockable front door is a nice touch, though again, the box provides absolutely no security, so don't think of using it for a dropbox for carkeys or money.

"I needed a long runner for the area between my kitchen and dining room to protect the threshold where the linoleum meets the carpet. I found this runner for a very fair price.  I had a very difficult time comparing colors, because each runner from this company (House, Home and More) is a separate Amazon page, so it's literally impossible to compare colors side-by-side as you can for, say, a pair of slacks.  I ordered this runner, and when it was received (very timely, I might add), the color was far too light.  I sent the manufacturer an email asking why their products don't make it easier to compare colors, and DeeDee, their representative, emailed me immediately, explaining that when they began selling on Amazon, a company could only show variations of one option, either size OR color.  She went on to say that if I was unhappy with the runner, I could return it for full credit, and order another color more to my liking.  SHE ALSO, WITHOUT ASKING, INCLUDED A MATERIAL RETURN AUTHORIZATION, ready to be printed.  Amazing service!  I have packaged up the runner for return, and I've already ordered a different runner in a more suitable color (and 2 feet longer).  I can't speak to how durable these runners are (though other reviewers have noted they hold up very well) but I can say that the quality, weight and appearance of the runner was very very good, and I'm looking forward to receiving the new one in the new color.

"This is a good little vacuum.  Haven't had it more than a couple of months, so don't know yet about battery life, but so far it's been a really good unit; lightweight, well-made, and versatile with the on/off brush, which not only saves on battery when you don't need it, but makes use on both floors and carpet much easier.  Another bonus to the on/off carpet brush is being able to turn the brush off to vacuum throw rugs, which often will be snagged and the yarn pulled out when cleaned with vacuums with a rotating carpet brush.  Another plus is that it comes with its own stand; many of this style do not.  A negative is that you must remove the handheld 'dust buster' style part of the vacuum to empty the dirt cup, but definitely not a deal breaker.  The price compares with similar units at both Costco and BBB, but this one is the higher voltage (14.4) with the stand; the units I checked at the other two places did not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U5XE9T708KRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LASI48Q#wasThisHelpful","R1U5XE9T708KRZ","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all, I'm a baby boomer, so my most formative years were spent listening to the music featured here.  I had the pleasure of seeing this documentary about 3 years ago at a live screening in Indian Wells, California during the fundraising leg of the journey, where several of the musicians from the 'Wrecking Crew' group toured around the country previewing the film and then hosting a Q/A and autograph session afterward.  For the last 3 years, I've been waiting for these guys to reach their goal of bringing this film to public release and DVD; I've been checking their website monthly to follow their progress, and now I'm thrilled beyond words that I will be able to order a copy for myself as well as copies for a number of friends who also grew up on this music.  The reason for the fundraising drive and the delay in release was due to the huge expense of buying the rights to every single music clip in the film (and there are LOTS of them).  As music can do, the clips of each song brought back very specific memories of my life.  What a great ride this is, to learn how so many of those songs came about.  This documentary is a genuine treat, and will bring a newfound insight and respect for the music we grew up with.As an aside, and in agreement with the other (first) reviewer, I don't understand why Carol Kaye so clearly has a vendetta against the film, which gives her the credit she deserves for her very substantial part in the creation of some of the most memorable songs of the time.  (If you aren't sure what I'm referring to, hunt around a bit on Amazon and you'll see her many, many comments and responses to posts regarding this film.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18EUXVJV6F5N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHJ7F4S#wasThisHelpful","R18EUXVJV6F5N1","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our Labs go through periods where one or both of their ears get pretty nasty and cause them to scratch intensely.  This product is one of several we've tried, and the Virbac is the best we've found.  Not only is it effective at cleaning out the black gooey crud that seems to just appear spontaneously; it doesn't have a strong, offensive chemical smell like some of the similar products; it also clearly doesn't cause pain.  I just reach for the bottle and the guys sit patiently and wait for me to use it.  Here's how I do it:  Shake the bottle well, lift up his ear and squirt a tablespoon or so into the ear, then rub to get the Virback into the bottom of the ear.  Then I use gauze pads to wipe it out (and that's where I can tell how well it's working).  Some instructions say to let the dog just shake his head to shake the stuff out, but I like to wipe it out so I can see the result of the medication and gauge how clean the ear is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI48WCQ1DGW4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056EAKSM#wasThisHelpful","RI48WCQ1DGW4W","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always try to make sure I've got Krew Comb in my bathroom cupboard for when I'm wearing my hair short (crew-cut or flat-top style).  There are periods I totally get away from those styles and wear my hair longer, so I can tell you the stuff doesn't go bad; the last tub I bought was probably about 6 years ago, and I recall I had to buy it from a beauty supply place, so glad it's available here on Amazon.  For those who've never used it, it's a pink paste, about the color of Pepto Bismol and the consistency of a paste car wax.  I put a small bit (about the size of a pea) in my hands and rub them together, then run my hands through my hair.  Krew Comb doesn't dry like a gel, it's dense and makes the hair kind of stiff but still flexible. It's ideal for making a flat top or crew cut stand up, and lends itself well to the 'bed head' look. You can brush it if you wish, but I can't imagine trying to get a comb through it.  It's scentless and washes out with shampoo pretty easily, but without shampooing it can build up in your hair.  I wouldn't recommend it for use with long hair, but for short styles that don't need movement, it's great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMB0CT57MMV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UOVWGY#wasThisHelpful","R2JMB0CT57MMV6","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought two of these carts with the intention of stacking them extra tall (by adding 4 of the 18"" legs from the second cart) so I could stack two microwave ovens in our breakroom.  Once the carts were received (quickly and well-packaged), I realized this wouldn't work, as the leg pieces aren't threaded at both ends, so I had no way to extend the length.  Plan B:  Buy the separate item, a set of four 36"" Alera legs...which I did.  These arrived, and luckily, they ARE threaded at both ends, so I made 54"" legs by connecting the new 36"" legs with 4 of the 18"" legs from the original cart...perfect.  But now comes the reason for my review (and for the 3-star rating).  As other reviewers have noted, the trays on this cart are upside down from every other 'metro'-style wire rack system I've ever owned, which is a fair number of them.  On this particular cart, it's an especially important issue, because when I put the cart together with the microwaves on the shelves, the doors don't open (because the microwave sits down in the 1"" recessed shelves, rather than on top of them).  And no, you can't install the shelves upside down because the corner holes where the poles go through are tapered to be larger at the bottom (a necessary design...the tapered shape keeps the two-piece plastic shelf brackets in place, which give it the strength this type of shelving is noted for).  Yes, I knew this was the design, from reading a number of the other reviews which noted the same issue.  But since this is the only cart which otherwise met my needs, I went ahead anyway.  So now, I have a great 54"" tall rack with 3 shelves, and I've addressed the sunken shelf issue by having some 3/4"" wood shelving cut to fit in the bottom of each of the two shelves; now the microwaves fit nearly flush, and the microwave doors will open without dragging.  Not very elegant, but it works.  Now yes, the reviews (and the photos) showed the shelves mount upside down from every other shelf of this style, and I bought it anyway, because it's the only shelf with these dimensions I could find, but I've given it 3 stars instead of 5 stars because I see the upside-down shelves as a design flaw. I hope Alera takes a look at this issue and corrects their design...it would actually be worth it to me to buy another cart if the shelves were of the more standard design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q7C6HJ84ENDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FDX5IG#wasThisHelpful","R2Q7C6HJ84ENDD","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased these legs to go with the Alera 'Wire shelving 3-tier rolling cart in black anthracite' microwave cart.  I wanted to expand its height and stack two matching microwave ovens for our break room.  (I first bought two of the carts, thinking I could combine the legs together to make one taller cart, but the legs that come with the carts, formed from two 18"" legs which screw together, aren't threaded at the top ends so I was unable to add a third 18"" length).  I purchased this set of 36"" legs on faith, since the vendor I emailed couldn't confirm these were threaded at both ends, but when they arrived today, I was happy to see that they ARE threaded at both ends, and also come complete with the double-male threaded couplers as well as black rubber caps for the tops, and both leveling feet and heavy duty rubber casters for the bottoms (use whichever you prefer).  Two of the casters lock.  Note that these legs are regular matte-finish black, whereas the microwave carts are something called 'Anthracite', which is a two-toned black and gunmetal gray slightly bumpy finish, but when the two finishes are screwed together, not bad looking.  I'm now good to go with 54"" tall legs with casters, and my extra-tall stacking microwave ovens rack is exactly what I was looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7BKTR4N1V2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BUWYC8#wasThisHelpful","R2I7BKTR4N1V2G","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update 1-2-15Because of the issues I note in my review (below) I requested a return authorization, which Amazon forwarded to the company providing the juicer.  I must say that though my personal concerns kept me from loving (and keeping) the juicer, the company's response to my concerns was quick, respectful and very impressive.  After making a few suggestions for adjusting the juicer (which I tried), I replied that I still would prefer to return the juicer for credit.  With no further delay, they processed my credit.  I am very impressed with the seller, and would certainly recommend them if this juicer (or any other product they sell) fits your needs.  Good customer service these days warrants a ""WOW!"".---------------------------------------------Just received this today.  I really wanted to like it more than I do. It has the heavy, industrial look and feel that appears it will perform well and last forever. After squeezing a dozen or so Palm Springs ruby red grapefruit, here's my first-day's review.The good:1.  It does a good job of squeezing all the juice out of these grapefruit.  It lets a lot of the pulp through, where the description says it eliminates pulp and seeds.  (I like pulp, so for me that's a plus, but if you don't like pulp, this might be a negative.)2.  A full-sized grapefruit (cut in half) fits into the hopper, unlike many of the others I checked out on Amazon, most of which noted you would probably have to quarter grapefruit to make them fit.  Grapefruit juicing is one of the things I require in a juicer.3.  Very easy to clean.4.  The rubber feet seem to be protective; no exposed metal to scratch your countertop.5.  A standard 2-cup Pyrex glass measuring cup fits under the spout. Not sure why some other reviewers complain that it only has room for tiny cups.The bad:1.  It's terribly awkward (and I think a little dangerous) to use.  As you bring the lever down with the necessary pressure/weight on it, the juicer tips forward.  The only body mechanics you can use to avoid this is to hold down on the back of the machine while at the same time pressing the handle down.  I'm a pretty big guy, and this ended up being really exhausting after the 12th grapefruit.2.  The end of the handle is not rubberized, it's the same cast iron as the rest of the handle, which is very uncomfortable on the hand.3.  The cone that comes down over the fruit to press it onto the strainer started out centered, but as I used the juicer, the mechanism shifted or torqued somehow so that after the first 6 fruits or so, I had to press it in to align toward the center as I brought the lever down; otherwise, the top piece (the part over the fruit) hit the side of the chamber on the way down.  I used the included allen wrenches to make sure all the fittings were tight, but that didn't help.Considering those three negatives (and the fact I think it's an accident waiting to happen with its tipping-forward issue), I'm not impressed with this juicer and I'm going to return it.Regarding shipping and packaging, its box was squashed in the center, but the juicer itself was fine, protected at each end by styrofoam packing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KI6JXDY1QHIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZJO7JI#wasThisHelpful","R3KI6JXDY1QHIK","A2FMK0SLCHHCW3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FMK0SLCHHCW3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent price and quality.  I get claustraphobic in a sleeping bag, so this is ideal.  I have two now so i can double them up when its colder.  One is plenty for summer camping, but when it dipped into the 50's i found myself becoming a heat leech off my camp mates.  So i got a second one.Great smooth fabric, feels nice on the skin, slides over clothes well, lightweight and warm, but seems to be breathable.I can't recommend this enough.  Would be perfect for kids for sleepovers, for the car, to take to events, packs small, its great.Cons: If it's cold you do have to keep your feet tucked which can be a challenge.  The newer model of this has elastic around the bottom so you can tuck it around the bottom of your sleeping pad.  Great idea.  I, however, was cheap and got this one because its half the price, so i must remain vigilant about keeping the toes tucked.I'm 5'6"" and when it's cold enough the you must keep the toes tucked, this is just long enough for me, so if you're like 6"" you may not want to use this  by itself for cold weather.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QAU02G7MYH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWQLTNE#wasThisHelpful","R8QAU02G7MYH0","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great device.  Use it to watch on your tv anything you can bring up on the google chrome web browser.  Use it to watch you tube and vevo and netflix and hbo and a variety of other things.  Control it from your phone or tablet or computer.  A great way to modernize your (or your smart phone literate parents) tv.  Also good for making your semi-smart tv a fully smart tv.Easy to use, easy to set up, just plug into your tv's hdmi port (also has to be plugged into a power source with the ac adapter unless your tv has a power providing hdmi port which most lack).Great for travel too.  Just plug it in and show movies to your friends and boring relatives.  Use at hotels.  Fun for amazing folks who have no understanding of technology.  (""But where's the movie coming from?"")The one flaw, which I think google will fix eventually, is that you can accidentally (or purposely) log on to other chrome casts.  So if you have several of them in your house you can change other people's movies while they're watching.  (Was I ever annoyed when my roommate turned off the game of thrones season finale) You can also do the same to your neighbors.

"I have a '93 Chrysler town and country with leather squishy seats.  The leather is very hot and then the seats are made too soft so you kinda sink in creating humid and breezless conditions for the crotch and the booty.  Most unpleasant when combined with no air conditioning.  I may be traveling in northern Wisconsin, but a hot summer day in an unairconditioned vehicle with leather seats is the same no matter where you are.  So I ordered 2 of these.  They are very nice, but those two shoulder straps on the cover did't work with my van because my seat has a single head rest bar rather than two small poles holding it.  I think this will work if your headrest is the two metal poles style and it's removeable.  Mine is neither.  So I cut off the straps and luckily they were put on seperately so it didn't fall apart.  I then wove more string into the giant holed beads and tied it to my seat.  Worked very well.  Took a couple hours to do it all, but the job is done and the booty is much cooler.  The beads a comfy to sit on with the exception that I have semi-long semi-curly hair and thesae beaded seat covers pull out long hair, so I've put thin sheet material over the backs of the seats and now all is well.I'd like to say here that leather car upholstry sucks.  If you're considering leather upholstry just don't do it.  It scratches up, it dries up and cracks, it feels terrible whether it's too hot and buring you or not aloowing your backside to breath or freezing you in winter.  Fabric is the way to go.  Also, the leather they use today is much lower quality than what they used in the '93 sweatmobile mentioned above.  It's thinner and much more easily damaged and if you have dark clothes on a light colored leather the color rubs off onto the seat and doesn't come off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7OUIFKB2K3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A96SSM#wasThisHelpful","R1W7OUIFKB2K3U","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have psoriasis stop eating nightshades now! Doing that one thing has made my psoriasis go from red, itchy, scaly, painful, spreading, to flat and smooth and receding.  Recently I went to a Panera resturant and had a bread bowl with brocolli chedddar soup, absolutely delicious.  A day later my psoriasis was back to its' old self and when I checked their website to see the ingredients there were cayenne and paprika proving my nightshade allergy.  Avoiding nightshades is a big pain in the butt, but slack off and your psoriasis will remind you.  Also certain red food dyes (red #40, etc. . .) are made from peppers, so you have to avoid them also.  Tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, tobacco, eggplant.  Potato starch is in everything!  Tomatoes are in everything, paprika is in everything.  And the few things that don't have one of the above have food starch or spices or natural flavorings so you don't know if they have it or not.  I did just find a mayonaise that has no paprika Trader Joe's organic.The book itself is confusing and offer a thousand possibilities of why you might have psoriasis.  However, it's defintely got some things right and I don't know of a better book on the subject (because psoriasis research leads to drug companies offering us drugs with side effects including death and cancer).  It's nearly impossible to do everything it says, and even doing as much as you can will be hard, but food allergies of all kinds are hard.  I've lived with psoriasis for 18 years (since I was 12) and that has been hard.  So as tough as it is avoiding certain foods, it's easier than having psoriasis.  Mine hasn't cleared yet, but I'm certain that it will eventually.  Serious improvement, though.  More than I've seen with anything else.If nothing else wean yourself onto the diet slowly.  If you're like me, you've had it for years, so if it takes you another couple years to clear, at least it's not getting worse.  The book is worth buying.  Give it a try.  Leaving behind all those foods you love will be unpleasant, but when you see clearing and make a mistake and see the damned psorasis start coming back you'll realize just how much you love not having psorasis and you'll sacrfice those foods, not gladly, but you'll do it.Update: November 2009I am still using a few of the tips in this book to control my psoriasis and it's the best it has ever been since I got it.  A note about the book is that what it is is a bunch of ideas of what could be causing your psoriasis.  If you try to do everything it says you'll go insane.  I suggest reading it over then picking one or two things to start with and trying them. Always remember that the healing process takes time.You really do have to stick with it.  I've been avoiding nightshades since before I left the first part of this reveiw, almost a year now.  It's really hard to do, especially if you eat out.  I also did a liver cleanse which was truly awful but worthwhile I think.  I am allergic to nightshades and maybe peanuts and these things were building up in my body for the entire 30 years of my life.  The cleanse made my posriasis much worse for about a month while the toxins released into my body from my dirty liver.  I used milk thistle and apple juice.  Very effective.  Read about milk thistle on wikipedia if you want to learn more.  I did it for 2 weeks, but next time I'd stick to a week at most.If I cheat on my diet my psoriasis tells me about it.  I have not had full clearing, but it is smooth to the touch (unless I get into the cayenne or paprika which is in everything), it's not red, not scaly, rarely itchy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVSIKVEXH709/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0470267267#wasThisHelpful","R2UVSIKVEXH709","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Poor quality.  The lighting is so dark that at many points you're taking it on faith that the people are still in the shot.  Boring and oddly graphic (a man slices a woman's naked breast and other such things).  I ended up fast forwarding through much of it.  The plot is weak and very boring.  The Candy Tangerine man is not a good actor (neither is anyone else in the movie), and he's not as good looking as the script pretends he is.There is a preview for a movie called Dolomite before it that looks potentially at least a little better than this one.  That preview was my favorite part of this movie.  Dolomite has an army of ladies who do his fighting for him.  There's also a sex scene in the preview that looks very real, like maybe he just set up a camera in his bedroom at home with his gf/wife.

"The necromonger plot is not really my cup of tea.  What is my cup of tea is Vin Diesel as Riddick quietly and calmy killing a prison guard with a tea cup.  I own this movie and watch it for things like that.  I love the character Riddick which I can't imagine anyone playing better.  He's not cocky, he's just confident.  I love how he kills the prison guard sitting on his chest.  So quietly and quickly, then gives a little shrug to the mercenaries.  Very cool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9TUL7NEYGKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002VEUV2#wasThisHelpful","RH9TUL7NEYGKB","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wouldn't have thought a book about stoves would be such interesting reading, but this really is a good book.  I bought it in hopes that I'd be able to attempt to build a stove myself.  That did not happen, in fact I'm not even sure what type of stove I'd like.  However, the book has increased my faith in a wood stove keeping my home comfortable, and be environmentally sound.  I liked the writing style, which is pretty rare for a book of this type.  There were times when I couldn't put it down. Honestly, I was on this page again to sell my book, but now I find I'm not ready to let it go, so I'm writing a review instead.While it is old and could probably be updated, the art of the wood stove is also old, so much of the most valuable information may be old as well.  Certainly, history has a lot of lessons to teach us about masonry stoves.  Also, the book talks about past mistakes of masonry stoves, so if you're thinking about building your own, this would be good reading.Update: I am now building a house and will be having a masonry stove installed.  The book says it's hard to find a master stove builder but now there are many throughout the country, I've found one right here in my small town.  Also a masonry stove has benefit over a wood stove because you can get insurance if you have a masonry stove because it qualifies as a fireplace and thus is less risky to an insurance company than a wood stove.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LPBDMSQGGL1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890132098#wasThisHelpful","R3LPBDMSQGGL1Z","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's a fairly fun game, but I'm going to have to play it muted.  The drivers and the passengers say things constantly, like every two seconds and they each only have like five lines, so they reapeat themselves about every ten seconds or so.  It's very annoying.  The constant advertising for levi's, pizza hut, KFC, and others is disturbing.  I can't belive the game designers thought that was acceptable.  Also, the music sucks.

"I bought this to play on my new Wii because I never did buy a gamecube, and man was I ever let down.  I have a SNES system pretty much just for the original mariokart.  It's great, it's something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults.  Double dash is so infantile it sickens me!  The battlemode options are terrible!  Who wants to play on top of a gamecube?  That's the most uninspired thing I've ever seen!  And other venues such as cookie land?  I wanted to see sequels to the original, advances in the game but the same basic concept.  This game is for kids much like the N64 version, look toward the gameboy DS for a better mariokart. A serious let down.

"This is not an appropriate gift for your schizophrenic uncle who has trouble telling reality from fiction.  Max Brooks has written this book like it's a true threat that we should all be getting prepared for.  His phrasing is both unsettling and hilarious.  It's not often I've felt those two emotions together.  I keep telling myself the threat isn't real, but still I think it's time to get started building a reinforced concrete wall 10 feet high around my property so I'll be ready for at least a class two zombie attack.  But every night I'll lie in bed worrying.  What if it moves to class three and the bodies of my former friends and neighbors who have now become zombies pile up until they form a wriggling undead ramp.  Then I'll wish the wall had been twenty or thirty feet high to give me more time.  Maybe I could add a metal framework and weld a rebar mesh over the top.  Then I'd sleep soundly with my earplugs in so the moans of the undead as they hunt won't drive me insane.  I'm lucky to have received this book from a caring friend before it was too late.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMXITZIZ7P5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400049628#wasThisHelpful","R1VMXITZIZ7P5Z","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had trouble sleeping because of background noise for years.  I finally bought this because I live in a duplex and my neighbors are loud and erratic in behavior, arguing and moving furniture around at 3:00 am.  I was afraid to even try to sleep at home after several days with little sleep and my roommate made me buy this because I was ready to move out.This product is great.  It makes a very fan-like sound, but with no mechanical or cycling sounds, or rattling.  This is just a constant whoosh.  It has two speeds and you can change the sound of the whoosh by changing the postition of the vent holes on the device.  It has a switch right on the side of it, not on the cord so it's easy to use.  It's even padded on the bottom to make sure it doesn't vibrate.I used the low setting last night and slept through the night for the first time in the month since the crazy animals downstairs moved in.I've been relying on ceiling fans and box fans for background noise for years, this is much better.  It's a fuller sound, it covers more, and it doesn't make me cold.As many others have said in previous reviews, this is unlike those pre-recorded white noise sounds.  This cannot repeat, because it's actually making the sound as you hear it.I travel for a living and stay in a lot of hotels.  I look forward to taking this thing with me and blocking out the sounds of neighbor's TV's and talking and vehicles, etc. . . It's very small and lightweight, and seems durable.I don't know why I didn't buy this sooner. Shooting my neighbors is the only thing that would help me sleep better, but this is legal so perhaps a better choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CW1NEQLTI3Y2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007XJWYA#wasThisHelpful","R3CW1NEQLTI3Y2","A3Q323MZNVU1PJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3Q323MZNVU1PJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Young people and smartphones seem inseparable, so it's about time young adults get a book that explore life without a device. In a tale in which a group of early teens are deprived of their technology and dumped on a remote desert island, P.D. Quaver spins a story for young adults that works on all cylinders. As a novel for young people from late elementary to middle school, she manages to tell a unlikely story of a school which is supposed to help kids free themselves of technology and a group of kids who have been put in the school. The school is a front and the kids are kidnapped and taken to a desert island. Quaver pulls off the suspension of disbelief part perfectly, and the get that thrill going in the young reader. If you do get this book for a young person in their life, don't let it be lost on them that they are reading it on a Kindle. Perhaps Quaver will offer a paperback edition. That would make an extra emphasis on the life-without-technology-angle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q9HDC6FRMY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J6HIGE0#wasThisHelpful","R3Q9HDC6FRMY6","A1QNX8YY704IX1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QNX8YY704IX1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alice is a woman who is tired of her life. She owns a business but struggles to keep up. She is in a relationship with a guy named Robin but the pair are mostly annoyed with each other. Combine this with a secret past and a person from that part of Alice's life coming back into the picture, and thus comes together the plot of this romance novel. Much of the beginning focuses on the dynamics of Alice's relationships, especially her relationship with her twenty-two year old daughter Skye. One of the sub-plots of the novel revolves around her daughter and whether there was a mix up at the hospital. Alice isn't sure Skye is her biological daughter. However, the two are close and Skye tries to get her mother to open up and try news things.This is how Alice makes it onto a cooking game show which is where the real romance and plot twists begin. There she meets someone who helps her expand her business and also offers her much more. But Alice is torn between several men and her struggle with her past. Not to give anything away, I'll say the story becomes an engaging exploration into the conflicts and passions of a woman with much potential she need to discover for herself.""Dawn Any Minute"" has a solid narrative, distinct characters and a creative plot. It's rich on dialogue which in the first part of the book can sometimes devolve into more bickering than is needed to show the family dynamic.

"A powerful read that explains why the fallout from the mortgage collapse five years has not finished and may only be just beginning. As if putting off the inevitable, the author outlines how hidden have been the practices of many banks, and much of it is only now being discovered, putting the government in a position of unwittingly helping disguise the level of fraud while not understanding how the banks operate.

"Ugh.. these guys have really F'd up Boraxo hand soap. Can't any company leave well enough alone anymore? I've used Boraxo soap to clean my hands after working in the garage for over 40 years. Luckily, my Dad had a couple of large boxes of the original Boraxo hand soap that I used as a teenager and he was kind enough to give me one last time I visited him. Oh man, it brought back so many fond memories. I used it around the house to wash my hands every day and even turned my girlfriend onto it; she loved it and started using it in the shower in place of her normal body wash.Okay, so I thought, ""terrific"", I will just switch over to this soap. So, naturally we ordered some from Amazon. They showed a normal hand soap and also a ""pro"". I didn't want the new ""pro"" version, so I placed an order for the regular one. Nope, amazon sent the pro one. Ugh, it was awful. Horrible perfume smell and small ""rocks"" that don't dissolve when you wash your hands. WTF?I went back and compared it against the soap my Dad gave me. It completely dissolves when you apply water. Leaves your hands spotless - removes any odors and doesn't leave any scent of its own. Compared to the new stuff by Dial, it's no contest. The new stuff is horrible. It leaves grit, which you have to rinse away and leaves some godawful smell.Okay, okay, no problem. I'll just check out the local hardware store and find the old stuff.Nope...So apparently Dial has the market sown up on Boraxo soap I guess. So I call them and ask if I can get the old stuff? Nope, sorry. They explain they added more perfume to it, blah, blah, blah. The woman on the phone said I was the second call that day complaining about it. Yeah, great.. maybe they can change it back. I explained to her that they are missing a bet, because natural is in and this soap is amazing stuff - if they would just go back to making it how they did back in the 60's and 70's. Who know if any of that information will get up the food chain.All I can tell you is they have taken an amazing product and messed around with it until it's so terrible that I don't even want to have it in my home, under any circumstances. I sent it back to amazon. I did visit the store hoping I might find something; I found the Boraxo laundry additive. At least it doesn't have the horrible perfume, but it leaves grit that is just as bad as the professional version of the hand soap.Someone at Dial needs to get on the stick and realize that people no longer what perfumes and chemicals all over their homes, clothes, hands and bodies. Make your product like you used to and I will buy it. This new Boraxo hand soap blows...","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30LQB6ER7QWKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JESDPE#wasThisHelpful","R30LQB6ER7QWKE","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, the compartment where the battery goes doesn't accept all 9 volt batteries. It's a super tight fit.

"I wanted to like these, but... there were some things which resulted in returning them. I actually ordered 4 sets (3/8 and 1/2, each in SAE and metric). Returned them all to amazon for a refund for the following reasons:1. Finish is sort of dry and rough, not black and smooth like some of the other impact sockets I own. Feels very ""made in china""2. While the sockets are clearly marked, they only have what appears to be surface ink or silk screen sizes. There is not imprinted size on the socket itself, so I have to wonder what would happen when this paint or ink is warn off through use? You would be left with sockets that have absolutely no mark. The sizes are not etched, only printed.3. A couple of the sockets had printing that wasn't straight; it was crooked and looked terrible.4. While it was nice to receive a plastic case (and the case itself is rather nice), I noticed that the sockets didn't fit back into their areas properly. They were too close, so if you removed one socket to use it, then went to put it back, it nudged the two on either side and caused them to bump up and out of their holders. So the only way to correct this was to then take every socket farther down the line out and put it back in without the one to the right present. This finally corrected the ""not fitting back into its spot"" problem, but as you can imagine, it would be time consuming when using the sockets.Overall, this kit is fair value for the money. However, the quality just seemed a little sub-par to me. The number imprinting could have been etched or something, as just the painting on that was done didn't look like it would last long to me. I think also having a case which accepted the sockets without interference would have been nice as well.Normally I buy Neiko brand, but decided to try Tekton for a change. Probably won't do that again based on my experience here as compared to the very nicely designed Neiko stuff.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMGWK11WY0UD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9Y1LAU#wasThisHelpful","R2FMGWK11WY0UD","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, the consistency of this soap seems like it's cut with something other than pure Borax - the original soap that I was used to using was very consistent as far as granule size, while this stuff has very large particles which don't work as well in my opinion.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZ22ECOGX9GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BPGSFA#wasThisHelpful","R1JZ22ECOGX9GR","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This ratchet is just okay. The operation/feel is decent, but the quality of the metal used on the ratchet switch seems a bit low budget to my eye. If you compare the overall design of the head on this ratchet to most others, it seems way over-sized and thus cheap feeling. The ratchet action is acceptable, but nothing high quality feeling.If I had picked this item up in a store, where I could see and touch it first hand, I doubt I would have spent the money on it. Since I ordered it via amazon, it arrived and it's decent enough to keep, but I am not exactly jumping for joy over it.I think if I had it to do over again, I would buy two ratchets at the hardware store and then do some cutting and TIG welding to fashion something a bit more sleek and slim than the Motion Pro item here. Also, it's worth noting that the T-handle really feels more like it's a 3/8 size and then they have inserted a 1/4 drive in place of the 3/8 size. I'm not sure if that's really the case or not, but it seems like it's just a 3/8 size ratchet with a 1/4 drive swapped into place.Overall, I would give it 3 out of 5 stars. This tool certainly won't be winning any design awards any time soon, but if you are accustomed to buying your tools at Harbor Freight, then you may be happy with the purchase. If you are used to higher end stuff, don't get your hopes up too much on this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMVMQY15D1TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GTV15I#wasThisHelpful","R3QMVMQY15D1TW","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I was a kid, I used to watch this TV show called ""Land of the Giants"". As I recall, it was about this group of space travelers who left earth in their space ship, then returned only to discover that they had some how magically been shrunk down to a few inches tall; as a result everything in the world was now super sized to them.When I received my Neiko 36"" bolt cutters in the mail, this is exactly how I felt.When I say these are huge, that's exactly what I mean. I had previously had a set of 24"" H.K. Porter bolt cutters from Home Depot, which these replaced. I thought the HK cutters were pretty big, but I could probably use the Neiko 36"" cutters to slice right through those. The Neiko 36"" one are massive and well made. When they are totally open, the jaws look like they are over 3/4"" wide at the tips. And the jaws are just huge, like the size of your hand huge. I mean, seriously heavy duty and massive. As soon as I finish this review, I'm going to have to buy a set of these same bolt cutters in the 24-inch size, just to have something more rational in size to use for day to day stuff around the shop.But if an M1A1 tank ever breaks down outside my house, these will definitely come in handy!So when people say in their reviews that these bolt cutters cut through a master lock ""like butter"", they are't joking around. The jaws on these bolt cutters are so large it looks like they could cut through not just the shackle on a master lock, but probably cut the lock itself in half without too much difficulty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TKSQU8P8O2IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JIKDCS#wasThisHelpful","R1TKSQU8P8O2IG","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't think I would like this measuring cup as much as I do. I purchased it for use with my espresso machines - specifically for pulling shots which then have to be poured carefully into milk, etc. The cup is a very nice size (smaller than I expected, which is good actually). It's about the size of a traditional ceramic espresso cup (think Peet's coffee). It's a touch larger and can easily hold two shots.I like that it has marks on the size and have actually started using it to calibrate the shot volume on some of my machines. It's not very good to drink directly out of (due to the pour spout), but it's great when it comes to pouring shots or any small volume of liquid, etc.I wish it didn't cost $13 via Amazon Prime, but what the heck; you only live once :) It works great and is a well made, classy little addition to the coffee cups, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV5HGJUYPQBYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GZYTIW#wasThisHelpful","RV5HGJUYPQBYG","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This oil was recommended by a local race shop for my Yamaha R1. I had been using Motul 5100 and liked it. I contacted Motul directly and spoke with their service department. I ended up going with 10W40 300v during a rebuild of the bike. After having used the bike on the road with this oil, I'm really impressed with how smoothly the gear box shifts. Also, this is a double ester oil, which helps the oil stick to the surfaces; this helps protect the motor at start up, etc. As long as you don't push the oil much past 3000 miles on the street, I think running 300v is worth the extra money for the protection is provides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX7XGLP81P3R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VJPUNW#wasThisHelpful","RX7XGLP81P3R8","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the Tachyon OPS HD camera via Amazon to use on my motorcycle helmet while riding. The camera is nicely made, but does require you buying a separate MicroSD card. I purchased a 32 gig MicroSD card - each 4 gigs is said to record up to 1 hour.The camera and accessories supplied are all very nice. I powered up the camera and did a test recording or two. I immediately noticed the sound was not there - only very few seconds I would hear a faint blip of sound. I tried resetting the unit and powering it on/off - no luck. A few more test recordings and the same thing. Oh well...One thing I did notice (at least indoors) is that the video quality is really poor. It looks like something out of a 7-11 security video or something. Granted, it might be better outdoors in direct sunlight, but due to the camera having an audio issue, I didn't get that far.Thankfully, amazon prime makes returns easy to deal with. I boxed the camera back up and returned it to amazon for a refund.As much as I like the size and construction, I think I'll probably avoid going with Tachyon again. For one, their website is a bit confusing and after a negative experience (as well as the poor video quality), I think I'll probably look for something else. The price was right, but the quality of the video and audio problems give me pause.It's a shame too, because I really did like the one button operation of the camera.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NOP6TDYGGJ9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UBRQJ2#wasThisHelpful","R2NOP6TDYGGJ9Q","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the arrow T50 staples in both 1/4 and 3/8 inch sizes. Unfortunately, my staples were put into a box with little thought to the journey ahead. With very little packing and no means to keep the staples from sliding out of their boxes, my shipping box arrived sounding like it was full of marbles. When I opened the box, I discovered that both packages of T50 staples had come open; this resulted in all the staples breaking apart and mixing up during shipping.I was able to separate the 1/4 size from the 3/8 size, but it was a little disappointing that so many of the long staple rows broke into smaller sections. I ended up having to throw away about 5% of the staples ordered, as the broken sections were too small to really load into my staple gun. I also ended up stepping on one of the loose staples that fell out of the box, but luckily it went into my shoe, instead of my daughter's bare feet or something.If Amazon could do something to help keep the boxes secure during shipping, I think that would be a great help - perhaps some tape or maybe shrink wrap or something alone those lines might be helpful.If you do order this product, just be aware that there is a potential for the boxes to slide open during transit (and be careful of loose staples if you have kids or pets, etc.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z32RUQ149OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RUN3WK#wasThisHelpful","R2Z32RUQ149OV","A1I1I1HKW8LNUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I1I1HKW8LNUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this bridge in hopes of solving the intonation problem I was having with the stock tune-o-matic bridge on my Epiphone Les Paul Special II LTD. I have Ernie Ball Classic pure nickel .009-.042 strings on it, and the intonation was always sharp on the first three strings, even with the tune-o-matic saddles all the way at the end of their travel. I also had a problem with the G string sounding flat and squawky, and I believe that was related to the saddle because I could loosen the string, wiggle the saddle a little, then re-tighten the saddle and the string would sound normal again for a day or two before going dead again.So, first things first. This solved my intonation problem. I know I probably didn't really need a roller bridge to get more travel on the saddles, but I figured that I could also help lengthen string life by taking away the sharp edge of the tune-o-matic style bridge at the same time. It works for that purpose, but it took some extra work.The first problem I had was that some of the rollers wouldn't actually roll! I used a bit of tri-flow and a pair of needlenose pliers to get them going, and they now work for the most part but I really had to crank on them with the pliers to get them moving and a couple of them still don't spin as freely as I would expect. I discovered that the rollers are not black chrome, but actually just painted brass. This begs the question, why did they bother painting them? If you want a roller saddle bridge for use with some kind of tremolo, I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere because these rollers don't work well. They are working for my non-tremolo guitar just fine, but I won't be actually using the rollers much.The next problem I had was the post size. Now, I know that Gibson bridge posts are smaller than those by Epiphone, but based on some of the other reviews I was under the impression that the included posts should screw right in to the threads in my guitar body. That is not the case. The threaded portion of the included posts is a larger diameter than those on my Epi. As a result, I was left with two options. I could either try to pop out the original thread inserts from the guitar body or I could pull out the Dremel and chase out the post holes on this bridge to make it work with my original posts. I chose the latter because I couldn't justify hacking into my guitar and risking permanent damage for the sake of this experiment. So, I chased out the holes to fit my posts and it is working but if you look closely it is fairly obvious that I am not a machinist.With all of that said, I am giving this bridge three stars because of the problem with the rollers and not because of the modifications I had to make for it to work on my Epi. The rollers are their primary function, and that function does not work well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HJATEJ6D8WSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092LWHI6#wasThisHelpful","R1HJATEJ6D8WSG","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, I just got this game a couple of days ago and I will come back and update this review after I have more time to play it. However, I wanted to note some things about installation and my first impressions before they slipped my mind.INSTALLATIONIn my case, I already had Steam installed on my computer from an Age of Empires game I used to play years ago. I had not used it in a long time, so I opened Steam and updated it before even messing with the Rocksmith installation. After that was done, I installed Rocksmith from the CD. It seemed to install fine, but it only took about 20 minutes, which seemed much shorter than what I had read about in other reviews. I also noted that the desktop icon and the program information in Steam said it was ""Rocksmith Demo."" It also only had three songs available, no guitarcade, and lots of missing features compared to what I had read in other reviews. As it turns out, the way I did the installation I actually did install a demo version that needed to be activated to get the rest of the features. There is an activation code printed on the insert inside the game case, and you have to go into the Steam program and find the menu option to activate a game. Then, just enter that code and it will download the full version of the game. The download took almost three hours on a hard-wired cable internet connection with a download speed of about 600kbps.GAME PLAYI have a real limited experience here so far, but my first impression is that the game is going to be both fun and educational in time, but right now it is a little overwhelming. I have only rehearsed a couple of songs so far, but I have done them several times and the game automatically makes it more difficult every time you rehearse it. I have to try to figure out a way to turn down the difficulty or turn back the progression because both of those songs have now become completely unplayable at their current difficulty progression. I also messed around with the Ducks game, which just seems like a creative way to exercise scales and fretboard memorization. I think this is going to be a great tool, and it is also fun to play. However, the mini games of it are short and just like the song rehearsals it seems that the difficulty progresses too quickly if you keep playing. It would be nice if you could pick a difficulty limit for that game or select a longer game time to use it as more of a repetitive exercise tool. I still have a lot of work to do to find my way around in the game and figure out all the features, but again I want to mention that it does seem overwhelming at first.UPDATE 5/16I tried playing the game again last night. Once again I was stumbling and getting lost, especially when the notes were moving up the fret board. I decided to just erase my previous progress and start all over with a new profile. Then I discovered a valuable tool: the Riff Repeater. It is in the song menu, and it gives you several different options for playing portions of songs at various speeds. I chose free speed, which means that the song will go full speed until you miss a note, then it stops completely and waits for you to play that note. I also discovered something very important that the game is not entirely clear about. On the noteway (area where notes are coming toward you), there are four highlighted blue tracks. These four tracks correspond to where you should have your fingers stationed above the fretboard, and when the highlighted spot moves to a different area that means you should also move your fingers to the corresponding frets. To play along with the game properly, it seems really important that you should use all four fingers in the correct positions according to which tracks on the noteway are highlighted blue. This made a HUGE difference, and changed the game from impossible to merely challenging. I actually discovered this, along with some good tips about strumming and hand positioning from a Youtube Guitarsmith tutorial. So, if you just get the feeling that your hands are not in the right position or it seems impossible to keep up with the position changes, I highly recommend going over to Youtube and watching the Guitarsmith tutorial by Andy Schiller.By the way, just to warn others, if you buy songs from the store it seems that sometimes they will not have the same single note and chord playing options that the stock songs come with. I downloaded the Santana song pack, and from what I can tell it seems that chord playing is the only option for those songs. If I just looked at it wrong or missed the single note mode somehow, someone please let me know.For now, I am leaving my review at four stars because I still think the game is lacking in that it doesn't give adequate instructions about finger positioning.UPDATE 5/22After a week playing this game, I have noticed a HUGE difference in my guitar skill, both in and out of the game. The game successfully challenged me and took me out of my comfort zone. It forced me to learn things that I had just assumed were too advanced for my skill level (slides, bends, hammer-ons and pull-offs, double stops). This game was less than the cost of one private lesson at the local guitar shop and it was money well spent. I am upgrading my review to five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JCODJT7XEM16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004S5TDUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JCODJT7XEM16","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently opened up my guitar case for the first time in seven years. The Elixir strings that were on it were still playable, but they sounded dull and the G string was starting to show some corrosion. I can't remember if it was a forum comment or the reviews here that gave me the idea to try these strings, but I like them. I also can't remember what gauge my old Elixir strings were, but these are much more playable and they give off a nice warm tone from my old Epiphone guitar. I think I will stick with these from now on. One thing I should note is that the high E string broke when I was trying to stretch it the first time. That is not the string's fault, I think I just overdid it with the stretching. I replaced it with a plain steel string and that is working fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1CKITANYHOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E3CHC#wasThisHelpful","R3I1CKITANYHOI","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To put it right out there, this is a nice looking coffee maker and that is what you are paying for: looks. I wanted a coffee maker to match the other red appliances in our kitchen and this thing is gorgeous. However, you are paying a lot extra for a bare minimum of functionality with this unit. There is no timer. The on/off switch feels clunky. The LED to let you know it is on is very dim and hard to see. The water chamber is narrow and you have to be careful when pouring water in to avoid spilling elsewhere. About the only thing extra you get with this is a permanent filter, but I don't think that really justifies the extra cost. If I had the choice again, I would probably buy a more sturdy and better-built coffee maker for less money instead of just paying for high-priced clothing on something that should only cost a third of the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLC8PXF5G7KUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DIR32DO#wasThisHelpful","RLC8PXF5G7KUC","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, let me say that I have exceptionally high water pressure in my home, so maybe that is the thing that killed these filters. The filter that came with my faucet mount was supposed to be good for 200 gallons. When it hit 8 gallons, it automatically jumped up to reading 35 gallons and the water started tasting like regular tap water. I really liked the look and feel of that faucet mount, and I was just hoping that the included filter was just a dud. I decided to give it another chance with these replacement filters. Unfortunately, I had no better luck with these. One of them only lasted 3 gallons before the water started tasting unfiltered again, one only lasted 13 gallons, and the third one actually cracked open. I am very disappointed. I have since then switched to a Tap Master unit that sits on the ledge of the sink and only attaches to the faucet by a hose. It has worked much better.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5JQ7ELBBP5M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00799HEHW#wasThisHelpful","R5JQ7ELBBP5M3","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We moved in to an all-electric townhouse recently, and I felt the pain of that all-electric setup when I got the $300 electric bill for our first month there! So, I was on an immediate mission to save energy wherever I could. One of the things I noticed was that both the intake and output pipes on the electric water heater were hot to the touch. Those hot pipes sitting out in the exposed air translate to wasted energy. So, I wrapped them with this tape. The tape sticks well and does a great job of insulation. So far, in the three weeks since I got that monster electric bill, I have managed to trim our usage by about 30%, and I am sure that insulating those pipes was one of the factors that helped.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI5UBF1R5VAJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AZYTGA#wasThisHelpful","RI5UBF1R5VAJV","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used the 500-light set of these along the back fence of our small townhouse patio. The fence is probably about 15 feet long and 5 feet tall. I ran the light string from top to bottom going along the whole fence, with about six inches between each lap. There was enough length to cover the whole fence in this fashion, and even a few feet extra to string through a small tree at the corner of the fence. Instead of putting the solar charger in the ground, I tie-wrapped the stake to the top of the fence and that must have been a good location because the lights stay on all night. They come on as soon as the sun goes down (around 7:00 right now), and are still on at 6:00 the next morning. In fact they don't go off at all until the ambient light sensor sees sunlight. They don't provide a whole lot of light.

"First and foremost, it works. My 18-month-old daughter has a problem with thin hair that gets dry and frizzy very easily in our climate. This stuff solved the problem. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is just too greasy to use as a leave-in conditioner but it works well as a rinse-out. If I had to complain about anything, it would just be that it takes a whole lot of this conditioner to work on a small amount of hair.

"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...fool me twice...fool me twice you can't get fooled again!I have been through two of these units and I will never buy another Pur product again. The first one sprung a leak within the first month. The leak was around the connection point where it attaches to the faucet. It started as a small trickle that was no more than a nuisance, but within a week the trickle turned to a spray that was too big to ignore or even work with.Since this was the only faucet filter offered at the local OSH store, I made the mistake of getting another one. The second one started locking up within the first couple weeks. It would occasionally stop flowing water from the regular aerator side, like a valve was locked up. Of course, the locking up problem continued to get worse until it got to a point where it wouldn't flow water through the aerator side at all. I could still get filtered water, but for the regular faucet we would have to completely disconnect this unit.That is enough, and I feel like a complete sucker for buying two of these cheap units. I should have come to Amazon and read reviews on all of them first.

"We recently moved into a rental townhouse that has very old in-wall radiant heating. After receiving a $300 electric bill for the first month, I realized we would need to come up with some other solution for heating.

I have not received another electric bill yet, but we have a smart meter and can check our usage daily through the Edison website.

The only reason I give four stars instead of five is that the elastic cinch cord is rather useless. Because the cover is so thick and heavy, the cord just stretches without forcing the cover to tighten around the bottom at all. So, I don't even use the cinch cord. Thankfully, I live in southern California, where we are not likely to see much challenging weather, and I do believe that the cover will stay put just fine without using the cinch cord.

We have only been using it for about a week now, but she doesn't wake up in the middle of the night anymore, and she doesn't get up an hour or two early anymore.

"I must include the disclaimer that I haven't actually sat on this seat yet, so if it somehow ends up being uncomfortable I will downgrade my review later.The primary reason that I was ordering this seat was to accommodate a poorly designed toilet. When the toilet tank lid is properly aligned, the lip of the lid is directly above the seat mounting holes. That means that the seat can never be raised to 90 degrees. As a man, this presents a unique problem that my wife would never notice. The cheap plastic lid that we had on there just wouldn't stay up unless I slid the tank lid back to create more room. That, of course, looked ugly, and was something that my wife just wouldn't tolerate. So, she kept putting the tank lid back to normal and I kept sliding it back so the seat would stay up. We had a real battle of wills going on in the bathroom!Anyhow, this seat solved that whole problem. The seat still doesn't lift all the way to 90 degrees, but it doesn't matter. It stays put at about 85 degrees, and won't close without a little tap. Then, it closes softly and quietly.

"Our living room is is decorated in earth tones, and I ordered this area rug just hoping that it would tie in without the dark brown being too overwhelming. I was pleasantly surprised! The picture does not do justice to the color variation shown in this rug. The tan stripes are much more prominent than the picture would have you believe. It ties in to our living room perfectly, and it is also a very sturdy rug. When it is rolled up, it stays firm rather than collapsing like some of the K-Mart and Ross rugs we have had over the years. If you are thinking about buying this rug, do yourself a favor and look at the zoomed in view. That will give you a much better idea of the overall look of it than the picture of the whole rug.

"I stumbled on to this box and to XBMC quite by accident. I was simply searching for a low-end HTPC to get us by while we wait for the homeowner's association to approve a satellite antenna. At this price, I had to at least try it. So far, it is working for its intended job, but the use is just a little cumbersome. Details below. Overall, I would recommend this box if you need an entertainment solution and you cannot afford one of the slim-profile HTPC's that are now available. I would also recommend it if you need portability. If you can afford a true Windows HTPC and don't mind leaving it hooked up to one TV, I would say just go that route and install the Windows XBMC version on that HTPC.HARDWAREThis works out pretty well most of the time, but a couple of times I have had to unplug and re-plug the G-Mouse II receiver because it failed to pair with the mouse, even after going through the pairing procedure in the directions. Also, when the mouse goes into sleep mode it automatically re-enables the air mouse function when you wake it back up. This is a bit of a pain because much of XBMC is easier to navigate with the directional button instead. Also, it seems that you have to turn off the air mouse to get the video menu to go away while you are watching a video. Otherwise, it will keep popping back up. Even with the mouse function disabled I sometimes have to hit the ""back"" button on the remote three or four times to finally get the video menu to disappear. The mouse pointer does not disappear with the mouse function turned off, so you always have to wait for it to fade out on its own. Also, the keyboard side of the G-Mouse doesn't work well. It sometimes misses key clicks, and since it is not in a true QWERTY layout, I end up having to look up at the screen after each key press, then looking back down at the remote for the next letter. I may just end up switching to a good old logitech wireless mouse and keyboard setup, as I think that would be easier than this compact solution. As far as the actual box goes, it is nice and compact (probably about 6"" square by 2"" tall), and I like the fact that it has both HDMI and composite outputs. Because of that, I can use it on the big LCD tv in our living room, or any of the old CRT televisions in our bedrooms and it is very easy to move around. It also has Wi-Fi so I can literally use this box anywhere in the house, or I could even take it to a friend's house if the occasion should arise.XBMCI had never even heard of XBMC before I found this box, but since it took about a week to arrive I had some time to play with it on other devices. I installed it on my Android phone, my daughter's Android tablet, and my Windows 7 desktop. If you have also never heard of XBMC, do yourself a favor and watch some of the tutorials on Youtube, as those have been a tremendous help. The overall concept of XBMC is great. If you are a patient enough person to find good working sources for your regular shows and the movies you would like to see, and if you know the schedule of all your shows well enough to know exactly when they air, then you could very well use XBMC as a cable replacement. I am not patient enough for that, and I have been using a DVR box for so long that I don't even know when most of my shows air, so I don't know when to look for a new episode on XBMC. I guess I still miss the convenience of having a DVR box that automatically records my shows and puts them in one place for me, and I will be looking forward to having my satellite installed so I can get back to using one. I will still use XBMC to look for movies and older TV series after that, however, and it may very well be a true replacement for Netflix. I have been able to easily find any shows that Netflix carries on XBMC, including Netflix original series. As far as the difference between the Windows and Android versions of the software, they are functionally the same but the Windows version does seem to run more smoothly for some reason. Perhaps because this software was originally designed for a Microsoft system?ANDROIDI have not used much on the Android side of this system, but I can verify that Netflix and Gmail work. That being said, the Android version of Netflix is meant for a touch screen and it is a pain to navigate on this system. I probably won't ever use it, and I really don't have much need to surf the web or check email on my television, not when I can already do all of that on my phone. I think I just convinced myself to set this box to always boot into XBMC. If you want to use Android apps on your television, then this box is definitely the answer for you. Just be aware that Android apps are designed for a touch screen and navigating some of them with an air mouse is going to be clunky.OVERALLMy overall impression of this box is three stars. It works as a way to get free entertainment if you don't mind the cumbersome nature of navigating it. Ultimately, I think it is going to be relegated to occasional use for a movie or show that I cannot find elsewhere, and if I had the decision to make over again I probably would have bought a slim HTPC and installed XBMC on that instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9KYLKPER1FR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GR30TAA#wasThisHelpful","R3B9KYLKPER1FR","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the most basic thermostat on the market, and I bought it to replace the very same model that the landlord had in our condo. I would have waited for the landlord to replace it, but at this cheap price it was faster and easier for me to take care of it myself. The problem with the old one was that the relay had stiffened up with time and we had to turn the temperature way above what we really wanted to get it to even come on, then the condo would get way too hot because of the high temperature setting. That means that, to avoid waking up in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat, we basically didn't use the heat at night. The new one works as it should, but because we already had a problem with the same model I am not convinced of its longevity. If this were my house and not a rental, I would put in something better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVAEUFWKGB43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BP7ZFW#wasThisHelpful","RJVAEUFWKGB43","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:We took a road trip from the California coast to eastern Arizona with this thing, and it held up ok enough that I don't feel like I need to lower the rating on it, but there are a couple of things I should mention. The plastic support piece to use with narrow bars slid loose a bit over the course of our trip and made a constant noise. I probably won't be using that piece again. Also, the mounting plates all bent, so I know that I had the carrier mounted down tight enough. The plastic support pieces are just another example of poor design work. Also, since the mounting plates bent I am going to have to reinforce them with unistrut or bar stock before using this carrier again. If I had any kind of plans to keep this mounted for any kind of regular use I would return it and get a hard case. We only take one road trip a year, and with some modifications I can make this work for that. However, I would NOT recommend this carrier to others. Just get a hard case or a rooftop bag. This attempt at a hybrid between the two was a great idea, but poorly implemented.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have not even taken this thing out on the road yet and it already only gets three stars! I don't do this lightly, and I usually write decent product reviews following well-researched purchases. I am sorry to admit that this thing fooled me.First of all, let me say that I bought this for two primary reasons:1. It is cheap.2. It can collapse down when not in use.It still passes muster for those two items, or I wouldn't even be giving it three stars. I can also add that it does look nice and tidy when it is folded down. I was able to tuck all the straps under the cover, and that is nice.However, there are some serious problems with material design and quality control at this company. Here is a list of the things that are already wrong before I have even gone on the first road trip:1. One of the plastic clips to connect the front of the wind screen is completely missing. I don't mean they just forgot the plastic part, but they never sewed the nylon strap in at all. I am sure the velcro will be enough to hold it, but it is an inconsistency, and it will leave the receiver for that clip free to just flap in the wind. It looks like this will have to be a job for duct tape!2. They include plastic support pieces to put under your roof rack if you have a roof rack with narrow bars (which I do). That is a nice concept, but the problem is they sent two of the short-sized ones, one of which is not long enough to fit the rear mounts. So, I was able to reinforce the front mount and that is where the most force will be felt, but I wish I could have done the same on the rear.3. There are eight mounting nuts (two at each corner) with molded plastic knobs to tighten them down. Of those eight, five of the plastic knobs broke off of the nuts while I was tightening them down. I might have gone too tight on some, but two of them cracked in my hand before they were very tight at all. I was able to finish the job with a crescent wrench, but that plastic also serves to hold the mounting bracket, and the nut underneath it is too narrow to grasp the bracket securely. I am going to have to add some washers to make them work properly.4. When folding it down, you are supposed to clip the top of the wind screen to some plastic clips on the side to hold the wind screen down. The problem is that the nylon straps on those side clips are not long enough to reach the wind screen. Again, this is poor quality control, and it renders those side clips useless! Another job for duct tape to at least secure those useless side clips.5. Don't believe the picture of this thing when it is fully expanded. It looks nice and rigid in the picture, and that might have been how it looked off the factory floor before it got folded into a box, but because of the way it is packaged it has big creases along the middle. It might fill out to look something like this when it is full, but it is not nearly as rigid as the picture would lead you to believe.6. It sags on the bottom. You would think that the bottom of it is rigid from the picture, but in reality the only rigid areas of the bottom are the areas where the aluminum frame is. Everything else is loose fabric and that is going to mean that it is going to sag down and touch the roof of the car when loaded. This is not necessarily a functional problem, but it will look ugly.If I had the time to do so, I would just return this thing for a refund and look for some other solution. Unfortunately, today is Saturday and we are leaving for a road trip on Tuesday. So, we are stuck using this for now. If there are any more disappointments after this trip, I will be returning it and downgrading this review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJG0B91SYOAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PEQMNA#wasThisHelpful","R1MJG0B91SYOAL","A5T1AJ2TYYT2U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5T1AJ2TYYT2U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Anti-Inflammatory Diet & Action Plans book is filled with informative sections and tips on reducing inflammation. Part I is filled with Actions Plans – understanding inflammation, empowered eating for healthy living and the Anti-Inflammatory Action Plans. There is a Vegan Action Plan, Paleo Action Plan, Mediterranean Action Plan and the Time-Saving Action Plan.Part II are recipes from smoothies to breakfast to soups to desserts and snacks; it’s all covered. There are a ton of recipes that look delicious. The one downside is that I like pictures of what things are “supposed” to look like and this has a few pictures here and there. I can tell you I wouldn’t follow one of the action plans to the T because I have such a hard time with strict, stringent diets. I need the tips to keep inflammation down, though as well as some food ideas that I can incorporate into everyday living. I felt like there were some delicious recipes, particularly breakfast recipes, as that’s one of the hardest meals for me to prep and eat. The Coconut Rice with Berries looks delicious and easy; it’s on my list of things to try, as well as the Buckwheat Waffles, Coconut Pancakes and Sweet Potato Hash.I honestly can’t attest to the reduction of inflammation from eating a strict diet from this book, but I do that avoiding certain foods and eating whole, healthy foods is generally better for everyone, no matter what the ailment.*Book received for free in exchange for honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B1CD1SRGFO4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942411251#wasThisHelpful","R2B1CD1SRGFO4U","A2OSKBS1VPMGAW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OSKBS1VPMGAW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used a few wrap products on the market and most do tend to have some sort of result...even if it's just a little skin tightness. I really liked this wrap although 6-8 hrs is long for me to wear something. I wore these on work from home days with a shaper tank to hold it in place. Drank lots of water and had tighter skin and lost a few inches (1.5"") to be exact. I'll take whatever help I can get!

"My office moved into a temporary, makeshift space while our new office is being completed so we are without our good chairs (we sold the old ones and the new ones don't get delivered until we are in the real space). Needless to say, my back has been hating this office situation and the temporary chairs. This Lumbar Support cushion made quite a difference once I brought it in.The outside fabric is super soft and the memory foam inside has just the right amount of firmness to give that lumbar support I need while sitting 12 hours a day. I suffer from chronic back pain, following two car accidents in the past 2 years. Without lumbar support in a chair, i suffer all day long AND all night as well. There is nothing that helps my back completely, because of the damage that has been done but little things like this make life much more bearable.

I love that the rice cooker can be set to delay start, up to 15 hrs ahead!Okay, so this thing is AMAZING…Brown rice is so difficult to get perfectly cooked and this thing does it! While it may take longer than other methods, it’s worth it! It was easy to use but I definitely used the directions that came with the cooker, as opposed to what the package of rice said. It came out perfectly, not undercooked or burnt! I put the rice in, then rinsed it before adding water and turning on. I love that I set it before I left for work to start before I got home since I ended up working late that night.I also loved the extra veggie steamer that was included in the box…I’m a sucker for kitchen gadgets, what can I say?

I am always looking into non-pharmaceutical solutions and this book is definitely a good alternative.The Acid Reflux Escape Plan helps explain acid reflux and GERD as well as including a 2 week meal plan and includes over 100 recipes!This book has a lot of tools for helping manage reflux/heartburn. There are lists of foods to avoid (and ones you can eat!), shopping lists of foods to help combat reflux/GERD symptoms and even tips on immediate relief from heartburn! I really liked the chart they included to help you keep track of triggers. I think paying attention to causes is really important in managing reflux. I know that personally, one of my biggest triggers is eating too much food at one time.

"This laptop bag is a decent enough looking bag made out of dark brown PU leather. I decided to give this to my brother who was looking for a new bag and well, he gave it a 3* out of 5 rating. He said it looked to “feminine” and more like a man purse than a men’s briefcase. Obviously, the shoulder strap is removable and you can use it as either but he just didn’t love the design of the bag. Not masculine enough. He did like the pockets; there is a large pocket on the outside as well as a large zippered pocket inside and two small pockets, just like you see with a large handbag or tote.All in all, if this is what you are looking for in a bag, or this is your style, then this is a decent bag. For him, he was looking for something more distinguished and masculine. I couldn’t use it since I don’t particularly love this style bag for the transport of my work laptop. My personal rating would be a 3* as well, just because the price is a little high for the overall quality. I don’t love the “lack” of protection the inside zipper pocket provides.

"I actually practice myofascial release with a lacrosse ball to relieve the back and shoulder pain I have from 2 car accidents in the past 2 years. I also occasionally use a foam roller, after a hard work out. My favorite are the balls with spikes. They get in to spots where nothing else can.The quality of the materials used are definitely good quality and it is well made. However, I felt like it was difficult to use for pretty much everything except the legs and I really just like what I was using already a lot better. Maybe it was the weight; it seems heavy, especially compared to a foam roller. It made using it cumbersome to use.I was excited to get this to review, thinking that it could be another thing to add to my repertoire. I did a little research and I think that this would probably be great for someone who no longer got the relief they wanted from the foam rollers but this seems too hard to me.

"This purple sea urchin light is really cute. I have it on a small shelf with some other knick-knacks because it was underwhelming where I had planned to use it; to be honest, it is quite small for the price. It’s too small to be really useful as a light so I’d recommend if you are looking for a cute little decoration.Mine did have a small nick in the candle holder so had I purchased this, it would need to be returned or exchanged. It’s small but at almost $17, I’d definitely be getting a new one if it arrived damaged. All in all, while it’s cute, I’d only really recommend this if it dropped to a $10 price point for the quality of the items. And the size…or lack thereof.UPDATE: I was given a little background on the process to make these things and the pricing is driven by the expense of having to ship delicate urchin skeletons and the time to hand make each one. This makes me understand the pricing a little more and while a true sea-life aficionado will appreciate the time and effort put into this but an everyday consumer would not.Customer service was wonderful; they contacted me about replacing my damaged candle holder but truthfully, where it sits, no one will ever see the small chip missing.

"XTAVA Define Lashes Volumizing Waterproof Mascara was a bit of a disappointment for me. I was excited for “volumizing” and “waterproof” but it certainly lacked in the volume department; it took 3-4 coats to even look like I was wearing mascara!  The formula was very light and thin and didn’t really volumize my lashes like other mascaras. It did stay on all day and my lashes did look okay after several coats, I just prefer one (maybe 2) coats. It didn’t clump, which was another benefit.

You can move the limbs and my doll's head comes off super easy; was considering gluing but then she would always have to look one direction. Another thing I love is the level of detail, just in general. The doll comes with a diaper, onesie and outfit including headband but she can be re-dressed! I have a 7 year old niece who loves to change what her dolls are wearing so this is awesome.While I personally wouldn't purchase this doll for a child to play with because the price is just too expensive to just get dirty and destroyed.

"The AquaCare 4-in-1 Rainfall Combo with Hand Shower & Rotating Hydro-Brush/Massager has a lot of really cool features. The shower head comes with 2-way Water Diverter with angle-adjustable Overhead Bracket, Plumber's Tape and Extra-long 6' Stainless Steel Hose with dual Conical Brass nuts for easy hand tightening for easy installation. This shower head is replacing one that did not have a removable handle so I’m pleased with it. I looked at fancy ones at Home Depot but I really didn’t want to pay their prices for my spare bathroom that I rarely use. This shower head has a bunch of cool features that the others didn’t have, too.

"This is such a great product/idea!!! Sometimes I have to leave a key for my cleaners, if I have an appointment or have to go into work that day and I always HATED leaving it right under the mat, for fear that that UPS man would pick the mat up to ""hide"" my boxes delivered and someone would have free access to my home. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large the inside of this was.

"UPDATE: After 2 days of ""heavier"" use (i.e. left it running for the whole 6 hrs), the unit stopped working. Pretty sad that it only seemed to hold up when I used it for 1-2 hrs at a time. When I went to make this my primary diffuser, I got 2 days out of it before it broke!ORIGINAL REVIEW (4* rating)I am an essential oil fanatic and actually own SEVERAL diffusers to spread throughout the house. This Bloomsure Diffuser has a very simple, sleek design and this particular design is in my bathroom, as it’s the perfect shape and size for one of the shelves. With the lights and some lavender oil, my bath is super relaxing and all I need is that glass of wine! I really loved the colors when I first used this (and still do). It’s so relaxing to just sit and watch as I’m chilling in the tub. You can set it to just one color, or have it cycle through.The diffuser is simple to use, just fill with water (be careful not to overfill), add a few drops of essential oils, plug in and turn on! The button on the right turns the unit on/off and the left button controls the light. The machine has an automatic shut off when it runs out of water. I generally run it about 2-3 hours at a time (no, I don’t have the luxury of taking a bath that long. I usually turn it on 45 mins before the bath to get the scent going in the bathroom, 30 minutes for the bath and then 30-ish minutes post bath time, as I’m washing my face and getting ready for bed.I’ve been using for a few weeks now, about 3 times a week and so far I haven’t run into any issues. I truly haven’t tested the automatic shut off, though, since I only run for short periods of time.*Product received in exchange for honest review*","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P8NRV8KD83VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KVI3DG#wasThisHelpful","R2P8NRV8KD83VF","A2OSKBS1VPMGAW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OSKBS1VPMGAW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have these little tiny windows in my dining room (96” wide, 24” long) and I’ve been looking for something that accented the dark gray walls, white trim and gray mini blinds since it is my “dining room.” These curtains looked like they would be just what I was looking for!The set comes with (1) valance (56”x18”) and a pair of tiers (combined width 56” w/ 36” length). They are a cotton/polyester blend, with a canvas feel and appearance. They really are quite thick and definitely durable. Totally different from the normal, dainty kitchen curtains that you find in department stores. I did have a little crooked stitching on the bottom of one of the tiers, but I'm not sure how many people would ever be that close to my curtains to analyze.I think the valance looks great on the door. I’m actually thinking about using the fabric from the “too-long for my window” tiers and having short valances made for the big window because I do really love the way they look on the window but they don’t just sell the valances (and I need shorter than 18” since the window is only 24”)!!!

"I am a big fan of both Jeff Gold and Janet Montgomery. Their CDs have been so helpful in managing my anxiety and helping get me relaxed and to sleep. I was ecstatic to review this CD, as I am currently struggling with my weight and I’m getting married in 7 months!!! I need to drop 50 pounds and I’m looking for all the help I can get. Sadly, I got this CD a few weeks ago and misplaced it until a few days ago. I am a stress-eater and I can honestly say that I think this CD will be helpful in stopping me from turning to food in times of sadness, happiness and even despair. I have only been able to listen to it once so far but my goal is once or twice a day for the next few weeks. Janet’s voice, with Jeff’s melodies really can put me in a trance-like state.

"This voice recorder from iGearPro is a neat little device. It comes with the iGearPro voice recorder, a mini USB cable to charge/transfer files, an adapter to record landline phone calls as well as the headphones and microphones. The device itself is lightweight, very lightweight… almost “cheap” feeling, compared to some others I have tested.However, this voice recorder does work, just fine and it is definitely more user-friendly than may other models. It has 8 GB of memory and the battery seems to last around 10-12 hours. You can record and listen to the recording, right on the device. No need to download to a computer first!There are 3 speakers on the device and while the quality of the recording/speakers is not top of the line, it does work sufficiently. The quality of the recordings is 128kb, which is a lower quality but for the purpose of voice recordings, it’s fine! I would definitely not say “it sounds great” because it’s just not “great” quality so it’s not really possible but it does work. I used it in a class, to record the lecture because I was unable to take notes that day and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be! I was able to playback and take notes a few days later.It is easy to operate, charge and playback. While it is not the most impressive in terms of quality, it does do the job and for the average user, this is a perfect little gadget. It's not a bad price, considering...and I would consider purchasing again if I lost mine, simply because it is easy to use and gets the job done.*Product received in exchange for honest review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHKHPJ3IG1BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","R3DHKHPJ3IG1BX","A2OSKBS1VPMGAW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OSKBS1VPMGAW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great book if you’re looking to get your babies to eat healthy from the start! While I am not a mother, I have a few friends who are about to become first time moms. One of them is highly allergic to a few foods herself and wants to be as clean as possible with the baby’s foods!The first section has a lot of info and even includes a list of foods to avoid, and “how to.” It teaches you how to make your own baby food with clean, non-processed ingredients. You have better control over what you are putting in the baby’s body that way. I think if you teach kids young to eat fruits and veggies, they will always eat them. My niece is a perfect example. She’s six, loves fruits, smoothies and veggies and doesn’t like candy!The second part of the book are the recipes. And there are a TON of recipes.

"I’m going to be honest, I hate to cook. I work a demanding job, often not getting home until after 7pm and I just don’t want to cook when I get home after a long day. But my fiancé doesn’t want to be in charge of dinner every night either so we recently agreed I would be responsible 2-3 times a week.I’ve got no experience in the kitchen but can seem to follow a recipe okay so I’ve been trying to get my hands on as many cookbooks as I can. Fiancé is a little picky with food so I have to make adjustments to most things so he’ll eat it Dump dinners are super easy meals. Dump the ingredients and go! The Absolute Best Dump Dinners Cookbook has 75 recipes, along with tips for prepping meals in advance (I need to start trying to do this as well!). It provides a list of ingredients that you should always have on hand when you’re short on time and need to throw something together.  I have to say though, with a picky fiancé, I can’t really use a good amount of these recipes. There are delicious meals, don’t get me wrong, but just not kid-friendly meals, unless you have kids that will eat anything.I think this is a great book for the adventurous eater, in need of a few ideas.

"I bought this case at the suggestion of my IT fiancé. He owns the black poetic cases for his iPad Mini2. I had the sky blue one first and LOVE it but it randomly broke at the corner and I couldn’t keep it on anymore. I decided it was time for a switch so I picked the ""lavender"". The lavender is really more of a pink-purple color; I wish it had come in a real purple color. The fit is perfect and it doesn’t add much bulk or weight to the iPad itself, which I love. I also love the magnetic on the front of the case, which turns the iPad off when closed. Good for saving battery power!If you drop the case or have kids who play with your case, I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it, since my mom’s has broken each time my niece has dropped the case.

Please note that if you have children, you will want to store this away from their reach, and preferably with the staples in a separate area.  It is not a toy, or a paper stapler.  It is a serious workshop tool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MNA4ASR1P46W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BPT316#wasThisHelpful","R2MNA4ASR1P46W","A2U6VP21H9UVV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6VP21H9UVV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a handy little shelf that allows me to stack kitchen wraps and other similar sized items in a slide out storage drawer that is tall, but only has low sides.  The rack measures  10 inches long x 7 1/2 inches wide by 9 inches tall.  Depending on what sort of boxes, etc you put on the shelf, you will need to allow additional height and or length for clearance of items than extend beyond the frame.  It is sturdy enough, although I do wish it had solid or  mesh shelves, rather than just the two curved wires to hold the boxes.  the open work limits the type and size of items you can stack on it.  It suits my purposes and helps keep the stored items together and within easy view.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DWK1JZOLCY01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5CPAB0#wasThisHelpful","R1DWK1JZOLCY01","A2U6VP21H9UVV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6VP21H9UVV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These folding crates have been the solution to organizing my various hobby items.  I do a wide range of  handcrafts, sewing and collecting.  These attractive crates, (10 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 101/2 inches)  fit nicely on a book case or closet shelf, keeping  all sorts of bits and pieces together and in order.  They fold up easily when not in use, it is easy to store them out of the way, unlike bulky plastic bins.  I use them for handwork supplies, fabric, yarn, doll clothes (my dolls have way too many shoes) etc.... I will note that these crates are not suited for heavy items, as they are of light, fabric and ""paste board"" type construction.

"This is a lovely design and the quality of the materials is quite good, but this is not a kit for beginners. First, the chart/stitch guide was in black and white.  That meant that it was very difficult to sort out what color went where, especially in areas with multiple colors in small areas. And it was not actually a chart, just a line drawing that suggested general areas for colors.  I just took my best guess.  So, be ready to improvise.  Second, parts of the design are worked in embroidery floss.  I actually like working with floss, but it is trickier to use than wool, and so not a good choice for beginners.  It is a bother to strip and separate floss and you have to stitch carefully to keep the stitches smooth and regular.  That being said, it is a lovely finished piece and a good way to practice shading if you are up to the task.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZZPLHBORD6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CO2FGQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CZZPLHBORD6O","A2U6VP21H9UVV3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2U6VP21H9UVV3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nifty mystery.  It will keep you guessing and the characters are interesting and well developed.

( If you know any engineers, they are all about resolving questions.)  The characters are  diverse group that you want to learn more about.

"I recently purchased a Brother HL-L2340DW Compact Laser Printer with Duplex Printing and Wireless Networking, so I feel that I have a good vantage point as to how difficult this item was to set up in comparison. Supposedly this Epson supports wireless printing - but after about an hour of fiddling, I wasn't able to get that to work and gave up. The only way I was able to get anything printed was with a direct USB connection. The Amazon listing says "" Built-in wireless - print from tablets and smartphones"". Well, that doesn't seem possible for iPhones or iPads. Not sure what other tablets/smartphones they're talking about.The print quality wasn't great, either - it didn't provide crisp black text, but more of a gray. The color was ok, but print quality was just really low. I assume this is an ink-saving strategy. If you want high quality color printouts, this isn't the printer I'd choose. Personally, I don't ever NEED to print in color, but thought it would be great to have the option. Well, now I'm still not convinced. I've definitely used really high quality color printers before, and this thing is nowhere near impressive enough to justify the extra cost involved.The ink comes in crazy plastic squeeze bottles that you use to fill reservoirs at the end of the printer. There are many warnings about carrying the printer ONLY UPRIGHT when moving it, lest the ink spill all over the place. I'm just ... not sure who made that design decision. Apparently the ink is a lot more environmentally-friendly than buying a ton of ink cartridges and replacing those over and over again, so that's good.The way this printer loads paper is crazy, too. It's not shown in the photo here on Amazon, but there's a pop-up plastic bit on the back that slides up and you put some paper in there. It's always sticking up and ends up curling and falling over. This is why paper trays were invented! This printer has no paper tray. There are just too many annoying things about it for me to give it a decent review - even with the built-in scanning functionality and eco-friendly angle, I've decided to give it away and will stick with my trusty Brother HL-L2340DW. I just don't want to have to deal with a ""PC LOAD LETTER"" rage incident every time I want to print!","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M2CWY6642923/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JHMG#wasThisHelpful","R3M2CWY6642923","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice tea towel, but EXPENSIVE! Full disclosure, I received this towel (just one) for free for reviewing purposes. It's nice and thick, and has a convenient bit on one corner so you can hang it from something, but $10 for ONE tea towel? The stitching isn't amazing. My cat likes to sleep on it. You can definitely get tea towels that are just as nice for a lot less, but probably not ones that are made of organic cotton. So that's a good selling point for this towel.

"You get what you pay for with these things.

Don't buy some junky $15 cover and expect it to last more than one season. This one, on the other hand, will clearly last for years.Though you can't tell from the pictures (they make it look like this is just a glorified tarp) there are actually cords and cord locks on all 4 corners so you can fasten it tightly to the legs of the bench (or whatever) that's under the cover.

"The biggest reason that I don't use the shared iPad in my house is that it's too much of a pain to type anything in. If you're exclusively browsing websites and not typing anything, then great - but this keyboard makes it WAY easier for me to log in to various websites and apps, comment on things, post on twitter, compose emails, etc. It's MUCH faster. It's also nice to use as a stand so you don't have to hold up your iPad for an extended period of time: particularly useful if you're using the Kindle app or reading something longer. There are 3 different positions you can angle your screen at. I found it really convenient for cooking with, actually - prop it up in the lowest position so you don't have to stoop over to see what's on the screen, and easily follow along with a recipe while you're cooking.One thing  I do NOT like about this is how the iPad itself snaps into it. I feel like I'm scraping the side of the iPad with the volume up/down buttons, and it's basically impossible to put the iPad into the case or take it out of the case without turning the screen off/on, messing with the volume, or otherwise interrupting the flow of whatever it is that you're doing. Maybe most people put their iPad into the case once and never take it out again, but I've found myself removing it from the case a couple of time and it's definitely awkward. Also, there's no way to bring up the on-screen keyboard once this thing is connected via bluetooth. You have to either turn bluetooth off in settings, or physically disconnect the keyboard. So if you want to access any characters that aren't on the keyboard (such as ` or emoji) you have to jump through some hoops.Otherwise, though, it's a pretty nice-looking case: smooth metallic bottom, just like the back of the iPad, a flexible gray leather-ish hinge that takes up a good portion of the top cover (where the camera and volume up/down buttons are) and some cheap-looking white plastic (it's matte, at least...) around that. I don't know why they didn't use metal in place of the plastic, especially considering the price of this item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZICUI53P456/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTT5Y#wasThisHelpful","R3BZICUI53P456","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We don't often get extended periods of freezing weather in Seattle, but it's happened a few times this winter, and it renders this chicken waterer useless. Though the water in the cooler I have it attached to doesn't freeze, this thing sticking off the cooler's spout is completely uninsulated, and froze overnight every time it got below about 30 degrees. During those times we would just go out and give our chickens a bowl of water to drink from.I think the cold snaps may have caused the plastic to become brittle, though, so I would only recommend this product to people who live in an area that never goes below freezing. OR, only use it in the summer if you do. I went out to the coop this morning and saw that the britetap had sheared off the front of the insulated water cooler it's attached to. And this is when it's 60 degrees out - nowhere near freezing! I bought another one to replace it because it's the least messy option out there and ours may have just been a fluke.

Taking these well-loved stories as their base, each author will write their own unique take on Jane Austen’s novels"" (Google ""Austen Project"" to check out the website for more details.)I find McCall Smith's style very enjoyable, and it comes through splendidly here in his modern retelling of Emma. I've read almost all of his other books - No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Scotland Street,  Professor Dr. von Igelfeld books - and this one was like putting on a comfortable old pair of boots. If you've read McCall Smith's Scotland Street or Isabel Dalhousie books, the content of Emma is quite similar - It's easy to get drawn into the stories of everyday people and their everyday problems.

"I thought I'd try these in baked macaroni and cheese for some extra protein, but I wouldn't recommend it. The pasta ended up kind of rubbery and didn't absorb the cheese sauce as well as traditional macaroni does. It ended up being kind of ""nonstick"", like separate pasta and cheese sauce.

"This is TP-Link's top of the line wireless routerThe provided instructions are very helpful - to set it up, you can either connect it via USB and set it up using your web browser, or use their Tether app. I tried the app on my iPhone and recommend that you use the USB/web browser setup option. Otherwise there's a lot of connecting to one access point, disconnecting and connecting to another one, etc. etc. It was a little bit frustrating.Range hasn't been a problem in my tiny house, so I can't really comment on how it would work for a larger space other than the fact that most reviewers seem very happy with the coverage they get in larger homes. The router itself has got kind of a large footprint - we have a Netgear that has a much slimmer profile than this and frankly looks better (sleek, black with subtle yellow green lights). This one kind of looks reminiscent of an iMac from 2001.I've been really happy with speeds for the web browsing, video streaming, Netflix, and music streaming I typically use it for. I can hardly tell a difference between using the 5.0 GHz and the wired ethernet port, so I'm really happy with it!

"This is a great little light! Nice, inexpensive solution to a dark gate into my yard. Anyone who shows up at night has to fumble in the dark with the latch to the gate, and I figured I'd need to have an electrician install an outdoor light fixture there. Expensive, right?! Well, I stumbled upon this and thought it was the perfect, inexpensive solution to my problem. After 5 minutes drilling the baseplate above my gate and attaching the light, it was working perfectly. The range of the motion sensor works really well - anyone approaching within about 10 feet sets it off, it stays on for just under a minute and turns off if nothing's moving. It's quite bright, but won't wake up the neighbors or anything. I'll definitely be getting more of these for the other dark corners of my yard!I was actually surprised by how big this thing is.

"I bought this after purchasing another NSI outdoor timer because I was happy with how well-made it was.  I specifically wanted two separate items on different schedules, so I bought a second timer instead of plugging both things into the one timer I had.Unfortunately the plug for this item is L-shaped, so it's impossible to plug two into the same outlet. The packaging actually shows a straight plug, which is why I bought it thinking it would work. Pretty misleading! If you have multiple outdoor outlets, you'll be fine, but if you have only one outlet with 2 plugs side-by-side, you won't be able to fit two of these timers.I solved the problem by buying a 2-foot outdoor extension cord, but it was disappointing that the packaging misled me.

"Having had a few days to try out this microwave, it's definitely got some issues. It looks pretty slick with its mirror finish, but I've had lots of annoying little problems. For the price, these should NOT be an issue:- You can't see what's cooking inside the microwave because of the mirrored exterior. If you're trying to melt butter or something, you won't be able to peek inside to see how it's doing. Result? Microwave interior covered in butter. The floor of the microwave is indented, too, not flat. So it's going to be a hassle to clean up.- The power levels on this thing make NO SENSE. Most microwaves have power levels 1-10. This one does, too... Kind of. What actually shows up on the display is 40 or 50 instead of 4 or 5. What the heck? Who designed this thing? The interface for operating it makes no sense at all. Just trying to cook something at a normal power level is awkward to punch in, too. Sometimes (not always) you have to press cancel before you're able to enter a cooking time. I have yet to figure out when or why I have to do this. So I always just press cancel before entering a cook time for something.- The inside is significantly smaller than other microwaves that are the same physical size. My old microwave took up the same amount of space on the counter, but was 1.7 cu feet. This one is 1.4 cu feet. The inside is much smaller.It heats food up just fine once you figure out the weird power levels. Which is great if you know exactly how long it's going to take to cook something, or don't care about ending up with undercooked or overcooked food. But microwaves have windows for a reason: power levels vary, and for most things you're cooking, you want to keep an eye on things. This microwave makes it impossible to do so.If you need an extra mirror in the house, this microwave could be just the ticket for you!","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UWQBWV259M0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQFSSWS#wasThisHelpful","R3UWQBWV259M0I","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When this arrived and I opened the mailbox, I thought ""did someone order coffee?!?"" It was even double-wrapped in bubble envelopes and I could STILL smell the delicious mocha flavor.The texture of these small chocolate bars definitely trends toward the ""gritty"" end of the spectrum, but I kind of like that. It's what gives it such a distinct coffee flavor. I once tried an amazing 'chocolate' bar from Sahagun in Portland, OR called ""KA-POW!"" that is actually made from very, very finely ground espresso and cocoa butter. Not technically chocolate since it doesn't contain cocoa solids, but deceptively similar in texture AND flavor! Well, this Scharffen Berger is like the poor man's KA-POW! (Which is funny, since this is still pretty pricey - just not as $$$)My only real complaint about this thing? The wrapping seems shoddily applied. The green paper wrapper had slipped off of about half of the small bars I received in my shipment.

"If you've read Terry Pratchett before and like his books, you should enjoy this collection of short stories from his early years. They were written by Pratchett back in the mid-sixties while he was writing for a small local newspaper in Buckinghamshire. There are familiar characters (Tales of the Carpet People) as well as new ones you'll enjoy meeting for the first time.There are some characters and settings that may make you realize they're the precursors to some of his other works such as the Discworld series. (The knights from Dragons at Crumbling Castle and Edwo the Boring Knight definitely bring to mind the people and settings from Discworld.)There are fun illustrations and typographical flourishes throughout the book that keep your turning the pages until you're finished and wishing that Pratchett had spent more time writing these fun short stories years ago so you'd have more to read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CIXDW9K3VCSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544466594#wasThisHelpful","R1CIXDW9K3VCSB","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was happy to see this new addition to Scharffen Berger's lineup. I usually buy their 70% bittersweet chocolate bar. While this new bar only differs by 2% from the existing 70% bittersweet I was surprised by how rich and nutty the flavor is compared to the 70%, even though the ingredients list is identical. I guess that just goes to show what a difference the raw cacao quality makes to a product like this. It can either be really mediocre, or really amazing. This product definitely falls into the amazing camp.An added bonus: the new bar is actually made with Rainforest Alliance Certified cocoa beans. That's definitely an improvement in terms of sustainability, so I'm happy with that.

"Unobtrusive and functional bike stand that's great for storing your bike while it's not being used. If you have slippery floors (wood, laminate, tile, etc.) you may want to add some sticky pads/feet to the bottom of the stand, otherwise it may move around while you're moving your bike onto/off of it. The rubbery top protects your frame from getting scratched up.How it works: basically you just rest your rear tire on the floor-level tray, and place the read axle on the rubbery part. It's quite flexible for different size bikes, too.Just one caveat: While I don't have disk brakes on my bike, the packaging says it's compatible with ""most"" disk brakes.

"This is an OK solution for exercising with your iPhone 6 (and some other models, apparently, judging from the other reviews that mention previous models also fit in the case). In my opinion, there are some improvements that can be made to this product:- bulky design: significantly wider than the iPhone 6 itself. I would be concerned that this would be a target for thieves if you're running around in a higher-crime area.- less space between the clear plastic cover and the phone's screen. It can be hard to navigate when the plastic is bubbling up around the edges due to too much space in there. My phone (with no case on it) fits easily inside,- it's too easy for the edges of the case to accidentally press the power button on the top right ,turning the screen off when you don't expect it.- the stitching on the back of the case, which rests against your skin while you're exercising, will allow moisture inside the case, especially if you're particularly sweaty.There's an extra slot behind your phone where you can stash some cash, cards or maybe a key, but nothing too big. It's not as deep as the slot your phone goes in, so it's easier to take a card out than if you had to fish around inside to find it.  This area is also protected under the back flap in case it's raining. However, these items would be closest to your skin, so it's likely that they would get wet if you're sweating.On the plus side, the extra slot might prevent the phone inside from getting AS wet as it would otherwise. If this is a concern, then I'd recommend this case over the Belkin Sport-Fit arm band, which is only a dollar or two cheaper anyway. Belkin's non-Plus arm band doesn't have the extra slot for cards/keys/etc. and would be more likely to retain moisture in the area that holds the phone. Now, the Sport-Fit Plus (this item) will probably still get your phone a BIT damp if you're sweating (and who doesn't, while exercising?!) but note quite as much, just based on the design. I'm still concerned that this might lead to long-term damage to my phone.Otherwise, the armband is comfortable, smooth neoprene that shouldn't irritate your arm while you're moving around, the phone (at least with no case) fits inside alright (though with a bit too much room to spare, which makes it harder to use the screen) and the opening for headphones lines up well with the jack on the phone itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LMVD9IJQVZN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O08PX78#wasThisHelpful","R1LMVD9IJQVZN5","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This arm band functions well enough - the Iphone 6 fits snugly inside and you're able to see everything on the screen. There's a flap on top that prevents rain from getting in and soaking your phone. It's relatively easy to use the touch screen through the thick plastic cover, but you do have to press down really hard because there is an annoying amount of extra space between the plastic and the screen.When it's on your arm, and you move your arm up to look at the screen, it rotates to landscape mode. This isn't too annoying for most apps that support rotation, but the iPhone home screen doesn't rotate, so it's kind of awkward to be looking at that at a 90 degree angle and trying to figure out what you're doing.There's a small opening on the bottom for headphones.I haven't had a chance to use this in the pouring rain yet, but it seems like it would do a decent job of keeping your phone dry. Not too sure about the seams on the front, though - if those don't stand up to the test of time/rainstorms, it's going to get (and stay) very wet in there. I'm concerned that it will get steamy inside just from sweating, too, if you're doing a really intense workout with this thing on. The stitching on the back will probably allow moisture to get into the phone area just due to the sweat on your skin.Really, the bottom line for me with this thing is that it's bulky enough that I'm not sure I'll use it regularly, especially at the gym. For an outdoor run: MAYBE. I use bluetooth headphones when I work out, so just having my phone nearby is usually fine. I would say that this item would be less annoying to use with bluetooth headphones, too, even though it would work with regular corded headphones/earbuds.

"Fun little gadget that's reminiscent of the Fitbit for step tracking, but for keeping track of temperature, UV index, and humidity either at home or on the go.Big pluses for me:- ability to monitor humidity accurately inside my house during winter, when it's REALLY dry!- ability to monitor UV index when outdoors so you're reminded to reapply sunscreen regularlyThe app is available for iOS and Android. I've been using the iOS app, which looks pretty good. The camera feature seems like overkill, though - you can use the button on your CliMate as a remote to snap a photo on your iPhone, but ONLY within the CliMate's app. Not just when you have the camera app running. The CliMate app superimposes some graphics showing the current temperature, UVI, and humidity level. You can integrate with Facebook or otherwise share these photos with friends via email, text message, or any of the other default options iOs has.There's a short little rubbery ""lanyard"" it comes with so you can clip it onto a backpack, handbag, zipper or what have you while you're on the go. I'm wary of how insecurely the CliMate attaches to the lanyard AND how the lanyard attaches to whatever you're putting it on. There's a definite risk that you'll easily lose this little gadget. I'm also not happy with how the CliMate fits on its stand - the post is much too wide, so you have to keep twisting the little cloud-shaped object onto it for a really long time before it stays on, and even then it won't stay on very long.Other than the stand and the lanyard, though, this is a great concept for an app that you can use to monitor, at the VERY least, temperature. If you've got one of those weather stations where you put a sensor outside and can look at the temperature, humidity, etc. remotely from a display you keep indoors, this is like an advanced version of that which can be monitored from your cell phone instead. The only catch here is that you can't sync with the CliMate unless you're not nearby. When you come back into range, though, it will sync with your phone and send you all the data it's been collecting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W70Z0YKDRTVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4OTADW#wasThisHelpful","R1W70Z0YKDRTVI","A2IKX7H2PLHULP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IKX7H2PLHULP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like using this for my kitchen counters. Whoever remodeled the kitchen before we moved in decided it would be a brilliant idea to install white tiles with white grout. Well, the grout stays white for about 5 minutes until something gets spilled on it - coffee, crumbs, spices, etc. I like using the fine tip of this bleach pen to apply a bead of bleach gel along the grout and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then wipe it off. Clean off the counter with hot water, dry it off and it actually seems like the gel keeps working. I notice a significant brightening of the white grout after the initial 5-10 minutes, but even after removing the gel and wiping down the counters I think it gets even whiter within the next few hours.

"This a really sturdy exercise band.

The level tells you when you're pointing in a straight line upward, so in case you don't want to tap into the stud right there, you can at least use a straight edge up from the handy point on this thing then do it there.

"These things are so very awesome, love 'em, great purchase!! I used #8x2"" Spax silver constructions screws and boy, WAY better than drywall screws. Seriously, I've been hooked on drywall screws for just about everything for years, and the construction screws go in so much easier. But back to the Geartrack - speaking of screwing, I really do like the little indentation that makes it so much easier to put up.Tip:  Level and mark in a couple of places on the wall where you want to hang this, and use just the tip of a black marker to mark in that little indentation where you want each screw (obviously at the studs). Then take the Geartrack to your workbench and get each of your screws started in the track - just a tiny little bit, just enough to hold. I did this, made it SO easy to hold up to my leveling marks with one hand and use the screw gun with the other hand to drive a couple of 'em in enough to hold it, then I could relax, take my hands off of it, and drive all the screws hassle free with just the one hand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S54WJ1D1BIIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UQFNBC#wasThisHelpful","R1S54WJ1D1BIIU","A2RLPYOQDA46LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLPYOQDA46LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I saw a couple of older reviews where people mentioned this thing supporting 100 lbs, whereas now it says 50.

"This headset is very attractive, callers are extremely clear to me, and I've been told by everyone I've asked that I sound ""crystal clear.""Next on the importance list is comfort. When I first put it on, it felt so comfortable I'm pretty sure I let out an audible ""ooooooo."" But then, it didn't take long on one ear, I mean 10 minutes tops, for the discomfort to start setting in on the earpiece side -- the other side never bothers me at all. If left too long on one ear, discomfort actually turns to pain. Fortunately, it's extremely quick to flip it around and change ears, go another 10-15 minutes, and repeat as necessary. I'm not on constantly so take it off between every call. Disclaimer - I do have a good size noggin, which very well plays a part in that, though I suspect unless you get the old fashioned big ones like we used to use for stereos decades ago (and are still available), you're going to experience this same thing no matter how large or small your head.Mute and volume (it's on the cord, not the headset itself) - I use my phone exclusively for this so it's not important to me. I have the headset volume turned all the way up and control the rest via phone. I read at least one other reviewer complain about the headset mute working only while you press it as opposed to toggle on/toggle off style, but since I use my phone anyway, it doesn't impact me either way.All in all this bad boy gets 4 stars from me, only dinging 1 for the comfort since I'm not convinced any one of this style is going to be much better.Now if only someone would make one that sounds this good that you could wear for an hour or more with no discomfort, one that also has a high quality retraction mechanism for the cord, I would then say that cord utopia had been found. If any of you know of such a thing, oh goodness, please let me know! :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YSFCA9OJRNDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032HM6JG#wasThisHelpful","R2YSFCA9OJRNDD","A2RLPYOQDA46LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLPYOQDA46LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I write very few reviews for films, but had to make an exception for this one. When Challenger exploded 73 seconds after departure, America's heart skipped a beat. Anyone who remembers that moment has got to find immensely interesting this amazing behind the scenes look at what happened on the commission that was charged with investigating and reporting on the cause of that terrible disaster.I've honestly done no additional research to verify the accuracy of this film but find it very, very convincing and don't doubt for a moment its authentic retelling of not only what occurred on this particular commission, but what most certainly happens on many similar, when cya and agendas rule the day, when those in power have already given the commission the answer they want the public to hear and it's only their job to give the equation that supports that, period, no push-back allowed.William Hurt delivered an outstanding performance portraying a real life character, and from the video clip they showed of the good professor in real life, he played him to the hilt. A poignant case of an incredibly intelligent man, he was dedicated to his work, and to truth at all costs. The way this man persevered, staying on to see his work on the commission through to the end during the very most difficult time of his, or anyone's life for that matter, makes him a true hero in my book.Bottom line, love it, gotta recommend it, watch it, you won't be sorry!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1OAG45C6F1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQUN4KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1U1OAG45C6F1N","A2RLPYOQDA46LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLPYOQDA46LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Priceless little gadget, works extremely well, have spun gobs of lettuce and other veggies in ours and never had a problem whatsoever, never saw a spec of dirt on the leaves afterwards. And it's dishwasher safe, too, with one caveat. The outer parts are hard, white plastic that can withstand heating element exposure in the dishwasher. However, the inner basket, as well as the connecty-wheely sort of gadget under the top lid are both very obviously very lightweight, delicate plastic that would not. Therefore, when our daughter put the basket in the bottom of the dishwasher, naturally it came out all deformed, ruined.Thus, the wifey just happened upon one of these at a garage sale and bought it.

"Since we returned this without use, I almost started to not write a review on this one but thought, well, just in case someone else had the same issue as me, I might as well, it might help to know there were others. And before I tell you the problem I feel it important to tell you that imho, I completely feel ours was just a fluke so still recommend this pin, for it looked good, rolled good, and my bet is that short of our fluke, this is a fine pin so giving it 4 stars anyway.That said, there is an opaque/clear-ish plastic fitting on each end where the handle fits into the rolling pin. On ours, one end was nice and flush like it should be, the other sticking out about 1/2"" or so, and sort of crooked at that even. It didn't prevent the pin from operating normally but, every time I tried to picture using the rolling pin, that little oddity stuck out at me and screamed, ""hey, look at me!"" I knew I'd never be happy so returned it right away. Then, instead of replacing it, my wife then told me that she wished I'd checked with her first since she wanted one of these new-fangled French ones without handles.

"Pros:* Compared to Others - Better in all aspects than previous headsets I've used, including: Jawbone Prime; Motorola H17, H730, Oasis, & HS850; Plantronics Voyager 510; Samsung HM1700* Comfort - Wow, amazing! I originally liked the kind that wrapped over the ear for security, then got used to the nakedness of just in ear, so wasn't sure how much I'd like this one but wow, it feels so comfortable yet at the same time perfectly secure, zero worries about it falling off!* Clarity - Sounds really clear and crisp to me, and others have told me I sounded good. I had trouble with all of my previous headsets with people saying it sounded cruddy, muddy, crackly, or breaking up, or ... enough already I said! So, while I've only had a short while, initial reports are good so I'm happy. Will update this review later if anything changes in that regard.* Voice Alerts - Love this feature, wouldn't want a headset without it. Knowing the battery level is a huge deal to me, to anyone I'd imagine. Plus, telling you ""power on, power off, connected, volume maximum"" all are equally nice, I like how they programmed these to work.* Tap to Call Feature - A must. At first thought this didn't have it until I did what all us guys hate to do and, uggh, read the manual, then learned I had to press and hold it for 2 seconds. * Power Switch - No issues. Sure, I really did prefer the boom operation on my last Moto (open - on, closed - off), but this one is no problem, got used to it real quickly.* Volume Switch - Very nice. Like any new gadget, wasn't sure I'd like the ""tap up 3 times to maximum then repeat "" thing but wow, surprised at just how much I really like it on this one - it's really quite simple. For each tap, an unobtrusive beep gets louder until, at its loudest, the alert simply says ""volume maximum,"" then another tap resets it to its lowest level, so it's always an ""up, up, up"" action, not ""up, up, up, down, down, down"" action.* Battery - Good. Granted, I've not used it mondo-extreme yet, just a bit here and there throughout the day, but seems about normal. My one check was little use over two days on standby then had to connect that evening.* Distance - No complaints. Granted, I'm wise enough not to stray too far from my phone when using BT so haven't been more than, oh, 5' tops from this thing, but zero issues thus far.* Reversibility (left or right ear) Feature - Works extremely well, very impressed. It's intuitive, didn't take long to figure out how to operate it. Works well, seems well made, although I'm wise enough to use care when flipping it around, engineering can only go so far with a light little contraption like that.* Looks - Very attractive. Sleek, not too big, not too small, just right!Cons:* None to reportSummary:With all those pros and no cons, of course I'm going to absolutely recommend this headset to anyone, without hesitation, and twice on Sunday :) Buy this bad boy, you'll be quite happy you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOKSK5RFNNEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IMB5NG#wasThisHelpful","R3AOKSK5RFNNEV","A2RLPYOQDA46LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLPYOQDA46LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:• Cup quality is nice. A couple reviewers mention about the felt peeling away, and while I only just got it and used it once or twice, I checked it with my finger nails and it seems nice and tight. It's even rolled over real nicely, and again, looks and feels tightly glued.• Quiet dice rolling - yea!! No more brain-jarring, clang-clang-clang when playing Yahtzee in that original, unlined plastic cup that came with the game. Finally, after all these years, peace and harmony when playing - yippeee!!!Cons:• Cup diameter is rather large. Worth noting, however, that it's no larger than any other felt lined cups I see on here so, I don't really have a better option so am keeping this one. Got used to my old Yahtzee cup which was probably 2-1/2"" round (this one's 3""), and just liked how that smaller size felt in my hand - amazing how much that silly 1/2"" makes.• Dice are el-cheapo's. I mean really, a bunch of the numbers have the spots not completely filled in and, well, all 3 of our family agreed that it was distracting during the whole game. I'm keeping the cup but going right back out and finding me some better dice.Summary:Worth the purchase for the cup alone, unless you can find a felt lined cup that is less than 3"" in diameter by 1/4 - 1/2"". And buy for the cup, not for the dice. That way, if you're like me and don't like the dice, you won't be disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYLHGMX1TL13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049H0E7O#wasThisHelpful","R2AYLHGMX1TL13","A2RLPYOQDA46LZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RLPYOQDA46LZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

For two charging/date cables, a wall charger, and a car charger...the price was amazing! They were shipped quickly and arrived before estimated delivery time.

"I was curious to read this book because I am aware of karma and how it affects our lives. In some instances, Karma affects us immediately, while in other cases the results of one's karma are delivered later. However, sooner or later one ends up paying for one’s bad deeds and benefiting from the good ones. All ten short stories in this book illustrate that even the smallest of actions accrues karma and that their effect is not limited to your current life but goes much beyond. The stories also show that no one is immune from the law of Karma, i.e. every action has an equal and opposite reaction. I enjoyed reading this book and gained valuable insights into reincarnation, after-life, and Eastern mythology.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MNEHUUFIVCE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HV2MI7S#wasThisHelpful","R2MNEHUUFIVCE8","A166BW49EET67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A166BW49EET67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband's libido and duration has been lacking the past few years due to growing stress from work and from being stressed about the kids. We were having sex maybe once or twice a month and that was stressing both of us out even more. At first he didn't want to even think about purchasing a male sexual enhancement supplement, but after a little talking to him we decided to find a good one. We have friends who didn't like the effects of viagra or felt like that viagra was an ""old man's pill"", so he didn't even want to try that. One of his friends suggested Virectin to him and we looked it up here on Amazon. The price was low in comparison to other supplements that we looked at and it made us both a little nervous, but we decided to try it anyway because we didn't want to spend too much money. The ""you get what you pay for"" saying is no longer in our vocabulary thanks to Virectin. It has worked WONDERS! We absolutely love and would definitely pay more if we had to. This is an AMAZING product for the price. We're now having sex almost every other day now. Such a huge and great change for us! My husband hasn't experienced any bad side effects and he lasts for such a long time. He even lasts longer than he did in our college days. ;-) We both HIGHLY recommend this product! We have found our go-to sexual enhancement supplement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38LZ4NMK3L5NK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OG9UZK#wasThisHelpful","R38LZ4NMK3L5NK","A166BW49EET67G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A166BW49EET67G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I are both runners that both HATE headphones with cords. They're a nuisance because they get tangled and are just a mess. I bought one pair of these to try out because we wanted to try something new. The design is wonderful! It's colors are unisex and it looks very sleek/modern. The bluetooth connects extremely quick and the headphones work like a charm. I bought a second pair too, so that my husband and I could each wear a pair while we're running together. They fit nice and snug on both of our heads and cover our ears perfectly. We don't worry about ear pains or the ear buds falling out because these are ""over-the-ear"". We both run for an hour or so each morning before we get ready for work/taking the kids to school and we haven't had any battery problems.One full charge seems to last us weeks! They're durable and they feel as light as the dreadful earbuds do. The shipping was fast and there wasn't any damage at all to either of the headphones.

"First let me say that I enjoyed reading First very much. It is a deeply emotional read that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The reason I gave this book 4 cups, instead of 5 cups is that the pornography scenes were just a little too realistic. I suspect that the author meant for them to be, but in my case it was just a little too much information, and made it difficult to enjoy parts of this book, although overall I found it to be a fantastic read. Also, I was very satisfied with the love scenes between Tommy and Mike which were in my opinion perfect. In addition, the end was very very satisfying, and yes, that did make up for what to me were porn scenes that were too detailed.

"This was a quick and delightful read, did not have info dumps, possessed some humor, had an enticing world, and fascinating characters who had some interesting quirks. It was a refreshing difference from other books in a similar genre where the guy is the one totally in charge and the female usually follows meekly along with everything he wants. Both characters were extremely likable as well as other characters in the book, despite the difference. They possessed the right amount of everything, not too strong, not too weak, and well, not too much of any one trait. I would read another book starring Veruca and Finn just to watch them grow and evolve as a couple and as people. I liked this book, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre, some good humor and anyone who wants a quick read.Llaph Reviewer for Coffee Time Romance & More - See more at: http://coffeetimeromance.com/BookReviews/rattlebook1byoliviarburton.html#.Veslio0XLVg","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU17TVOL3JTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OV9EE2#wasThisHelpful","RNU17TVOL3JTU","ANSX922QNYA67","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANSX922QNYA67?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Elle works her way through Louie and David’s past, she becomes more aware of just how little she knows about the men she has opened her heart, soul, and body to. Despite this; however, she continues to crave Louie and his touch like an addict craves the next hit. In my opinion, her attempts to take control are half-hearted at best, and doomed to fail because there really is no trust or honest communication between her and Louie. Louie doles out lies and half-truths so consistently, it is hard to appreciate Elle’s devotion to him.Lototy Reviewer for Coffee Time Romance & More - See more at: http://coffeetimeromance.com/BookReviews/ellebook2byemmamars.html#.VesljY0XLVg","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BX986HV7ZFZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSROD0M#wasThisHelpful","R1BX986HV7ZFZ8","ANSX922QNYA67","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANSX922QNYA67?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was action packed, both in the physical sense and the emotional sense and I did not want the story to come to an end. I was eager to read more about Myka, Ari, the pack, and Myka’s brother’s family. The world the author created was great, because along with the familiar use of werewolves a twist was added to make them totally unique and not like the cookie cutter creations made by other books in this genre. Myka felt real, even though she was tough she still had her vulnerabilities, was defensive, and was adamant about being able to do things on her own and her duty to take care of her brother.

"For a time, Behringer dropped this mixer from the lineup shortly after introducing the XENYX series, then brought it back.We've been using one for about nine years, toting it to and from church in a wheeled carry-on suitcase with cables, power cords and adapters stored in the lid.  The mixer shows no signs of giving up the ghost.  At a typical Saturday evening Mass, the ""choir"" consists of my wife and me.  A Behringer C2 condenser mic picks up both her voice and her C.F. Martin guitar.  I slip on a Shure WH20XLR headband mic.  My MacBook Pro's sound output is routed into a pair of line inputs for some pre-Mass meditative Muzak or for when we have to project a DVD or video on the screens.  When the children's or adult choir joins us, I plug in two more C2s, adequate for a whole choir.For hymns and songs, I dial a little Cathedral reverb (effect 01) into the final mix, allowing a few seconds of music to hang in the air when the singing stops.

"Next to me, my wife's most prized possession is her Martin guitar which she always strings with genuine C.F. Martin strings.  We originally used Dean Markley and Seymour Duncan pickups to hook the guitar into our mixer to be amplified by the church's sound system, but something was missing.  The sound coming over the speakers lacked the nuance and subtleties of the distinctive Martin sound.  Makes sense, because an inductance pickup is deaf to the rest of the guitar.Since she sings while she plays, one of these mics serves as both the guitar pickup and a vocalist's mic, blending the guitar and her voice into one pristine signal.  Another pair picks up an entire choir, leaving us one to spare for an additional soloist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IPV7Z52GXUGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CZ0RLU#wasThisHelpful","R3IPV7Z52GXUGA","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main difference between the 21st century version of this coffee maker and its mid-century incarnation is the color of the filter cone, the latter being transparent plastic.  The borosilicate glass carafe still bears the name Schott, one of Germany's most respected glass works. The design and operation are the same: slip in the filter, measure in the ground coffee, bloom it with a careful splash of boiling water, wait about a half- to a full minute, pour in the rest in a steady circular motion. When the water has drained through, take away the cone, slip on the keep-warm cover, pour and enjoy.  Yes, I know it's the same method as the Chemex that predates it in the USA and, yes, the Chemex coffee maker never lets the brewed coffee come into contact with plastic, but I'll lay odds that even the staunchest fan of Chemex or any other brand wouldn't be able to do much better than chance in a double-blind taste test.We keep this one on hand for when we're in the mood for some decaf with dessert, and the pour-over method seems to bring forth the fullest flavor.  The technique takes a little more precision than I can muster at 6:00 in the morning so we also have a programmable electric Melitta to perfume the house with the aroma of a fresh pot of coffee by the time the alarm clock goes off.The cone, carafe and lid can go into the dishwasher and, as an added bonus, the filter cone fits the carafe from our previous electric coffee maker, allowing continuous java production during a dinner party.  If there's a drawback, it's not the fault of the coffee maker itself but market dynamics that make #6 filters hard to find in bulk.  No biggie.  The ubiquitous #4 filter fits just fine and requires only a small adjustment to the pour-over rate.  Better yet, use the ""stopwatch"" method: after the first bloom, drizzle the water in a circular motion just enough to keep the grounds wet for 30 seconds, wait 30 seconds, repeat.  A little extra effort yields a lot more flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XREAU8GIO8MF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MIT2OK#wasThisHelpful","R1XREAU8GIO8MF","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[This review is for the 12-cup glass carafe model.]After 6 years, the DeLonghi developed a leak and by now it's at the recycling facility yielding up its recoverable components. During its final week, we used it to manually brew our coffee using the traditional Melitta pour-over method while waiting for this one to be delivered.  Once it arrived, life was back to normal, including waking to the aroma of a pot of hot coffee.This Melitta electric combines nearly every feature of every coffeemaker we've owned.  It uses the tried-and-true #4 filter which fits in a funnel-shaped basket.  This design ensures that all of the water passes through all of the coffee grounds, eliminating dry spots and under-extraction.  The clock and timer are no-brainer simple to set with separate hour and minute buttons, and the sapphire blue lighted display is easy for a tall user to read without bending, squatting or squinting.  A bright green LED confirms that the timer is set and ready to switch on at the preset time.  One not-so-obvious advantage is a swing-up lid over the basket instead of a hinged swing-out basket, allowing you to use the manual pour-over method during a power outage (that is, if you have a way to boil the water). The only thing it lacks is the DeLonghi's end-of-brew beep.We liked the ""aroma"" feature of our old DeLonghi and this Melitta's ""Robust"" brew-strength setting does the same thing: cycling the heated water flow on and off at approximately 30-second intervals so the coffee grounds alternately bloom and soak to develop a deeper flavor reminiscent of perked coffee without the grounds and sediment.  ""Bold"" shortens the pauses and ""Regular"" is the traditional constant flow method.Among its best features is the spout on the carafe: a simple lip that never dribbles, even when you desperately pour that first cup with an unsteady not-yet-caffeinated hand.*Melitta Bentz, inventor of the Melitta drip coffee maker and founder of the company that bears her name.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNYNRU13TCELK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPK8#wasThisHelpful","RNYNRU13TCELK","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The bull's eye store was once a reliable source for coffee filters in bulk, but those days are long gone. Ditto for the ubiquitous corner drugstore chains. Even the upstart cost-cutting mini grocers sell No. 4 cone coffee filters at boutique prices.Rockline is the second-biggest American producer of Melitta-type cone filters and the No. 1 producer of private label brands, so I know they can be trusted. Maybe my taste buds are pedestrian but I can't detect a difference in flavor when I brew 100% Colombian coffee with these filters or with unbleached filters.

"We've replaced canned tomato sauce in all of our favorite recipes with these ravishing red beauties from Italy and we're never going back. Aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can, these San Marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the Campania region of Italy.

"Buy a pressure cooker if you think you'll use it at least once a week.Buy this Fagor Splendid pressure cooker set and you'll use it a lot more often. At home on ANY kind of range (smooth-top or coil electric, gas, induction), the two pots and their interchangeable lids add versatility to speed, and that equals more bang for your cookware buck (pardon the bad pun). The glass lid turns the 8-quart pot into a handy stockpot or pasta boiler. Put the lid on the 4-quart pan and, voila, it becomes that extra saucepan you never seem to have when you really, really need one. When dinner's ready but you're not (pressure cookers are rocket-fast, you know), replace the pressure lid with the glass lid to keep it warm without overcooking or drying out.The stainless steel basket isn't big enough to hold a pound of long dry pasta, despite the photo, but it's the vessel of choice for shorter cuts like penne and rotelle, and for blanching filled pastas like ravioli and pirogies. Set it atop the trivet and it becomes the perfect steamer, whether you use the glass or pressure lid. And if it happens to fit a pot you already own, consider it a bonus.Fagor pressure cookers are among the easiest to use and care for. Instead of a wobbling weight or a ringed post pressure indicator, Fagor uses a spring-loaded pressure regulator. Heat the cooker on high heat until steam begins to flow from the regulator, start your timer and then back off the heat to maintain a steady gentle hiss. Once you've found your stove's sweet spot, you're not chained to the cooktop. As long as you can see steam or hear the hiss, you can go about your other cooking tasks. Wobbling weight regulators can be thrown off if the pot is jostled, and sealed-system pressure cookers require a constant eye on the number of visible rings. The regulator is also the pressure release valve, engineered so that the steam dissipates and cools quickly. At six inches from the vent, the steam is warm but not hot enough to burn your skin. Remember, this is steam that's 250 degrees Fahrenheit when it's under pressure!To keep the cook safe, Fagor pressure cookers have three locking mechanisms. The manual latch engages a pressure-activated locking pin that rises as pressure builds, keeping the cooker locked as long as pressure is present. The pressure itself pushes the flanges on the lid and pot together, creating a natural locking action. You'd have to be built like Mister Universe to force open a pressurized cooker. A small cutout in the lid exposes a portion of the gasket. If the pressure has no other way out, the gasket will stretch or snap, but will stay in place while the pressure escapes through the rim of the lid, not into the cook's face.Odds are, whatever you pressure cook in one pot will be served with something you can prepare in the other as well. We use the 4-quart pot to pressure cook spaghetti sauce with quarter-pound meatballs in just 10 minutes under pressure, while the 8-quart pot and glass lid take care of the spaghetti. Every piece in the set, except the pressure lid and gasket, can go in the dishwasher. Your humble author uses Bar Keeper's Friend to take care of any really tough discoloration. Keeping the gasket clean is easy because it's so easy to remove and replace. With weekly use and proper care, a gasket lasts about 12 to 18 months. The money you save on energy will more than pay for a new gasket.If you've never heard of Fagor or you're wondering if it's a brand a pro would use, just note how many are used in a typical episode of Iron Chef America.  Can you think of a better endorsement?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRBJ3CI0UT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009MGNO6#wasThisHelpful","R2LRBJ3CI0UT7","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why do internet service providers provide such wimpy phone line cords with their DSL modems and gateways?  It's almost as if they don't want you to get the speed you're paying for.  If the phone line is static-free but hammered by external interference from CFL bulbs, cordless phones and even the Wi-Fi signal from the router or gateway, your ISP compensates by momentarily disconnecting the line and reconnecting at the next lower speed.  Even worse, it's a one-way street.  Once the speed has dropped, it won't go back up unless you cold-boot the modem or gateway.  Log into the modem's setup screen and check its connection speed (don't log into the router's setup screen and don't use a site like speedtest.net for this).  Ideally, it should be at least 80% of the promised speed.  If it's not, this cable might be what you need.The shielding reduces external interference so the wire can deliver every megabit to your modem with fewer re-sends and dropped packets.  Get it along with a heavy-duty noise filtering surge suppressor like the Furman SS-6B Steel Power Strip and Amazon pays for the shipping.

If this Furman power strip can filter out power line noise for DJs and musicians, could it do the same for computer gear?Yes.  I even thrash-tested it by rapidly flipping the reverse switch on the document shredder to bombard the room with EMI mini-bursts, calling my home phone from my iPhone and flickering the lights on and off.  The line stayed up, and has done so since I replaced the wimpy power strip with this one.  The faster your DSL line, the more you need this kind of power protection.  It won't fix problems on the DSL line itself, but it will deliver clean noise-free power to your DSL modem or gateway, and many times, that's all you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2998MFI0VXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D017M#wasThisHelpful","RD2998MFI0VXA","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Things sure have changed since I gave my mother a Presto Harvest Gold pressure cooker back in the last century. Fagor replaces the wobbling weight with a captive spring-loaded pressure regulator. Instead of a rubber plug that blasts out of the lid in the event of excess pressure, the Fagor's emergency release is a cutout portion of the lid that exposes part of the gasket. The gasket stretches but if it should snap, it would stay in place and the steam would escape out the side, not into the cook's face. To earn the Underwriters' Laboratories seal, Fagor pressure cookers feature a pressure-activated safety lock in addition to the manual latch. You'd have to be built like Mister Universe to force open a pressurized cooker.In operation, the Fagor behaves a little differently than a weight-regulated pressure cooker. On the latter, you have to determine if the weight is wobbling at just the right rhythm. The weight should waggle but not bang against the vent stem. With the Fagor, all you have to see or hear is a gentle constant flow of steam. The regulator knob is also the release valve, should you wish to depressurize the cooker immediately instead of allowing the pressure to drop naturally. The steam is routed through a fan-shaped outlet, allowing it to disperse and cool quickly. At six inches from the outlet, the steam is warm but not burning hot.So far, the cooker has performed as promised. Lentil soup with diced smoked sausage cooked up thick and flavorful in just 10 minutes under pressure. Ditto for spaghetti sauce and whole links of Italian sausage. The sauce had intense flavors of garlic and herbs, and the sausage came out juicy with a hint of snap in the casing. Three pounds of diced red potatoes and the peeled cloves from a whole bulb of garlic were ready to mash in 6 minutes.The amazingly short cooking times omit the time required for the cooker to come up to pressure which can take about 10 minutes. Still, you save a lot of time overall.Keeping the all-important gasket clean is a cinch because it's so easy to remove and replace. The lid and pot are made of gleaming 18/10 stainless steel with an encapsulated aluminum base that cooks over any gas or electric heat source as well as the latest induction cooktops. When it's time to clean up, you can use cleaners like Bar Keeper's Friend on the inside and out, but if the discoloration is from cooking lentils, split peas, potatoes or beans, it's iron and other minerals that are good for you. Just wash and dry the pot and put it away until you're ready to prepare spaghetti sauce or some other high acidity recipe. You'll get back a little nutrition and you won't have to scour your pressure cooker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDVDF61L5HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000717AU#wasThisHelpful","R3TDVDF61L5HL","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With nearly the same footprint and dimensions as the printer it replaced in our house, the Brother HL-2270DW begs the question: ""Where did they hide the duplexer?""  If you're an IT support tech, the mention of the word ""duplexer"" usually causes you to cringe because you tend to hear it as ""Oh, Joe!  The printer in Human Resources won't print!  It says 'DUPLEXER ERROR'!""  In office printers, the duplexer is a big complicated Rube Goldberg contraption prone to jamming, usually around page 71 of a 75-page print job.  Its job is intercepting each sheet of paper after the first side has been printed, flipping and orienting it correctly and sending it back through the printer's imaging engine.  When all goes well (about as often as planetary grand alignments), each sheet emerges printed on both sides, saving paper (thus, trees).In this Brother SoHo printer, the duplexer is so well integrated and so far, so reliable, you're almost tempted to attribute its performance to pixies.  Contrary to others' experiences, every Mac in the house found this printer on the first try after I added it to our WiFi network using the USB cable method.  Setting it up in Windows 7 running under Boot Camp required manually configuring a TCP/IP port.There's not much to say about the print quality except, if you can't see the difference, why pay the difference for a more expensive printer?  If at least half of what you print is black and white text, and you want to save paper doing it, look no further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAZB68N3RO4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450DVDY#wasThisHelpful","R3BAZB68N3RO4C","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An online small appliance parts store wants twenty bucks plus tax and shipping for a replacement carafe for our DeLonghi coffeemaker.  We've been cleaning the tank regularly with vinegar, so we might just get a decade's use out of it.  When the original carafe developed a dribble near the spout I went shopping for a replacement here on Amazon.com and read more about this one on Medelco's website [medelcoinc(dot)com].At about half the price and with FREE Super Saver Shipping, this one wins the prize.  As recommended on the ""Product Fits List"" at Medelco's website, I removed the pause-n-pour mechanism since we never steal a cup before the coffee's ready.

"""Holy frickin' moly!"" comes close.  ""Miracle""?  Perhaps a little too powerful.I plugged a pair of Sylvania Silverstar Ultra headlights into my 1996 Subaru Legacy sedan and . . . bleah.  Where's that intense white near-HID light I paid for?!A non-abrasive headlight restoration kit yielded negligible results.  The Manny-Moe-Jack chain wanted at least half a C-note as did my trusted shadetree mechanic.  When I asked him about the 3M kit, he admitted, ""It's what we use.""  Next stop: Amazon.com.I read the reviews, watched the video and gambled the price at the local O'Reilly (I was impatient) where the counter guy continued the litany of praise.  Armed with my Ryobi 18 volt drill and the rest of the required tools, I plunged right in and restored the headlight with the worst corrosion, including a snowy white oxidized silhouette of a mountain range along the bottom.  I was skeptical, believing nothing would remove the oxidation.  Amazingly, it sanded right out.  Upon completion, I stepped back and reveled for a few moments in the difference.  After a battery recharge (yes, it takes the power of 2 battery packs per headlight), I finished the task and topped it off with a quick trip to an automated car wash to remove the restoration residue.  A bottle of 3M's lens cleaner and protectant is on its way from Amazon.comAnd, yes, I've posted a before-and-after photo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85IVQC4S36LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AIZ5HY#wasThisHelpful","R85IVQC4S36LN","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before we replaced our hardware store house brand garbage disposer with a new Waste King (which liquefies food waste instead of turning it into sewer pesto), kitchen sink drain clogs were at least a twice-a-year event.  A SoCal plumber advertises on the radio that he'll clear almost any clog for ""just $99"", so I'm already a few hundred bucks ahead.Most recently, I used the Drain King to blast a clog out of a slow shower drain at my mother's house.  A plumber had ballparked an estimate of around $2,500 for a worst-case scenario after repeated uses of chemical drain cleaners and plungers had failed.  With nothing to lose, I called in the Drain King and His Majesty did not disappoint.  A nearby garden hose was long enough to reach to the shower drain, so I shoved the Drain King in as far as it would go and held it in place while my mother turned on the water.  The Drain King sang its distinctive song.  I knew it was working because if the water had backed up with nowhere to go, the pulsating sound would have slowed to a stop.  Instead, I let it work for a full five minutes, followed by a 10-minute hot water flush.Clean drain, happy mother, and another $99 saved.

Next, I switched to the blade and pureed the tomato paste with half of the beef broth in my recipe.  I rinsed the San Marzano plum tomato cans with the remaining broth and poured it into the bowl to rinse out the rest of the tomato paste mixture.Cleanup is easy because every removable part is dishwasher-safe and KitchenAid includes a handy spatula that fits into the various nooks and crannies.

We had been doing the dishes with the help of an impostor, and not a very good one.  When it came time to replace it, we ordered up this one and my building inspector brother-in-law was happy to put it in, insisting that we install the new WASTE KING drain flange so the world would know we made a good choice.True to everyone else's experience, removing the old 3-bolt mount unit took more time and effort than installing the Waste King.  Once it was in, we treated it to its first meal: chicken bones from Popeyes.  Though it lacks the sound shielding of its costlier siblings, the Waste King L-1001 purrs quietly enough to let you carry on a conversation and the grinding noise is just loud enough to tell you it's doing the job.  You can also hear the higher RPMs (2,600 versus 1,800 or so).If you buy a Waste King, don't be alarmed by the loud CLANK! when you switch it on (If you're an ancient IT pro, it'll remind you of the loud startup click emitted by certain early hard disk drives).  According to the documentation, it's the anti-jam swivel impellers swinging into place.  If it sounds like it's laboring, it's really raising the torque to handle tougher food waste.

"Far too often, snazzy jazzy styling is wrapped around mediocre hardware. Not so with these headphones.

Pay a visit to your PC maker's website, let 'em scan your system and grab all the latest hardware drivers.With the OEM version, you don't get both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. For most users bringing along their XP-generation software and most peripherals, 32-bit is the best choice, especially on PCs with a maximum capacity of 4GB of RAM. If your PC has one of the latest Intel Core i-series processors, you'll reap the benefits of Hyper-threading, giving you the performance of 4 32-bit cores. Opt for the 64-bit version if you have a PC with a Core 2 Duo processor or better and have boosted the RAM beyond 4GB.So, if you're ready for Windows 7 and don't have a pile of cash to burn for the full retail version, order up and have a ball!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BBV3SIJ7XMAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NGJNZM#wasThisHelpful","R2BBV3SIJ7XMAM","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The facilities engineer at work was about to throw out this clock because it couldn't find the signal from radio station WWVB in our office building.  Since we already own one La Crosse Technology clock, I took it off his hands and saved it from the dumpster.Our first radio-controlled clock is hanging on the inside of an exterior wall that runs north/south, so the antenna is oriented for optimal reception.  When that clock was delivered, it set itself to the correct time within seconds of inserting the battery and hanging it on the wall while the sun was still up.  Most radio-controlled clocks won't sync until the wee hours of the A.M.This clock is in a more precarious location on an interior wall that runs east/west.  It's also hanging directly above our TV set.  With the TV and DISH Network satellite TV receiver turned off, I slipped in the battery, pressed the PT (Pacific Time zone) button and hung the clock on the wall at about 6:00pm local time.  True to form, the hands paused for about a minute or two before spinning wildly until all three hands were in sync with the first clock.  A phone call to NIST's time service (303 499 7111) confirmed the accuracy.  Days later, the second hands on both clocks still advance with the ticks on the phone.

"We had two plastic colanders.  One melted and warped as I was trying to drain some cooked bacon bits for a baked bacon cheeseburger mac.  The other has such large holes that I tended to lose a strand or two of spaghetti through the bottom.  This one's just right for both tasks.  I can drain and toss the spaghetti to my heart's content without worrying about the random escapee.  It certainly seems up to the task of draining cooked bacon and browned ground beef, plus it cleans like a dream.  It handled turkey bones and the cooked-limp vegetables from a batch of turkey stock admirably without letting the undesirable stuff into the final product.I'll keep the plastic colander for washing veggies and stuff, but when it's time to handle the hot stuff, this is the one I'm reaching for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SS70LYHTMEY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CDP536#wasThisHelpful","R2SS70LYHTMEY3","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Western Digital makes great high-capacity hard drives.  Western Digital makes lousy external enclosures for them.  When my WD My Book Home external hard drive started flaking out and wouldn't back up my iMac and MacBook Pro with Time Machine, I thought all the saved data was lost.  I took it apart to see what might be done to rescue the data and found a fatal design flaw.  The USB/FireWire interface unit is attached to the 500Gb Caviar drive, absorbing much of the heat generated by the drive.  Over time, the heat fried the electronics.I perused Amazon's selection of drive enclosures and chose this one for its built-in cooling fan.  A few Free Super Saver Shipping Days later, the enclosure arrived and the installation went without a hitch, requiring only a Phillips screwdriver.  The StarTech enclosure comes with a full-size USB cable, not a mini-USB as on the My Book.  I wouldn't be surprised if shoving all that data through a mini-USB interface is another factor in generating excess heat.When I first fired up the drive, it still wouldn't connect to Time Machine, but after a couple repair runs in Disk Utility, it's purring along nicely and hasn't missed a single scheduled backup.The enclosure's fan emits a quiet drone that's no more objectionable than the sound of the drive in the original My Book's plastic enclosure, which relied on convection alone for cooling and provided no sound insulation.  The aluminum exterior is barely warm to the touch and never gets as hot as the My Book's enclosure.  If plastic is hot, that's a bad thing because plastic is an insulator, not a heat conductor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VB9FL5K2ITEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UZH4FY#wasThisHelpful","R2VB9FL5K2ITEE","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Since my MacBook Pro is with me every Saturday and two Sundays a month to project hymn lyrics on our twin LCD projectors at church, it only made sense to record the choir on the MacBook as well.  Our Behringer XENYX mixer came with the UCA200 USB interface and since it's the church's property, I needed a USB interface of my own.  The UCA202 is a perfect step up.By hooking the signal from the mixer's 1-2 subgroup to the UCA202, I get a clean recording that I can further tweak with Audacity (available from audacity . sourceforge . net). The main mix with a little cathedral reverb from the mixer goes off to the church's sound system.  The UCA202 does the heavy lifting, freeing up precious CPU cycles.  Audacity never misses a note and Microsoft PowerPoint never freezes or stutters.At home, we use the UCA202 to transfer vinyl into the digital realm.  And if we're feeling patient, we can isolate and eliminate clicks and pops.Oh, the things we can do with modern technology.

"Having written the most rated review for a flip-over Belgian waffle maker, I found myself craving the classic ""American""-style waffle after ordering one at the local Spires restaurant. We found this Cuisinart iron at Macy's so I whipped out my debit card.It takes only 1/3 cup of my own waffle batter recipe to fill the grids (and then some, given the tiny overflow rim) but the stainless steel exterior shrugs off overflows after the iron cools. Three minutes' baking time on the number 3 setting does the job nicely. Despite the small size, the lid has enough heft to press down on the batter and force it upward into the top grid. After the third batch of waffles, the grids became so well seasoned that they no longer need a shot of cooking spray.As with my review of the Belgian waffle maker, updates will be posted as they happen.

"I ordered this stud finder along with a pot rack because I wanted to hang it properly.  The Zircon i520 showed me that there wasn't a stud for the pot rack's upper center support.  It also showed some sort of metal cladding on one of the studs.  Armed with that knowledge, my wife Cathy bought a precut piece of plywood and painted it to match the wall.  I pre-drilled starter holes in the left stud to get past the metal, and then secured the plywood to the studs.  I was then able to secure all three support points on the pot rack to the plywood.  The result, as you can see from the picture I've posted, is stable and sturdy.Moral of the story: spend less than fifty bucks now and save hundreds you would have spent fixing the wall later.UPDATE: When I replaced the switch for the food waste disposer, the Zircon MultiScanner verified that all the power was off in the duplex switch box by the kitchen sink.

"There are two reasons to have a pot rack.  It keeps the pots and pans you use most often within easy reach.  And it lets you flaunt your trophy cookware, like my Infinite Circulon collection.  What were once stacked and hidden away in a cabinet with dishcloths as cushions are now proudly displayed in your humble author's kitchen, safely separated to protect the nonstick surfaces.Our kitchen presented an installation challenge.  As in most American suburban homes, the studs behind the drywall are 16 inches apart while the mounting points on the pot rack are horizontally spaced 8 inches apart.  Securing the side supports to studs leaves the top center support weak and prone to pulling free from the drywall. Conversely, anchoring only the top center support to a stud puts too much strain on the side supports, causing them to dig into the drywall over time.Our solution: Cathy bought a precut 23 by 23 inch sheet of plywood and painted it to match the wall.  I secured the plywood to the left and right studs and then attached the pot rack to the plywood. The result, as you can see in the photo I posted, is sturdy and stable yet pleasing to the eye. Rightly, some have pointed out that the anchor screws are difficult to get to but I was still able to maneuver a Ryobi power drill into position and drive home the screws.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OCF0Q94CMU3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005RF5M#wasThisHelpful","R3OCF0Q94CMU3X","A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6VPIOPMDJ8H7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This ring it a great bright color and very comfortable to wear. It is very different from the normal black rings that are going around. The pink has not faded at all and still looks like the day I got it.  It is stretchy so it fits half sizes well. I wear it all the time and forget that I have it on.

"These are great for those rough nights when you need something instant. They do not dissolve as easily as others that we have tried but they are powerful and they have a lasting effect. I also like that you can crushed these and add then to water for the little ones they are not good at chewing. The bottle is a plastic royal blue and has a silver tin screw on top. The bottle has a very old fashion feel. My 19 month old has his two year molars trying to cut in and these help at night and since they are natural I like them better than pumping him with pain meds.

"This amber teething set by QBebe  has to be the best amber set I have seen. The beads are clear and bright. I love how they are polished and lightweight that my little guy forgets he even has them on.  He is not even two yet but he is cutting those stubborn molars and I have noticed that when he is wearing his necklace he is not chewing on everything and he is not cranky.  This is a great alternative to help him instead of medicine. And he looks so cute wearing the necklace. I have gotten a lot of compliments from people that have seen us out that are happy I am taking a natural way to help him. I did not know that there were so many people that knew about the powers of amber. I have three kids and with my older two I did not know anything about this.  the necklace's clasp is two beads that screw together tight so you do not have to worry about the child getting it off. each bead has a knot in between them so if by chance it does break not all of the beads will come off. I love the burlap pouch and the certificate of authenticity is very reassuring.

"These culinary scissors are the the perfect addition to your kitchen you did not even know you needed until you have them and you are chopping everything like a mad woman. They are easy on your fingers and  are super sharp. They are just like regular scissors but with 5 super sharp blades. I have cut herbs with them  but they are fun to cut slices of honey dew and watermelon for a small finger food salad for a toddler. or slices of celery in your dinner. You can even look on pintrest and use these for craft projects but I suggest you either buy one for food and one for crafts or you thoroughly clean these.

"The design of this chopper is wonderful. The collection tray is really big so you can chop multiple vegetables at once and quickly. This is very easy to use and the blades are sturdy and extremely sharp. I have read reviews how some people had an issue with the blades bending and I truly do not see this happening unless you are not using this for what it is intended for. The teeth on the cap are secure in the cap and I do not see any of these breaking unless you are miss using this product. The instructions are very simple if you need to use them. This chopper come completely apart to clean the blades pop in and out of the holding tray. the chopper comes with a comb to help clean and get any bits of food out of the teeth if you need to. The peeler that is an extra bonus is very sharp with a nice handle that is easy  to grip. I like how everything fits in the bin underneath for easy storage. The possibilities are endless with this awesome kitchen tool. i used honey dew and cut into chunks and chopped them into fruit fries for my toddler. the rubber buttons on the bottom of the chopper help it to not slide on the counter while you are chopping.

"I love the ability now to be hands free and just block out the world listening to my music. These Venstar wireless headphones are the best quality bluetooth headphones that I have tried out. They fit in my ear perfectly and the sound quality is A+ quality. I can clean the house and not have to worried about being caught up in a cord. Plus, I have the Note 4 and it is hard to lug the phone around. The design is very sleek and the headphones are simple to pair to your device when you have the device ready you connect to Venstar w202 and when you are connected the headphones tell you... When connected there is a blue light that flashes on one ear bud that contains the power button, mic and volume buttons. Both buds are connected but a flat rubber cord that is not really noticeable or felt when you are wearing them. The charging port is on the on the second bud is covered by a flap so it can not get dirty if you were wearing this out doing chores.  you can be an estimated  35-30 feet from your device. I love the duel feature of having  your phone and another device connected. I get a lot of notifications on my phone so listening to my music sometimes is a pain so I will use my tablet and since I can have both paired I do not miss a call. The earbuds tell you the number that is calling so you do not have to run to your phone to see who is calling.

"when you purchase this item you get 12  cpu rivets. they are made of a durable rubber that prevents any vibration. Vibration after a while will cause a screw to come loose and in a computer a loose screw will cause a lot of damage and cost a lot of money in the long run. they install very easily and fit nice and snug.  They are of a universal design so they can be used on different models. They are great for a computer repair company or just the average geek that is updating their system. They are surprisingly flexible and yet they are very strong at holding the fan in place. They are also easy to remove from the cpu if you need to change the fan. I recommend this to anyone that does not like to have a noisy machine. Even though they are made of rubber they do not smell of rubber when the machine gets warm.

"I am a full outside sideline, playground, scout type of mom. I am always outdoors cheering my kids on. I have this clipped to my purse or i will clip it on the stroller.

I have a leather purse and this did not stain it from me clipping it to the handle. The clip is strong and the pouch is sewn together really well. the clip is small that you almost do not even  realize it is clipped on. I have also had to on my keys.

"This cellphone mount is all you will ever need to keep your phone in one place while you are moving or just lounging at home watching videos. This has basically became my cellphone's best friend. I have a Note 4  which makes it hard for me to find a mount that is for a bigger phone. This grips right onto the stroller for our daily walks and  it also fits either on the steering wheel or the vents in the car. Not only is it for phones but can hold water bottles and sippy cups!! I have it on my phone at all times now. I work from home and having it propped up is easy to check emails or even have a conference call. The mount is made of super think plastic that in my opinion indestructible. both ends of the mount stretch pretty far and close right back to the original size. if you do get it dirty it washes right off with soap and water.  This also comes with a necklace holder for your phone. I do not use this not because it does not work with my phone but to my my phone is too heavy for it but my son loves it for is ipod touch.

"This has to be the coolest cellphone mount I have ever used. i am always scared to use the one on the vent during the winter because I am scared the heat will mess my phone up. I also have a note 4 and it is hard to find a mount that will fit it perfectly and not either be too snug it takes a tug to get it out of the mount. but this one releases just fine and holds my  phone perfectly in place. The phone mount slides about  into your CD player and holds firmly to the phone mount.The 3 different rubber pieces make it pretty universal and fit perfectly into the payer. It slides in about an inch. I love how it has a bottom to the holder part so your phone is not like floating. it is easy to pull and push so it fits the phone just right. and since it is down by your cd player it is out of your view and at night you do not see a glare if the phone lights up.

"First I would like to tell you at little bit about myself before I jump into these headphones. I am a work at home mother to 3 children and I am a full time student at Kaplan University. Two of which go to school and one that is a very independent and stubborn 18 month old. My home office becomes the community room very often. (should have never put the love seat in when I was decorating)  The noise canceling feature is wonderful when the husband is on kid duty and I am trying to take my class or listen back on a conference call that was recorded earlier in the day. The fact that these are blue tooth also makes it easy to chase the kids around also by listening, There is not wire pulling  or tripping unless of course I do have the wire plugged in since these headphones have the ability to be wireless or wired. the headphones are light and fit on your ears comfortably. they have a very sleek look. the box that they come in is very well thought out for storage of these headphones when you are not using them. The range they fit is goes from my 18 month old to my big headed husband. ( shh do not tell him) I have tested these on many genres of music and I love how the sound is carried and how the bass hits. They do not take very long to charge and they stay charged for quite a while and like I had stated you can use the cord given if you do run out of battery. they charge with a usb cord that is the same as my note 4 so if i do not have the cord with me I can just use my phone charger. these will give you a completely new listening experience and they are extremely functional with a great look.

"To finally have a great quality facial brush is an awesome treat to myslef.  I do not have the time to go to the spa and this is a great way to have some time to make myself feel beautiful and to take care of myself.  The fact that this is multifunctional is a great feature and saves me space and money since I do not have to make different purchases. I loved the brush attachment the most overall it felt like a tickle gently brushing away the dirt and oils on my skin. My face feels so much lighter.  The pumas attachment is for getting rid of dead skin. My skin so refreshed it felt like I had done a facial at the spa.

"This travel set is first off a money saver after the first use. Most travel size products  are about a dollar a piece and that is if you can find the products you are going to use in travel size bottles. If not, this is where this set comes into perfect use. The bottles and the tops for the bottles are sturdy and they are definitely reusable. The tops screen on perfectly. I like the variety of bottle sizes and designs that are included in the set because you can use these for everyday use. I have a face mist that I love but the bottle is big so I have a spray bottle from this set is in my gym bag. I make my own lotion and I used a lotion bottle for my purse. I have bragged about this set to all of my friends and family. This zip lock reusable bag that the set comes with is a great bonus because it keeps the set together. This set includes: 2 oz pump bottle, 2 oz flip-cap bottle, 1 oz.spray bottle, 1 oz.flip-cap bottle,  2 of the 0.5 oz flip-cap bottle, 2 of the 0.5 oz. cream jars,  2 of the 0.35 oz. cream jars, 2 of the 0.1 oz. cream jars, 1 pipette, 1 funnel (which I think could be a better design it takes forever to use) , and  1 spatula.I received this at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZNKD2URNN19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01470VEOE#wasThisHelpful","RCZNKD2URNN19","AS8K2326H08KZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS8K2326H08KZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Why weren't these around when my oldest 2 were little. These are wonderful and since we rent our home I have to be careful about making modifications to the cabinets. you do not do any damage to these at all. 3m is a wonderful product and you can tell this company making these took pride in using the best. We have a constant battle with my 18 month old and my drawers in my kitchen. These do not open now without the knob and that is great. Except for when the hubby does not put the knob back in the hiding spot. My son has realized that we have outsmarted him and not he pulls and pulls on it until he gets bored. At first I would he was going to pop the drawer open but he cant!!!! I was always nervous with the screw in kinds that you have to  reach in and push down to open fully because you can easily pinch your fingers. The outlet covers are a great bonus. You can honestly never have enough of them. and these fit in perfect and he cant get them out which is nice.

So why not protect it with a glass screen that is meant to take a beating. You must read the instructions thoroughly and follow them step by step or you will mess it up and there is no going back. BUT once you do have it on your phone you can rest assured you phone is protected.  The screen fits it perfectly and now you can throw your phone n your purse and you do not have to worry about your keys scratching it. My husband can have the phone in his pocket with screws and nails and the phone wont be scratched up. I love this company and their screen. I did receive this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKZPSXG6ZPGM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIK6I2S#wasThisHelpful","RKZPSXG6ZPGM1","AS8K2326H08KZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AS8K2326H08KZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a well-made polo shirt from Oxford NY. The material is soft and comfortable. The thickness is exactly what I look for in pull-over shirts. There are a couple of minor issues that I think are important enough to point out. First the sizing tends to be on the small size. The shirt fits close to the body and in the sleeves. If it were a half-size larger, it would be perfect, but since that's not available, I would order a full size larger for myself. The second issue is that it is rather short by a few inches and it doesn't fit well when tucked into the waistband of your pants. The shirt is made to be worn outside your waistband, but even so, it isn't long enough to suit my preference. There is no shirt pocket and the collar lies flat. The discounted  price is excellent for the quality, so I may consider getting more shirts, but at the next larger size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJYUS0V5IMU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXISRMM#wasThisHelpful","R3GJYUS0V5IMU1","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Oxford NY crew neck t-shirt is much nicer than I expected. The quality of the stitching and the material is excellent. It is medium weight material and is neither too thin or too heavy for year-round wear. The length is the same as my Polo shirts and longer than my Jockey shirts.Pro: It has actual soft labels stitched into the neck. This is a huge plus for me. One thing I dislike about the majority of t-shirts being made today is that they leave off the label, which makes it difficult to tell which direction the shirt is facing when getting dressed.Con: The shirt is just a bit tight across the shoulders and back, so if I raise up one or both arms over your head, the shirt tail will pull up. This doesn't happen in my Polo shirts which are cut to be more relaxed across the back and in the sleeves. Maybe I just have bigger than average shoulders. While I still prefer the Polo fit as my ""gold standard"", the Oxford NY shirt is almost as good and the price is better than what I have paid for the Polo shirts in the past. So this  ""con"" is not a deal breaker and I would definitely buy the Oxford again and I do recommend it. If I were wearing it when being very active with a lot of arm movement, I would get one size larger, but for average wear, I would stick with my exact size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DACLKVC8MKDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXITHPI#wasThisHelpful","R2DACLKVC8MKDQ","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally a freezer bag that lives up to the task! The last box I bought from ""Brand X"" was terrible and literally fell apart in my hands when I opened and closed them. These Hefty gallon-size freezer storage bags have the best zip-closure I've seen. Once closed, I could not force the bag to open until I unzipped it with the slider. The interlocking closure has a rounded edge to it that helps to protect the seal and keep something else from rubbing open the bag by accident. The closure has a very slight click sound when it is fully closed, which is a nice idea. The bag itself is thick and has a white rectangle on it for writing down the date and/or the contents. Definitely a quality bag to store and protect your expensive foods.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIW7MCVZQKSDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUJ5UZC#wasThisHelpful","RIW7MCVZQKSDN","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned 2 Remington MB200 models, which I liked, but the only problem was that the battery didn't last long. This Remington MB4045 model has all of the positive features of the older MB200, plus it has a powerful Lithium-Ion battery which is expected to last longer. The MB4045 also provides 3 length-adjustable heads to let you trim long, medium, and very short (stubble) beards. The MB200 only had a single adjustable head. The MB4045 also has a pop-up trimmer in the back for sharp edge trimming of sideburns and around mustaches and van dyke style beards. This is quicker/easier than having to break out a razor and shaving cream for those areas.The kit includes a pair of scissors and a hairbrush as accessories. The scissors are much too small for me to put my fingers in the handle holes. My hands are probably medium in size. So the scissors are useless to me. The bristles on the hairbrush are short and very stiff. The overall brush length is also very small and I can't easily hold it by the handle. Both of the accessory items are made more for the hands of a small woman or man. I would have preferred getting a small comb and a groomer cleaning brush as the MB200 kit provides. I took off one star for the disappointing accessories, but the groomer itself is excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IQZT8WWHI07X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SG5WOK#wasThisHelpful","R2IQZT8WWHI07X","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm disappointed in the Swiffer 360 product. It's OK, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. Fortunately I have a box of the original blue Swiffers on hand, which work great. The original Swiffers have less material and are more open in construction, so they capture and hold more dust than this version in my opinion. This 360 version is so tightly packed with fibers that there is no room for the dust to go, so whatever dust that doesn't stick on the outermost surface just falls on the floor or goes up into the air. I think it was a good idea to take a regular Swiffer and make it a 360 version, but they should have stopped there instead of also making the product denser and changing the way it picks up dust.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1NS9ATB259P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLUOM1W#wasThisHelpful","R3R1NS9ATB259P","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The dispenser box doesn't work very well. The bottom flap is too small to pull out a single packet of oil. When you pull out one, a couple more come out with it. I think a top opening flap would be better.The oil itself does smell like raw coconut, but I didn't find the taste of it to be all that strong. I made popcorn with it and the kitchen smelled like toasted coconut. The flavor of coconut was enhanced by the cooking, and it tasted pretty good on popcorn. I found it to be less heavy than regular cooking oils, which added to the pleasant taste. I also found that it works really well when added to fruit salads.As a skin lotion, it seems effective as a lubricant and not sticky. The coconut fragrance is pleasant on the skin.It does seem to be a bit expensive, but you are paying in part for the convenience of having small travel packets.

"These Hefty cups are acceptable for adults, but understand that they are very thin and flimsy compared to other plastic cups you can buy. Children with their small hands will squeeze the cup and cause the sides to collapse. So it is not a cup I would recommend for kids. Adults don't have that dexterity problem managing a flimsy cup, but even so, the sides of the cup collapse when held, so you might want to warn your guests when serving drinks. The embossed diamond pattern is there to reduce slipping, but this is an example where something has been engineered to the point that it becomes almost unusable in an effort to reduce cost and reduce waste. I think this design actually increases cost and waste since the cup is only usable once, while more sturdy plastic cups from other companies are washable and reusable many times. I can make plastic cups from other companies last through several uses, but this I would never use more than one time. The only way I can see to get around the problem with this design is to double stack the cups, which is really wasteful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GS4WQIWSYP33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y0FJMI#wasThisHelpful","R3GS4WQIWSYP33","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent quality graphics card. I'm using it to drive 4 monitors for a Flightgear simulator. I immediately upgraded the drivers when I installed the card and software. Monitor setup was frustrating and difficult, which I think may be more of an issue with Flightgear and/or Windows 7 and not the card itself. Specifically, the monitor numbering/order kept randomly switching each time I rebooted. Only after considerable trial and error over the course of 2 days and then adding the monitors one at a time was I able to use the ordering of the ports to correctly match the ordering needed by Flightgear. After acheiving success in the layout order, I've been able to successfully reboot to the same configuration each time. So if you run into a similar problem, just take good notes and systematically try different configurations adding the 3rd and 4th monitors individually and you will resolve the problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SMOPMWR6WIHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3NK2LE#wasThisHelpful","R2SMOPMWR6WIHG","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good product for the price. However, you need to be in a darkened room and also have your eyes dark-adapted to best appreciate the lighting effect. The barettes themselves are quite bright and have a multicolor LED that flashes at different rates and colors. There is only an off-on switch and no selection of constant light or a constant color. The ends of the fibers also are bright, even though the fibers are very thin and hair-like. However, the fibers themselves don't leak that much light from the side. So you need to see them in the dark for best effect as shown in the photo.I actually bought these as a source of optical fibers for another hobby project and this turned out to be a very good deal to get 12 batteries, 6 multicolor flashing LEDs, and a large quantity of fibers. Two of the barettes had strands that were somewhat bent becease they were kinked during packaging and one barette turned on sometime during the shipping and was not as bright as the others by the time I received it.

"Charmin is my favorite brand and Ultra Soft Mega rolls are the type I usually buy at the big-box store. However I decided to give the Ultra Strong Mega Roll version a try. I really can't tell any difference between the 2 versions in actual use. They both seem soft to me. I used a micrometer to compare the roll thickness to the Ultra Strong to the Ultra Soft. If I measure from the inside tube to the outer surface, the overall roll thickness averages 4.4 +/- 0.2 cm for the Ultra Soft Mega Roll (using compression by the thumb-roller on the micrometer),  while the Ultra Strong Mega rolls are slightly thinner (about 3.8 +/- 0.2 cm). So I think the difference is that the content of each sheet of the Ultra Soft is fluffed up more and that makes it more absorbent, while the Ultra Strong sheets have the fibers woven in a manner to be less resistant to tearing and are not as fluffed up. I don't have a way to measure the relative weights of each roll, but the physical length and width of each sheet is the same and the number of plys and sheets are the same for both brands. So the difference is that the Ultra Strong sheets must be very slightly less thick than the Ultra Soft because of the way the fibers are arranged.In any case, they are both excellent products I recommend, and whether you get the Ultra Strong or the Ultra Soft, you are going to get the same number of sheets and plys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI156FXYJ643/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DX5G92#wasThisHelpful","R3JI156FXYJ643","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So I see no measurable reduction in absorbent fiber content from what I purchased in the past.

"This is an OK printer. There are less expensive all-in-one models out there that have the same or even better specs, but lack the ""2-year"" supply of ink that this one comes with up front. So the price will likely even out or maybe even favor this Epson in the long run. However, you do have a higher up front cost in buying this Epson and you are gambling that it will last long enough to pay for itself. The ""2-year"" supply of ink is of course and estimate and depends entirely on your own usage.I think the strongest selling point for this Epson printer is the promise of having a single package that combnes printing, copying, faxing, and scanning and comes with pre-purchased ink reserves. This was a selling point for me since I have a 2 year contract coming up where I need to set up a remote office and this package gives me nearly everything I need from the start in a small package without the concern for buying extra ink for some time. I would have preferred a full duplex printer, which Epson does offer in a more expensive model. If saving paper is a major concern for you, look for that model instead. I do like the fact this is wireless and makes the installation location more flexible without the need to run cables.While this is a good package, there are some things that are lacking. First the printing quality is just average for color graphics. I wouldn't bother doing finished color photos with the printer since it doesn't have the kinds of inks needed for color photography. You need to buy a true photography style printer for that (Epson does sell those and I have one). But for business charts and graphs and draft photos on ordinary office paper, the color reproduction is OK. Second, I think it is just kind of slow all around. If you want faster printing, you might want to look at the printing speed of color laser printers. There are also some much faster business scanners. Third, the printer consumes your color inks even when just doing black-only printing. There is no need for this, since b/w printers do a perfectly good job of printing only with black ink. I fnd this a common and very frustrating aspect of today's color business printers since it not only wastes ink, but prevents the ability to print only in one color when that is all you need. This basically forces the customer to buy a separate b/w printer in order to have truly cost effective printing if that is the primary need in the office.So overall, I think this is an OK combo printer for color business graphics in a small office, but I think if you have the room, and you want the best equipment available, you might be better off separately purchasing a very fast b/w duplex laser printer, a color inkjet printer that is photography-capable, and a duplex scanner that can scan both sides of a document at once.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7WB94QBYBTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R1S7WB94QBYBTC","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Corsair RM750i is a high performance, high quality, low noise power supply for use in new custom computer systems or as a replacement for an existing system that needs to be upgraded or repaired. I won't go through all of the specs for this power supply. They are readily available here in the product listing and provided by some of the other reviewers. Here are some questions and answers that maybe some shoppers are thinking about:Q. Why would I need this?A. If your current power supply has failed and you need to replace it, or if you are upgrading an existing system with more power-hungry peripherals, you will need a power supply such as this one. At 750W, it gives you the power supply of a workstation. You can power multiple SATA cards, one or more multi-monitor graphcs cards, and other power-hungry peripherals. For me, this upgrade was needed in order to power a new Geforce graphics card for a research lab flight simulator using 4 monitors. Although I had an existing 750W power supply, I didn't have all of the connectors I needed to power the new card, plus the old power supply was often noisey under load. Anyone wanting to build their own custom system from scratch will need a reliable power supply, and this is an excellent choice for long-term use, particularly for a gaming system where intense graphcal rendering requirements are expected.Q. Is it easy to install as a replacement?A. Yes. Just remove the old power supply and replace it with this one. You will need to use a screwdriver and be somewhat mechanically inclined, but it is not a difficult replacement. All of the cabling uses connectors that are keyed so you can't accidentally plug a device into the wrong sized peripheral connector. Follow all of the common-sense rules when working with electrical devices. Also read the instructions before starting.Q. Is it highly rated?A. Yes, it has a gold-level 80-plus rating, which simply means it has above-average reliability for delivering consistent power output. The warranty period is for 7 years, which is probably longer than the average age of a system when it gets replaced with something newer. The RM750i also uses  high quality Japanese capacitors.  Having had smoked capacitors in a couple of NT-era workstations, it is a frustrating experience, particularly when the product is out of warranty. Here the capacitors are the best available, and the 7-year warranty will have you covered in the event that something does happen.Q. Does it have all of the connectors I need?A. It should have everything you need and then some, including cabling for all modern peripheral devices. You should need any other adaptors, unless you have some very unique server system that maybe has a large number of disk drives to power. I think for 99% of users, the included power cables will cover all of your needs. If you have any doubts, check the spec sheets before ordering and compare it to your peripheral devices and boards. All of the power cables are black, and personally I wish cables were in different colors to make them easier to identify inside of a computer case, but that is just me. I think most people don't care or they prefer the black cables. The power cord is of typical length and neither too long or too short.Q. Is it loud? Can I use this and not have it disturb others in the room, such as in a bedroom or a quiet office?A. The RM750i is very quiet! It is the quietest power supply I have ever owned. It uses no fan at all when drawing under 300W and above that the fan speed will ramp up. At the typical ambient temperature of a full 750W output, it has only 20 dB of sound coming out, which is equivalent to a whisper in an empty auditorium.Q. Is Corsair a good quality company that stands behind their products?A. I have been using Corsair products for many years and have never had a problem with any product they made. I've never had to use their warranty service, but I believe they stand behind their products and would not hesitate to recommend them.Q. Does the RM750i provide access to power monitoring?A. The i-system means that it interfaces with the Corsair Link digital monitoring and control system. This provides the power user with the ability to monitor temperatures and adjust fans speeds and coolant regulated heatsinks through a software interface. The Corsair Link product system  is described at their website.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CQMV6GP3WX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPNSQTU#wasThisHelpful","R13CQMV6GP3WX2","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This worked just as it should. I tested it using an InFocus VGA projector at 720p (the limit of the projector) and using a 6 foot VGA cable. The HDMI signal passed through to the VGA port without degrading, and I had no video problems while watching a movie from a DVD player. The Belkin adaptor was connected directly to the DVD player when I tested it.I noticed that the audio signal was slightly attenuated when passing through the HDMI adaptor as compared to a separate direct audio connection of the speakers to the DVD player, but this was not a significant reduction in volume. In fact, it was only noticable when I purposely changed the cabling to compare volume. I also can't say that the Belkin adapter was the cause, because the source of the attenuation could have occured within the HdDMI circuitry of the player itself.I did all of my testing with a USB power adaptor attached to the adaptor. When disconnected the power, the video and audio signal did not degrade in any noticable way. Use of a longer VGA cable or an HDMI cable might require the added power to always be used as described in the installation sheet.I think this is a great item, and it allows me to now use the video projector with DVD players or other HDMI enabled devices. Previously I could only use the projector with a VGA-ported computer, but the adaptor gives me more options for using this older equipment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXL2C7B2PDLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4TQ64Q#wasThisHelpful","R2CXL2C7B2PDLE","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product at no cost so I could examine it thoroughly and post my review on Amazon. The review expresses my personal opinion.Completeness of the model kit: 5/5Overall durability of the parts: 5/5Play/Fun potential: 5/5*Imagination potential; 5/5*Teaching potential: 5/5**Potential will vary with the interest and skills of each child. I am referring here to children who enjoy building or taking aprt things, and who have the mechanical skills to build simple models. If the child prefers music, reading, or sports to building things, this is maybe not the right toy for them.Potential downside: the product uses many small parts that can easily be lost. You can use this to teach children to build models in a place where parts won't get lost, and to put the parts away in plastic bags or in boxes when stored. Also if the child likes to put things in their mouth, they aren't old enough for this toy.Synopsis:This is a very nice erector set model of an excavation shovel. It is similar to the erector set models I made over 50 years ago, but the parts are a bit safer these days with rounded corners on the piece of metal. I have no concerns with letting my grandkids play with this model.There are a total of 193 pieces, which includes all of the screws and nuts. In addition to the metal parts, this model also includes several colorful plastic pieces that can be bolted on which have more complex shapes, such as the steering wheel and the seat. The rubber tracks are nicely molded with almost no flash (flash being the extra bits that squeze out of the mold). The rubber is not overly stiff, but also not overly soft, so I think the treads will last quite a while provided the child doesn't purposely break them. Usually the rubber pieces are the first to go bad by getting brittle or decomposing into goo, but I think this is about the best quality you can expect for a model of this type. I couldn't find the wrench at first and then found it inside the bag of metal parts after I opened it. The kit also includes a small phillips screwdriver, which I think is quite nice. The child can then learn also about putting their tools away in a safe place for the future. .The instructions are perfectly clear and are plenty big enough to read. There are 9 panel views of different stages of the assembly. Eacch view is about 3x 3 inches, so 9 square inches per panel, which makes for 81 square inches of assemby instruction diagrams. If you have ever built a model or assembled Ikea-like furniture, the instructions are no problem. Every part is shown in exploded view and the number of parts used are listed in each panel. For a child who has never built anything, a parent or older child can help them understand how to copy what they see in the pictures, and after 5 minutes of help, the child will have it figured out.The model is listed for 6+ years of age. Some younger children will be able to put this together easily if they are mechanically inclined. If they play with other bulding block toys without sticking the pieces in their mouth, they are probably old enough to move to the stage of putting things together with screws and nuts. This is a very good way to help kids understand how things are made out of parts and which way to turn screws to make them tight or loose. The parts can be used to make all kinds of models - not just the one that is pictured. Models like this can really stimulate your children's imagination. Of course, they will want more of these to build, and that is a good thing. This is not a toy to be played with for a few minutes, but a child with good mechanical skills will keep reusing the pieces over and over for many years to build all kinds of clever machines.Summary: I would love having this if I were a kid. The giant erector set I got one Christmas was one of my favorite toys and I played with for many years. These days the erector set toys tend to be packaged in smaller sets like this, but this makes it easier to manage the cost of adding to the erector set over time, and also keeping it novel and interesting for the child.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTHDPNPG5XI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9VOP5S#wasThisHelpful","RWTHDPNPG5XI6","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a speedy 3.0 USB flashdrive with a moderately large 32 Gb capacity. In reality the capacity is just under 30 Gb because of the installed encryption software. I tried to install a file that was exactly 30Gb and it wouldn't fit. Whether or not you want to keep the encryption software on the drive or move it to your primary drive is up to you. I can recommend this drive for a one-time backup or for occasional use, but you might want to compare this to other flashdrives before deciding which one to buy.The reason I recommend it only for one-time or occasional use is because the USB connector is made entirely out of very thin plastic that I don't believe will hold up to continuous use from inserting and removal from a USB port. So if you are looking for a flashdrive that will hold up to many insertions a day, you should look at the higher end Lexar drives with metal connectors. But if you only want to use the drive once a week or less, and if you are careful inserting and taking it out of the port, this drive will be good enough.As mentioned, the drive comes with pre-installed encryption software, so I think this should actually be marketed as a long term backup storage device that is used perhaps once to store backups of important files (like family photos, financial records, or lists of account numbers and passwords) and then put away in a safe location. The encryption software is entry level, but it is perfectly fine for the average user and is easy to use with your own password. If you want more heavy duty encryption, you can purchase an upgrade online and then you can select a higher grade of encryption.In summary I'm taking off a star since the connector can easily break, but it does perform well as a storage device and the encryption software you get is a nice added bonus. The drive comes with a small lanyard, but I doubt that most people will even attach it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LEWKYLXL3JGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5V62RQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LEWKYLXL3JGD","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a  remarkable lens for the affordable price! I'm currently using it for astrophotography and the results are much better than I expected. There is a slight amount of coma in the far corners when used below f/3.5, but even when used at f/2, I think the coma is acceptable, particularly if you wind up cropping your images anyway. Using this lens at f/2 and 20 second exposures lets me get test images of the sky to check for the quality of haze before I make the decision to set up y polar tracking platform. Even the 20 sec untracked exposures are useful for stacking.  There is also a small amount of luminance drop-off in the corners, but not enough to be noticeable unless you measure it with Photoshop or a similar product. So far I haven't found the need to implement a luminance correction. There is also very little barrel distortion. I was expecting much more, but it really isn't noticable unless you specifcally try to emphasize the distortion.The version I have is the Nikon mount, and I'm using it on a D7100. I use it mainly in the manual setting mode (M), but I've done ordinary photography with all camera settings including auto and the everything works as it should. The AE chip in the lens correctly sets exposure in the camera and it does it well. The in-camera focus guide correctly assesses manual focus. Since I'm using this primarily for astrophotograpy, I set the focus based on the ring markings. I did a night of testing just the focus for different f-stops and.there were no unexpected surprises. The ring markings on my lens are accurate for infinity, and the focus hasn't slipped even when moving the camera around to different parts of the sky.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQXI4FWT2HBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOVD9UA#wasThisHelpful","R3VQXI4FWT2HBO","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very easy to install faucet. As long as you have standard 9/16ths inch water shutoff connectors already plumbed in place and the predrilled faucet hole in the countertop is 1-3/8th inches, the installation is easy and straightforward.  Once the hot and cold water supplies are turned off and the old faucet and supply lines are removed, attach the provided hot and cold flexible supply lines to the base of the Kraus faucet. Only hand tightening is required. The seal is made by dual o-rings on each line. These flexible supply lines are reinforced with stainless steel braided covers for extra burst protection. Each supply line also has an integrated wire mesh filter to help prevent particulate matter in the water line (eg sand) from ever reaching the faucet.  Next, pass the supply lines through the hole in the top of the counter and then attach the large washers and the nut from under the counter. You may need someone to hold the faucet upright and in the correct orientation since it is tall and a bit top-heavy. When in the right position and the main nut is tightened, tighten two philips-head screws to keep the main nut from coming loose. Then attach the supply lines to the water turnoff connections and turn the water back on. I would recommend using plumber's teflon tape for these turnoff connections. You may also want to add silicone sealant around the countertop hole before installing the faucet, but be careful to not get any on the nice bronze finish.Be aware that the spigot on the faucet does not rotate to different positions from side to side. It is fixed to one orientation - directly forward. The faucet is designed for raised basins on a flat counter and look best in that application. This faucet is really too high for sinks that are depressed  within the countertop. There is no lever for operating a drain in the basin. The lever at the top is for water control. The bottom lip of the faucet spigot is 9.68"" from the counter top, which is an important measurement because you need this to plan for the basin height. The center of the spigot to the center of the faucet pipe is 4.72"".The fit and finish and overall quality of the faucet are superb. The rubbed bronze finish is flawless. The top lever is made of porcelain. Metal parts are brass for corrsion resistance. The faucet comes in a cloth bag for protection and a cloth wipe is included for keeping the finish clean and free from scratches during use. All of the parts are well packed with thick foam padding on all sides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJWLKG3AO9C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHQW85Y#wasThisHelpful","R2WJWLKG3AO9C9","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The monitor is rather basic in that it only has 1 HDMI port and 1 VGA port. It lacks a DVI port and there are no USB ports. It has internal speakers, but if you want acceptable audo for games and videos, you will be happier with external speakers. However the onboard speakers do get the job done for a  basic computer setup.The native setting for color leans toward the warm side. If you are older and have naturally yellowing lenses in your eyes you will want to tweak the color toward the blue to compensate. However, I could never find a satisfactory setting when attached to my nvidia graphics boards. If I tried pushing it to the blue suing the rgb channels, it immediately became too blue. If I adjusted the brightness and contrast, it didn't help. If I adjusted the gamma or the color temperature, it also didn't help. My guess is that this is somehow related to the blue filtering circuit in the monitor which seems to always be on. Even though I have the blue filter supposedly turned off, there is still a bit too much yellow in the whites and grays. I suppose if I had younger eyes, it wouldn't bother me as much. I have Sony, Asus, and LG monitors without this problem, so I feel the warm tone is just an inherent characteristic of this monitor. When viewing movies and photographs, it doesn't bother me, but webpage backgrounds and Windows applications just look too warm to me.The crispness of the monitor in native resolution (1920x1080) is sharp, but not quite as sharp as my other monitors which are all IPS LED. When viewing on this monitor alone, the lack of crispness is not apparent, but when set side-by-side with my other monitors, the slight lack of crispness is there no matter what the contrast and brightness settings are. I have the feeling that the lack of crispness is related to the blue filtering circuitry.The response time is slower than my 1 ms monitors, but for general computing use it is perfectly fine. I do no gaming, but I do rendering to animate 3D graphs, so this is not an ideal monitor for that purpose.I do recommend the monitor for general computer use and for watching videos and viewing photos. I'm going to use this as a dedicated monitor for recording teaching videos and for reviewing photos in real time from my DSLR. It should perform very well in those applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GMGAXEDDKXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RVGYHFK#wasThisHelpful","R3GMGAXEDDKXM","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice medium-duty vise for a drill press, or it can also be bolted to a workbench. It is fairly large. The clamping surface is 4 inches across and approximately 1.5 inches high. The clamp opens to a length of 3 and 7/8 inches. The overall open length is almost 18 inches. The bottom of the vise is completely open so you can drill through materials completely. The frame is made of heavy aluminum, with steel rails and a steel lead screw. The handle is smooth and made of a synthetic material and it has good gripability (i.e., not slippery). It might be slippery though if you have grease or oil on your hands. However, the handle can flip to 90 degrees for increased leverage by pulling out on the spring-loaded handle and flipping it to the side. The tie-down bolt slots are 1/2 inches wide and 4.5 inches long. The frame is 7/16 inches high at the tie-down slots. The side rails are large enough for using quick release clamps on your drillpress base to hold down this vise. The vise has a quick release button on top for rapid positioning of the clamping lead screw. The top of the button is plastic, which might be easily damaged, but the locking mechanism beneath is metal.There are no major problems with the vise and I believe I would buy it again. I do recommend it. However there are a few deficiencies that you should be aware of:1) There is no flat surfaces at the bottom of the clamping cavity to rest material on. The material rests directly on the round steel rails, and for some uses, this is just not good enough. I much prefer drill press vices that use machined flat side rails. However those vises are more expensive.2) The clamping surfaces are steel, but only 3/16 inches thick. This means that the vertical and horizontal grooves for holding round materials are very shallow and essentially useless for this purpose. The grooves appear to be about 1 mm deep. On my favorite vice, the clamps are 3/4 in thich and the grooves are about 1/4 in deep, which is much better for holding round stock. Also the grooves on both plates didn't align correctly, but this can be corrected by loosening the screws and adjusting the positions of the 2 plates. I actually took the plates and reversed them to have perfectly flat clamping surfaces. You can also remove the steel plates and install your own nylon, rubber, or wood plates instead. The steel plates are attached by 2 flat-head screws on each plate.3) The lead screw uses a quick-release button to rapidly position the clamping surfaces. This works really well. It does make the screw a little hard to turn for long distances, but since you would initially adjust by using the quick release, the issue is very minor. I only mention it to let you know it is normal and not something to be concerned about - it is not defective. The lead screw works very well when tightening.Overall, I think this is a very nice clamp for general workshop use. It isn't intended for use on a milling machine, so it lacks some of the nice features found on heavy-duty clamps for precise positioning, but this will handle 90% of my workshop applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHONIRET84RS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5XU07A#wasThisHelpful","RHONIRET84RS4","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These golf shows exceeded my expectations. It is a high quality shoe for a reasonable cost. The overall quality is superb with absolutely no defects found in the upper leather, stitching, outer soles, or interior components. The arch support is close to perfect for me, and I am always somewhat critical about this because of an old tendon injury. The shoes are surprisingly light in weight and almost have a slipper-like comfort to them. Normally I wear a 10.5 wide, but the size 11 medium fit comfortably. The width was barely snug, but not uncomfortable even after hours of walking and even before they have been fully broken in. They gave excellent stability with no unexpected or abnormal ankle roll when walking or driving a club. The low-profile rubber-cleated soles gave good traction even in wet grass and pathways.

"This is another excellent Avery label product. The package is listed as Internet Shipping labels,which sounded odd to me. The name refers to additional Avery software that can be downloaded to print out a specific style of shipping label. The label is designed for internet businesses that ship products. However, these are blank labels, so the user can design the label to be anything they want. They don't have to use a template only for shipping. If the user wants to use special software that computes postage and/or fills in the addresses automatically, the package provides the internet linksto the USPS, ebay, and pbSmart web sites. There is also the internet link shown for the Avery site for Design & Print software or the MS Word template.The labels are stacked 2 to a sheet and each is 5.5"" x 8.5"". The label is somewhat lighter in weight compared to other Avery shipping labels I have used in the past. I believe the lighter weight and the minimum amount of waste (just the backing material) allows Avery to list this as a more environmentally favorable product when compared to other products of a similar size.

"This is a full-function, full-size iron. It is not ligtweight, but I wouldn't say it was overly heavy. For casual ironing at home, the weight is OK. It has all of the features you expect to find on an iron such as 3 steam settings, steam burst, water spray, fully adjustable temperature range settings, and auto-off. It has a light to indicate it is operating. The cord is sufficiently long to not be an issue for most users. The ironing surface is wrapped with stainless steel. Some people prefer a non-stick surface, while others prefer the stainless steel, so keep this in mind when choosing your iron.The top point on my plate was slightly rough around the top where it wrapped around the point, but it didn't catch on the fabric I've used it on. The water tank has a flip-down cap. It is a bit hard to fill, but this is true for most irons. The manufacturer includes a plastic cup to help fill the iron. The only obvious flaw I found was that one side was not correctly in place when the bottom base part was screwed on. This doesn't seem to affect the use of the iron, but there is now an uncovered plastic tab hanging out on the side that could potentially catch on fabric someday. Normally I could fix this in less than a minute, but because the screws in the base are non-removable, I can't loosen the base to put the piece back in the proper place. I really don't like appliances that can't be repaired (e.g., the cord can never be replaced in the future), so I took off a star for the defect and the inability for the user to service or repair the iron.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WAQ3LLCTAA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV70LOE#wasThisHelpful","R39WAQ3LLCTAA4","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The version I got is different from the product description, so I will mainly review the function. The product uses plastic tiles that have artwork attached. There are also some versions that have a picture frame or a drawing board instead of the pre-made artwork.The tiles attach to the wall using the Commander velcro strips. These are easy to apply and remove from the wall, but you must clean the wall with some alcohol first to make sure the glue on the back of the Commander Velcro strip grips the wall firmly. This is especially true in places like kitchens and bathrooms. The tiles have a built-in bubble level to make it easier to align. Once the large tile is attached to the velcro, the artwork is then put onto the face of the tile and it is held there by a magnet.My version came with an optional stand-off piece to make one of the tiles ""float"" further from the wall. This adds visual interest by allowing the art to occuply a different plane away from the wall. The standoff uses the same magnet method as used by the artwork to attach it to the large tile. If you like the way the standoff works, you can buy more of them separately.The entire system works fairly well and I like the fact that it has built-in bubble levels. If you have a modern decor and live in an apartment or college dorm, it might appeal to you because you can hang art without damaging the wall. Also if you change your wall art often, this might be a good choice for you This is not something I would use in my home since I don't care for any of the art work shown in the brochure, but I'm sure the art will appeal to someone. I think it is well-made, but it really doesn't look all that great. I think if they had team logos or nature photos, it would be a more interesting product.

"This is a difficult review to write because this is not a typical history book. It is unlike anything I've read before. It is history in the sense that it is a compilation of recollections of men who served in 3 battles (Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima). However, this work lacks all of the key elements that places these recollections into some sort of historical perspective. We aren't given any detailed information about who was involved, where they came from, what they thought before, during, or after the battle (or war), how and why they were motivated to take up arms (or not), and for the most part, whatever became of them. There are many names associated with these recollections, and in fact, the book is remarkable for the many references it provides. But they are just names to the reader and there is no information about who these men were. Also, because much of this book appears to be based on recollections by individuals (as opposed to official Army reports, for example), there is a tendency to wonder if these recollections have been eroded or embellished by time. It is not that I doubt anything stated in the book, but I just have the feeling that so much is missing. Likewise, the juxtaposition of so many stories in such a concentrated format can give the reader a wrong impression or it can numb the reader emotionally.Likewise, we aren't given any political, economic, or sociological information to understand the motives of men and country. Nor are we given any detailed background information about the tactics or strategies or equipment and methods used by these armies. These are important elements, because it may be difficult for some younger readers raised predominantly in the 21st century to fully understand the lives of men from the 18th or 19th century. Those of us who lived in the mid-20th century are still able to understand the lives of warfighters in WW II, but even now the cultural knowledge of young people is vastly different from what it was a scant 80 years ago.  So I really wonder if a younger reader can truly appreciate the content of this book. One can argue that the historical context can be found elsewhere, but because there was nothing here to place the recollections of the soldiers into perspective, I found it surprisingly difficult to become interested in this book. While reading this book, I kept referring to my own memories of other history books I've read and studied of those 3 eras. Without that background of knowledge, I think this book can be unsatisfying.Surprisingly, nothing in this book is particularly memorable to me. I finished it and nothing in particular stands out in my mind. That's a strange outcome for reading a significant amount of material. However, the emotional feelings I had while reading the book are more memorable to me than the words I read.  It is indeed a book that can trigger visceral negative emotions, including anger, disgust, sadness, hatred, sympathy, and more. It can also trigger flashbacks to horrific events in our past that some might not wish to dredge up. I found it difficult to wade through the blood and guts descriptions, which makes up a large percentage of the book, or maybe it just seems that way. I would almost call this war pornography, because the main purpose seems to be to evoke an emotional knee-jerk response from the reader. Perhaps there is something educational here, but as I said, the reader has to have some prior historical knowledge to take this book and appreciate what it delivers. I found that I approached this book by imagining myself listening to the worst of the war stories from veterans of these battles. The book gives you little in terms of stories of the days spent in training or what soldiers and Marines did to relieve the boredom and loneliness. There are no funny stories or letters from home. There are no memorable officers or non-coms, no mention of friends, troublemakers, or lost loves. You instead get the stories that are the hardest to tell and also the hardest to read. And these stories seemed to become  worse as we developed better ways to kill. So the book is certainly not balanced in describing the lives of warfighters, but neither is it sanitized or self-censored in the descriptions of the battle itself. You read in great detail about bodies being blown apart by mortar shells, cut in half by machine gun fire, decapitated heads strewn about, the stench of burning bodies, the mountains of limbs and guts, of being covered in feces and parasites, of bodies being torn apart by explosive compression, of brains being traumatized by concussions, and the madness of losing psychological control. You read the stories and take them for what they are and you put them into whatever context you wish because the stories are related in a matter of fact way. These stories have been reported elsewhere because they were familiar to me from other books, but this is the first book I've read where the stories have been presented as a collection.. The text goes into highly explicit detail that I think was intended primarily to shock and disturb the reader, so I don't recommend this book for young people or people with sensitive emotions.While the purpose of using 3 American wars is to show commonality and differences in what  warfighters have experienced, the author doesn't go into a true comparative analysis. Nevertheless, the research is cited in depth, so for the interested reader, this could be an excellent resource to pursue their own analysis from the cited materials. The book is quite different from other historical works of the American Revolution, the American Civil War, and the Battle of Iwo Jima. It is not for everyone and it is frankly a very depressing book to read, but that is the nature of war. Most history books I can read in 1 or 2 nights, but this took me over 3 weeks to finish because it lacked any of the humanity that men seek in wartime and only presented the inhumanity. In a way, it is suprising that battles from Vietnam and Iraq were not included in the book to bring the entire American warfighter experience up to date, however the author does touch briefly on his reasons for not doing this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIREK7T94MGC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553805185#wasThisHelpful","RIREK7T94MGC6","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very impressed with this 40 volt Lithium-Ion battery-powered Dewalt blower. It is nearly as powerful as my 2 stroke gas engine blower. I think the main difference is that the gas blower has a constrictor tip on the end to concentrate the force of the air, while the Dewalt blower has no such tip. Even so, the Dewalt is more than strong enough to do the job of the gas-powered blower.It easly clears off leaves and pine needles and pine cones up to 4 inches in diameter. It will also blow away fallen tree branches that are an inch thick and 3 feet long. I even used it to blow down a couple of wet clay fire ant mounds with no problem. On a full charge and blowing at full blast the entire time, I can clean off the pad for a 2 car garage, a separate 2 car parking pad, 200 feet of driveway (up and back), 100 feet of sidewalk (up and back), and 70 feet of front porch. I can probably also clean the dust out of the garage as well, once I get used to conserving power. Note that when the charge gets low enough, the blower stops in order to protect the battery charge from getting too low.I like that the 40 volt power pack has a built in charge indicator. Just press the button on the battery pack and green leds light up to help you to estimate the remaining charge. I also like that the charging station itself can be set on a workbench or it can be mounted on the wall to save space. The mounting bracket is a slip cleat style so you can slip the station off the wall completely and take it elsewhere. The charging station has a very large, easy to see red light on it that tells you when charging is in progress or finished.The weight of the unit is nearly the same as my gas blower (maybe a few ounces less), so It feels very comfortable to carry and familiar to use. It is much quieter than a gas engine and releasing the switch turns off the motor completely. I can use this comfortable, while the gas engine blower is so loud that it helps to wear hearing protection. You won't need hearing protection with the Dewalt. You can also partially squeeze the control and get less blowing force. It even has a ""cruise control"" speed controller so you can set the trigger to any speed and you can then take your finger off the trigger entirely. The blower seems huge compared to my gas engine blower, but it is still comfortable to hold and doesn't seem that bulky when it is actually in use. It does take up a bit more storage space, but that's not a major concern. The fan is lightweight, so you aren't fighting any inertia from a gyroscopic effect of the fan turning.Overall, I think this is an excellent blower for a homeowner who has a lot of property to cover, but wants to greatly reduce the noise while cleaning up. It comes with a 3 year limited warranty and a 90 day no-questions-asked money back guarantee. It also comes with a 1 year free service maintenance policy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FC2WKPRWBGZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF02SVK#wasThisHelpful","R1FC2WKPRWBGZP","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jasmine green tea is very hard to come by in my area. I used to get it all the time, but the last couple of years it has disappeared from store shelves and can only be found through online sellers or my local tea shop in bulk. I like the idea of having a sealed package on hand at home that will keep indefinitely and will be there when I want to brew it. I don't have a K-cup machine, so I prepared this using my loose tea brewing cup with a stainless steel strainer. The jasmine flower flavor is definitely present and delicious. The green tea component is not bitter and does not overpower the jasmine. I would say they got the name correct in that they put the jasmine before the green tea. Overall this is a mellow, flavorful blend of tea that I would recommend to anyone. I would very likely purchase this Numi tea again if the price was right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FRCYCE5IGE6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFFMUBG#wasThisHelpful","R2FRCYCE5IGE6T","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested this on a small section of my back yard lawn 4 days ago, and it is already greening up in that section. I plan to finish the rest of the bag in the back yard where I have been getting some invasive crabgrass. This size bag covers 5,000 square feet, which is perfect for my backyard. This is also sold in a larger bag.I couldn't find the fertilizer ratio listed on the Amazon site, but the back of the bag says it is 30-0-4. I'm unsure what herbicide is specifically aimed at the crabgrass. Later on in the spring I'll report back on how well the crabgrass problem is under control.I really like the Scotts lawn and garden products and use them. I've used Scotts Bonus S Southern Lawn Weed and Feed for the front yard for the last 10 years. It greens up the lawn in under a week (after being watered in) and knocks down the dollar weed until the following winter. My lawn looks as good as the lawns in the neighborhood that are professionally maintained, and even better than some. I just pour a bag of Scotts in my tractor spreader and I'm finished in no time. Scotts fertilizers can also be broadcast in small lawns with hand spreaders and in medium-sized lawns with walk-behind spreaders.UPDATE: After 3 weeks I'm now seeing a significant die-off of the weeds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZK00WJTJW0NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I1M5NG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZK00WJTJW0NS","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Head & Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff shampoo from Proctor and Gamble is unique because it has tea tree oil and peppermint oil in the formulation. It says on the container that is provides instant relief  and cools on contact. Additionally it lists attributes that are common to all of the Head & Shoulders shampoos, namely relief from dry, flaky scalp. I don't have dandruff, but perhaps that is because I currently use the Head & Shoulders 2 in 1 shampoo for men. However, I can compare the mint version to the version formulated for men and report on that.First, there is a slight mint fragrance to the shampoo, but it is not overwhelming. Maybe that is just me and someone else with a better sense of smell can distinguish the mint frangrance better than I can. It is not for example the same as opening a bottle of mint mouthwash, which to me has a strong mint fragrance. In fact the fragrance of this shampoo to me would be indistinguishable as mint without reading the label. However, I want to emphasize that the shampoo has a pleasant fragrance and it is definitely a different fragrance from the H&S shampoo for men. It is just hard to distinquish or describe how it is different. I think it  doesn't have a medicinal kind of smell to it, so that is probably important to many people. It is just pleasant and mild.As far as cooling, I didn't notice that at all. I take very hot showers, so any sense of cooling would probably be lost. The product does contain both alcohol and menthol, so these should create a tingling or cooling sensation, but I just couldn't distinguish this myself. On the other hand, if you washed your hair in a sink, you might notice a cooling sensation.  After washing and rinsing, I didn't get any significant cooling sensation that lingered.. To me the sensation was no different than using any other version of Head & Shoulders shampoo. I suspect that if you do have dandruff and flaky skin, that you very likely would notice a tingling or cooling sensation though. Having a healthy scalp probably makes a big difference in terms of the sensation. I put some on the back of my hand after showering and I didn't notice any cooling effect either. Oh well.Overall, I think this is a very good shampoo that I would buy, use, and recommend it to friends. While I didn't a notice siginificant difference to another Head & Shoulders product I use, I still think it deserves 5 stars. I also believe that people with active dandruff and a sensitive scalp would definitely feel the tingling and cooling sensation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OLMNZFJ0I96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP261N4#wasThisHelpful","R2OLMNZFJ0I96","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cover is made specifically for built-in outdoor BBQ cookers. If you have a stand-alone or portable BBQ, Classic Accessories also has a wide variety of cover styles and there will be one to fit your particular application.Outdoor cooker covers have to withstand the elements, and unfortunately this reviewer doesn't have a crystal ball to see how well the cover will stand up to mother nature over the course of a few years. Furthermore, how well the cover stands up depends a great deal on where you live and whether your cooker is completely exposed to the weather or somehwat sheltered from the wind, sun, and rain. Movement in subfreezing weather and excessive exposure to the UV in sunlight tend to cause an early end to any cover. My general impression is that this cover should last at least 3 years here in the Gulf South where humidity is high and the sun and heat are very intense in the summer. That is my best guess, but it is based on a lot of experience of how quickly I've seen similar materials break down.The cover is constructed of panels sewn together. There is a large central panel that wraps over the BBQ cooker, and then smaller panels on the right and left sides that create a boxy form to the cover. The stiching between panels is double stiching, but there are places where single stiching is used, such as along the edges where the outer material wraps around to the inside. The edge wrapping is a good inch or more and this gives a lot of rub protection to the edges. The outer surface of the material appears to be a coated canvas-like weave of polyester material. It looks very strong and sheds rain water. The inner surface of the material is a fully waterproof vinyl. At initial insepction, it appears as if there are two materials that make up the cover, but it is actually just one layer of material that is treated differently on the outside and the inside. It is quite thick, but is flexible. It kind of reminds me of a canvas work coat, but stiffer due to the vinyl coating on the inside.Around the lower part of the back and sides is a stretchable internal cord (like a bungee cord) that is wrapped and sewn into the material, which grips onto the back and sides of the cooker. The tension on this cord is not adjustable, so you need to measure the dimensions of your cooker and buy the correct sized cover to assure that it will slip over and still grip the cooker tightly. The outer part of the cover also has an extra woven panel sewn onto it which is narrow and darker in color. This band of material goes around the entire cover. The purpose seems to be to give the cover some extra strength and rigidity where the user might pulll up or down on the cover.  It is also decorative since the color is darker than the rest of the cover. There are also two handles that are sewn onto the cover at the top of the two side panels. The handles are flexible, but strong and are well-stitched at the ends onto the cover. However, the vinyl wrapping on the handles themselves is only single-stitched. Inside of the cover are two belts with plastic connectors that allow the cover to be securely clamped and tightened to the cooker handles. These belts are about a foot long and once clamped, the excess slack can be pulled out like you would on a seat belt. These belts along with the wrap-around elastic cord do a great job of keeping the cover securely in place on the cooker. I also want to note that the end panels of the cover are perforated to allow wind to pass through from inside, which also helps to keep the cover in place. Although the end panels are perforated, there are additional panels on the outside that keeps rain from blowing in through the perforations.There is a metal plate with the name Hickory Series on it that is riveted to the cover. To help keep the inside part of the rivets from rubbing against your cooker, there is an extra internal panel of material that runs the horizontal length of the cover that covers up the inside part of the rivets. Also this panel helps to prevent the knobs, handles, or front edges of the cooker from rubbing directly on the waterproof interior of the cover, so it gives an extra layer of protection to the front where it will be rubbed often when taking the cover on and offMy overall opinion is that this is a well-made and well-designed cover that should satisfy the majority of users. I would not expect it to stand up to hurricane winds, but it will do fine during normal use. My biggest concern is the material holding up to UV light and subfreezing temperatures that could cause cracking. Covers that are completely exposed to sunlight are naturally going to have a shorter lifetime than covers that are used in areas with some shade, particularly in the middle of the day. If you have sub-zero temperatures, it is important to be sure the cover is fitted correctly so it doesn't move around and crack from bending in the cold. If you consider that the cover needs to be replaced after 3 years, but is 100% effective in protecting the cooker during that time, then it is doing its job.  If you get more than 3 years of use out of the cover, you are coming out ahead. If you get less than 3 years of use, then you probably have extreme weather that is causing the cover to fail prematurely, and it is hard to find any cover that holds up to extreme winters or summers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFEHSCJY3W7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4J52OY#wasThisHelpful","RMFEHSCJY3W7D","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to garden, but I'm always looking for ways to make the results better with less effort on my part. I have three hose sprayers for liquid fertilizer, and those use pre-measured packages for fertilizer. However, this product is NOT hose sprayer fertilizer. The Scotts Super Bloom Water Soluble Plant Food is is made for watering cans or jugs.You take a specified amount for a given volume of water. If the plants are in pots, the recommended concentration is 2 TEASPOONS to one gallon of water. If the plants are in outdoor beds, large containers, or planters, the recommended concentration is 1 TABLESPOON to one gallon of water. I happen to use a 1.5 gallon watering can that I use with small containers and hanging plants that are too small for the liquid sprayer. So it is easy to mix the Scotts plant food as 3 tsps to my 1.5 gal can.I think very highly of Scotts lawn and garden products and use them all the time. This Super Bloom food will help me to supplement the time-release fertilizer I put in at the beginning of the planting season. I will be using this on plants that were put in last fall (mostly pansies and petunias), and the new plants I'll add soon (impatiens, mums, violas, etc). This is a 12-55-6 food, which is rather potent, so follow instructions carefully when mixing the concentrate with the water. Don't use it at a higher concentration and don't just throw it dry around the plant and try to water it in. You can use it once every week to every 2 weeks to keep the blooming continuous.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5VJOIVBC50D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTDGWAY#wasThisHelpful","RG5VJOIVBC50D","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a clever method of creating professional-looking printed tabs for a binder. What you get in this set are 16 dividers that are punched for 3-hole binders. Each divider has a unique a tab. You also get a sheet of adhesive labels that you can print on with your printer. Once you print the adhesive labels, you can then place the labels on the dividers in sets of 8. They are self-adhesive. You are given 10 groups of 8 (80 tab labels total), so you have plenty of extras in case you mess up (you only need 16 out of the 80). To further help, you get a practice sheet with marking that replicate the adhesive labels and you can use this to test your printer output. You can make a copy of this if you think you need another practice sheet. The set works with either laserjet or inkjet printers. The tabs are about 1-inch wide and about 3/8ths of an inch high, so you should pick a font size that gives a good fit in this small of a space.To assure a good result, use the Avery Microsoft Word template for this set: 13150.

"If you are looking to buy a first stapler for school or a general-purpose office stapler, this is a good one to buy. It is palm-sized and can fit in any desk drawer. It is very stable and has a full-length rubbery-like surface on the base to keep it from sliding around during use. The top has small depressions where you press down so it wont slip from your hand.The stapler uses a flat-clinch bend instead of a curved clinch bend of the staple. I much prefer this flat type because it is easier to open up and remove the staple without tearing the paper. The stapler does NOT open up flat for stapling into other materials. It is only made to bind together thin materials that fit within the jaws. There is no adjustable paper guide, but it does have markings (indentations) on the base to use as a placement guide. It is very easy to load staples, and the inner metal surfaces have all been nidely polished to remove sharp edges on the stamped metal pieces. I'm glad to see this because some staplers have very sharp metal edges and can unexpectedly cut a finger. You should be safe with this one.The only thing I found to be an issue is that the stapler opens up a little too easily. There isn't a definite catch or latch to keep the top in place. So sometimes when I pick this stapler up by the top, the stapler opens up and the staples can fall out. As long as you know to pick the stapler up by the base, it won't open unexpectedly. I don't feel this is big enough of an issue to take away a star.The stapler uses 24/6 mm or 26/6 mm flat-clinch staples and if you forget, this is listed on the underside of the base.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30I7017ZFTWQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WNNSWI#wasThisHelpful","R30I7017ZFTWQ7","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This laminator heats up very fast! Within 2 minutes you are ready to feed your first sheet. The Fellowes M5-95 has bright red and green LEDs on the top that are easy to see.

Heating is uniform across the sheet and I didn't have to feed any sheets through a second time.

This makes it perfect for the absent-minded professor types. I think the auto-off feature makes this one an easy choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DQTHV4CNPO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RM7WTFS#wasThisHelpful","R39DQTHV4CNPO8","A3JGIXQPX65TGJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JGIXQPX65TGJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using this Pioneer for over a year and have so far burned over forty 25GB Blu-Ray discs, backing up data from my computer, including much video footage.  So far I've never had a coaster.  Every backup has been flawless.I use exclusively Verbatim disks (non-LTH).  I've been backing up data on PC's since PC's first became available in the early 1980s.  I learned long ago the importance of using only high quality media for my backups.  It's a waste of time and money to have to throw away a disc because a burn has failed.  It's even worse for the burn to look like it succeeded but then to try retrieve the data a few years after the backup and find that that the data has been corrupted.  I now only use the best media, and in my experience, Verbatim makes the best consumer-grade discs, though I've also had good experiences burning TDK DVD's.If you use lower quality discs, be sure to install Pioneer's firmware update.  It's available on the Pioneer website.  From what I understand, it helps with burning lower quality media.I've been using the free version of Cyperlink's Power2Go software for burning Blu-Rays.  It came bundled with the Pioneer.  It's worked well for me, but I'm currently trying ImgBurn as an alternative.  Power2Go is a better choice for most people.  It's simple to use and reliable. The free version has worked well for burning Blu-Ray data backups.  If you like more control over your software and aren't intimidated by many pages of settings options, ImgBurn is a great alternative.  It's Open Source and free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL983EFCU2648/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00834SING#wasThisHelpful","RL983EFCU2648","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is much a higher quality than I expected. There is also a mystery - two unidentified extra parts included with it.The build quality is excellent and everything about the light feels solid.  It's not a light you'd want to use for an entire scene, but for a podcast or similar situation in which you have a single subject and fairly tight quarters, it's excellent.  I used it as a back light located 3-4 feet above the subject's head.  It's bright enough that I had to use it at low light settings. I'm really happy that Bower includes two filters. I used the amber for the back light and it worked perfectly.I intend to buy two more of these to use as key and fill lights for future shoots.However I do have a complaint: there's no calibration on the adjusting knob, so you have to readjust the brightness every time you use it.  In my case, I had it set in the same place for four shoots on different days.  I wish that either there was a separate on-off switch so I could leave the adjusting knob at the right adjustment, or calibrations on the knob so I could quickly dial it back to where I want it after turning it back on.  However for the relatively low price, I'm not complaining too loudly.  It's just a small detail that Bower could have solved easily with some numbers on the adjusting knob.Now for the mystery - mine came with two extra parts that aren't mentioned either in the instruction sheet that comes with it or on the Amazon or Bower web pages. They both appear to be AC adapters.  They plug directly into the battery slot on the light, and have a receptacle for a cord from a power brick, as well as a slot on top that might be for another battery (but the Bower battery doesn't fit).  There's no identification on it at all.  And there are two of them!The box appeared unopened, so I don't think a customer returned it with extra parts.I highly recommend this little light for situations where you need relatively close-in lighting, such as for podcasts.  It's an excellent light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJY13BTJGSUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IJHK9Q#wasThisHelpful","R2LJY13BTJGSUD","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are going to be very useful to me.  One of my needs is for leveling a video camera in the field, and several of these levels will work great for that.  The pocket level is particularly useful.  It clips onto a shirt pocket and comes with philips and flat tips.  The tip's fit is just snug enough for light screwing, but isn't super tight and the tip could fall out if you're carrying it in your pocket.  However the there's enough room inside the level to hold both tips, so it's not a problem.I compared them against a good quality professional carpenter's level.  All but two were spot-on.  The pocket level wasn't quite accurate, but it was only off slightly, not enough to be noticeable.  The bulls-eye level was the least accurate, but sill reasonably accurate.  The bubble was just touching inner circle of the bulls eye, so for most purposes it would probably be acceptable.These levels are definitely basic.  No one will mistake them for expensive tools.  They're just basic levels in basic, red plastic.  However they appear solid and for how I will use them, I expect them to last years.I hesitated for a long time about buying them, but I'm glad I finally overcame my skepticism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10AL75SZCISTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038M9HII#wasThisHelpful","R10AL75SZCISTP","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a rewrite of a review I previously wrote about both the Logitech C920 and Microsoft Lifecam Studio 1080p HD. I've raised my rating from three to four stars for both webcams. They are both very good units, but both have significant flaws that make it impossible to give either of them five stars.I bought these webcams for a video project, so all of my testing has been for video capture and editing.  I haven't tested still images or Skype.At the end of the review, I also will give some information about four software packages that are available - one of them free - for recording video with these webcams: Active Webcam, Arcsoft's Webcam Companion, CyberLink's Youcam, and Virtual Dub.I'm rewritten this review after using the Logitech for a month and the Microsoft for three weeks. I ordered the Logitech first. I've been buying Logitech products since the 1990s and until now was never disappointed. This time I was so dissatisfied with it that I ordered the Microsoft, only to be even more disappointed.It's not that they are terrible. They are both excellent in many ways. However I expect more from a 1080p unit than from an ordinary webcam, especially considering the glowing reviews they receive.One thing I love about both webcams is the tripod mount.  For my video project, I needed to mount the webcam on a tripod, so this was a requirement.  It will also be useful in future shooting.  Both webcams will work with any standard tripod.  I used a Sony VCT-R100 tripod for my project.Microsoft's most obvious flaw is advertising this as a 1080p webcam without mentioning that it only does 1080p still images, not recorded video. If you use some non-Microsoft software (Virtual Dub and Cyberlink's You Cam), it will record at 1080p, but the quality is poor if there's any movement in the scene.On the other hand, the Logitech doesn't come off well either. Its most obvious flaw is in its video compression, which results in major video artifacts under certain conditions.  If you don't know what a video artifact is, it basically makes the scene look like something out of science fiction.  The strange thing is that the recorded video plays with no problem in a video player, such as Windows Media Player, but when I try to edit it, the artifacts appear.  I've read reports by other owners who say it also happens with Skype.  I haven't tried these webcams with Skype, so I have no experience with this.I did find a way around the problem with Premiere Pro, but the easiest way to avoid the problem in recorded video is simply to use non-Logitech software for recording video.  I tried Virtual Dub, Arcsoft's Web Companion, and Cyberlink's You Cam.  All of them recorded video from the Logitech with no artifacts.One other recording issue is video format.  If you are buying the webcam for recorded video on a Mac or Linux, or if you want to edit the video, you may find the Logitech the better choice. The .wmv format is a Windows format, so anyone on a different system will probably have to convert it to a different format to use it, and even on Windows, editing it can be a problem, but the Microsoft records only in .wmv. The Logitech records 1080p and 720p as .mp4 and 480p and 360p video as .wmvThe Logitech's other problem is color balance, which is disappointing. The Microsoft's color balance is generally much better. I gave up completely on using the Logitech's automatic color and set it manually every time.The Microsoft is much more demanding of your CPU. Unless you have a fast computer, you probably won't get z good HD recording with it. I have a quad core 3.0GHZ i7 with 24GB of RAM, but the Microsoft could record only 13.1fps at 720p and 6.4fps at 1080p, using Virtual Dub. The Logitech did much better, averaging exactly 30.0fps at both 720p and 1080p. Using the Windows 7 Performance Monitor, I found that the CPU usage while recording ranged from about 40% to 60% for the Microsoft but only about 15% to 35% for the Logitech.I also tried it on my 1.6GHz Samsung netbook.  The Logitech recorded better than I expected, though it you wouldn't want to use it on any scene with movement in it.  The Microsoft's greater demands on the CPU made it completely unacceptable for recording 720p video on the netbook.To my eyes the Microsoft delivers a much sharper image (a purely subjective measurement) than the Logitech.If you transport your webcam a lot, then the recessed lens on the Microsoft offers much more protection than the Logitech lens, which has no protection at all. The Microsoft comes with a rubber lens cap, but it's so loose that it's completely useless. The recessed lens is an excellent design feature, however. The Microsoft is also much smaller, which could be useful if you move it around a lot.The Microsoft software won't let you change the microphone on the Microsoft, but the Logitech software does allow it. The Microsoft microphone is located on the top rear of the webcam, which I expected would be a terrible location, but in practice it's better than I expected. The Logitech microphone is in front, where it should be, and does produce better audio (I was sitting about two feet from the webcams for the tests).  The Logitech is stereo and the Microsoft is mono. If you use other software for recording, such as Virtual Dub, Arcsoft's Web Companion, and Cyberlink's You Cam, you can specify different audio inputs.The autofocus isn't great on either unit, but Logitech's is better than Microsoft's.Logitech's software allows you to specify a folder for storing videos and photos, but Microsoft's does not. On Windows 7, it stores everything in My Pictures. Microsoft creates .wmv video files and Logitech creates .mp4 files. Logitech offers three levels of video and three levels of audio quality. Microsoft doesn't give a choice. Logitech allows recording at four video resolutions: 360p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p. Microsoft allows recording at seven video resolutions (eight for photographs): 160x120, 320x240, 424x240, 640x360, 800x448, 960x544, and 1280x720.Zoom controls on both tend to be erratic in how they operate and often don't work at all.Microsoft tilts and pans, rotating a full 360 degrees.  The Logitech can only tilt up and down.  If you want to pan, you need a tripod.The sad thing is that I actually prefer both the color balance and the zoom & pan controls on my old Kodak S101 640x480 webcam, though the Microsoft and Logitech both are superior in image quality, even at low resolutions equivalent to the Kodak's.The Microsoft developed some intermittent problems towards the end.  The previously excellent automatic exposure sometimes didn't work properly, and my computer occasionally gave me a warning that it didn't recognize it as a USB device.My bottom line:==============I only needed one webcam for my project.  I originally disliked the Logitech so much that I ordered the Microsoft and intended returning the Logitech, only to be even more disappointed by the Microsoft.  I ended up using the Logitech for my project and I am returning the Microsoft.  It was frustrating, because in many ways I prefer the Microsoft, but recording only 720p video and having higher CPU requirements made it less useful for me.  I returned it because of the intermittent problems I experienced, but would have returned it anyway because of the other issues.Now for the software.  If you buy the Logitech and you plan to do 720p or 1080p video recording, then you'll definitely want to look into alternative software because the Logitech's produces video with unacceptable artifacts that you don't see while watching them, but become very apparent if you edit the video, at least with Adobe Premiere Pro.Virtual Dub (free)=================At first this one turned me off, but after I played with it for a few weeks and watched a YouTube video on configuring it, I fell in love with it.  If you are serious about video, this is the one to get.  It's loaded with options, but it's not the most user-friendly software available.  However after you get used to it, the others are frustratingly limited in comparison.  However it's definitely not for casual users.Cyberlink You Cam ($35)======================If you're going to edit your video or if you're on a Mac or Linux machine, this is the one you want to get because records .avi files.  It's a great choice for nontechnical people who don't want to deal with Virtual Dub's nonintuitive user interfaceArcsoft Webcam Companion 4 ($35)==============================This is a nice package with just one problem: it only records .wmv files.  This is a Windows format, so you'll need to convert it to use on a Mac or Linux machine, and you may have problems editing it.Active WebCam ($29)=================Initially this is the one I thought I'd like, but I was never actually able to test it because it was constantly freezing up.  If you are using multiple webcams for surveillance, you should look into it.  It does get good reviews.  However the user interface leaves a lot to be desired, but because of the freezing up I never had the opportunity to give it a real test.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABGY4HH3BO1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JH8T3S#wasThisHelpful","R2ABGY4HH3BO1D","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I need to disclose first of all that several years ago I wrote an article for ""News from Native California"", which is published by this book's publisher.  I have no other connection with the publisher other than being a longtime enthusiastic customer.This is the first coffee table book I've ever bought.  I discovered it when a friend borrowed it from the Sausalito Library and I couldn't put it down.  I've now ordered my own copy from Amazon.The book consists of paintings, illustrations, photos, and copies of original newspapers and manuscripts, accompanied by text from original sources from the days when California was Mexican to the 20th century.  The illustrations alone would make this a memorable book, but the text is what makes it useful and really interesting for me.It shows not just evolving attitudes towards grizzlies, but also a rapidly evolving society and the impact of technological change.  In the early days, we read about young California Indians going out in groups of four or five, carrying bows and arrows, to hunt grizzlies, as a sort of tag team, in which all the men except one conceal themselves.  The one man in the open shoots an arrow at the bear and then runs, letting the bear chase him, until the man goes into hiding and another man fires an arrow at the bear and runs away with the bear in pursuit.  This continues until the bear is too wounded and too tired to continue.After Mexicans occupied much of the land, grizzly hunting changed to several young men lassoing the beast.  It's fascinating to read about a California so different than the one I live in today, a time when encounters with grizzlies were common and young men took pride in their abilities to vanquish the beast.As the 19th century proceeds, however, something changes.  Part of it is technological change, which produces guns that are much more effective for killing grizzlies.  Partly it's also the flood of settlers into back country.  California Indians had revered and coexisted with these beasts, Mexicans saw them as sport but it still took several brave and skilled young men to lasso them.  But as the century wore on, the need for more land that was safe for settlers combined with the more powerful guns becoming available slowly changed grizzly hunting into more of a grizzly slaughter and events became popular in which bears were pitted against bulls in a fight to the death.The book concludes with the usage of the bear as a symbol in California history, ranging from the Bear Flag revolt to a bear as the U.C. Berkeley mascot.This is a fascinating book.  I've just touched on the surface in this review.  If you want to get a taste of how life was lived here in the 19th century and earlier, this is a great resource.  The book fortunately has an index. Each quote in the text, which can be several pages long, cites the source at the end of the quote.This is a book you will want to keep coming back to.  I highly recommend it.This book is jointly published by the U.C Berkeley Bancroft Library and Heyday Books, located in Berkeley. Heyday publishes excellent books about California Indian history and also the respected magazine ""News from Native California"". I highly recommend them.  This is the second Heyday book that I've reviewed for Amazon.  I have many more in my library.  When time permits, I'll review more of them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2000Q07R66YAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890771708#wasThisHelpful","R2000Q07R66YAJ","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to disclose two things first of all:1) I know the author professionally through our roles as directors of the Miwok Archeological Preserve of Marin (MAPOM), a nonprofit founded in the 1970s and dedicated to promoting accurate knowledge of the Coast Miwok Indians.2) Several years ago I wrote an article that was published by ""News from Native California"", which is published by this book's publisher.Reading this book answered many questions for which I had not found answers in my preceding two decades of researching local history.  I've read mission records (to the extent that my very limited Spanish allows) and 19th century publications, but although it's a cliché, the research in this book really did blow me away.Starting around the time of the birth of the man we know today as ""Chief Marin"" in 1781, Betty Goerke presents a thoroughly researched picture of Coast Miwok life when the Spanish first arrived here and the changes that overwhelmed them as first the Spanish colonized them, then the Mexicans, and finally as they were caught up in the Bear Flag Revolt that resulted in California becoming part of the United States.  It's a harrowing tale of continual wrenching change from one generation to the next for a hundred years as the world Coast Miwoks had always known morphed into something new and alien.Although it's a well-researched book by a respected college teacher who's been researching the subject for decades, ""Chief Marin"" is also a very readable book.  It's not a dry academic work.  Researchers like me can learn much from it, but so can casual readers.For the benefit of those who have not yet read the book: the man we know today as Chief Marin was not actually a chief.  He was born with the name Huicmuse and at age 20 entered Mission Dolores, where he was baptized as ""Marino"" but was also known as ""Marin"". As far as I know, he was never a leader in his birth village (today's town of Mill Valley).  He was highly regarded, was probably from a well connected family, led an insurgency against Mexican domination, and carried a great deal of authority, but was never a tribal chief. ""Chief Marin"" is simply the name people have used for him since the 19th century.I also need to mention the book's publisher, Heyday Books of Berkeley, CA.  They publish excellent books about California Indian history and also the respected magazine ""News from Native California"".  When most people think of Native Americans, they think of tribes from east of the Rockies or the south west.  Here in California, traditions and languages were often very different from other parts of what is now the United States.  Heyday Books' publications are a great place to begin learning more.  I highly recommend them. (Disclosure: I've written an article for Heyday's ""News from Native California"", but my only connection otherwise to Heyday is as a long time enthusiastic customer).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8A4YRZ37B9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597140538#wasThisHelpful","R3G8A4YRZ37B9K","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IMPORTANT NOTE: The Amazon page for this watch currently (as of June 29, 2013) incorrectly shows this watch's band width as 26mm.  It's actually only 21mm.  I was surprised when I temporarily replaced the band with a 20mm band and it fit almost perfectly, so I measured it and confirmed that the watch takes only a 21mm band.One other error on the Amazon page: the complete model number is MTP-1183Q-7ADF.  This is the number shown on the warranty after I registered it on the Casio website. The Amazon page incorrectly gives the watch model as MTP1183Q.  The model number stamped on the back of the watch case is MTP-1183.See the update at the end of this review for information about replacing the battery and especially about how to close the case afterward.Three things immediately impressed me when I received this watch yesterday: 1. This is a beautiful watch 2. The bezel around the watch face is raised above the watch crystal.  This will help reduce the scratching problem that's been so common on Casio watches in recent years.  It gives the watch some protection if you accidentally hit a wall or door with it.  Most Casio watches I've seen don't have this. 3. When I registered the watch on the Casio website, the warranty was extended from one year to two years.  The webpage said that the extension is only for this particular model and didn't mention any expiration date for this offer.  I registered it in June 2013.  NOTE: I bought the watch from Watchtronics.  I don't know whether all sellers of this watch offer the factory warranty.I really only have one gripe about the watch, but it's not serious enough to knock any stars off.  The band is much too shiny. It's especially bothersome to me because the watch is also very shiny.  I immediately replaced the band with a Speidel band that I already had.  The watch looks much better with a more normal leather band.  This is personal preference.  I'm sure many people will love the band's looks.  Inexpensive Casio watches tend to have really cheap looking bands, but this one is not cheap looking.  It's just too shiny for my taste.The other reviewers who complained about its stiffness are right.  It was even stiffer than I expected.  My first reaction was to wonder whether it came from a Kevlar cow (just kidding!).  The other reviewers are probably right that it will become more pliable after it's been worn for a while.  I won't know because I immediately replaced mine.The Amazon pages shows this watch's band as 26mm, but it's actually 21mm.  The 20mm Speidel band I put on it is almost a perfect fit.  Just a very small part of one pin is showing.  The Speidel is a nice band, but it's lighter in color than I'd like on this watch, so I'm looking for dark leather band.  I'll update this review after I find a band that looks good on it.This is a discontinued Casio model, so you won't find it on the Casio website, although you can register it for the warranty and get a two year warranty.  I knew it was a discontinued model but bought it anyway because for me it looks better than current models.  The main risk in buying it is that the battery may be older than on a current model and so could need to be replaced sooner.  It's a risk I'm willing to take for this watch.The watch's module number is 1332.  The back of the watch states that it was assembled in China, but that movement is Japanese.The day of the month window is very small and difficult to read.  This is fine with me.  I didn't want a date display at all.  I have enough other digital devices that give me the date.  I just want the time from my watch.  If you want the date, this is not the best watch for you.The procedure for precisely setting the time is: 1. Wait for the second hand to reach 12 o'clock and pull out the crown (the button on the side) two clicks. 2. Rotate the crown to the correct time 3. Rotate the crown to move the minute hand four or five minutes past the correct time. 4. Rotate the crown to move the minute hand back to the correct time 5. Push the crown all the way in.To set the day: 1. Don't set the date at night between 8pm and 2am. 2. Pull the crown out to the first click 3. Rotate the crown until the correct day of the month is displayed.  It takes several turns of the crown for each day.  You can't rotate back a day.  You can only go forward.  It takes so many winds for each day that if you accidentally set it one day in advance, it will take a minute or two for you to wind it all the way forward to the correct day.The date feature strikes me as completely useless.  There's no way to set the month and year, so there's no way for the watch to know how many days the current month has.  It seems to me that unless you reset the day of month every time there are two consecutive months with different numbers of days, the day of month displayed will be wrong.  However the date display is so small that you may not even notice that the date is wrong.  I don't plan on even looking at it!I am grateful for Amazon's ""Free Return"" policy for watches.  It's hard to tell from a photograph whether a particular watch is right for you.  I ordered three watches over a three week period.  The first two were both Casio models I thought I would like, but which I disliked when I saw them in person, so I returned both.  This is the third watch.  I knew immediately upon seeing it that this was the watch I wanted.I'll update this review if anything changes.  Overall this watch impresses me other than the shiny, stiff band and the date display.UPDATE AFTER TWO YEARSI'm still happy with this watch after two years, but I don't wear it every day.  I use a different Casio with a nylon band as my every day watch so sweat doesn't damage the leather band on this one when I exercise.  I wear this watch when I want a better looking watch. Unlike other Casio's I've bought in recent years, the crystal hasn't gotten scratched at all.  I've had others that scratched almost immediately with less wear than this watch has had.The battery lasted a little under two years.  I replaced it myself.  The battery is a 377 Silver Oxide. Opening the case and replacing the battery is fairly easy, but putting the back of the case back on is not. You can find YouTube videos showing how to open the case.  I used a Stanley utility knife to pry the rear case off.  There's one spot where you can insert the knife edge.  Don't use a household knife - the blade probably won't be sharp and strong enough.  You can use the knife point to nudge the old battery out.The problem came in closing the case.  Before trying to close it, be very careful to align the tiny cutout in the case back with the winding stem.  The cut out is very small.  It's easy to miss and easy to get out of alignment when you do the next step.The next step is closing the case.  It's tricky.  There's a YouTube video showing how to do it with a vice, but it did not work for me.  I ended up using an 11SP Irwin Vise Grip, but a G-clamp or regular Vise Grip should work also.  I placed pieces of thin wood on both the front and rear of the watch to protect it.  It takes a lot of pressure to get the case back on.  You'll feel like you're going to crush the case, and you might if you're not careful.  I worked up slowly, repeatedly opening the Vise Grips and turning the adjusting screw in just slight more, then trying again to close the Vise Grips.  When you get the right amount of pressure, you'll know it.  The case snaps closed loudly.My watch is now back together and running fine again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WM1NUM6FUTO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00170IHHA#wasThisHelpful","R2WM1NUM6FUTO2","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cancelled this order after discovering that it doesn't carry a warranty when sold by the seller I ordered it from (this watch is sold by several sellers), but it was shipped despite my cancellation.  In the picture it's pretty much exactly the watch I want, so I opened the package, thinking that if I really liked it, I'd buy it even without a warranty.Here's what I've observed about it:- The face looks great.  It has a black background with shiny silver hands and hour markers that should make it relatively easy to read in low light without illumination. I especially like the Spartan non-numeric hour markers.- The band has eleven links that can be removed.  This is much more than my other Casio bracelet watch, which only had seven removable links.  It should fit very small wrists.- The seller's description said that this watch shows the date, but thankfully it does not.  I have other gadgets that give me plenty of digital data including the date.  I just want the time from a watch.- The band is a very shiny silver, except for the middle section.  It's listed as being 22mm in width, but at the pin it looks almost identical in width to my 20mm bands.  It tapers down a much approximately 14mm at the clasp.  It looks to me more like a woman's band.- The bezel around the watch's face and the sides are shiny silver, but the tops of the pin mount section are a dull finish.  I didn't like this contrast.- The band's clasp doesn't have the locking mechanism that my other Casio bracelet has.  It will be easier for this one to fall off if the clasp catches on something.I see a lot of complaining in reviews of other Casio bracelet watches about them being too large and hard to remove links.  Removing links is actually fairly easy.  Just look for little round holes on the inside of the bracelet.  You'll see an arrow next to it.  It points in the direction the pin comes out.  To remove three links from my other Casio bracelet, I just used a steak knife with a sharp point and pushed through the hole until the pin just began to emerge from the side.The pin is not a traditional straight pin.  It's a ""J"" shaped flat piece of metal.  After you've pushed it so it's begun to stick out of the side of the link, use a very small needle nose pliers with a sharp point to grab hold of the pin and pull it the rest of the way out.  My needle nose came in a jewelry making kit.After you've removed enough links, put two links adjacent to each other and push the pin back in.  The needle nose helps a lot here.This model has been discontinued by Casio.  This means that the watch probably has been sitting around for a while and the battery may not last as long as on a current watch.  It also means that you can't download the manual or battery information from the Casio website.  The Casio website however does have links to affiliates who service discontinued watches.Buying it without a warranty may not be as foolhardy as it seems.  Digital components are most likely to fail while they are still new.  If it's been sitting in a warehouse for a while and it's still running, it may be worth taking a chance on.The face on this watch is almost exactly what I was looking for. If I liked the band, I'd keep it despite not getting a warranty.  However the band is unacceptable to me, partly because of the lack of a locking mechanism on the clasp and partly because of the small size.  To my eyes, it looks almost feminine.  The large number of removable links suggests to me that Casio sees this as a watch that might appeal to women also.Even though I'm going to return it, I know that this is a watch that some people will love.  I'm knocking off a star for the problems with the band.  Otherwise it's a very nice watch.One other thing: despite the seller telling me that the watch does not come with a Casio warranty, there is a Casio warranty card in the box.  If I were keeping the watch, I'd try sending in the card or registering the watch on the Casio website, just in case it actually is covered by a warranty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R223F2N1T90T1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VYO7NQ#wasThisHelpful","R223F2N1T90T1I","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this for three weeks and have used it four times, switching bands between watches.  It works perfectly and feels high quality. It's heavier than I expected, a good sign, and seems well made.  The tip shows no sign of bending or wear yet.I don't understand the problems that some reviewers have had.  I've only used one of the tools, for removing watch band pins, but it hasn't bent and still looks like new.  I also don't understand the problem people have had tightening the retaining nuts.  On mine they screw on and off easily and the attachments are perfectly tight. It's possible that quality control is extremely poor, resulting in some very low quality units getting out, but it's hard for me to imagine it being that low quality.  My unit is solid and well made.One reviewer described it as ""chrome plated plastic"".  That's definitely not the case with mine.  It's solid metal.I wish I had bought this years ago. I've always used a sharp knife for removing watch bands, but this makes the job much easier and faster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25O0QFW4X4ME5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZEWGSA#wasThisHelpful","R25O0QFW4X4ME5","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had these just over a year and still find these speakers amazing.  I usually use them on my netbook and find they put out an decent volume of sound of impressive quality.I'm not saying they will satisfy audiophiles. These are, after all, relatively inexpensive USB speakers without a lot of bass.  But I was impressed today when I moved my Altec Lansing speakers from the desktop computer I'm using to write this to the computer I use with my music synthesizer and temporarily replaced the Altec on this computer with the Logitech USB.  It doesn't have the bass or volume of the Altec speakers, but it does have as much volume as I need in my small office and quite good sound quality.To get the best volume and sound quality, I open up the Windows Sound window.  Depending on how your Windows PC is configured, there will be one of two ways for you to do this.  First click the Start button and then Control Panel.  If you see a vertical menu list of items, scroll down to Sound and click that; if you see two columns of categories, click Hardware and Sound and then click Sound. Here you'll find options that should improve your listening experience with these speakers.It's on a netbook or laptop that these speakers really shine.  If you've been using a standard netbook or laptop speaker, these will be heaven to you.My only complaint is that the USB cord is short.  It's no problem on my netbook or on my ancient Thinkpad, but for some larger laptops, it could be an issue.  Otherwise, if you're looking for inexpensive USB speakers, it's hard to beat these.  I was going to add ""portable"" to that list, but after listening to them just now on this desktop and playing with the Windows Sound window to tweak it, they also make decent, though not ideal, speakers for a desktop.  The short USB cord can be a problem when using it with a desktop, but a USB extension cable can remedy this.I'll still order larger speakers, probably another set of Altec Lansings, to replace the ones I moved to the other desktop computer, but in the meantime, I don't mind listening to this Logitech, and I love it when I'm on my netbook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J04VXQ9CRVU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VAK1I2#wasThisHelpful","R2J04VXQ9CRVU0","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this tape the first time I used it, but I've waited to write this review until I had used it enough to confirm my first impression.  Now, after shipping about a dozen boxes in recent months, the verdict is in: I love this tape!Unlike the tape I was using before, this tape is easy to work with. No more struggling to find the end of the tape and then struggling to get the entire width of the tape to pull up without tearing into jagged strips.  Finding the end is easy, and pulling it up intact is even easier.As other reviewers have commented, be sure that after you use it, the end of the tape is under the little claws designed to hold it in place.  If you don't, then the next time you need to use it, you'll have to go through the process of finding the end of the tape on the roll, but this is much, much easier than with other clear packing tape that I've used.In addition to tearing less easily than other tapes, it seems at least as strong, though I haven't compared strengths in any quantifiable way.The bottom line is that after using this for a few months, I'll never go back to standard clear packing tape. The time and frustration I save by using it more than justifies the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WOPDH5XD6ETK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HX1HG#wasThisHelpful","R1WOPDH5XD6ETK","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE after one year of ownership:  This little heater continues to impress me.  I don't know how it would perform in a really cold climate, but here in Northern California, where nighttime winter temperatures rarely go much below freezing, it's outstanding at heating a small space quickly.  The room where I now work is unheated; it was converted from being the house's garage.  I use a deLonghi oil radiator heater for the main heat in this room, but off course it takes a long time to warm up.  The Lasko heats the area around my desk quickly while the deLonghi is warming up.  After the deLonghi is warm, I switch off the Lasko.  This combination works well for me, and using the Lasko this way allows me to conserve power by using the deLonghi at a lower power setting.I was impressed enough with the Lasko that I ordered a second one (a model 103, identical except for having a red front).  I use one in a separate building behind my house and the other in an unheated room inside my house.  Neither Lasko is my main heater.  They just provide heat while the oil radiators come up to temperature.  They also occasionally provide a relatively low power supplemental source of heat as an alternate to using an oil radiator heater at a higher power setting.After a year of ownership, I'm raising my original four star rating to five stars.  The price is so low and the heater works so well that the little guy deserves it.My original review:This little guy puts out an impressive amount of heat.  It won't heat a large or even medium sized space, but if you need to heat under your desk or very near your person, it definitely puts out the heat.  It works well in my 8'x 9' office in a standalone unheated, uninsulated brick building. I've only owned it for two weeks, so I can't attest to its durability, but its three year warranty does offer some assurance.Ironically, I canceled the Lasko after ordering it and ordered a Vornado Personal Vortex 375/750 watt heater instead, but Amazon was unable to cancel the Lasko in time and shipped it.  I left it packed in the box for a week, intending to return it... until I became frustrated with the Vornado's pathetic heat and out of curiosity, opened the Lasko and tried it.  I was immediately impressed with the heat it generates, so much so that I've returned the Vornado and ordered a second Lasko MyHeat.My main use for the two Lasko's will be supplementing the oil filled heater in my office, which during the winter can be as cold as low forties Fahrenheit when I open it in the morning.  The Lasko's will provide immediate heat while the oil-filled heater slowly heats up.A secondary use for one Lasko will be cold weather camping in my truck.  The power draw is low enough that I can power it using the deep cycle battery I carry when traveling.My only real complaint about the Lasko is the lack of any tip-over protection.  A thermostat would be nice, but for this price, I'm not complaining.  However I am knocking off one star for the lack of tip-over protection.  This is my one concern about camping with this heater.  I don't use heat while sleeping so it won't be a problem for me, but for anyone who camps with it and leaves it on while sleeping, you'll need to be very careful to prevent it being accidentally knocked over during the night and starting a fire.  I plan to affix Velcro to the bottom to protect against tipover.Other than that, this is an outstanding little heater.  Its looks won't impress people, but it will keep a small space warm while consuming very little power.UPDATE: I've used my Kill-A-Watt meter to confirm the wattage of nine electric space heaters.  Virtually all of them have actual wattages that are below the claimed rating. The exception: both of my Lasko MyHeats.  Lasko claims 200 watts, but one of mine has an actual wattage of 211 and the other 202.  By comparison, the Vornado Personal Vortex Heater, which I originally wanted but ended up returning, claims 375/750 watts, but the unit I had was only 326/696 watts.  I don't say this to disparage Vornado.  Nearly every other space heater I've tested had lower wattages than claimed, except these two little Lasko's.General information about buying electric space heaters:=============================================I've owned and used electric space heaters since 1988, mostly DeLonghi oil filled radiators.  When I recently began looking for a heater that would warm up a room faster,  I was frustrated at the lack of hard, objective, facts about electric space heaters.  Even the manufacturer websites often fail to mention or makes it hard to learn the most basic information you need to know, such as wattage ratings and warranty lengths.  Not even Consumer Reports has enough information to really inform a consumer.  Therefore it's up to us as consumers to share what we know.  The rest of this review shares some of what I've learned.In case you're wondering what heater I decided on to replace my DeLonghi, I didn't, at least not yet.  I tried  a Vornado PVH and a Bionaire BH1331-U, but I ended up returning both heaters.  I'm sticking with my oil-filled heaters for now.Basic electric space heater facts:1. All electric space heaters are equally efficient.  All heaters rated at 1500 watts output the same amount of heat, but may do it very differently.  You have to choose the one that heats the way you need it.2. Power consumption is determined by two things: the power setting you're using and how long the heater is actually on.  Turning up the thermostat setting doesn't increase the heat or power consumption; it just lengthens the time that your heater will be running.3. To reduce power consumption, use the lowest power setting on your heater that produces the heat you need.4. An electric space heater will save you money only if you turn your central heating down or off and use space heaters to heat only the rooms where you need heat.5. The only kind of electric space heater that's likely to provide adequate heat in a large or draft space is a radiant heater (not to be confused with a radiator heater, which is very different), but radiant heaters pose a fire hazard.Don't take manufacturer wattage claims too seriously. When I used my Kill-A-Watt meter on six space heaters, I found variations of up to 200 watts between the claimed and actual wattage for each space heater.  In most cases the actual watts were less than the claimed watts, but one of my DeLonghi's 1500 watt heaters turned out actually to be a 1600 watt heater.Two crucial steps in finding the electric space heater that's right for you:============================================================1. Learn which heater is right for your needs.  A huge percentage of complaints by reviewers about space heaters are due to reviewers buying the wrong type of heater for their needs.  Your first step should be to decide between the basic types: Ceramic heaters with a fan, oil-filled radiator, micathermic, and radiant.  First learn the conditions in which each one works best and works best and then select the type that will work best for your needs.  There is no one single ""best"" heater for all situations.  Each one has conditions in which it works well and conditions in which it's terrible.2. Look at the warranties.  Warranties on space heaters range from one year to five years.  Delonghi and Soleus heaters that I've checked have one year warranties.  Other companies, such as Bionaire, Honeywell, Lasko, and Vornado offer three year and five year warranties on many - but not all - of their models.  If a company offers only a one year warranty on some models but a five year warranty on others (such as Bionaire), it raises question about the durability of the heater with the shorter warranty.  However a long warranty is only as good as the company offering it.  Read reviews to learn what experiences people have when their heaters die while still under warranty.In most cases, you'll have to download the manual from the manufacturer's website to get the length of the warranty.  It's a nuisance, but it's worth taking the time to do.Don't let anyone tell you that any particular type of heater is ""the best"".  The best type is the one that best suits YOUR needs.  The best heater for me might be the worst heater for you.  Some heaters heat up a cold room faster, some keep a room at a steady temperature, and some will work better in a large space.Some questions you need to ask yourself before deciding which type of heater to buy- Will it be keeping a room at a steady temperature? (oil-filled radiator or micathermics heaters might be best)- Will it be heating up a cold room?  (a heater with a fan or a radiant heater might be best)- Are there children or pets who might be injured by touching a hot surface? (oil-filled radiator and radiant heater might be a problem)- Do you want to heat just a particular spot rather than the whole room? (radiant heaters might be best- Are you concerned about fire risks?  (oil-filled radiator or micathermic heaters might be best, though no space heater is completely safe)Oil-filled radiators:These are my favorite heaters.  These are the heaters that look like old-fashioned steam radiators.  The oil retains its warmth after the thermostat cycles off, which is important if you want to keep a room at a steady temperature.  The downside is that the oil takes longer to heat initially, which is why these heaters take so long to warm up. I have two DeLonghi  oil-filled radiators; I've been using one of them for 23 years, and the other is about eight years old.  I love the heat they provide.  It's steady, warm, with no noise and no drying out of the air like with some other types of heaters.  They are ideal for maintaining a steady temperature in an enclosed room.Oil filled heaters have a huge drawback, however: they are terrible at heating up a cold room.  It can take an oil-filled heater hours longer to heat up a cold room than other types of heaters.The US Department of Energy recommends oil-filled heaters as the most efficient, because the fins generate warmth even when the heater's thermostat cycles off.  However this efficiency is only when the heater is continually on, keeping a room at a constant temperature.  If you turn the heater on and off frequently, you'll lose most of the efficiency that's inherent in these heaters.If you have children or pets, look into one of the shielded radiator heaters.  I prefer the unshielded ones because they radiate more heat laterally, but the surface can get very hot and be a hazard if touched.  DeLonghi claims that their shielded radiator heaters circulate heated air more quickly.  Both of mine are unshielded, so I have no way of confirming that.  My concern about the shielded radiators is that they would direct more hot air up rather than to the side, where I need it.If your electric rates are different for different times of the day, you can use this to your advantage in setting your radiator heater toswitch on and warm the room from cold when rates are low, then let it provide steady heat when rates are higher.A word of warning about oil-filled radiators: if one is poorly made or damaged, it can leak oil and permanently damage rugs and floors or even start a fire.  Only buy from a reputable manufacturer and don't accept one that has any visible damage.Ceramic fan heaters:These are great at heating a room quickly, however many people including myself don't like the heat they blow.  I don't mind it in my Vornado Personal Heater (375/700watt), which is located under my desk, but I thoroughly dislike it in the old Honeywell ceramic oscillating heater that came with my house.  I much prefer the warmth that comes from an oil-filled radiator. Ceramic heaters can be most effective at quickly warming up a cold room.Radiant heatersRadiant heaters (don't confuse them with radiator heaters!) work by heating whatever they are pointed at rather than heating the air in the room.  If you have a large, drafty space, a radiant heater might be your best choice, because it doesn't heat the air, only the objects and people it's directed at.Micathermic heatersMicathermic heaters work similarly to oil-filled radiators, except that instead of heavy metal fins filled with hot oil, micathermic heaters have thin sheets of mica that heat up.  I've only had experience with one micathermic, a Bionaire BH1331-U, and found that it's exterior surface remained very cool except for a few very warm spots on top.  There would be less risk of young children being burned by touching a micathermic heater than an oil-filled radiator.  Micathermic heaters are slower heating than ceramic fan heaters, but are faster then oil-filled radiators..Baseboard heatersI have a Lakewood oil-filled baseboard heater I bought five years ago that has many of the advantages of a micathermic heater.  It heats faster than an oil-filled radiator but has no hot surfaces and low fire risk.  My Lakewood does an excellent job of heating my 12x15 bedroom.However I have not researched baseboard heaters and only have experience with this Lakewood, so I don't know whether others are as good as this one.  I was impressed that when I measured the actual wattages of my various space heaters, the Lakewood's actual wattages came closest to its claimed wattages of all the other heaters I tested.  Lakewood unfortunately went out of business in 2009 and had a major problem with oil leaking from its heaters a few years earlier. Despite this, it's in many ways my best heater and has the lowest cost of operation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E7LHKPBOD3MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XDTWN2#wasThisHelpful","R1E7LHKPBOD3MX","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!I recently reviewed ""Sherlock"" and gave it five stars, which leaves me in a bit of a dilemma, because if ""Sherlock"" deserves five stars - which it definitely does - then ""Jekyll"" deserves more stars.  The quality in ""Sherlock"" is uneven, with the second episode mediocre, but the quality of ""Jekyll"" never deteriorates as the series progresses.  If anything, it improves.There's so much to love in this series: the writing, the cinematography, and above all the acting of James Nesbitt. He is superb, playing Dr Jackman (the modern day Dr Jekyll), Hyde, and the original Dr Jekyll.  He is an amazing actor who I had I had not really been aware of before seeing ""Jekyll"", despite his long filmography.It's tough to review ""Jekyll"" without giving away spoilers, which I don't intend to do.  This series is like peeling an onion.  Each time you think they've taken it about as far as they can, they go deeper into another surprising and unexpected layer of the story, including interweaving with the original Robert Louis Stevenson story.I wasn't a fan of any of the earlier versions of this story, and am not a fan of horror in general.  They are mostly so unimaginative, but ""Jekyll"" is in a class by itself.  I confess sheepishly that inexplicably I haven't read the original novel.  Now that I've seen this series, I'm definitely going to read it.In my ""Sherlock"" review, I started off by saying, ""I'm fairly skeptical about adaptions that transplant classic tales into the contemporary world..."".  The same is true of ""Jekyll"", and just like with ""Sherlock"", the adaptation surprisingly works, and works very well.The non-linear storytelling in the series is fascinating and works quite well.  I'm not usually a big fan of flashbacks and flashforwards - unless well done, they just disrupt the storytelling - but in this case, they are done superbly.I watched the TV series, not the DVD, so I can't address any issues regarding the DVD.The next time I'm in the library, I'm going to check out the original Robert Louis Stevenson novel.  I now have an interest in reading it that I never had before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8OFMGC3VQKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QXDEH2#wasThisHelpful","R2N8OFMGC3VQKA","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this in hopes of upgrading from my ancient DeLonghi oil-filled radiator, but the Bionaire is not up to the job.  It puts out much less heat than any of my other four whole room space heaters (two DeLonghi oil-filled radiators, one Lakewood oil-filled baseboard heater, and one Honeywell oscillating ceramic heater).  I'm returning the Bionaire tomorrow after a week of ownership.There is one thing I like about this heater: it has two lights, one to indicate that it's plugged in and the other to indicate that it's turned on.  I wish more heaters had both lights.However I have far more gripes than praise for this heater.  For one thing, as of this writing, Bionaire fails to mention two very important facts on its website and in its description: unlike some other Bionaire heaters with five year warranties, this one only has a one year warranty and it's only a 1000 watt heater.  I confirmed with my Kill-A-Watt meter that the low setting is 900 watts and the high setting is 1000 watts.  The main difference between the high and low settings is a weak but very noisy fan that comes on automatically on high.Another complaint: extremely flimsy construction.  This is the only heater I've owned - including my tiny 200 watt Lasko - that feels tinny and like it could fall apart if I wasn't careful in handling it.  Adding to the sensation of shoddiness in mine was a loose interior part that banged around whenever I moved the heater.One more complaint is the thermostat knob.  There are no numbers.  I'm not one of those who expects room temperature readings on a space heater, but it is helpful as a reference to have numbers to make it easier to remember what setting you want to use.All in all this was a disappointment.  I hoped I'd be moving into the next generation of heaters beyond oil-filled radiators, but instead I'm returning the Bionaire and returning to the old oil-filled radiators with a new appreciation for their sturdy reliability. I've owned one of my DeLonghi's for 23 years.I like the idea of this heater's design.  If it were a 1500 watt heater with a five year warranty, I'd be much more enthusiastic about it.  But considering how flimsy it feels and the loose part inside it, one has to wonder why Bionaire warranties some other micathermic heaters for five years but this one for only one year.Some reviewers complain about a smell, but this shouldn't be a problem if you let it burn off before you use it indoors.  This is standard for any micathermic or oil-filled radiator heater.  I left my Bionaire outside for about three hours on high, and even after bringing it indoors it took another hour or so for the smell to entirely go away, but after that there were no more odors at all, even operating it in a small 8'x9' room.General information about buying electric space heaters:=============================================I've owned and used electric space heaters since 1988, mostly DeLonghi oil filled radiators.  When I recently began looking for a heater that would warm up a room faster,  I was frustrated at the lack of hard, objective, facts about electric space heaters.  Even the manufacturer websites often fail to mention or makes it hard to learn the most basic information you need to know, such as wattage ratings and warranty lengths.  Not even Consumer Reports has enough information to really inform a consumer.  Therefore it's up to us as consumers to share what we know.  The rest of this review shares some of what I've learned.In case you're wondering what heater I decided on to replace my DeLonghi, I didn't, at least not yet.  I tried  a Vornado PVH and a Bionaire BH1331-U, but I ended up returning both heaters.  I'm sticking with my oil-filled heaters for now.Basic electric space heater facts:1. All electric space heaters are equally efficient.  All heaters rated at 1500 watts output the same amount of heat, but may do it very differently.  You have to choose the one that heats the way you need it.2. Power consumption is determined by two things: the power setting you're using and how long the heater is actually on.  Turning up the thermostat setting doesn't increase the heat or power consumption; it just lengthens the time that your heater will be running.3. To reduce power consumption, use the lowest power setting on your heater that produces the heat you need.4. An electric space heater will save you money only if you turn your central heating down or off and use space heaters to heat only the rooms where you need heat.5. The only kind of electric space heater that's likely to provide adequate heat in a large or draft space is a radiant heater (not to be confused with a radiator heater, which is very different), but radiant heaters pose a fire hazard.Don't take manufacturer wattage claims too seriously. When I used my Kill-A-Watt meter on six space heaters, I found variations of up to 200 watts between the claimed and actual wattage for each space heater.  In most cases the actual watts were less than the claimed watts, but one of my DeLonghi's 1500 watt heaters turned out actually to be a 1600 watt heater.Two crucial steps in finding the electric space heater that's right for you:============================================================1. Learn which heater is right for your needs.  A huge percentage of complaints by reviewers about space heaters are due to reviewers buying the wrong type of heater for their needs.  Your first step should be to decide between the basic types: Ceramic heaters with a fan, oil-filled radiator, micathermic, and radiant.  First learn the conditions in which each one works best and works best and then select the type that will work best for your needs.  There is no one single ""best"" heater for all situations.  Each one has conditions in which it works well and conditions in which it's terrible.2. Look at the warranties.  Warranties on space heaters range from one year to five years.  Delonghi and Soleus heaters that I've checked have one year warranties.  Other companies, such as Bionaire, Honeywell, Lasko, and Vornado offer three year and five year warranties on many - but not all - of their models.  If a company offers only a one year warranty on some models but a five year warranty on others (such as Bionaire), it raises question about the durability of the heater with the shorter warranty.  However a long warranty is only as good as the company offering it.  Read reviews to learn what experiences people have when their heaters die while still under warranty.In most cases, you'll have to download the manual from the manufacturer's website to get the length of the warranty.  It's a nuisance, but it's worth taking the time to do.Don't let anyone tell you that any particular type of heater is ""the best"".  The best type is the one that best suits YOUR needs.  The best heater for me might be the worst heater for you.  Some heaters heat up a cold room faster, some keep a room at a steady temperature, and some will work better in a large space.Some questions you need to ask yourself before deciding which type of heater to buy- Will it be keeping a room at a steady temperature? (oil-filled radiator or micathermics heaters might be best)- Will it be heating up a cold room?  (a heater with a fan or a radiant heater might be best)- Are there children or pets who might be injured by touching a hot surface? (oil-filled radiator and radiant heater might be a problem)- Do you want to heat just a particular spot rather than the whole room? (radiant heaters might be best- Are you concerned about fire risks?  (oil-filled radiator or micathermic heaters might be best, though no space heater is completely safe)Oil-filled radiators:These are my favorite heaters.  These are the heaters that look like old-fashioned steam radiators.  The oil retains its warmth after the thermostat cycles off, which is important if you want to keep a room at a steady temperature.  The downside is that the oil takes longer to heat initially, which is why these heaters take so long to warm up. I have two DeLonghi  oil-filled radiators; I've been using one of them for 23 years, and the other is about eight years old.  I love the heat they provide.  It's steady, warm, with no noise and no drying out of the air like with some other types of heaters.  They are ideal for maintaining a steady temperature in an enclosed room.Oil filled heaters have a huge drawback, however: they are terrible at heating up a cold room.  It can take an oil-filled heater hours longer to heat up a cold room than other types of heaters.The US Department of Energy recommends oil-filled heaters as the most efficient, because the fins generate warmth even when the heater's thermostat cycles off.  However this efficiency is only when the heater is continually on, keeping a room at a constant temperature.  If you turn the heater on and off frequently, you'll lose most of the efficiency that's inherent in these heaters.If you have children or pets, look into one of the shielded radiator heaters.

"I tried to like this heater.  I really did, but it's actually not correct to call it a ""heater"".  It's really a ""warmer"".  I ended up returning it after several weeks of trying hard to make it work for me.It performs nicely in cool rooms.  It's probably ideal for an office or cubicle in a modern, heated building where you just need a little more warmth in your personal space.  The vortex action of the Vornado is impressive.  Unlike heaters that aim the heat at you, the Vornado aims it around you rather than simply blowing it on you.However if you are like me and need to heat a cold room, this is not the device for you.  During the winter, the temperature inside my office when I open it up in the morning is usually in the 42F-55F range, and this heater completely fails at heating it up. I was using the heater in conjunction with my oil-filled radiator, with the Vornado providing some heat while the oil-filled heater slowly heats up.  The tiny 200 watt Lasko MyHeat does an excellent job at this, but the Vornado does not.  Used in this way, The Vornado actually takes nearly twice as long to bring my tiny office up to 67F as the little Lasko does.However, I don't want to totally bash the Vornado.  For people with other heating needs, it could be a perfect choice.What I like about it:- The tip-over switch works well, almost too well. The first day I used it, I didn't notice that the rear edge was resting on a USB cable. It was enough to stop the heater from working. It's a good safety feature.- It appears well made- The heater is good looking, a shiny black with a silver grill. I don't really care how a heater looks as long as it works well, but it's a definite plus to have it be good looking as well as functional.- It comes with a three year warranty, longer than many heaters.What I don't like:- The switches are on back, so you can't see them unless you pick up the heater and turn it around. Until you're used to it, selecting high and low settings without seeing the buttons can be tricky, especially with a non-heat fan-only option between high and low. It was a nuisance, especially on a heater without a thermostat.- The warning light that shows that the heater has failed to turn on because of a problem such as sitting at an angle is nearly the same color as the orange power light. It should be a different color, such as red. You get used to it, but there really should be a greater difference in color.I'm knocking off one star for the design problems - in a heater as well designed as the Vornado, they are unexpected - and I'm knocking off a second star for its pathetic heat output.General information about buying electric space heaters:=============================================I've owned and used electric space heaters since 1988, mostly DeLonghi oil filled radiators.

"Although I like this heater, it didn't work for my needs and so I'll be returning it.  I hoped it could take the place of the ancient, oscillating Honeywell ceramic fan heater that I use in the morning to warm up my very cold office (which can be as low as 43 inside when I open it up) before I switch on my oil-filled radiator, but it just does not have the power.I do like this heater.  It worked very well at heating up my 12'x15' bedroom and at keeping my office warm on a coolish afternoon, but it was a total failure at heating up my small, unheated and uninsulated office in the early morning.  It took two hours forty-five minutes to bring my office from 52F to 67F.  My oil-filled radiator does faster!However for less cold situations, this is an excellent heater even for someone like myself who prefers heat from oil-filled radiator heaters.  It's good looking, appears well made, and has an effective tip-over shut off mechanism.  Vornado's five year warranty make it a fairly safe investment that should be satisfactory as long as you aren't trying to heat up a very cold, uninsulated room.I tested it with my Kill-A-Watt to check the accuracy of the wattage claims.  It's rated at 750/1500 watts but on mine, the actual wattages were 725 and 1350.  When I tested it on thermostat operation for keeping a 12x15 room at 68F for 12 hours, I was impressed that the electrical consumption of this heater was actually lower than the oil-filled radiator heater I tested.General information about buying electric space heaters:=============================================I've owned and used electric space heaters since 1988, mostly DeLonghi oil filled radiators.

All electric space heaters are equally efficient.  All heaters rated at 1500 watts output the same amount of heat, but may do it very differently.  You have to choose the one that heats the way you need it.2. Power consumption is determined by two things: the power setting you're using and how long the heater is actually on.  Turning up the thermostat setting doesn't increase the heat or power consumption; it just lengthens the time that your heater will be running.3. To reduce power consumption, use the lowest power setting on your heater that produces the heat you need.4. An electric space heater will save you money only if you turn your central heating down or off and use space heaters to heat only the rooms where you need heat.5. The only kind of electric space heater that's likely to provide adequate heat in a large or draft space is a radiant heater (not to be confused with a radiator heater, which is very different), but radiant heaters pose a fire hazard.Don't take manufacturer wattage claims too seriously. When I used my Kill-A-Watt meter on six space heaters, I found variations of up to 200 watts between the claimed and actual wattage for each space heater.  In most cases the actual watts were less than the claimed watts, but one of my DeLonghi's 1500 watt heaters turned out actually to be a 1600 watt heater.Two crucial steps in finding the electric space heater that's right for you:============================================================1. Learn which heater is right for your needs.  A huge percentage of complaints by reviewers about space heaters are due to reviewers buying the wrong type of heater for their needs.  Your first step should be to decide between the basic types: Ceramic heaters with a fan, oil-filled radiator, micathermic, and radiant.  First learn the conditions in which each one works best and works best and then select the type that will work best for your needs.  There is no one single ""best"" heater for all situations.  Each one has conditions in which it works well and conditions in which it's terrible.2. Look at the warranties.  Warranties on space heaters range from one year to five years.  Delonghi and Soleus heaters that I've checked have one year warranties.  Other companies, such as Bionaire, Honeywell, Lasko, and Vornado offer three year and five year warranties on many - but not all - of their models.  If a company offers only a one year warranty on some models but a five year warranty on others (such as Bionaire), it raises question about the durability of the heater with the shorter warranty.  However a long warranty is only as good as the company offering it.  Read reviews to learn what experiences people have when their heaters die while still under warranty.In most cases, you'll have to download the manual from the manufacturer's website to get the length of the warranty.  It's a nuisance, but it's worth taking the time to do.Don't let anyone tell you that any particular type of heater is ""the best"".  The best type is the one that best suits YOUR needs.  The best heater for me might be the worst heater for you.  Some heaters heat up a cold room faster, some keep a room at a steady temperature, and some will work better in a large space.Some questions you need to ask yourself before deciding which type of heater to buy- Will it be keeping a room at a steady temperature? (oil-filled radiator or micathermics heaters might be best)- Will it be heating up a cold room?  (a heater with a fan or a radiant heater might be best)- Are there children or pets who might be injured by touching a hot surface? (oil-filled radiator and radiant heater might be a problem)- Do you want to heat just a particular spot rather than the whole room? (radiant heaters might be best- Are you concerned about fire risks?  (oil-filled radiator or micathermic heaters might be best, though no space heater is completely safe)Oil-filled radiators:These are my favorite heaters.  These are the heaters that look like old-fashioned steam radiators.  The oil retains its warmth after the thermostat cycles off, which is important if you want to keep a room at a steady temperature.  The downside is that the oil takes longer to heat initially, which is why these heaters take so long to warm up. I have two DeLonghi  oil-filled radiators; I've been using one of them for 23 years, and the other is about eight years old.  I love the heat they provide.  It's steady, warm, with no noise and no drying out of the air like with some other types of heaters.  They are ideal for maintaining a steady temperature in an enclosed room.Oil filled heaters have a huge drawback, however: they are terrible at heating up a cold room.  It can take an oil-filled heater hours longer to heat up a cold room than other types of heaters.The US Department of Energy recommends oil-filled heaters as the most efficient, because the fins generate warmth even when the heater's thermostat cycles off.  However this efficiency is only when the heater is continually on, keeping a room at a constant temperature.  If you turn the heater on and off frequently, you'll lose most of the efficiency that's inherent in these heaters.If you have children or pets, look into one of the shielded radiator heaters.  I prefer the unshielded ones because they radiate more heat laterally, but the surface can get very hot and be a hazard if touched.  DeLonghi claims that their shielded radiator heaters circulate heated air more quickly.  Both of mine are unshielded, so I have no way of confirming that.  My concern about the shielded radiators is that they would direct more hot air up rather than to the side, where I need it.If your electric rates are different for different times of the day, you can use this to your advantage in setting your radiator heater toswitch on and warm the room from cold when rates are low, then let it provide steady heat when rates are higher.A word of warning about oil-filled radiators: if one is poorly made or damaged, it can leak oil and permanently damage rugs and floors or even start a fire.  Only buy from a reputable manufacturer and don't accept one that has any visible damage.Ceramic fan heaters:These are great at heating a room quickly, however many people including myself don't like the heat they blow.  I don't mind it in my Vornado Personal Heater (375/700watt), which is located under my desk, but I thoroughly dislike it in the old Honeywell ceramic oscillating heater that came with my house.  I much prefer the warmth that comes from an oil-filled radiator. Ceramic heaters can be most effective at quickly warming up a cold room.Radiant heatersRadiant heaters (don't confuse them with radiator heaters!) work by heating whatever they are pointed at rather than heating the air in the room.  If you have a large, drafty space, a radiant heater might be your best choice, because it doesn't heat the air, only the objects and people it's directed at.Micathermic heatersMicathermic heaters work similarly to oil-filled radiators, except that instead of heavy metal fins filled with hot oil, micathermic heaters have thin sheets of mica that heat up.  I've only had experience with one micathermic, a Bionaire BH1331-U, and found that it's exterior surface remained very cool except for a few very warm spots on top.  There would be less risk of young children being burned by touching a micathermic heater than an oil-filled radiator.  Micathermic heaters are slower heating than ceramic fan heaters, but are faster then oil-filled radiators..Baseboard heatersI have a Lakewood oil-filled baseboard heater I bought five years ago that has many of the advantages of a micathermic heater.  It heats faster than an oil-filled radiator but has no hot surfaces and low fire risk.  My Lakewood does an excellent job of heating my 12x15 bedroom.However I have not researched baseboard heaters and only have experience with this Lakewood, so I don't know whether others are as good as this one.  I was impressed that when I measured the actual wattages of my various space heaters, the Lakewood's actual wattages came closest to its claimed wattages of all the other heaters I tested.  Lakewood unfortunately went out of business in 2009 and had a major problem with oil leaking from its heaters a few years earlier. Despite this, it's in many ways my best heater and has the lowest cost of operation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZF33QPRD70E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003KJK86E#wasThisHelpful","R1AZF33QPRD70E","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm fairly skeptical about adaptions that transplant classic tales into the contemporary world and was prepared to dislike ""Sherlock"", but I was pleasantly surprised, especially by the first episode, ""Study in Pink"".  It's stunning.  Not just the story telling, but the photography and general production values are outstanding.I was much less enthusiastic about the second episode, ""The Blind Banker"".  The episode opens with Sherlock engaged in sword fight in his flat that never really is integrated into the rest of the story, which for me barely held my interest.  The best part is the Chinese circus scene, which has some outstanding visuals.The third episode, ""The Great Game"", is an improvement over the second episode, but doesn't reach the quality of the first.  The opening scene is particularly annoying.  It shows the sociopathic side of Holmes, as he mocks the grammar of an Englishman, imprisoned in a foreign country and facing a murder charge, who has begged Holmes to save him from execution, but is very hard to watch.Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr Watson, the Afghan war vet adjusting to civilian life, both give brilliant performances.  Dr Watson is a particularly interesting character whose inner tensions are more apparent in each episode, with more depth than Holmes.Despite my gripes about the story in the second and to a lesser extent in the third episode, the writing, acting, and general production values are outstanding in all three episodes.  I'm looking forward to seeing what future episodes will offer.  Until now, my favorite Holmes were Jeremy Brett and Basil Rathbone, but Benedict Cumberbatch seems likely to eclipse both of them.  I like Martin Freeman's Dr Watson much more than his predecessors.  He's not the bumbler that's often portrayed, but an intelligent medical doctor who is also a hardened war vet who knows he has alternatives if Holmes takes him too much for granted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108QBR91SNVT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004132HZS#wasThisHelpful","R108QBR91SNVT4","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using Haynes manuals for decades, starting with the British sports cars I owned in college through the Toyotas I own today.  The manuals are fairly thorough and provide most of the information that the average home mechanic will need for maintenance and general repairs.  It's not as complete as the factory manual, but it's only a fraction of the cost of the factory manual.Before I began driving Toyotas, I did all my own repairs and I'd routinely buy the factory manual in addition to the Haynes manual.  The Haynes manual's real strength for me was explaining in layman's terms things that the factory manual assumed a professional mechanic would know.  However now that I have two Toyotas, repairs are virtually never necessary, so mostly all I do is maintenance on my 200,000 mile Toyota truck and 100,000 mile Corolla.The newer Haynes manuals are printed on cheaper paper than in the past, which makes the photos harder to understand, but I still find it useful as an inexpensive source of information for maintenance on a car that virtually never needs repair.  In fact, the Corolla is the first vehicle I've owned for which I never bothered to buy a factory manual, and bought only a Haynes manual.If you want to perform major repairs yourself, buy both the factory manual and the Haynes.  Otherwise, for maintenance and the occasional minor repair, the Haynes manual should be satisfactory and in fact more useful for the average person than the more expensive factory manual.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1FO7DTTNCOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563928078#wasThisHelpful","R2W1FO7DTTNCOP","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mine indoors and am not using the clips, so I can't address the problems other reviewers have had with covers popping off and clips not working properly.  However I can verify that these use amazingly little power.I used my Kill-A-Watt to measure their power consumption over a 24 hour period.  During that time, they used only .07 kwh.  Even though I'm on Pacific Gas & Electric's Tier 3 rate of $0.33276/kwh, the cost was just two cents for 24 hours of usage.  For any of the lower tiers, the cost would be just one cent or less for 24 hours.Next Christmas I'll definitely replace all my Christmas lights with LED's like these, though based on other reviewers' comments, I'll research other brands.  I bought these on an impulse in a Costco warehouse and had nothing else to choose from.  They've worked well for me, but I haven't used them under conditions that have caused problems for other reviewers.The only complaint I have about them is that I don't like the plastic covers.  They are designed to resemble old fashioned Christmas tree lights of a few decades ago.  I don't care for old style Christmas tree lights, and the ""sparkling"" appearance that GE gives them just makes it worse.  However, knowing that they are consuming just a small fraction of the electricity of my other Christmas lights more than makes up for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PS26LBM8YAT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O1VU2A#wasThisHelpful","R2PS26LBM8YAT9","A2KQSLKDHGPRMK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KQSLKDHGPRMK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you majored in English or literature you probably had to read this.  If you have a MA in Gothic literature, as I do, you read this about 5-7 times.Unless you are a horror fan who also enjoys romantic elements, this is not for the average modern reader.  It follows a specific Gothic pattern that is amped up to include incest, matricide, gender-bending, and some very graphic violence - and of course an appearance of Satan, described sort of like the Satan on ""South Park"" without the sweety voice.It is an easy read.  Be prepared that good does not always win in this novel, but I still enjoyed more than Anne Radcliff's anything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PHLN2CIZ12DK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006R4SB9A#wasThisHelpful","R1PHLN2CIZ12DK","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! I can't believe that there are only three reviews of this awesome cycle as I am writing this. More shocking is that the overall rating is average at this time. Okay, okay... I get it. One reviewer has had an issue with the crank.  That is unusual for a new bike that does not get the same level of use as a bike in the gym.  I am a Spin instructor and I have this cycle at my home. Let me share a few things about this bike and the online buying process.First, a few things about the price. Expect to pay anywhere from $1,195 to $1,795 retail for this exact cycle online. Many fitness equipment sites sell this bike and will tell you that you are getting a ""deal."" Well, as of January 13, 2015 the price range is $1,200 to $1,800. You should always receive free shipping from any online vendor for this product. If not, look elsewhere.To get a price as low as $1,195 you will have to find and wait for a sale at a site that is targeted towards professionals, yet is not wholesale, which might require a business license or bulk purchase. I have found that Mad Dog Fitness, Spinning's official trademark, often offers specials on all Star Trac bikes. Try going to their web site directly.  On January 13, 2014 this bike is available for $1,395 from spinning.com with the DVDs and other extras.I was going to purchase this particular bike in 2010 for under $1,200 with a $200 special offer.  My husband did his research online and he decided to buy this for me as a birthday present from a small second party retail fitness business he found online. He paid, wait for it... $1,695 in 2010. It was new, completely assembled and tuned up. This is something that is not done if it comes from most fitness equipment retailers. The tune up works out certain ""hitches"" that frequently occur in the gear/resistance, crank, and chain with the beginning use of any new gym-quality bike. As an instructor who has taught Spin for 19 years I have seen these type of issues over and over again. Beginning with a tuned up bike from the start helps prevent problems later. This is about a $200-$400 value.Now, about the cycle. I teach Spin and indoor cycle on many different bikes. This remains my favorite. It is why I choose it for my home bike. It offers you a good number of options to adjust the seat and handle bar height. You can adjust the seat and bars fore and aft as well. All of these adjustments are critical. Getting your bike professionally fit to you by a good instructor is as important as a great tune up. The handle bars are wide enough and solid to be very comfortable. This is something that is missing in many lower price indoor cycles.This bike uses a chain, not a belt, to move the weighted fly wheel. This is one of the reasons that it feels authentic to outdoor bikes. Belts feel smoother, but less realistic. The fly wheel weighs 38 pounds. This is a good size. Cheaper home models can weigh between 25 and 31 pounds. The weight of the fly wheel is important to how hard you work, how the resistance feels (smooth vs choppy, challenging vs too easy), and how simulated hills and speed are performed. In a nut shell - how many calories you burn and how much fun and safe your ride is. A heavier fly wheel means you can increase your work when you want.The other HUGE bonus to the Star Trac line of bikes that many other bikes miss is that the fly wheel weight is on the outside of the wheel as opposed to the center. The centrifugal forces of energy at higher speeds will help you feel as though you are being pulled into your ride. It makes your speed drills and cadence rides a dream.The stock pedals allow for cycle shoes with SPD cleats. If you prefer to use your Look cleats you will have to change the pedals. You can use traditional running or work out shoes with the stock pedals. My advice is to invest in cycling shoes if you are purchasing an indoor cycle for your home. You will increase your comfort and efficiency on the bike tremendously. You can also say goodbye to numb toes once you wear cycle shoes with cleats and clip in. You are literally part of the bike and you are working when you push and when your leg comes back around.The last thing I have to say about this bike is that it is gym quality. It is the same bike used in many gyms, including several gyms and studios where I teach. If you are not sure what that means you have not been to a gym in a while. :-) It is heavy in a good way. It is sturdy and and can take years and thousands of hours of rides. Pop some great music on, you do not need to wear a bike helmut to have a fun ride on this bike!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3JJ17JVBXLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMXC8D2#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3JJ17JVBXLJ","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""Compatible With but NOT limited to: Apple iPad 3 Apple iPad 4 Apple iPad Air 1 Apple iPad Air 2 Apple iPad mini 1 Apple iPad mini 2...""  this is from the language in the product description.I have some photos and I wanted to mention a few things other reviewers have written in their reviews* The cable is thicker than Apple's and appears that it would not be so delicate.* It is, indeed, 6-feet long.  That is a lot of convenience.* A few reviewers who ordered pink, as I did, wrote that they believed the color was closer to red.  See my images.  I feel it is a true pink and true to the image in the product images.* The connectors were not too snug and fit into any USB port that I tried.  Trust me, I tried many.* Those reviewers who have written that they will only stick with Apple products now might be interested to know that while I have never had a charging/syncing issue - every Apple cable I have purchased began to come apart towards the lightning connector within 2-6 months.  I expect that these type of cables have a short ""shelf"" life.  But I do expect them to work.When I connected it to my iPad it gave the initial charging sound and occasionally there was a flash of green on the battery, but within a second it would read ""Not Charging.""I am disappointed.

"I wish I had used these candles this year.  I will use them tonight for the last night of Chanukah.I agree with most reviews and want to acknowledge the reviewer who points out that these are indeed made in China.  If that bothers you, do not purchase these candles.They are hand-rolled and wrapped individually in the box.  Not one fit into my Menorah.  They were slightly too big.  Such an easy fix to roll the bottom of candle a bit to make it narrower.  The honeycomb wax adjusted easily under my fingers.They burned between 45-60 minutes.  That is what I am used to unless you have an oversized Menorah.  The best part is that there were absolutely NO drips!! The previous 7 days I was using beautiful candles that I bought because they were drip less, but they dripped everywhere and I had to place foil under my Menorah and clean it each day.I will buy these every year.  I think they are awesome.

"These are beautiful candles and very colorful. For the aesthetic it gets 5 stars.  But the practicality and promise of drip less leaves me disappointed.I posted many images to help demonstrate the challenges that I faced.  I sent these to my daughter and she reported having the same issues.I believe these may be hand crafted.  It lends to the beauty.  That also causes minor and major variations in the bottom width and wick length.  Some candle bottoms were so wide I had difficulty getting them into my Menorah.  I had to pick away at the wax to get it to fit.  Others were so narrow that they would fall out or lean precariously.  I had to melt the bottoms to make them stick.  All of them left so much wax debris and even large wicks that I had to clean out each candle space every day.They are NOT drip less.  You can see from my pictures.  My Menorah would be covered with wax after each burning, requiring a scrub in scalding water.  Wax would even drip onto the surface where the Menorah stood.  I usually kept aluminum foil under it.As gorgeous as these are I will not purchase again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EGCAWZBZV71Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O84J7MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1EGCAWZBZV71Y","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Cole Haan and I love these shoes.  I have two pairs.They add a bit of sophistication to any outfit, including jeans.  I also like the slightly retro, masculine smoking slipper look.I always buy a 1/2 size up because I have wide feet.  With the slightly pointed toe that makes these a bit long, but super comfortable.  Just a week ago I did over 4 hours of heavy duty patio cleaning and yard work in my dark colored shoes.  That really is how comfortable and durable they are.When I'm working I may be standing and lecturing for several hours and walking back and forth across an enormous college campus.  No problems.  These shoes do click-clack when you walk.  Sorry, you can't sneak up on anybody.I usually wait for Cole Haan online clearance sales when they also have an additional 40-50% off.  I purchased these a year apart at such sales and spent around $40 on each pair.  I am a shoe nut, and these gets many compliments with a cute pair of pixie pants.

"I am a huge Cole Haan fan.  I have these in pink suede.They run narrow, which accounts for many people writing about having to but a 1/2 - 1 size up, as I usually do.  Because they are narrow in the toe box, this is why many wearers report the bowing effect.  Cole Haan does offer this shoe in wider widths, but they sell out quickly.I wanted to address the top reviewers concern that some of the shoes from this seller may be counterfeit.  I purchased mine from Cole Haan.  She is correct that these shoes are made in India and that should be marked in dark brown under the tongue of the.  The size and serial number will be stamped in brown on the outside inner edge, which should be leather.Please see my photos.  The silver button at the back has a distinctive look.  Any other design is not a real Cole Haan shoe.  A few of the colors here do not have this design.  The same goes for the unique tread pattern that bears the Cole Haan signature and travels up the back of the shoe.  These are driving shoes; hence the tread and metal button on the back.I have one wide foot (forefoot/toes) and one normal foot since a bad surgery in 2013.  I find these shoes to be comfortable for my wide foot, and my post-op bad foot.  I can wear them for hours of teaching and walking across my college's campus.  I like the kapow fun color.  It livens up a black pant suit or jeans and a t-shirt.  I get tons of compliments.Disclosure: I bought these on clearance through the Cole Haan website during special with an extra 50% off.  I do that a lot.  They cost me about $47.00.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJKCUAE42PJPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FXE4R8#wasThisHelpful","RJKCUAE42PJPV","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love 'em!I read all of the other reviews.  When you buy shoes online it is such a gamble.  I have odd feet.  They tend to be wide, but I had bunion surgery on my right foot in 2013, which was botched severely, and I ended up losing my right little toe.  I usually buy size 8.5 to get the extra width, even though the length of my foot is 7.5-8.  As many reviewers have written about the width winging out, even with my wide left foot, the 8.5 B is wide.  See pictures.  To me that is better than even the tiniest bit fitted, because that might get too tight throughout the day.Anyway, no pity party.  I deal with it.  I do look for shoes that are comfortable and hide my scars.These shoes are adorable stand-out slip ons with an athletic vibe.  I have them in patent leather, so I would feel comforfortable wearing on a rainy day.  I also have them in a color not available here: bright pink.  I bought mine through Cole Haan on clearance with 40% off and paid less than $45.  Although they were final sale.The non-slip white contrast sole is cushy and fashion-forward.  These look good with jeans, shorts, and even a suit.  Compliments galore!  I'm glad I went with such a kapow color.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZEQNH2QHGQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV2DLX6#wasThisHelpful","R1TZEQNH2QHGQ3","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not only do these not have much of a cherry flavor, they are quite waxy in texture and not as red as I would prefer.The price is way too high for an artificial product that does not deliver on strong flavor, almost no cherry flavor, lackluster color, only a 10 ounce package, and rarely can find a seller that does not charge for shipping.If you really need Cherry-Flavored chips and not dried cherry pieces, try melting high-quality white chocolate and adding real cherry extract and blending with a few dark sweet cherries in a powerful blender until completely smooth.  Pour out onto waxed paper to cool and chop into chips.  It is a lot more work, but worth it for the final product... only if you really need it.Avoid this these chips.  They are a waste of money, calories, and full of artificial ingredients.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGHRL39TGO5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IXHENE#wasThisHelpful","R1BGHRL39TGO5N","A15HI1HDAU7SPR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15HI1HDAU7SPR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has an odd fit.The 12 pounds is a perfect weight for someone accustomed to using any weight vest or weight belt for power walking or additional resistance during weight training.However, the fit is both loose and snug in all of the wrong places. It connects at the top of your chest.  This means that men will have a hard time wearing this unless they have a small frame.  For women, it has to click above your breasts, which be uncomfortable depending upon your size.  The closure is fairly high, and because the weight of vest is primarily in the back and hanging beneath the closure, it keeps riding up and feels like it is going to choke you.The remaining weighted part of vest has no way of being kept snug to your body, so it tends to flop and move around a great deal.  I have used it for power walking.  I cannot imagine using it for running (which I cannot do because of arthritis) or any higher impact activity.  If you are bigger through your back it may fit slightly closer.The teeny, tiny pocket will only hold something as small as an iPod Nano.  That does not work for me because I walk with my phone and use it for my music.Sadly, I have not even been able to get use out of this for clients in my outdoor H-I-I-T class.

"First off  these pumps are beautiful!  I bought them in nude in February 2014.The nude color lengthens your leg visibly and provides a clean line.I love Via Spiga shoes.  I have always found them to be made well, comfortable, supportive, and stylish.  These shoes are no exception.I purchased my pair at a large department store in a size 8B.  Even with my wide feet and an awkward right foot after several surgeries, these shoes are comfortable.  I cannot wear high heels any longer unless they are a wedge since my foot surgeries.  I have worn these shoes for 14-hour days when I have been on my feet and walking for long periods of time.  They did well!These are great for more work and professional attire,  they work the best with dresses, so you can take advantage of the color lengthening effect.

"A few years ago I swore to myself that I would never spend this much money on a blender.  Well... it is worth it.I have not explored all of the options with this amazing and SUPER powerful blender yet.  So far I am making daily protein smoothies from homemade recipes.  My husband is very happy about that.My next attempt is to make ""hot"" soup with the Vitamix using ingredients that are not hot.  My daughter is excited for us to do this soon.I love the various settings and the heft of the base.  The pitcher lifts off and is placed on easily without needing to be locked in place.  There is an extra safety feature that requires you to turn the blender on using a toggle switch on the rear right-hand side.  My granddaughters like to see the lights turn on when it is switched ""on.""It is very loud when it is crushing large ice cubes.  However, it will crush them quickly and then it is smooth and quiet.  Actually, it is remarkably quiet for its power.I had hoped that it would be powerful enough to really pulverize flax meal that I would add, but it is not.  If I do not want larger chunks of flax meal in a smoothie, I need to zap that in a coffee grinder first until it is a fine powder.Here is one of my recipes for a super-charged, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, protein boost, cherry/berry smoothie.Alter the amounts to taste and according to the number of servings.Fill pitcher 1/3 with iceAdd 3/4 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurtAdd 1 bananaAdd 2 scoops of ""Body Fortress"" ""Advanced Whey Protein"" vanilla flavor*Add 2 scoops of ""Amazing Grass"" ""Green Superfood""Add 3/4 cup fresh or frozen/defrosted cherriesAdd 1/2 cup of fresh or frozen/defrosted strawberriesAdd 1/2 cup of fresh or frozen/defrosted blueberriesAdd 1-2 fresh kale leaves washed and ripped into small piecesAdd 2-3 tablespoons of honey (to taste to cut tartness of berries)Add 2 teaspoons of Neilsen-Massey Pure Vanilla PasteAdd 1 teaspoon of Almond extractSqueeze the contents from 1-3 ""Now"" Omega 3-6-9 1000 mg Essential Fatty Acid Soft GelsPour 1 cup unsweetened plain or vanilla flavor almond milk over contentsPour 1 cup pure cherry juice (you can get it at places like Trader Joes) over contentsPlace lid on - turn on - set to snowflakePULSEIt will be really loud for a few second until the ice is broken up.  Let it continue blending until you see all ingredients mixed thoroughly- then give it another zap or two, just to be sure.  Taste, pour, and enjoy.This make 4 large servings in a full pitcher and has a good amount of protein, and almost a daily dose of fruits and vegetables.My granddaughters do not know that they are drinking their greens, kale, flax seed, or essential fatty acids (high Omega).  They only know it tastes wonderful.  The cherry versus strawberry lends to the sweeter taste and is higher in anti-inflammatory properties.*I like this protein power because it mixes well, tastes good without any chemical tastes, and has some of the highest protein to calorie and fat ratio I can find, particularly for the money.  Vanilla is always a good best because it can even go with chocolate.Try my smoothie out and let me know if it worked for you.  :)Update June 8, 2015: I have now made hot soup from room temperature ingredients.  Easy!  Last night I took frozen strawberries rinsed then off and made stawberry Bellinies with a tad of simple syrup (previously made with Stevia), a bit of Chambord and a sparkling brut.

"I purchased this after reading so many excellent reviews.  I have long known of ginger's abilities to decrease nausea and aid digestion, so I thought I would give this a try.I took one capsule the day after receiving this when I had a bit of nausea.  I ended up with horrible burning reflux throughout my esophagus and to the back of my throat.  The best way to describe it is similar to the burning of a severe mint without the mint flavor, but all of the heat and pain.  Needless to say, I was in extreme discomfort.So, this was a big disappointment for me.  At least the price is super reasonable.  I feel it was worth trying as everyone may have a different experience.  I do have lupus, and GERD, and other chronic ailments.  I was hopeful that this could be used as a natural replacement for a prescription medication for nausea and general digestive health.Others may have a better outcome.  Certainly, many have written about them.  I wanted to share one experience that was not great, but may be isolated.Since first writing this review I learned that I may have had a bad interaction with one of my medications.  I also learned that people who take ""blood thinners"" (warfarin, lovenox, plavix, any NSAID, such as ibuprofen, aleve, or prescription NSAID), also those with diabetes, and those taking high blood pressure medication.According to my research, this works best as a preventative, particularly for pregnant women with nausea, and may also help individuals with chronic joint pain.
