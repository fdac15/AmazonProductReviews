" 1:34 Mins If you are looking for the best possible audio cable, look no further. I was sent a sample of this cable and I was very impressed by just how well made it is, which isn't easy for something as simple as an audio cable.First of all, I like the cable itself. Anker claims the cables can withstand over 10,000 bends.  While I can't do that kind of testing, I can say I was impressed by how well they handle bends.  It's clearly thicker than most, and almost magically withstands bends, and springs back into shape without any trace of a kink.Second, there are rubber grommets to provide added protection from bends at the ends, and the connectors are enclosed in metal, not plastic.The connections are gold plated, giving you the best possible connection.  The bottom line, this is a premium cable for people who want the best possible connection to their audio devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10SE1FTAAWY0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R124LAK#wasThisHelpful","R10SE1FTAAWY0G","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:55 Mins This is a case for people who hate bulky cases.  While it doesn't provide protection from major drops, it does give you scratch protection on the back and side, which is great for people who carry their phones in their pocket or handbag.  I've never used protection on the front of my phones, but if you are concerned about something scratching the front glass, you should pick up some front protection sheets.I like the fact that the back is clear, because a lot of people go out of their way to pick a color for their iPhone, only to hide it under a case.I was sent a sample to review and I gave it 5 stars specifically because I think this is a great value.  You get 2 cases for a great price.  While I know there are other cases that offer more protection, I rated it based upon comparisons to other products in this price range.  I hope you found it helpful and I welcome your questions or comments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCF6ST2AXX8Y0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0FCFSA#wasThisHelpful","RCF6ST2AXX8Y0","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the minute I opened the package, I was impressed by this mouse.This mouse does an amazing job of going exactly where I want it to go, without any lag.  Since I use a massive 5K display, this is important to me.  Besides the great performance, I love the quality of the components and how it feels in my hand.  The cable is soft, strong and lightweight, with a rubbery silicone feel, it's not round, and not quite flat; it's sort of like linguine.  Even the USB connector is high end.  Their attention to detail is quite impressive.  Even the packaging impressed me.I'm often asked to evaluate technical products, so it's hard for me to be impressed by a mouse.  This one definitely impressed me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D64BHX7U20G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDH7EZU#wasThisHelpful","R2D64BHX7U20G","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never considered the idea of eating seaweed as a snack, but when they sent me a sample to review, I didn't even know what to do with it, so I asked some friends what they knew about it and they told me they use Nori for sushi, but it's also a healthful snack.  Since I'm not a sushi eater, I focused on it's snacking potential and it turns out it's a great snack.For those who have never tried Nori, you're going to love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVOIN2DBISMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I01ZXYE#wasThisHelpful","R1FVOIN2DBISMT","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first brewed a sample of Dechunxian DongTing Green Spiral Spring Tea, I originally thought I didn't use enough, because it the water seemed pretty clear.  I used a simple tea ball to brew it and I basically filled one side.  After brewing, the tea leaves expanded an filled the entire ball.In spite of the light color, the tea itself was perfectly brewed, and as a green tea lover, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was just right, smooth, not too strong, and it left no aftertaste.After enjoying my first cup, I added more water and re-used the same leaves and the taste was absolutely wonderful.  Naturally it was lighter, but for some people, the second brew is the preferred way to enjoy it.  If you've never tried brewing green tea like that, you should give it a try.  In fact, some green tea companies make it a point to recommend people fill their cup and let it sit for about 20-30 seconds, then discard the water and re-fill it.  When you brew tea like this, that short batch of water takes away the edge and leaves behind the plenty of flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MC16J55TAWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI3VL3E#wasThisHelpful","R26MC16J55TAWR","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:16 Mins When I was asked to review this speaker, I immediately tried listening to it the way I would use it if I was on the beach, which means I needed to hear how good it sounded even if it wasn't pointing directly at me.  What I found was that the sound quality was so good, it sounded almost identical regardless of what direction it was pointed.This means that if you take it with you to the beach, you can hang it on your bag or your chair and let it swing around and the sound will be just as good no matter where you are sitting.I've tested a few other waterproof speakers in the past, but I have to say this one had sound that was far better than any I've heard before. In spite of it's size, there is a lot of depth and bass.It's easy to use, and doesn't require any special codes to pair it with your phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQTY74EVPK19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYQDI34#wasThisHelpful","R2PQTY74EVPK19","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:00 Mins If you love the great outdoors, you NEED one of these to protect your stuff.  I've been kayaking for years and I wouldn't even think of getting on the water without one.  In fact, I wouldn't even go near the beach without one because it not only protects your stuff from water, but from dirt and sand.If you're not familiar with dry bags, they are rubber coated bags that you seal by rolling down the top and clipping the sides together.  Once you clip in the sides, the bags are completely waterproof and submersible.I was sent a sample to review and I found this dry bag is super strong, and has plenty of space for cameras and other items you want to keep dry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29W4LNMSKYPWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R72NQM8#wasThisHelpful","R29W4LNMSKYPWY","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:27 Mins Whenever I'm asked to review a product designed to plug into the lightning port on the bottom of an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad, the first thing I do is look for Apple certification.  I simply won't endorse or use any device without that certification.The reason I say this is because I've bought a few non-certified cables in the past and they cause my devices to throw a message on the screen that says I'm using an unauthorized device.  According to Apple, any uncertified cable can potentially harm your device or void any chance for warranty support.  Apple includes a unique serial number on a chip inside every cable and your device will know if it's certified.So, after I checked for the certification, the next thing I did was plug it in... and make sure the cable was recognized.  It worked perfectly!In addition to checking that the cable was certified and recognized, the final thing I did was bend and twist it around.  I like the feel.  It has a nice rubbery texture and extra reinforcements on both ends.  When compared to the original, these cables seem a bit thicker and the connector is much bigger and presumably, stronger.I can easily recommend this cable to anyone who is looking for a high quality, reinforced cable for their iOS devices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V0N0QDYL66VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0H09LS#wasThisHelpful","R3V0N0QDYL66VY","A5QDZEOIMQ4LW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5QDZEOIMQ4LW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll be honest right now and admit that I've been using Photoshop for years.  When I first started, I found it very hard to figure out how to accomplish tasks--the way it worked seemed illogical.  Now that I'm happy with the Photoshop interface I've switched to PaintShop Pro, and I find it frustrating.  There's a good chance that it's because I'm so used to Photoshop.  It may be that once I get better at using PaintShop, I'll find it to be as powerful and useful as Photoshop.  For now, somehow, everything I edit looks like a small child attacked it with crayons.PaintShop is often slow and cranky, and sometimes mouse pointer movement is not smooth across the screen.  On the whole, though, it seems to be slightly more nimble than Photoshop.Magic Move is pretty clever, and I wish I had a greater need for it.  PaintShop also seems to handle text a lot better than Photoshop.  Batch processing and scripts are available, and for me they're essential.  I'll need to dig into them a bit more deeply and write some more complicated scripts to see how well this feature works.Since I'm working with lenses that have some pretty standard flaws, I've found Lens Correction to be a help.  I don't have it tuned perfectly yet, but I'm hopeful that I'll get there eventually.As I learn and adjust, I may be able to use this the way I need to.  For the moment, though, every time I open PaintShop I find myself wishing for Photoshop.  The price makes PaintShop much more accessible, and there's no subscription, so this will be my choice whether it turns out to be as powerful as I need it to be or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GBP5DZM7IIU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R3GBP5DZM7IIU4","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I think of seaweed snacks I think of seaweed, not a tapioca starch, canola oil, and brown rice chip with a thin coating of seaweed on one side.  So this seems like a bit of a compromise to me.  These hold up better to humidity than plain seaweed snacks, at least.To me the flavor is sweet and a little spicy, but I like spicy foods.  To someone who is sensitive to spicy heat, this might be more powerful than I think.The texture is fun, very crispy and easy to eat.  It seems like when I first opened the package, I ate about 3/4 of it without even being aware of how much I had eaten.  (There are two servings per package.)  Even with the rice chips, these are not very filling.So they're crunchy, sweet, and a little spicy.  They're really more rice and tapioca starch than seaweed.  I like them and I wouldn't turn them down, but I probably won't go out of my way to find them again.  My first choice would be real seaweed snacks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HL689YQFO9MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLEQUES#wasThisHelpful","R1HL689YQFO9MN","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this arrived over the summer, my first thought was ""*gasp* WARM"".  I'm pretty sure it'll be a good jacket for all but the coldest of days.The sherpa lining is only on the front and back of the shirt.  The sleeves have a black nylon lightly filled lining.  This makes it much easier to put the shirt on or take it off without getting hung up on the fuzzy lining.I've washed it on cold and lightly dried it on the lowest setting, pulling it out to hang while still damp.  It shrunk a little, but it wasn't bad.  If anything, it's more comfortable.  Judging from the other reviews it might shrink more if I let it dry completely, but this size is exactly right so I'm going to keep hanging it to dry.A long time ago I had a denim jacket that was broken in perfectly.  (Curse you, battery acid!)  I've never had anything nearly that comfortable since then, but this comes close.  I'll update my review if this disappoints over time, but right now I'm really looking forward to wearing this regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5XEPXAB1WFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7HNZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1R5XEPXAB1WFW","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't seen some of these flavors locally (and a couple I've seen but haven't tried.)  These are full-size candies, slightly more than two ounces per package.  At the current price they're far cheaper than anything I can get locally.Looking at the reviews, it looks like the flavor mix wasn't right a couple of years ago, but for the moment it matches the product description: 8 packs of Original Skittles, 4 packs of Wild Berry Skittles, 3 packs of Tropical Skittles, 3 packs of Sour Skittles, 6 packs of Original Starburst, 3 packs of Tropical Starburst and 3 packs of Starburst FaveReds.The tropical flavors were a surprise for me, and sometimes the colors don't match expectations.  I'm getting used to the idea of checking the label to see if the green is lime or apple, or something else that's unexpected.  The Wild Berry Skittles are probably my favorites overall.  Sour Skittles are unpleasantly like a punch in the jaw, and worst of all, there are only three packages.I'm not keeping this amount of candy in my house again, but if I needed it for a special event or fundraising, this might be the way to go if the price holds.  It's a good mix that might have something for everyone if they like strong fruity candy, and it's a way to get flavors that might be hard to find locally.  Just be sure your will power is better than ours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20LQJ4B5CYBGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B45FZS#wasThisHelpful","R20LQJ4B5CYBGO","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These buttons are the best mistake that's happened to me in a long time.  Some time ago I spotted these 10mm buttons being sold by Amazon as an open box returned item.  I grabbed them.I'm guessing they were returned because they were too big for the buyer.  I didn't get 10mm buttons, I got these 13mm Elan Beads buttons.  And I love them.  Here's what I said about them at the time:""The first impression that I got from these buttons was sometimes blue, sometimes green, and always a fair amount of sparkle from every angle. I bought these to use as focal closures on jewelry pieces and it was a good choice. They are definitely interesting enough to hold their own in a piece of jewelry.""The silver colored back is securely attached, and the buttons seem well made.""Best of all, the seller found my positive review and offered to fix the mistake.So: lovely, bright buttons.  Very well made.  And a very responsive seller.

"I live in a place where the temperature fluctuates between hot and hotter, so I always have a bottle of water with me.  I've tried just about every kind of water bottle there is in the hope of keeping the water cold.  Insulated containers don't stand up to the heat, so lately I've been moving toward single-walled containers that can be frozen.  This bottle seemed perfect.It's better than that.  I fill it about halfway and put it in the freezer, tilted so it's diagonal.  When it's frozen I top it off with cold water and transport it in a small lunch-sized cooler with ice packs.  This keeps the water much colder than any other container I've used.  When it's empty I can roll it up and stuff it into my bag.  That's more convenient than walking around with a bulky empty container.Best of all, today I brought it to our weekly card game.  No one had ever seen something like this wobbly, floppy, droopy water bottle.  When I poked the top half and it flopped over there was total silence at the table.  Then someone said ""Your water bottle needs a little blue pill.""  The jokes continued for the rest of the night.  +1 star just for keeping us laughing all night.The one warning I will give is that if you're not careful, it's easy to gulp some air with your water until you get used to drinking from this bottle.  And because it really requires two hands to support the whole thing, I use a different bottle in the car while I'm driving.The instructions tell you to fill it with boiling water before use, and that worked with no problems.  I was wondering if it would damage the plastic lid, but it was fine.  It's an easy way of cleaning something that probably won't do well in the dishwasher.The instructions also warn ""Do not put high concentrations of acid and alkali and other strong corrosive substances in the bottle"".  Orange juice is probably not a good idea.So, two hands required, and no acidic juices or other drinks.  For me it's different than anything else I've used and I gulped some air until I got used to it.  But I can clean it with boiling water and I can freeze it to take ice cold water with me, and that's what I really needed.  It doesn't take much space to store it, and the humor value is unlimited.  Love it.Sample received.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IJD4QXNTPG43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CPDP96#wasThisHelpful","R1IJD4QXNTPG43","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this for things that are only needed once or twice a week, not daily.  Most of the time it sits on the shelf, and when I need to grab it I have no trouble finding it among all the blue and black binders.  For high visibility, this is it.But I'm not impressed with the durability, which surprises me in a Five Star item.  The cover is not bad--one very flexible plastic layer.  I bend it back so I can fold it over and write on the desk instead of the divider, and so far the cover hasn't been damaged by this.  But the rings (which are round, not D-rings,) are not great quality.  I've already bent one so that it doesn't close properly.  Clearly I have arms of steel.I'm not sure if this would last for a whole school year, but if there are hallway games of binder football I'd doubt it.

"I've got pretty much the same stress as everyone else, and I'm really not moody... more like one mood, all the time.  I've been taking rhodiola root for a couple of weeks and so far I haven't noticed any change.According to Sloan Kettering, rhodiola ""improve(s) physical and mental performance by reducing fatigue caused by stress"".  For me there have been no improvements, but no side effects, either.  Since I use Natures Bounty for other things and have never had a problem with them, I'm going to guess that the problem isn't these capsules, the problem is probably me.Now that I'm digging a bit deeper, I see that rhodiola may cause problems with other medications, and I probably should have talked to my doctor before starting it.  That would be my advice to anyone else as well.  (No, not MY doctor, he's already too busy.)But it may help with stress and fatigue, and who doesn't have those?

"I've got a couple of lights on timers.  At first it was so that my home looked lived-in while I traveled, but I left it that way because because having lights turned off is a good way to remind me to stop what I'm working on and go to bed.  This timer is another reminder for me, and it controls a light that's visible from the street.It was fairly easy to install, though it is kind of large and is a little difficult to stuff into the light switch box.  Basic tools are needed, like a flat screwdriver and a selection of cuss words.  Four wire nuts are included.  The decorator-style faceplate is not included.Once it was installed I used the manual switch for a few days until I got around to programming it the way I wanted it.  It was a little hard to see, which made programming it a bit frustrating, but with the battery backup I hope I won't have to think about it again.I like the random feature, which hopefully would be a little more convincing if someone is watching the house to see if it's empty.It was fairly easy to install, somewhat annoying to program, and is working the way I want.

"I ordered two of these, and I'll admit they're better than I expected, though I wasn't expecting much.  Each individual order contained a random mix of sizes and colors and there wasn't much that worked well together, but buying two gave me a lot more options.  Each order will vary, but to give an idea this is what was in my two orders (colors are my best guess):1 10mm strand of basic pearl color (very heavy weight)8mm:1 white1 pearl1 champagne1 funky goldish-tan1 light pink1 peach1 rose1 sage green1 dark blue-green6mm:1 light brown1 red1 grey1 black1 Wedgwood-ish blue1 purple4mm:1 pearl1 (kind of) tan1 light green1 purpleThe 6mm blue are a really lovely color, and I wish I could get more of just those.  Oddly, I've got a lot of colors here that seem close (several flavors of very light brown/champagne, for example) but they've got green or red or other undertones that make them seem to clash with each other.  The greens also don't work with each other, but work with the various tan beads.  I'll have to leave them mixed together and see what jumps out at me over time.The thing that surprises me is that these were obviously dipped or sprayed in color while on the strand.  Some strands are fairly tight and didn't leave the beads much room to move, and those beads are stuck together.  Moving them around breaks them up (and covers the table with iridescent colored dust.) Yet color coverage is excellent, all the way around the bead, even where they've stuck to each other and the strand.So lots of different colors and sizes, not chosen for any particular color harmony.

"I want very much to like this necklace, and there are some things to like about it.  But I have some problems with it.In the box, or if I hold it up to the light, or if it happens to be positioned properly when I wear it, the pendant catches the light very well.  It sparkles in even the darkest room.  On someone who is very slim, this would probably look well all the time.On me, though, the pendant likes to turn.  It never twists to the back, which is nice, but it does often rotate so that the face of the pendant is pointing down and someone standing in front of me has a view of the top of the pendant.  It's not that the chain is too short--if I pull the chain to tighten it the face of the pendant rotates up.  I don't know why it does this and I haven't found a fix for it yet.The chain seems very flimsy and arrived pre-tangled in the box.  It took a long time and serious magnification to get the knot out so I could put the necklace on.  If this will be a gift, it might be a good idea to check the chain before wrapping the box.The lobster clasp is small and difficult to work with, and catches my hair.  The loop actually looks like a stamped piece, and between the thickness of the piece and the small size of the hole it is very difficult to get it on to the clasp.The necklace comes in a very nice gift box: Amazon's standard black box with blue lining.  I'm not sure I'd give this necklace as a gift, but I know I wouldn't hesitate to give a gift in this gift box.I've got very mixed feelings about this necklace.  When it rests properly it looks wonderful, but getting it on is difficult and looking in the mirror to see that it is facing downwards is frustrating.  It's not large, but it catches the light well.  It's a subtle and lovely detail for someone with very nimble fingers or a helping hand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S1AM7LTR8N3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJFL8E2#wasThisHelpful","R2S1AM7LTR8N3Q","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure what Smart Target Benzoyl Peroxide Delivery Technology is, but to judge by the painful red lump on my cheek, apparently my skin can defeat it.Actually, for me, this kind of breakout is new.  My skin is usually in the ""annoying and eye-catching"" range, but I never have painful breakouts.  Until I started using this--now I have several.I can't explain why.  The active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, and this is something I've used on and off for years.  It can't be a reaction to that.  In any case, I'll be going back to another product with benzoyl peroxide, so I'll know more in a couple of weeks or so.If this worked for me I'd have nothing else to complain about.  The lotion feels soft and smooth, it applies evenly without feeling unpleasant or greasy, and it leaves a matte finish that doesn't affect my makeup.  There is a slight odor, but it is not strong enough to bother me and it fades quickly.While I'm testing a sample, this product is expensive enough that I'd have tried to return it if I had bought this and gotten these results.  I know it works for some people and in that case it may be worth the investment.  But now that I've tried it, I wish I had stayed with my regular benzoyl peroxide product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303XBU2XNUY6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7P7FO2#wasThisHelpful","R303XBU2XNUY6I","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't get me wrong, I love and miss my grandmother very much.  But while I'd give anything for another afternoon with her in the kitchen, I don't want her blue hair, and I don't want to smell like all the moisturizers she used to apply.  And this fragrance remains for a long time.The lotion itself is wonderful, but I'm not sure if there's any benefit once I try to wash the fragrance off.  It absorbs very quickly and doesn't feel greasy, so maybe there is some benefit.  I finally gave up and applied it to my legs so that I could leave it on and see if there's any visible change.  My legs are very dry, and after a couple of weeks of this moisturizer they seem just as dry and flaky.  My skin looks and feels good for a while after applying this, but within a couple of hours the dryness is back.  (But the odor lingers on...)This might be good for someone who doesn't mind fragrances, but the minimal short-term improvement is not worth the smell to me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QE0K6CC7NDKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FKGDHU#wasThisHelpful","R1QE0K6CC7NDKO","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Original review 06/19/2015: The first impression that I got from these buttons was sometimes blue, sometimes green, and always a fair amount of sparkle from every angle.  I bought these to use as focal closures on jewelry pieces and it was a good choice.  They are definitely interesting enough to hold their own in a piece of jewelry.The color in the photo is a good match, but the shape of the buttons is different.  I received 15mm buttons, not 10mm as described.  Since I'm building around them this isn't a problem for me, but it might be tough for someone who needs to fit these in a buttonhole.(Edit: description removed.  Looks like I received these buttons.  And it looks like I should calibrate my caliper--they're 13mm.)The silver colored back is securely attached, and the buttons seem well made.I like them, but I was really interested in the color.  If you need 10mm buttons and you order these, you might want to check them when they arrive to be sure they fit.UPDATE 09/18/2015: The seller has responded.  (Wow!)  Human error, she shipped the wrong buttons.  I can see how it happened.  It took me a long time to figure out I had the wrong buttons--they're very similar.  But I'm updating my review because these things don't happen often, and now I know that Liz is happy to fix it if needed.Best of all I now have the seller's storefront, so I'll be able to get more of the wrong buttons when I need them, along with some amazing beads.

"Every now and then I like to find new ways to review old material I already know.  (Ok, I *have* to, or I'll start forgetting details.)This would be a great companion to a basic anatomy textbook, probably at the high school level.  It would also be good for younger kids who are ready to start studying anatomy on their own or with help.  The drawings are pretty clear and the text is easy to understand.  Because the human body is not flat, several structures that might be difficult to understand with only one view are visible from several angles, sometimes including cross sections or range of motion.For me, I find that putting colored pencil to paper and filling in the drawings makes details clearer and easier to remember.  Glancing at an image in a textbook is one thing, but actually filling in a drawing forces me to consider the shape I'm working with, to pay attention to where one bone ends and another begins, and to think about how things like joints actually work.I think that if I had worked with books like this the first time I took classes on this subject, I might have understood the mechanics of how the body works a little better before getting into the field and seeing damaged bodies, not working.This isn't a primary anatomy textbook.  But it is a great basic workbook, and for me the act of coloring forces me to slow down and learn well.  And it's an enjoyable refresher if you haven't picked up a textbook in a few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWKTDQY2CNK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486241386#wasThisHelpful","R1TWKTDQY2CNK1","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got 40 out of 50 boxes.  The order is short by 10 boxes.  All things considered, this is actually a good thing.At a glance they look shiny and promising.  Some of them are so badly made that the base and lid don't fit well together, and once opened it's a pain to force them closed.  But that's not the biggest problem.Each box had a large sticker with bar code, ASIN, and item title.  Some stickers were on the bottom of the box, some were on the top.  Some of the stickers come off without damaging the silver foil, some rip it right off.  Sticky residue is left where the stickers were.It's a waste of time to remove these stickers and too many boxes have been damaged already.

"Back when I was a teenager, I had a friend who burned incense in her room constantly.  I'm sure it was just because she liked the smell.  I had completely forgotten about that... until I opened this bag of beads.These beads smelled powerfully of sandalwood, I think, strong enough to make someone else in this house cough.  While my friend liked the scent, I don't want to try to sell jewelry that smells like it.  But they're beads, I'll just wash them.That didn't get rid of the smell.  So I soaked them in mild soapy water overnight.  That didn't work either.They've been airing out now for about a week, and the scent has faded a bit.  It will probably take at least another week to get rid of it completely.These are very interesting beads, with eye catching colors and seemingly random lines.  Slightly less than half are drilled badly, at an odd angle.  The rest are fine.  But I'd rather not buy beads and then have to air them out for a couple of weeks to get rid of an odor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIY5MRPAEQ5TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EE4BB8I#wasThisHelpful","RIY5MRPAEQ5TX","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rodents aren't usually a problem in my garage in June.  I'll see more activity when it gets colder.  Right now I can't really say if these packs will repel critters that are having way more fun outside at the moment.But I can still give them a try and see how they smell, and so that's what I'm doing.  I've had one on the garage floor for a week, and even though the garage is fairly large, one pack is enough to make the whole area smell strongly of peppermint.  The pouches are filled with corn cob bits soaked with peppermint oil, and yet the oil hasn't stained the unfinished floor.Usually when the garage door is open a frog or an anole or some other small thing will wander in, but I haven't seen that happen this week.  Could be coincidence; I'll have a better idea over time.I wrote the date on the pouch so I'll have a good idea of how long it will last.  So far even the south Florida heat and humidity don't seem to be knocking the scent down very much.I'll get a better idea of how well these repel rodents when the weather starts to turn a little cooler.  For now, the garage smells of mint, the frogs seem to be staying outside, and the floor is not stained from the peppermint oil.  If these packs disappoint I'll update this review, but so far, so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJZY4GHY4NIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVHTDZM#wasThisHelpful","RIJZY4GHY4NIQ","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm giving a five star rating with some hesitation, because the zippers on these containers seems a little flimsy.  But so far I haven't been able to break them by beating up on them a bit, so until they fail I'm going to assume they're good.  If I do have problems with these I'll update my review.Actually, the whole thing seems flimsy, but that's not a bad thing.  They're flexible enough to give a little on the overstuffed side, and to collapse on the thinner end.  I haven't been able to tear the paper, and the plastic top is sturdy enough.  I've got thin blankets and a couple of pillows in these along with a few sprigs of peppermint, and they stored easily under the bed for the summer.  Since they won't be used daily the zippers probably won't be a problem.  There's no real way for dust to get in.  And the plastic top makes it easy to see which of the two containers I need.I thought about turning them upside down to make it easier to slide these under the bed, but it wasn't necessary.  The paper bottom slid across the carpet easily.When the weather gets colder I might take out the blankets and put summer clothes in these, or I might fold them up and store them.  They fold down to a small, thin square.I look back on the dust covers and storage containers that used to be in my grandmother's attic, holding old clothes and uniforms and moth balls.  They were thick and heavy duty, and they took no abuse at all.  They might get opened twice a year for the winter coats, but beyond that all that heavy duty plastic was unnecessary.  I think that these will keep dust out without taking up much space, which is exactly what I needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMIF1PGLV9QWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOF6GY#wasThisHelpful","RMIF1PGLV9QWJ","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In my house, dressing usually comes in two flavors: take it or leave it.  I dress the salad in the kitchen with whatever works with the meal, and if you don't like it you can see if there's something in the fridge you want.  So having special servers and a caddy to carry them suggests way more effort than I usually put into a salad.But hey, maybe variety is wanted.  Maybe yesterday's dressing was so good that I should have made extra.  Maybe today's is so bad that yesterday's seems wonderful by comparison.  Now I've got bottles to store those dressings in.I look at this set and I see the cute side and the practical side.  I'm a grouch and don't care about the cute side, so I'll get that out of the way first.In case ounces and milliliters are not your thing, the other side of the bottles offer measurements of ""full of deliciousness"", ""half way thru the good stuff"", and ""sadly almost gone"".  Clearly the Zak folks are optimists even when the bottle is half empty.This isn't actually a proper set, since the caddy and the bottles each come in their own box.  Expect to have three boxes to wrap if you're giving this as a gift.  But it does look nifty together, though with four spots in the caddy you might want to give two more bottles to fill it.  Green (or actually kiwi) is available if you want to mix up colors.  There are also spice mills if you really want to go crazy, or a two section caddy if you want to keep the four section caddy for something else.  For me, if I wanted to give this as a gift, I'd get two bottles and a two section caddy.  It's significantly cheaper, comes in the same number of boxes, and there are no worries about balancing the load so it doesn't spill on the way to the table.On the practical side, I'm keeping the caddy for something else.  Even I can manage two bottles at once, and the caddy comes with a lid and four sections that would work well for olives or assorted pickled things or extra salad stuff like croutons or nuts.The description says ""removable handle makes for easy use once on the table"", but the instructions say something different: ""Keep handle fully assembled; do not take apart once assembled.""  I assume the ""removable handle"" is actually the whole handle assembly, including the base plate that goes under the caddy.  But the base plate can be cranky to remove from the caddy, and I've jostled the caddy pretty well trying to get the base plate off of it.  If I've got food in the caddy, that seems like a great way to spill.  And I don't have a whole lot of room for the whole assembled thing in my kitchen.  So I'm using the caddy without the handle.The bottles work really well, though ""Zesty"" (the one with the push button) requires quite a bit of force to use it.  I see one other reviewer is having trouble with it, and I suspect anyone with arthritis or other hand problems will be frustrated by it.  This might not be the best gift for older grandparents.  ""Saucy"", with its flip top, is much easier to use.  Both pour well, with no drips.  Both have an o-ring on the neck of the bottle above the threads.  So far the bottles don't leak, even when filled with ""Runny"" vinegar.By me this is an interesting design that solves problems I didn't really have.  I like the bottles and will start making enough salad dressing to store, so that I don't have to go through the trouble every time.  The caddy will probably live in the pantry until I go to a party and bring food, and even then because the lid is not tight the foods will be transported in their own containers and moved to the caddy when I get there.  The handle is quite large and has to stay assembled once you put it together.  The box doesn't say anything about it, but the product page says this is dishwasher safe, so that's a plus.  And the caddy comes apart into three pieces (plus the handle) for easy cleaning.  I like the bottles, but the whole set strikes me as a bit more fussy than I like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBTVA8F224Q6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC719XW#wasThisHelpful","RBTVA8F224Q6R","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As my mother was dying, I wrote a detailed journal.  As Scott Simon's mother was dying, he wrote tweets.  I think his method is much better than mine.The tweets are woven into the book, wrapped around memories and offering slightly disconnected punch lines.  It's unusual, but somehow it makes me feel like a fly on a wall, as though I'm observing what's happening in real time.My guess is that Simon actually used the tweets to jog his memory as he wrote this book.  The sparse information contained in tweets could have allowed him to fill in the memories and conversations as he wished.  With this structure, he created an image of a woman I wish I had had the opportunity to meet and to know.It's an interesting format, and highlights some very personal memories.  It's a very easy read, but for me and possibly for someone else going through this or not too long past it, it can be difficult to go down this road.  In a way, it's comforting to know that we were not the only ones who had similar experiences with doctors, and it's very comforting to know that Mrs. Newman's nurses were as wonderful as my mother's nurses.

"My shower has always been easy to clean, with just a few items to move before cleaning.  Then I got a shower caddy, and I think my brain decided that since I've got four shelves I have to fill them all.Removing all that junk before cleaning the shower is a pain, and more than once I just cleaned around them.  But this is perfect.  Everything fits... shampoo, conditioner, heavy duty conditioner, three soaps and a bottle of body wash (how the heck did I do that?), exfoliators, razor, and so on.  Removing everything and tossing the whole thing into the sink makes it easy to clean the shower.Last time I left everything in there and hung the caddy from the towel hook.  The things that were removed and left in the shower are the things I use, and the things that stayed in the caddy after a week probably aren't going to be used, and were tossed.Then I rinsed it, let it dry, and folded it up and put it away.So for me this is a cleaning tool and a decluttering tool.

"The day that this arrived, I was in lousy shape from no sleep the night before.  My back and shoulders were in knots, and for some reason everyone was avoiding me.  Normally I'd lie on an exercise ball, but that was too extreme a stretch for me that day.I dropped this on the floor, sat down, and relaxed my back over it.  The first couple of minutes of muscles untwisting brought tears to my eyes, but after that the pain faded and the knots untied.  I may even have examined the inside of my eyelids for a few minutes.So this was immediately added to my stretch routine.  It feels wonderful and I actually look forward to it.But I also exercise with it.  I don't do sit-ups with this, because it feels like a questionable position to start with.  It is good back support for reverse crunches, though.  And I've finally found a way to to do erector spinae work without buying a Roman chair, something I really miss.  The range of motion is not the same, but so far it's the best I can do at home.The padding is comfortable but not too soft, and it doesn't slip on carpet.  I'm not sure I'd recommend this for sit-ups, but for other ab and back work at home this has worked well for me.  And I've found it's great for stretching.

"According to Scotts' charts, this Bermudagrass should have been good for me in South Florida.  Maybe the problem is that a lot of my yard gets full sun for most of the day, but I prepped as instructed, put down a pound of this seed in the usual bare spots, and watered as instructed.  (When I'm writing a review I always read the instructions, even though I know what I'm doing.  This way I test the instructions, and sometimes I find out that I didn't really know what I was doing.  Not this time, though.)A couple of spots did not sprout at all.  The other two grew a little, but not as much as I expected considering the coverage.  It's been a month and a half and I'm going to let the rain take over the watering, but I'm doubtful that those spots will fill in.I'll be the first to admit that my yard is a challenge.  The soil is very sandy and alkaline, and the direct sun is severe.  There's little to no shade in the spots that I planted.  And I don't have a sprinkler system, so seeds are subject to human forgetfulness.  One advantage these seeds seem to have is that even though there's a bird feeder nearby, the birds showed no interest in these seeds.  Maybe it's the coating.In a more hospitable (and less far south) South Florida yard, these seeds might do well.

"The current photo on this item (as of 5/4/15) shows two grey spools and two brown spools.  Warehouse Deals had a great price, and while I didn't need these colors I thought I could get away with them by using them in pieces where the cord would not be obvious.  S-lon works well for me structurally, and I planned to use them where strength would be more important than looks.But that's not what arrived.  There are four spools, the package is labeled ""CHINO"", but the colors are a very light beige, a sort of denim blue, a cornflower-ish blue, and a color that I see somewhere else described as antique gold, but it looks a bit more like a brownish OD green to me.  The blues don't seem to work well together but otherwise it will be fun to mix and match, and I have no problem making any of these colors visible in the pieces I'm working on.I don't know if I got an old package that has been replaced with the colors in the photo, or maybe a new package when blah brown and blah grey didn't sell, so I'm not sure what I'll get when I reorder this item.

"We unfolded this blanket and discovered that it was a generous size for Dixie, a large golden retriever mix.  Dixie has had skin problems for years since fleas appeared in the yard.It's just a blanket, not the cushy padded bed she's used to, but she loved it anyway.  She flopped down on it and rolled over for some belly rubs.  After about two minutes of this, I noticed a tiny biting ant fall off her, stagger a couple of inches across the blanket, then curl up into a ball.I expected a repellent effect, but having it kill the bugs that fall off of her is not a bad thing.  At this point Dixie has VERY sensitive skin, so if she reacts badly to the blanket in the next few days I'll update this review.  For now, it seems to be working well and hopefully will be a better option than the medications the vet prescribes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5D6GXXBAALF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06QQSU#wasThisHelpful","RX5D6GXXBAALF","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These arrived at a moment when I had broken glass on the kitchen floor.  (The gloves have wonderful timing.)  I pulled on a glove and grabbed a handful of glass.While the texture made it easy to pick up every last glass chip, I realized that I couldn't feel the sharp points through the gloves.  To test them, I squeezed the handful of glass until several pieces broke.  (Seriously, the things I do for reviews... what was I thinking?!)  The glass did not puncture the glove.I've used the same pair of gloves to clean up other messes like a pile of wood screws.  At this point I almost want to make them rip, just to prove that I can.  I've been using another glove with a mandoline, then washing it and reusing it the next day.  I've slipped a couple of times but still haven't lost any blood.I've also used these for standard gross clean-ups or chemical use, and while they haven't been damaged they still get thrown out after that.Large gloves are usually a little loose on my hands, but these are pretty snug.  They aren't uncomfortable (beyond the fact that my hands are warm, just like every other nitrile glove.)  There are no places that bind up, like some cheaper thin exam gloves I've tried.  These run a little small but overall are a good fit.These gloves have provided excellent protection and the texture makes it easy to grab even tiny things.  They run small but don't run tight across the thumb or knuckles.  Generally when I buy disposable things like gloves I shop by price, but I think when I use up these gloves I'll be buying more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCJF5IZPQ4ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGSGRIS#wasThisHelpful","R2VCJF5IZPQ4ZR","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using these dividers with an Avery extra wide heavy duty binder, and while they will fit into a couple of my older binders (the larger ones, with back-mounted rings,) it's probably a good idea to plan to have an extra wide binder for these dividers.  They are a generous size, which makes them easy to spot in a thick binder full of paper, but they stick out of most of the binders that I own.  In a larger binder they look very professional, but sticking out of an ordinary binder they just look sloppy.I wanted these more for durability than for the way they look, and I'm happy with that.  I've stored thick stacks of paper, a couple of magazines, and a couple of smaller books in the pockets.  The clear front of each pocket will eventually look battered and the stiff back of the pocket can crease, but they take the abuse without falling apart.Avery has label templates which can be downloaded as well as software that can be used to design labels online, but they require a name and email address to use them.  On the bright side, the ""Send me free offers, templates and tips from Avery"" option is unchecked, which hopefully means they'll keep the junk mail to a minimum.  I've downloaded their Word template and tried the design app online, and I prefer the online app.  Someone with different design needs might find that the templates are better.The ""Easy Apply"" strip makes it easy to mess up all the labels at once, instead of one at a time.  If your hands are steadier than mine your labels will look better.  The alignment and consistent spacing add to the professional look.  My page of label strips warned that I should ""first print on the Easy Apply Practice Sheet to ensure the label sheet is fed into your printer in the correct direction.  The practice sheet is located on the back of the supplemental instruction sheet.""  My dividers don't have that sheet or (obviously) the practice sheet.  A sheet of plain paper worked fine.  I made a mark on the sheet to note which way it fed into the printer.These dividers look professional and are heavy duty.  They're large and stick out well from the paper, making them easy to find.  But for that reason they require an extra wide binder.  Avery's software is good but requires a name and email address in order to use it.  I like the dividers but I'm a little frustrated at the need to give away my email address in order to get nicely printed labels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NVQU7MEQZMEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O48PYAK#wasThisHelpful","R1NVQU7MEQZMEK","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags work well for dry items.  They're pretty good for sandwiches, and the wider shape seems to work well for an opened sleeve of cookies or crackers.  I tried food with a little liquid and ended up with a slow leak and small puddle in my fridge.  And yes, I made sure the bag ""clicked closed"" when I sealed it.The features listed on the box aren't really that impressive.  ""Patented Maxlock track design for an extra strong seal"".  (But not strong enough for liquids, apparently.)  ""Clicks closed so you know it's closed"".  Somehow this has never been a problem before.  ""Zipping sound indicates the seal is secure"".  Well, mostly.  This is another feature I can't bring myself to care about.It seems like Hefty is trying to improve on something that works just fine without zips and clicks.  That's fine, but I'm still buying based on price--there's nothing here that's worth paying extra for.""Recycle if clean and dry"", the box promises, but local recyclers here won't take plastic without a recycle symbol.  The symbol is only on the box, not the bags.  Not every recycler is the same, of course, but here these bags are not recyclable.So these are OK but unremarkable.  The next time I store anything wet I'll put the bag upright in a container in the fridge.

"I'm in Florida, and we have problems with bugs year round.  (I'm not complaining!)  These baits arrived and I walked out onto the lanai (an enclosed porch, to everyone else) and spotted a line of ants marching through.  I put one of these baits down about six inches away from the ants.Within seconds the whole line took a left turn and covered the bait.  They hung around for a while, and when I went back to check the line had resumed, in the new location, with a pit stop at the bait.The next day they were gone.Two days later I had ants on the other side of the lanai.  I moved the bait and the same thing happened, and the next day they were gone.Ants keep re-appearing every few days, but there's no way to know if they're the same nest taking a different route, or just overflow from my neighbors, who don't seem to do any pest control at all.So yes, these work, and they seem to be very popular with Florida ants.  I can't tell if they're eliminating the nests.

"My Jeep has been limping along for a few months with repairs that I couldn't do because nuts and bolts that have rusted into place for two decades couldn't be loosened.Do I take it to the shop?  Do I buy air tools and a compressor?  Neither option is in the budget... but this impact wrench is.There are some cons to this wrench.  I find I was taking breaks a lot, because heavy use makes the tool smell like it's burning.  It didn't burn out, but I didn't push it too hard.And it's heavy, which I expected, and not balanced well.  It's awkward to hold in place, doubly so if you're working in a tight spot that requires three elbows in each arm.The rocker switch was a bit odd, and it took me a minute to get used to it.  Not my preference but not a big deal.All my sockets fit well and stayed on, which is good because the tool would wander a bit because of the balance.  I could concentrate on trying to keep it in place without worrying about trying to hang on to the socket, too.And it broke loose some pretty nasty old bolts that haven't budged for any amount of leverage or heat.If you're a pro looking for a tool that will survive a serious daily beating, this ain't it.  But for me and my old Jeep, and a few repairs that have piled up for months, this was exactly what I needed.  It's not the first tool I'll reach for when the next repair comes along, but I'm pretty sure it will be the last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2JWXSLI5FIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZHIN0S#wasThisHelpful","R3E2JWXSLI5FIG","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shed & Garage Alarm!  Loud enough to be heard all the way inside the house!Doubly so because it has to be inside the house.  If you squint to read the mouse print on the back of the package, on the very bottom, it says ""For indoor use only.""  So we installed it on the bathroom shed.Seriously, I wanted it for a door inside the house anyway.  But for anyone who is buying this for a shed, you should know that you can't expose it to the elements.  If the inside of your shed door doesn't line up properly, and if the sensor is more than 12 mm from the alarm, this won't work.But hey, I want it for inside.  The nice thing about family is that when you tell them ""Please don't oil that squeaky door hinge,"" the first thing they do is oil the squeaky door hinge.  And then they find out what happens when you startle me, intentionally or unintentionally.  (If you don't know what I'm talking about, good.  I hope you never learn.)  Just try to re-squeak a door--the folks at Home Depot gave us funny looks and no answer.  So.  Door alarm.Except that the chime is loud enough to be heard through an exterior concrete wall, and through three interior walls.  The chime, not the alarm.  That would be great, if this were an outdoor alarm.  And there is no volume control.  We wrapped up the speaker in bubble wrap and old socks, and it is still loud enough to be uncomfortable.So this has all the disadvantages of an outdoor alarm and you can't use it outdoors.It was easy to install.  The ""Learn"" function was easy to use.  The sensor can be placed on either side of the alarm, a nice feature.  It was a little more difficult to remove than it was to install.  If you've got a leak-proof shed that is square and not at all warped, you might be able to use this inside the shed, but not on the outside.  I'll be looking for a different door chime.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJXVCRYC2QY1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCUW3NU#wasThisHelpful","RJXVCRYC2QY1J","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do like these scissors a lot, though I'm just as happy with these Scotch Precision scissors), which work as well and are slightly cheaper.These Westcott scissors, like the Scotch, are 8"" and nonstick titanium coated.  I've used both to cut through heavy cardboard and other thick materials, and both work very well.  These scissors have a distinct advantage in visibility--most of the time I grab these because they're the first thing I see.  The two shades of pink are eye catching and can't be mistaken for anything else.I find that the Scotch scissors fit better in my hand.  These are OK, and if I'm just trimming something quickly it's not even something I'll notice.  But if I have a lot of work to do I'll look for the Scotch scissors, since they seem like a better ergonomic fit and they make my hand a little less tired over time.In a few years I'll need new scissors, and what I'll probably do is compare these two and choose the one that is cheaper.  These work, they clean up easily when cutting through tape or label adhesive, and I have no trouble seeing them even when I put a piece of paper on them.

"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started taking these.  We don't fully understand the gut microbiome yet, and here I am taking a probiotic for my mouth?  But dental work is not really an option right now, and I'm doing everything I can to keep my teeth in good shape.  When Hyperbiotics offered me a sample of these and their Pro-15 probiotics, I figured I'd give them a try.The Pro-15 didn't really do anything for me, and at first I thought the same thing about these.  Every morning after brushing and mouthwash I'd chew one or two of these, then grab the first cup of coffee for the day.  Bad planning on my part.  After a couple of weeks I switched to taking these before bed.I didn't give them much thought, until one morning while stopped at a light I realized my teeth felt like I hadn't brushed.  Yep... I hadn't.  In my rush I somehow thought that I must have brushed my teeth already because my mouth didn't taste like someone parked an old truck in there overnight.  My breath was fine, it was just my teeth that were gross.  (Here's a tip I found out the hard way: do NOT use a hand wipe to clean your teeth if you forget to brush.)Once I realized that, I knew what the problem was: my morning breath (which was, by all accounts, no worse than anyone else's) was gone.  Whatever was making my breath nasty in the morning is gone, and while I still can't face the day without brushing, it's amazing the difference this makes.I don't know if this will improve my dental health over time.  I'm placing an order for a new bottle and I'll be taking this regularly from now on.  It's cheaper and less painful than dental work, and I'm hopeful that it will make a difference.

"As someone with digestive problems and a family history of lousy gut biota, every now and then I try different probiotics in the hopes that they'll help.  When Hyperbiotics offered me a sample of Pro-15, I went with that hope again.Again, I was reminded that either the problem isn't my intestinal microbiome, or there are additional problems I'm not addressing.  Like every other probiotic I've tried, this one also didn't fix my GI problems.  But I suspect that the problem is me, and not the Pro-15, for two reasons:1) When the shipment arrived I checked the expiration date.  I found a manufacture date, which was one month earlier.  If I were taking an aspirin I wouldn't care if it was a bit stale, but probiotics lose their effectiveness over time.  If these didn't work for me, it's not because of age.  (Well, not the pills' age, anyway.  Maybe MY age.)2) Shortly after trying this, I tried a different Hyperbiotics product: PRO-Dental.  That really did work for me and it solved a problem I didn't even know I had.There were no side effects.  The pill did not taste bad (didn't taste much at all, actually) and was fairly easy to swallow.  And the probiotics were fresh.  They didn't work for me, but I suspect there are additional problems I need to fix.  Based on what I've seen here and my other Hyperbiotics experience, I'd say that this would be a good place to start for someone who has a need for probiotics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESEDN0XSDY51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NNTBF22#wasThisHelpful","R1ESEDN0XSDY51","AB0Y33G717HOU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0Y33G717HOU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never used a primer before, but I've heard good things about them.  Based on reviews of other Japonesque products, this seemed like it should be a good place to start.  It seems I was right.Since I didn't know what to expect, I gave the primer the best chance to fail that I could think of.  One morning when I had a lot of sweaty work piled up at home, I applied this primer to half my face, then applied makeup (to my whole face) as usual.  Then I started moving stuff, and didn't look in the mirror for hours.  Good thing my family loves me.Several hours later, I finally stopped and checked my makeup, or what was left of it.  Lipstick, of course, was completely gone.  The side without the primer had a few smudges left, but most of the makeup was washed away by sweat.The primer side was not perfect, but the makeup was surprisingly good.  I'd have been comfortable bringing that side out into public.Since then I've been using this primer whenever I apply makeup, and I'm getting a little spoiled by it.  I no longer bother much with touch-ups through the day.  The primer feels impossibly silky to apply, very little is required, and the light fragrance is not noticeable within a couple of minutes.  (I dislike fragrances, so this is important to me.)  I seem to be getting better results while using less makeup, too.  I'm pretty sure that no primer will make my skin look ""flawless"" unless Kilz comes out with something in my skin tone, but I do see a bit of an improvement.This primer helps my makeup last a lot longer, and I use less makeup too.  It's not quite an ""illusion of flawless looking skin"", but it does help a bit.  It applies incredibly smoothly and easily, and not much is required.  The light fragrance fades quickly.

"I'm aware of the historical significance of the bean--worldwide, a primary source of protein and the lifeblood for many people and cultures, sometimes signifying prosperity or fertility, a sign of new life or new beginnings.  And beans are a significant part of my diet and, hey, you are what you eat.  So I'm a human bean.But I knew my friends would look at this bean and think of ""the musical fruit"".  (Your friends may vary.)  I was right.Once we got the laughs and the doggerel out of the way, they suddenly wanted to admire this bean.  The bean itself is about 19mm long and about 10mm at the center, so it is easily visible.  My friends loved the color, which is surprisingly rich under indoor lighting.  They admired the way it floated on the chain.  They noticed that it has a very flattering effect on the things it reflected, and that no matter which way I turned some part of it caught the light.Then someone made a very questionable bean joke.I don't care if it's rude; I like this necklace.  The curves of the bean are surprisingly graceful, and I like the shape of it better than the original Tiffany necklace.  This one seems more natural, healthier, more promising.  And this one is available, which is no longer true of the Tiffany necklace.The chain had me worried.  It seems very thin and delicate.  I wore it to bed for a couple of nights, to give it a chance to compete in the Tossing and Turning Olympics.  It survived both nights with no damage.Both boxes are also nicely done.  They are a very slightly textured matte black, with contrasting brilliant blue.  The inside of the interior box is a slightly padded soft black, which does a wonderful job of highlighting the piece inside.  If all Amazon Curated jewelry comes in these boxes I may have to start looking here for gifts.This is the loveliest, most delicate piece of jewelry that I've worn that has inspired absolutely the rudest jokes.

The consistency is no different than textured paints that have a rough surface.  The finish is inconsistent, even when applied thickly.  Not at all what I would call ""crackle paint"".

"I purchased a total of 5 brands of these ""crackle"" mediums/paints, and am sorry to say none of them perform as expected.This particular product crackled better than most... but has almost no adhesive properties.  It crackles great, but flakes off very easily at the rub of a finger.  It absolutely must be sealed with a top coat (polymer might be preferred) in order to retain any kind of permanence.  Even then I would expect it eventually to come off the item.  It may work well on wood, but I wouldn't use it on metal, plastic, glass, vinyl or any other slick-surface, even if primer is used.  It's just ""flaky"".This crackle paint must be applied thickly to achieve proper crackle... and will crackle differently at the slightest difference in thickness.

Simply doesn't do the job for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GO4UZL05CTZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV42AS#wasThisHelpful","R3GO4UZL05CTZ","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried other keyboard of this general class.  This one works better than any others I've used.  The touchpad is responsive and accurate, the keys respond well.

(Why didn't Microsoft put a ""disable pad tap"" function in Windows 8 & 10?).  It is thin enough to fit in the same case as my tablet and still allow the case to close.The only reason I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with driver software to give it capabilities beyond Windows (such as turning off pad tap).

This is a 15 watt 8 ohm speaker and should be able to produce a fairly loud signal... but the sound was pitiful.

"This is a lovely ocarina with nice mellow tone.  Being ceramic it has a much nicer sound than plastic ocarinas.It comes in a sturdy heavy-nylon case with belt loop and includes an adjustable bead-string neck loop that's as pretty as the ocarina.  The instrument is easy to play once you get the fingering down.  It comes with instructions.  If you already know how to play a 12-hole ocarina you'll have no difficulty with this.There's nothing at all ""cheap"" about this ocarina.  I wouldn't call it ""concert"" quality... but it's better quality than most.  For an instrument in this price range it is excellent quality.  The instrument itself is well-made, the glaze finish very nice (as well as the hand-painting), the neck cord is very pretty and even the case is high-quality.  For a quality musical instrument it is certainly a good buy.Note: one review stated this is difficult to blow and they have difficulty getting out low tones: I would have to say they didn't have a thumb hole covered (which would produce such results).  This ocarina plays fine and is not at all difficult to blow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDHZPV7XY69H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWSDUTE#wasThisHelpful","R2KDHZPV7XY69H","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The product itself, although a ""squeeze stress toy"" felt like it wasn't properly filled with squeeze stuff (about half empty).  Very flimsy, the hands did not reach the face.  When squeezed the arms do not separate as advertised.  The base of the figure was distorted and it wouldn't stand up.  In short, it is a very-poorly-manufactured item.BUT THERE IS HOPE!  Feeling around I realized the squeeze stuff, whatever it was, wasn't gel.  So I cut the bottom out of the figure with scissors (see photo) and discovered the innards are some kind of white, water-soluble putty.  I removed this putty and without the distorted bottom, the figure stood on its own quite well.  If one wanted it could be filled with sand to add some weight, the bottom glued to a form-cut piece of wood, plastic or cardboard, and you'd have a decent display figure.  But it's fine hollow; it stands on its own and holds its shape without filling.What about the arms?  The entire figure is made of very flexible vinyl.  I really like the floppy wings.  So I took a stiff piece of thin wire and ran it carefully through the head into the body.  I then bent the head downward so that the face was hidden by the hands.  The effect was perfect... a Weeping Angel with a bowed head and face hidden.  To open the arms, forget the squeeze action... just pull the arms apart at the elbows.  No one is going to care when they see that horrid hidden face.So you can rescue it from its poorly-manufactured state and turn it into what it should have been to start with-- a detailed display model with arms that can pull away from the grimacing face.  I'm now rather pleased with the figure.  I'd give it 4 stars if I hadn't had to do all that work.  (But really, it's simple and took about 10 minutes total.)  It's fairly easy to mod if yours doesn't work out of the box.  From what I've read and the ratings stats (at this time) you have about a 30% chance of getting a ""good"" one.  Fortunately it can be modified.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AG1Y0JIQ92F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLQ6B9A#wasThisHelpful","R14AG1Y0JIQ92F","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read the mixed reviews on here and wondered why it worked for some folks and didn't work for others.  I think the reason is the very scanty instructions that don't stress clearly enough how this product is used... and the fact that it is labeled as a ""medium"". From the instructions it is clearly not a medium (ie, it is not mixed with paint).  I finally figured out how it's used by going to YouTube and watching a demonstration.  I then realized the instructions were correct; they just didn't emphasize an essential step.This product requires a FOUR-STEP process...which is why I give it only 3 stars; it's very time-consuming to use.STEP 1)  Paint an acrylic base coat as a contrast color.  Let it dry.STEP 2) Paint this ""medium"" over the base coat . Let it dry.  IMPORTANT:  do not expect to see crackles yet.  This stuff doesn't crackle by itself.  Instead it provides a crackle environment.STEP 3) *ESSENTIAL TO FUNCTION*  Once the Weathered Wood dries, paint it over very quickly with a coat of different-color acrylic paint.  This is when you will quickly note the cracking.  There is a chemical reaction of some kind that occurs and the crackling begins very quickly.  It begins so quickly in fact, you may not be able to apply the paint fast enough.  If you re-brush over a pre-coated area it may actually pull both paint and crackle away from the project.  That's another reason for only 3 stars... lack of working time.  The crackle effect starts taking place within 15-30 seconds.STEP 4) Once the crackle step is complete and FULLY DRY, overcoat it with a sealer.  I'm not sure what kind of sealer to use since acrylic reacts to the crackle, but a wipe-on polymer might do best.  Without this sealer coat the crackle will be like actual weathered paint... rather unstable.So this is a very time-consuming and tricky process.  It works, and the effect is interesting, but it requires four distinct steps with four drying cycles that will cover (at the very least) a two-hour period-- as opposed to a ""mix with the paint and let it dry""... or a crackling base that you then paint over.I have tried five of these ""crackle"" products.  They all are similar in concept and results.  None of them approach the crackle we might find in a ceramic crackle glaze... which is really what I'm looking for.  If anyone knows of such, lemme know.  : )","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EKQ3EI59Q96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LXLTUU#wasThisHelpful","R6EKQ3EI59Q96","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've purchase four similar-type guitars lately for practice in building electric guitars.  This guitar is surprisingly nice.  It should be considered a ""starter"" guitar-- but a good one.  Here are the pros and cons:- Has only one pickup and that's near the bridge.  Don't expect rich, deep tone.  This guitar is obviously designed to appeal to the younger generation looking for metal / distortion guitar playing... thus the location of the pickup.+ But it's a rather nice humbucker and pulls the best sound possible out of this guitar, considering its location.+ The body is pristine, gorgeously finished.  The wood (at least on the one I received) was well-assembled with joint marks just barely visible and blended in with the transparent / grin finish.  It's an attractive guitar.+ A swirl-maple 1/16"" veneer on the surface of the neck provides an attractive and durable surface+ The neck is straight and sturdy.  I did not have to adjust the guitar or action at all... rare with off-the-shelf guitars.+ The amplifier with this-- although predictably ""tinny"" due to the small speaker size-- is surprisingly robust.  The basic tone is clear and clean, even at higher volume.  Hit the ""overdrive"" button and you can get all the dirt and grit you want.  Overall, it is a much better amp than a similarly-configured competitors guitar set (which I also bought.  In short... this guitar set is better).+ I like that the bottom of the neck (where it joins the body) is rounded and smoothed rather than cut off straight as we see with some guitars in this price range.+ Comes with everything you need-- guitar cord, strap, picks, tuner and gig bag.In summary-- this is a nicer guitar set than I thought it would be when I first purchased it.  You get the entire set for about the price of a Fender Squier and the nicer tone and power of a humbucker pickup (although of course, not the tonal versatility of a 3-pickup Squier).  I consider this guitar set to be well worth the purchase price and a good choice for a beginning guitar player.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VCL8JDMJ5SHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RZCZ90#wasThisHelpful","R1VCL8JDMJ5SHP","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good-quality ""starter guitar"" with a pitiful practice amp thrown in to the bargain.  For around a hundred bucks, it's not a bad deal.I'm reviewing this item from several directions:* Is the manufacture of good quality?  (yes)* Does it suit the intended purpose? (starter system for first time players... somewhat yes)* How does it compare to other products? (right in the middle... not the best, not the worst)This is a ""starter kit"" aimed directly at young / first time guitar players.  The guitar and amp should be rated separately.  Part of me wants to give this 5 stars for quality of manufacture, but other issues are involved-- including what else is available for $100.My overall satisfaction with the purchase:  I bought mine in ""used excellent"" condition and am very pleased with the purchase, even though I've played guitar for (mumblety mumble) years / decades.  The lower used price attracted me to try it.GUITAR PROs and CONs:* WELL-MADE.  Finish is pristine.  Beautiful body, gorgeous neck.  The maple veneer fingerboard is lovely. Appears to be 1/16"" veneer, so the surface should hold up well.* SET UP.  Easy to set up.  Almost every off-the-shelf guitar has to be ""set up"" for proper action.  A few turns on the neck rod and resetting of the bridge screws produced action that is very acceptable in this level of guitar.  Of course it's not the same micro-fine action one will get out of a $2000 guitar... nor should it be expected to be so.  I am picky about such things but find this setup to be very acceptable in this range of instrument.  In short-- it's quite playable and even enjoyable to play.* VIBRATO is excellent (wiggling fingers to get a tremolo tone).  Not all guitars can make that claim... not even expensive ones.* TONE.  Considering this has one humbucker at the bridge and is intended to appeal to the high-tone, distortion hard-rock base of the younger generation, the sound is fine.  For the trained ear or someone who wants mellow blues / jazz tones, this would not be the instrument of choice.  This is a ""twanger"" for sure.  (That said, add a P90 below the neck and some good strings and yowza, might have a very nice-sounding guitar.)* This is a humbucker rather than a single pickup, so it has that to its credit.  And it's a good enough humbucker to not require replacing.* The tuners are very touchy (small ratio), but they do tend to hold once tuned.Bottom line:  one shouldn't buy a guitar like this and expect professional features.  This is a starter guitar... but it's a well-made starter guitar. However for the same money one can buy a Fender Squier and have near-pro quality.This guitar really is made very well.  It's not as good as a Fender, but considerably better than some other $100 guitars I've seen.  So 5 stars for quality of manufacture... 3 stars for being (as expected) a basic $100 guitar with a single bridge pickup.  (Note: had they put a neck pickup on this as well I'd have given this 5 stars hands-down).THE AMP PROs and CONs:+ It's included with the guitar+ The controls are easy-to-use- Pitiful poor speaker.  If someone likes distortion... you'll surely get that. It's difficult to get the amp to NOT distort.  A lot of young ""rockers"" will love it.  But if you want clean sound you'll have to turn the Gain all the way down, Volume all the way up, and all tone dials to the middle.  Even then, don't strum too hard.- Very ""tinny"" sounding.  It's basically a ""junk"" amp thrown in for a starter.If one were to replace the speaker with something better, there's a chance the amp part of this unit is better quality than the speaker allows.  I'm going to try to scrounge a higher-quality speaker just to see what I can get out of this.OVERALL:  The quality of the guitar is the high-point here.  It is built much better than I expected it to be.  The finish is very nice, the neck is good quality, and the action can be easily set to ""very playable"".  It's beautiful in appearance (better than the photo demonstrates).  That is the shining ""5 star"" grace of this kit.Conversely, the sound of guitar and amp together is tinny, distorted, with zero depth.  If you know how to mod a guitar... stick a $15 P-90 pickup on this near the neck and you could double the playing sound/value of the guitar.  It would be worth it; you'd have a nice guitar with great vibrato play.Surprisingly I like this guitar as a ""modable"".  I have plans for it, definitely.  I suggest this mainly for modders who want to have some fun starting with a well-built guitar base.  For that purpose, this is perfect.  It's also a low-cost alternative for the first-time guitar player who wants a playable instrument, one that can be set up to be easy to play and will at least encourage them to keep playing.  A viable alternative to the popular Fender Squier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCWO0HH0JCQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097BD7L2#wasThisHelpful","R1CCWO0HH0JCQO","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I checked three of these out at a local guitar store.  For the price, awesome guitar.PROS:* Around $400 retail.  That is cheap for a quality guitar* Excellent tone.  I would put flat-wound strings on it to really bring out the blues.* Official Bigsby licensed tailpiece (see cons as well)* Tri-switch between pickups offers neck, bridge or both pickups for variety of sound* Two volume controls and an overall tone control (I like that much better than the Les Paul 4-control system)* Master volume control* Two P-90 pickups... just right for anything from blues to 50s to surf to (with the right amp) gritty rock* Action can be set to very good (I've never bought an off-the-shelf guitar that didn't need adjustment to the action)* Solid neck runs straight through center of the guitar for added strength and sustainCONS:* V-type saddle makes it difficult to keep strings in tune when using the tremolo bar.  Replacing this with a roller bridge would likely fix the problem (I would consider such replacement a necessity).  Bigsby is a respected tail system but if not installed precisely is known for going out of tune.  I'd plan on springing for a roller bridge.  They're inexpensive and easy to replace.* The tremolo bar the three guitars I tested was too stiff in both directions.One must remember this is a $400 git and not a $1000 one.  Except for the tremolo stiffness and need to replace the bridge, it's a near-perfect guitar.  As it stands, it's significantly better than lower-price guitars, and even excels most guitars in its price range... but because of the tremolo / tuning issues is just ""okay"" overall (as shipped from the factory).  A roller bridge will be an essential add-on and if you can get one with a little looser tremolo, you could easily wind up with a 5-star guitar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSJGPEH1AI8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBY4KEM#wasThisHelpful","R3TSJGPEH1AI8P","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Such adapters often can be purchased in a microphone / headphone separator configuration, which is very handy so you can listen to your clips immediately after recording them.PROS:* Sound recording is far better than I expected for a microphone in this price range.* Stereo, with splitting performed by two separate parallel pickup devices in the mike.* Excellent recording quality; faithful reproduction of sound* Relatively small and lightweight* The LED light flashes briefly when you turn it on as verification the mike is working.* Removable wind screen* Handy mini-clamp on the back of the mike to hold excess cord and keep it from flapping against a device while recording.CONS:These aren't so much negatives as they are simple operational procedures.* This is a nature-cannon mike.  As such it is  very sensitive and will pick up all ambient noise.  There's no ambient filter (it's intended for filming nature and all that comes with it).  However, such background noise is usually very easy to cut out using free programs such as Audacity and its Noise Removal function.  Most ambient filters I've used muffle all sound, which I find undesirable.  I would rather have the clear, full, accurate reproduction of recorded sound that this mic offers and cut the background noise in production.  Most recording techs I speak with feel the same.* Battery required (supplied).  The battery is stated to last over 800 hours... which is a very long time.  However there is no indication of automatic shutoff... so you will need to remember to turn the switch off when done recording.Of the above two ""cons"", both are normal in even high-price cannon mikes... so both can be discounted as ""standards of the industry"".The instruction booklet is very small and written in ""Aslish"" (something I rather enjoy reading; their English though chopped, is considerably better than my Asian, and brings me the occasional chuckle).  So you will likely need your reading glasses and a sense of humor.  If you have both, you'll enjoy the manual.I consider this to be an excellent microphone and a good purchase.  I have purchased several mics in this price range that I didn't find to do a good job-- and posted lesser-satisfactory reviews regarding them.  I am pleased to say this microphone deserves its 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KA9IM3NOAOSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QNBWERC#wasThisHelpful","R2KA9IM3NOAOSK","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not really sure what this is meant to be used for.  I can say what it CAN'T be used for:* Can't be used to feed a USB mike into a cell phone or tablet* Can't be used to plug a flash-drive into an AUX port on a car* Can't be used with anything that requires USB power* Can't be used to plug USB headphones into a standard earphone jack (most USB headphones require power)About the only thing I can think of that it might be used for is plugging a self-powered USB sound output device into a cell phone... but I can't really imagine what such a device would be.  Most such devices would already have a 3.5mm output port, which would allow use of a standard connector cable.I think the main problem here is the manufacturer / seller failing to inform the public exactly what this device was intended to be used for.  The obvious uses of 1) plugging a USB mike into a phone or pad or 2) plugging USB headphones into a cell or tablet... simply don't work.

"For the price this makes an excellent ""first time"" guitar.  It looks fancy and sports two humbucker pickups.PROS:* A visually interesting and unusual guitar* Handles well; balance is good* Body finish is pristine* Two humbuckers and a single-- rare to see 3 pickups in a guitar this price range* Once it's is set up it plays well enough and is enjoyable to play.  That's a big ""plus"" with this level of guitar.CONS:* As is common, the entire guitar will have to be set up when first opened.  This one took a bit though; I spent more than an hour adjusting the neck, the bridge position and the string action.* The 5-position switch is too close to the volume knob, actually touching the knob at the uppermost position.* The positions of the switch do not allow simultaneous use of both humbuckers.  This is an unfortunate drawback.  The switch allows  neckbucker alone, neckbucker and mid-single, mid-single alone, mid-single and bridgebucker, and bridgebucker alone. In reality of playing, it is unlikely one would use the mid-single by itself; that position should have been reserved for both humbuckers (or all three).  This of course can be overcome by opening the back of the git and doing a bit of informed re-wiring.  It's not insurmountable, but it's a poor wiring design... especially since it would have been just as easy to wire it better.* The tuners were a bit loose-- again not unusual on a guitar in this price range.* The nut was not properly grooved for the strings.  The D-string grove had to be widened.* Tremolo is very stiff.  Solution:  open up the back and remove one of the springs.* There were two hairline finish cracks in the headstock, apparently from over-tightening the neck adjustment cover screws.* None of the pickups lined up with the strings.  The strings are all offside the ""dots"" on every pickup.  There's no way to fix this other than replacing the pickups with bar pickups (which would make this a much more awesome guitar and would be worth the extra cost).* The mid-single pickup is not height adjustable.  It simply screws in place.  The other two pickups are not angle-adjustable.  They would need to be shimmed underneath to line up with the strings.In other words, it's a starter guitar at a super-cheap price.  It is playable (once it is properly adjusted) and even fun to play, but it will require a lot of ""set up"" and a bit of knowledge to make it play correctly (also, give a day or so for the strings to set in).  This will make a nice-looking learner or practice guitar, but to be honest there are better guitars on the market in the same price range.  I give it 3 stars because it's an under-$100 guitar and no one should be expecting much more.  One can buy a Fender Squire for near the same money and get a much better guitar for the dollar.  However the humbucker pickups are nice and some first-timers will love the unusual style.This has potential as a ""hobbyist-rebuilder"" guitar.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15DIAEB9ULNUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSZGZBG#wasThisHelpful","R15DIAEB9ULNUT","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first received this I gave it 5 stars in general appearance.  Then I looked at it closer, with reading glasses, and discovered this is not the same figure as shown in the photo.  The photo figure is far more detailed than the one currently being shipped.  While the figure is still fairly awesome... it is just not the same as the pictured one.I am an admirer of Papo work.  This is the 4th piece I've purchased; prior pieces are the Shark Pirate, Warrior Orc, and Armored Crocodile.  I also own the Tigress Carrying Cub because it is so realistic.Rhino Man is a good figure... it's just not the great figure shown in the photo.  It is significantly less-detailed and the paint job is shoddy (for example, the axe head is brown rather than painted silver).  For these reasons I'm disappointed with the purchase.  It makes me wonder if they put out two different figurines, if the one in the photo is an artist rendition rather than the actual figure, or if the original mold wore out and this is a re-release.  Whichever, it's just not the same.These are sturdy enough for children's play... but detailed enough for display pieces.This makes a good addition to my fantasy figure collection. I don't collect many things and I'm very discriminating in what I add to it... but this line of figures has earned space on my shelves.  But this isn't what was expected.

"Least-expensive reproduction of the Firefly space ship on the market.  For Firefly fans who haven't already acquired one of the expensive models ($300 to $3000)... this under-$30 version will press the collector's-desire button.  The fact that it's marketed as a Yahtzee game is probably pretty much irrelevant.  We can play Yahtzee on our computers.  I'd wager almost every person buying one of these is buying it for the ship itself and couldn't care less that it comes with Yahtzee dice (although they are interesting little dice).I do wish the engines rotated and the tail fins were movable... but can't have perfection.

"When I purchased this it was under $20.  For that price it has a lot of features and reasonable performance.The entire line of Lepai amps has something in common: they work fairly well for the price range and what they are, but they don't pack near the punch one would expect from a car amplifier.  They make decent hobby-experimentation amps.  But for use as an auto amp, they just don't have what it takes.There is an exception:  if you're using a preamped external source (such as an MP3 player) these can produce quite good volume and tone.

"I read review after review about what a wonderful tool this is.  But I don't see the value.  I've used old-fashioned draw-knives  and they do a better job, more reliably and quickly.This is basically a plane with handlebars.  It can shave quite a bit of wood (the wood will have to be clamped) but it does so very roughly rather than smoothly.  The blade will require adjusting prior to use; it doesn't look like the factory spent any time getting it to working level before shoving it out the door.  It works best when the blade is just below the plane bottom; in this position it removes wood fairly well.PROS:* Well-built and sturdy* Good-quality blade* It works... kindaCONS:* Adjustment system is cumbersome and difficult to use* Blade does not come properly adjusted from the factory* Handles are narrow and uncomfortable to use* A standard plane does a better job for fine work* A standard old-fashioned draw-knife does a far better job for stripping and wood removalIn short, this is an unnecessary tool that tries to replace a draw knife and a plane with one low-cost tool... and fails in both aspects.If you're looking for a tool like this to shave wood (ie, a ""spokeshave"") I recommend a regular double-handle 10"" draw knife.

"This might be good as a carpenter's paperweight or conversation piece.There is no indication of just how small this item is.

It does not arrive adjusted properly; the blade is far too deep in cut to be of any value.  There is no blade locking mechanism save for one single screw.  As a wood-worker's tool I can't imagine the application.  It's just far too small to be of any value.  There's only room on the handles for a thumb and finger; how is one supposed to hold it and do any work?The only real value I can perceive is as a joke-gift for your favorite craftsman.

"The concept is simple:  smoothed edges for handing, sharpened edges for scraping.  You use these opposite the way you use a chisel; set the sharpened edge against the wood and pull it toward you.  It will remove minute quantities of wood and leave a fairly smooth surface.  The multiple shapes allow you to scrape flat sides, curves and grooves.This is a good-quality, well-made set of scrapers.  They are good for bringing wood down from rough to much-smoother finish and if used lightly can produce a very smooth finish on wood.

You'll find numerous opinions as to which works best.As far as these tools go, they do the job they're intended to do, very well.  Press hard and they'll take off small strips of wood.

"Decent wire.  I purchased the 1-lb reel after going through a half-lb reel.  This wire is strong (for 42awg) and performs well.  There was no breakage at all that wasn't caused by external problems; the wire itself held up fine.  I've tried other 42awg wire and was frustrated with the amount of repeated, seemingly random breaking.  This wire presented none of that, allowing me to finish projects with minimal headache.  I'm a repeat customer and very likely will be again, depending how quickly I go through this reel.The reason I rated this 4 stars rather than 5 is because there are a considerable number of ""break welds"" in the wire itself (where the wire has broken in production and been welded together).  One would not ordinarily notice this at all unless feeding the wire by hand (which I do)... in which case the break welds can be felt as they pass through the fingers.  As a break weld is about double the thickness of the wire alone, this causes a bump in coil wraps, alteration of resistance (minor, but it builds up with each break), and in excess reveals the wire is not ""quality"".For my use, this is inexpensive and acceptable.  It works well.  But buyers should be aware there are too many break welds in this wire to be used for critical work.  For regular coil winding (its most common use) it's adequate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAH6GGNKF0ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RO96F6#wasThisHelpful","RHAH6GGNKF0ZX","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When sellers consider a hard-cover Pern book to be worth 5 cents... readers can wisely take a hint and save themselves both money and time.My suggestion:  if you're a Pern fan-- just re-read the original series.  You'll enjoy it more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXI4VBOFYRSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345491165#wasThisHelpful","R2KXI4VBOFYRSP","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is good wire and I like the red color; it is much easier to see that the wire is stripped when removing insulation than it is with copper-colored wire.  This holds up and performs as one would expect.  Do be aware that the insulation is intended to be removed only by the heat of soldering or with fine sandpaper.  It lives up to that expectation.  I have tried every solvent I can think of and nothing removes that coating.  So you can pretty well rely on the insulation coating holding up and protecting the bare wire.  The downside is you need to have your soldering and sanding skills down pat.  This is thin stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OME0Y63T4LTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5G2UR4#wasThisHelpful","R3OME0Y63T4LTM","ALHC64J88LVWO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALHC64J88LVWO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent-quality 9v battery holders with on/off power switch.  They include both battery clips and wire leads.However, the design leaves quite a bit to be desired.  The battery access is on one side of the case... but the power switch on the other side.  This leaves one wondering how these were intended to be installed.  If they are mounted on one side, the power switch is blocked.  If they're mounted on the other side, the battery door is blocked.  If a small opening is made to access the power switch from the outside of an object, the access door is trapped inside the object.The only evident option is to just ""leave it hanging"".  If that was the goal, regular 9v battery leads are much less expensive.  The only advantage I can see to this case is that it does has an on/off switch.

"This is a good value for the money (currently $6.52)... depending on your needs.PROS:* 5-way switch, three pots and guitar jack already pre-soldered* Good-quality parts-- 500K pots and a sturdy switch* Low priceCONS:* Unusual layout (see below)* No instructions  (bad in this case because of unusual layout)UNUSUAL LAYOUTIn most items of this sort we would expect either two volume controls and one tone pot, or two tone pots and one volume control.But in this case we find two A500 pots with capacitors and a single B500 pot with no capacitor.Ordinarily, the B500 pot would contain the capacitor and be used as a tone pot.  The A500 pots would have no capacitor and be used for volume control.So it's unusual (and confusing) to find a non-capped B500 linear pot and two capped A500 audio pots.  It makes me wonder if the factory got a couple of parts boxes mixed up.  If this was a single A500 non-capped pot and two capped B500s it would make sense.

"This wire is intended and advertised as ""wrapping wire"" and for such purpose works fine. However, it is equally good for the purpose for which I purchased it: fine wire work on audio electronics.* The wire itself is single-stand and thin yet holds shape well when bent.* The insulation is sufficient yet minimal thickness.* The metal solders easily and conducts current wellSome have mentioned difficulty stripping because of how thin it is. Stripping is actually rather easy if you know the secrets:1. Use a hobby knife, lightly score one side of the wire, pull off the end with your fingers or pliers.2. My preferred method: open a pair of good scissors slightly, insert the wire until it stops between the two blades, pull on the wire. The natural sharpness of the scissors should catch and pull the insulation right off. Using this method I've had no difficulty stripping 1/2"" or more of insulation at a time.The insulation doesn't stick unduly to the wire and once it it sliced slides off easily.Good quality wire.

"This book relates the historical development of quantum mechanics, and should serve as a useful adjunct to quantum mechanics textbooks. I liked this book a lot and highly recommend it to physicists and students of physics, both those taking university courses and those seriously studying on their own.  However, I do not recommend the book for those with only a very limited knowledge of physics, because while no equations are presented the book is replete with somewhat in depth discussions of some of the finer points of the subject, particularly with regards to the interpretation of the Schrodinger wave equation, the meaning of the uncertainty principal and on the EPR experiment.  All this is best illustrated by discussing what is in this book.What is in the book The book discusses the development of quantum mechanics from 1900 to 2010, as depicted by 40 moments- critical junctures in time.  These 40 moments are divided into seven parts, as follows:Part I  Quantum of Action.  This part details the origin of the idea of quanta, first developed by Max Planck in 1900. It goes on to Einsteins application of Plancks ideas and to additional developments, up to 1925, including the work of Heisenberg, deBroglie and Schrodinger.  I found this to be a very entertaining and informative part or the book as it mixes basic ideas of physics with a bit of the biographies of the men who development them.  This approach is carried out throughout the book, with some biographical information accompanying the physics discussions.Part II  Quantum Interpretations.  This part of the book discusses the various interpretations of the meaning of quantum mechanics and the controversies that developed, covering the period of 1925-27.Part III  Quantum Debate  This part of the book further amplifies the debate about the meaning of quantum mechanics during the period of 1927-47.  It focuses on Einsteins reservations and his EPR thought experiment that sought to show that quantum mechanics, as it was formulated, was incomplete.Part IV  Quantum Fields  This part of the book, covering the period of 1947-67, focuses on the development of quantum field theory and quantum electro-dynamics.  I liked the development of Feynmans approach and how it compared to that of Schwinger and Tomonaga.  It also goes into the beginnings of the development of the quark model.Part V  Quantum Particles  This section deals with the development of the standard model, covering 1968-2003.  I found this and the preceding sections to be the most difficult when they delved into the ideas of group theory.  Part IV contains a good description of the relation of symmetry to basic conservation laws, but then the author jumps to group theory and then to its application to particle physics, but without explaining very much about group theory and even less about how it is applied to the problems of describing the interior of the atom and the interior of protons, neutrons and of the particles that are observed in accelerator experiments, some of which are also found in nature due to cosmic ray collisions.Part VI  Quantum Reality  I found the discussions of Bells theorem and Bells inequality to be excellent.  I learned that there are many version of the experiments meant to investigate this inequality and determine if reality is local or non-local, and that there are newer types of expressions of the sort that Bell developed that are being tested.  This part of the book covers the period of 1951- 2006.Part VII  Quantum Cosmology  This part of the book deals with quantum mechanics, its application to cosmology (especially through the work of Hawking) and to attempts to develop a theory that encompasses both gravity and the standard model for particle physics.  This part of the book covers these subjects from 1966-2000.  There is also a brief epilogue that discusses the search for the Higgs particle up to 2010.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84ATRPIMUZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199566844#wasThisHelpful","R84ATRPIMUZL","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book and found that it helped to clarify the paradoxes discussed in this book (see below).  In doing so, it also provided a good overview of many of the conundrums that relativity theory and quantum mechanics have created.  I give this book 5-stars and recommend it to people, like myself (a retired research metallurgist with a long ago exposure to modern phyaics in graduate school and further reading since I have retired), which have some understanding of the ideas presented in this book, but with the reservation that those with little or no background in the subjects covered are likely to view the book less positively.What is in this book-This book discusses the most important paradoxes created by modern physics, plus two introductory chapters that discusses some logic paradoxes.  The chapters and their content are as follows:Chapter 1  The Game Show Paradox  Monty Hall and how his knowledge of what is behind the three curtains alters the odds when he lets a contestant switch from their initial choice to another one.Chapter 2  Achilles and the Tortoise  Classical paradoxes and how they are resolved.Chapter 3  Olbers Paradox  Why is the sky not covered with stars, making the nighttime as bright as the daytime?  The physics here is about the finite nature of the visible universe and the ideas concerning the beginning and expansion of the universe.Chapter 4  Maxells Demon  The physics of the second law of thermodynamics is discussed in this chapter.Chapter 5  The Pole in the Barn Paradox  - Special relativity and length contraction are discussed in this chapter.Chapter 6  The Paradox of Twins  This chapter focuses on special relativity and time dilation.Chapter 7  The Grandfather Paradox  This chapter focuses on relativity theory and the possibility of travel back in time that the theory allows for.Chapter 8  The Paradox of Laplaces Demon  This chapter deals with the ideas of a mechanically deterministic universe and free will.Chapter 9  The Paradox of Schrodingers Cat -  The basic paradox of Quantum Mechanics and the question of entanglement is discussed in this chapter.Chapter 10  Fermis Paradox -  Fermi asked - if there are aliens from other planets why havent they visited (at least as far as most people are concerned) or have given any indication of their existence?  The physics is about the possibilities of life on other planets.Chapter 11 - Remaining questions  These are not paradoxes, but questions which the author thinks will be answered in his lifetime, answered but not in the foreseeable future and questions that may never be answered.  This chapter is only 6-pages long and only lists the questions, but does not discuss them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PBH8T7LDL2W1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307986799#wasThisHelpful","R3PBH8T7LDL2W1","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book details the efforts of the US Navy to use submarines to learn what it could about the Soviet Navys capabilities, particularly those of their submarines, as well as their general capabilities and intentions.  The book details the successful efforts to tap Soviet undersea cables, follow their submarines and to learn as much as they could about them.  Since most of this information is still classified, the authors were forced to focus on events which have become part of the public record, particularly with regards to submarine mishaps and the sinking of several, including the USS Scorpion and the attempt to recover a sunken Soviet submarine.  The book clearly shows the dangers that the men who served on submarines (both of the US and USSR) experienced and of their sacrifices.  It shows how the US Navy strove to protect the US from the nuclear weapons that soviet submarines carried and how the Walker spy ring undermined this effort.  I enjoyed the book and found it very interesting and informative.  I recommend the book to anyone interested in US military history, military policy and the Cold War.In my opinion, this book not only gives one a flavor of what is was like to serve on a submarine during the cold war, but also provides valuable insights into other aspects of the US Navy  political infighting between it and the CIA, and between Naval Intelligence and the Nuclear Navy that controlled the nuclear submarines that it relied upon to gather information.  I also feel that the book also gave insights on the relations between the US and the USSR, and on the end of the Cold War.  The book contains a appendix listing known collisions between allied (US and British Royal Navy) submarines and those of the USSR.  There is also a brief appendix that provides the USSR Navys perspective on events and on actions that they were taking.  The book also has two very useful maps and over 30 black and white photographs printed on glossy paper, that show some of the people, submarines and equipment mentioned in the book.The story of the US Navys submarine intelligence gathering efforts ends in 1998, the year of publication of the book.  As is noted in the book, with the end of the Cold War these US intelligence-gathering efforts have shifted somewhat to the Middle East.  It would be interesting to know how the rise of blue water Chinese navy and of Russia under Vladimir Putin has altered this intelligence gathering effort.  However, as any information of this sort is surely highly classified I guess we will have to wait many decades more to find out what is going on now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMXHM1M91ECZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1891620088#wasThisHelpful","RMXHM1M91ECZN","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The great British military historian and military theorist, B. H. Liddell Hart, is the editor, not the author of this book.  He wrote a four-page introduction and a 25-page section on the Red Army in WWII, but the rest of the book is by other authors.  Some, like German Generals Guderian, von Manstein, Blumentritt and Student were leaders of the German army, likewise for General Weygand of the French Army.  Military historians and lower level officers of the Red Army wrote other articles.  The book covers the imperial czarist heritage of the Red army, and the Red army during the Red/White civil war and purges of the late 1930s, as well as during WWII and the period after the war, up to 1955 (just before the 1956 publication of this book).I found the chapters to be of varying quality.  Some were interesting and provided some insight into the Red Army, whereas I found others to be too general and unfocused.  All in all, I do not think that this is a book that provides much detailed analysis of battles, campaigns and military tactics.  These topics are covered, but only superficially, and for the most part I found that the book provided me with few new insights.  Some of this stems probably from the fact that the book was written only ten years after the end of the war, with the German generals still trying to make themselves and the German army look good, and with Soviet officers unwilling to criticize their superiors or the army tactics and behavior during the war.I would only recommend this book to students of military history.  I would not, however, recommend it to those who might purchase the book because of the fact that Liddell Hart is the purported author.  As noted, he was only the editor.  Were fractional ratings allowed I would have given the book 3.5 stars, but because they are not, I am rounding the rating up to 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GRVNNL1SI9Z6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012RHU1C#wasThisHelpful","R1GRVNNL1SI9Z6","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this sunscreen a lot, and  I use it on myself, and  I am well over 60 years of age.  It is initially a bit oily (it is oil based), but it rubs in and the oiliness disappears within about a minute, as does the initial white appearance that it produces.  When the tube arrived the ZnO had separated from the oil, but shaking and kneading the tube for a minute or so quickly remedied this. Likewise, I shake the tube before use to make sure that the ZnO is not separated. It is easy to tell if there has been any separation as you can hear and feel the oil in the tube if it has, and this disappears when the ZnO is properly mixed.  Note that there may be some variability in the degree to which a tube arrives with its contents completely mixed.  I have purchased three tubes and I had to mix two up, but the third arrived without any separation.  However the the tubes that I had to manually shake and kneed worked as well as the one that I did not have to do this to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0MHKH4SB7CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CDQ73K#wasThisHelpful","R1W0MHKH4SB7CI","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While George Washington is shown on the cover illustration, this book is not primarily about him.  He plays an important background role, but the book is more general in its treatment of espionage during the Revolutionary War.  The  book provides a lot of interesting reference material, and I recommend it as such to those who are seriously interested in the US Revolutionary War.  However, I would not recommend it to someone who is primarily interested in an exciting narrative history.  Rather than being a narrative history  one that tells history as a story, hopefully an engrossing story, this book is more of an outline of events with capsule biographies of participants.  The book is also quite dry and I found it very slow going.  One of the features that made this so, was the fact that the book is printed in 7 point typeface (I measured it).  Books are generally printed in 10 or 11-point typeface, which produces a lowercase letter o with a diameter of about 2mm, whereas a 7-point o is only about one mm in diameter.  The result was a typeface that was readable, but one that I could only tolerate for perhaps 30 minutes at a time.  Letters written by the characters discussed in the book were printed in 7 point italics, whose letters were the same size as the rest of the text, but the lines making up the letters were thinner, making them still more tiring to read.What is in the book The book describes the influence of spying, both by the Americans and by the British, on the conduct of Revolutionary War.  The war is described in terms of the military departments established by George Washington  the New England, Canadian, New York, Middle, Highlands, Northern, Eastern and Southern Departments.  A chapter is devoted to each department, containing an outline of the military events in that department throughout the whole war, plus short biographies of persons of interest whose live impacted the events described in that chapter, and finally ends with a brief summary of the material covered in the chapter.  I found the material to be interesting, but the presentation to be very dry.The book begins with two chapters devoted to overall intelligence operations of the American and British, followed by a chapter devoted to the command structures of the opposing forces.  These chapters are followed by a department-by-department discussion of the war and how it was impacted by intelligence operations. The last chapters are devoted to technology during the war and to codes and ciphers.  The book ends with an overall summary.I found a material in the book to be very useful, particularly the initial and final chapters that cover overall subject like how the British and American armies were organized and how technology such as the development of a primitive submarine and the use of smallpox inoculation was carried out.  The book was therefore a very useful reference book, whose utility outweighed the dry nature and small size of the text by enough for me to give the book four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWMJ2CN56R6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781813212#wasThisHelpful","R3IWMJ2CN56R6T","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an interesting history of the US between 1900 and 1920.  I read this book because I am interested in the period and not because I was forced to for a college course.  I found the book to be interesting and I learned a lot.  However, being only 376 pages long the book was of necessity a bit superficial, but I feel did a very good job of explaining the period.  The emphasis was on Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and the progressive politics of this period.  While there is a lot on the politics of the period, the political conventions, the elections and the presidencies of  Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson, the book also contains other topics such as the social changes in the period, the struggle for civil rights, womens suffrage and the home front during WWI.While an academic text the book was far from dry and was written for students as opposed to scholars (there were no footnotes or bibliography, only an extensive section of suggested further readings).  I recommend this book to students and to anyone interested in US history.  It is a great starting point and the suggested readings allow one to get much deeper into the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307Z370TAQ3GN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393956555#wasThisHelpful","R307Z370TAQ3GN","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the case of this book the lives are those of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, their wives, and several members of the populist press, primarily Sam McClure, Ida Trabell, Lincoln Steffens, Ray Stannard Baker and William Allen White. The focus of the book in on how these progressive journalist influenced Roosevelt, Taft and the nation as a whole. While the book does not contain a detailed investigation of the complete lives of all those discussed in the book, it does contain enough to give the reader a good understanding of the character of these individuals and how they interacted with each other.I highly recommend this book to all lovers of history, biography, Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and the progressive movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQG91DVQHNTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416547878#wasThisHelpful","R3HQG91DVQHNTL","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a focused biography of Theodore Roosevelt - focused on his hunting and environmental activism.  It covers the period from his birth to the end of his presidency.  The focus on his environmentalism is so great that more time is spent detailing each of his important camping and hunting trips than on events like his involvement in the Spanish-American war.  His tenure as a New York Police Commissioner is covered in about one page, whereas whole chapters are devoted to trips to Florida, Mississippi, and Texas in the quest to hunt and kill bears.  I mention this so that a potential reader is not mislead into thinking that this is a Theodore Roosevelt biography, that covers his environmental activism in addition to the rest of his accomplishments.  The book also provides thumbnail biographies important experts on birds, mammals and forests as well as hunting guides and other curious characters.I would recommend this book to people seriously interested in the US environmental activities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  I would only recommend this to people who are primarily interested in Roosevelt if they have previously read a more standard biography and if they are interested in all of the details concerning Roosevelt's camping and hunting trips, his books that discuss these trips, and his general expertise on birds and mammals.  I found the book interesting and it did supplement my understanding of Roosevelt, but after a while I became a bit numbed by the minute details that are covered.  I for one feel that the book would have been better at 400-600 pages of text instead of 800-pages.  While I read the entire book, after 500 pages I grew tired of the endless descriptions of Roosevelt's hunting trips, and his establishment of bird sanctuaries.  However, if you are seriously interested in Roosevelt's outdoors life you may find the length to be about right and not get bored by the excessive amount of detail that is provided.  If I could have, I would have rated the book at 3.5 stars, but giving it the benefit of the doubt I am giving it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPU4709OCBH3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060565314#wasThisHelpful","RPU4709OCBH3D","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say at he outset that I hold 15 patents, so I know a little about the patent process, but not enough to write a patent on my own. I wish that I had had this book when I was working and filing patents, as it would have greatly aided in the process.  This book will not teach one to become a patent lawyer or agent, as that is not its aim.  The aim, which it fulfills nicely, is to educate an engineer, scientist or inventor in general, as to the patent process, so as to enable them to understand several critical concepts concerning the possible patentability of an idea or product.  The book describes: The current First to File rule vesus the older first to invent rule. The book discusses when an idea is ready for a patent and possible bars to patentability, such as the prior disclosure on the internet or in a technical paper. The book describes the importance of record keeping. It discussed if an idea or product novel enough for a patent?

"This book details Teddy Roosevelt's reactions to WWI and his conflict with the Wilson administration over its policies.  The book is largely based on Roosevelt's speeches, letters and publications during the period, and it provides much more detail than that provided in other books.  I would recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in the Roosevelt, and the history of the US entry into WWI.  However, the casual reader who has only a general interest in these subjects may find the book a bit too focused.What is in the book:The book is chronological in its approach, starting with Roosevelt's return from the Amazon in 1914, and ending with his death in 1919.  The main points are: Roosevelt believed that Germany was the aggressor because of its invasion of Belgium.  Roosevelt understood why all the states of Europe went to war, and had Germany not invaded Belgium, in violation of treaties that they had signed, he might have wanted the US to remain neutral in spite of a his personal pro-British bias. Roosevelt was strongly opposed to Wilson's  apportioning blame for the war equally among all of the combatants, whereas Roosevelt felt that Germany's invasion of Belgium clearly made them the aggressor. He opposed Wilson peace initiatives as Wilson believed that all sides were equally at fault and Roosevelt believed that this placed the conquered Belgians on a par with their conquers, who were also guilty of war crimes. Roosevelt was opposed to Germany's use of submarine warfare as he considered it murder. Roosevelt felt that Wilson's relatively weak condemnation of early German submarine sinkings led to the sinking of the Lusitania, and that Wilson's response to the sinking of the Lusitania was completely inadequate. He felt that the US was completely unprepared for war and attacked Wilson for not gearing up for a possible US involvement. He wanted to be allowed to lead a volunteer force to supplement the soldiers who were drafted after the US entered the war, but Wilson had no intention of making Roosevelt an hero and stronger candidate in 1920. The book details Roosevelt's attacks on Wilson and on the counter attacks by the Wilson administration and the Hearst papers.  The book discuses the Wilson administration attempts of muzzle him and of Wilson's attack against a free press. The book discusses the fighting of the Roosevelt sons and of Teddy Roosevelt's death.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73W25P9V8I6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137306521#wasThisHelpful","R73W25P9V8I6J","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting and very well written  Teddy Roosevelt biography, covering his life from  birth to  death, but one that focuses on his relationship with New York City. The thesis of the book is that Roosevelt was shaped by New York City and rather than being the ""cowboy"" president, he was actually the New York City President, and was the only President who was born in, lived in, and was shaped by the city.  (His cousin Franklin was shaped more by his upstate Hudson River home, and was not as associated with New York City as was Teddy.) I enjoyed the book a lot and recommend it to anyone interested in Teddy Roosevelt, New York city and 19th century US history.What is in the book?The book does an excellent job of depicting the city during Roosevelt's life.  It discuses how the city impacted his childhood, Roosevelt's early political experiences in the New York Assembly, his time as a police commissioner and as governor.  The book also briefly discusses Roosevelt's time at Harvard, as a Rough Rider in Cuba and as president, although these parts of the book are very brief.

"This book contains all 18 chapters of Tarbells original work, but each chapter has been condensed by about half from the original, which was published in two volumes.  The History of the Standard Oil Company was a compilation of articles that appeared in McClures magazine in the early 1900s. They were instrumental in the ultimate breakup of the Standard Oil Company into its constituent parts. The book is interesting, but should be read in the context of the history of the time and of the overall biography of John D. Rockefeller. I would recommend that anyone who is seriously interested in the subject read Ron Chernows biography of Rockefeller entitled Titan. Chernow puts Tarbells work into its proper context and provides valuable information on her and on the book. For instance, Tarbells brother was a founder and officer of the Pure Oil Company, a major competitor of Standard Oil. Tarbell praises Pure Oil, but neglects to mention her family connection to it, or that she might be less than an unbiased reporter with respect to Standard Oil.Tarbell provides the complete history of Standard Oil, focusing of its railroad rebates, which she believed were instrumental in it obtaining a monopoly on the refinement in US oil in the 19th century, contributing to the business failures of many men, including her father, another fact that she neglects to mention. That Standard Oil was a monopoly is clear, as was its use of railroad rebated to lower its cost of transporting crude oil to its refineries and kerosene from the refineries to its customers. The central part of the book is Tarbells contention that such rebates were illegal as the railroads were common carriers. She neglects, however, to provide Rockefellers position that these rebates were not illegal by statute and were justified by his larger volume of shipments, which reduced the railroads costs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW5PZNLA15USI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486428214#wasThisHelpful","RW5PZNLA15USI","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is truly one of the easiest computer devices that I have ever setup.  The instructions are on the cover of the box and are all that were needed.  The setup was truly plug and play and took less than five minutes.I was anxious to use a new router because my wife is always having problems with her I-pad disconnecting from the Internet.  This router was somewhat less prone to do this than our previous one, but did not completely eliminate the problem, which I am now convinced is more of a problem with out Internet provider than any wireless connection.  So far I am very satisfied with the router, the range is good and it is working well.I have, however, two complaints, but not  serious ones.  Unlike my old  router, this one does not have an on/off switch for the WiFi, which allows me to use a hardwired Internet connection to my desktop computer, while not transmitting a WiFi signal to my laptop and I-pad.  I found this to be a feature that I sometimes used and miss.  My second complainant is more of an annoyance, than a functional problem.  This router uses a very large AC/transformer plug, which is so large that it takes up three spaces on the terminal strip that I have to use in order to plug in all my equipment.  An annoyance and one easily overcome, but annoying nonetheless.  The input to the router from the transformer plug was also a bit smaller than the one that I had been using previously, so I could not use that somewhat smaller AC/transformer plug, which output the same voltage, so I had to modify my system to accommodate this larger AC/transformer plug.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BTHTFGS0UXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U6NS5Y#wasThisHelpful","R34BTHTFGS0UXJ","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a valuable and important addition to the literature of WWII.  It is very well written, but often difficult to read because of the subject matter.  Difficult to read or not, this is an important book to read as it details the beginnings of the Holocaust.  The author's research is compelling and the story he tells is likewise compelling and extremely important.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants an important insight into the Holocaust, and Germany in WWII.The prologue of the book begins at the Nuremberg Tribunal at the end of WWII, with the presentation of evidence of one of the earliest of Nazi crimes.  The evidence was of the 1933 murder of four Jewish detainees at Dachau, as compiled by a Munich prosecutor, Joseph Hartinger, later in 1933.  This book is the story of the murders that Hartinger uncovered and his attempts to get justice for the victims.  It is the story of an extremely brave and highly principled man who was willing to stand up to what was evolving as a brutal and murderous regime.  The book is important because it shows that there were men willing to stand up to the Nazis, but that there were not enough of them. The Nazi regime was in its infancy and had enough people stood up they might have been able to avert what was to come.  The book details how Hartinger's investigation and quest for justice were derailed.  It also discusses the earliest concentration camps and the evolution of what was to become the Holocaust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZY0DX7DH82SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352913#wasThisHelpful","R1ZY0DX7DH82SG","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My seven-year-old grandson loves this Mega Blocks set.  He has been building with many Mega Blocks and Lego sets and this is a great addition to them.  This set provides instructions and pieces for eight racecars, but with some imagination one can build their own design.  This fosters the skill of following instructions and also fosters creativity.  The pieces were typical of Mega Blocks, they snapped together reasonably well, but in some cases did require considerable force.I liked the set but two features have prevented me from giving it five-stars.  The box shows a racetrack, but none is included with the set.  This was no problem for my grandson as he has built several tracks from different kits, but I feel that it is misleading to picture something on the box that does not come in the box.  All the pieces come in separate bags, but the pieces are for all of the cars, not just for a single car.  This meant that all of the bags had to be opened to build the cars, adding to the complication for the build and the mess of having to content with almost 300 pieces at the outset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCRDOI1CE5VXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J05MJTG#wasThisHelpful","RCRDOI1CE5VXM","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final book in the three-volume biography of Theodore Roosevelt by Edmond Morris.  Although it covers a somewhat less important period of Roosevelt's life, it is a worthy companion to the other two volumes. The book is well written, interesting, informative, and it held my attention. We see how Roosevelt struggled to remain relevant to the US after his presidency.  We see his decline, both physically and in terms of his ability to shape events, and we see his struggles to try to regain power and influence.The book details his trips to Africa and the Amazon and his futile attempt to gain the 1916 Republican nomination for president.  It discusses his personal life, his illnesses and decline, his reactions to WWI, to the death of his son Quentin in the war and finally there is a poignant chapter on his own death.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R2H5FZDOKMI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086YK0RU#wasThisHelpful","R2R2H5FZDOKMI3","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an oil based, 20%ZnO sunscreen.  I found that it went on with much less drag than other ZnO sunscreens that I have used.  It has a very slight scent, but it dissipated quickly and was not objectionable.  It was white out of the tube and for the first instance on the skin, but the whiteness completely disappeared when I rubbed in the sunscreen. While the oil base made the product a bit greasy when I first applied it, this disappeared within a few minutes.When the tube arrived the ZnO had separated from the oil, but shaking and kneading the tube for a minute or so quickly remedied this.  Likewise, I shake the tube before use to make sure that the ZnO is not separated.  It is easy to tell if there has been any separation as you can hear and feel the oil in the tube if it has, and this disappears when the ZnO is properly mixed.  I do question the SPF50 rating, as similar products are only SPF30. I use this for my face and I wear a hat, so I cannot tell exactly how effective the product actually is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRQMLPLURVWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNOGAQW#wasThisHelpful","R2GRQMLPLURVWH","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this kit on two levels, it was fun to operate the machines when they were built and it was very educational to build them.What I liked - the instructions were pictorial and relatively clear, but it still required patience to follow them- you can build 20 different things following the instructions and more if you choose to be creative- the remote control motors actually worked and my grandson had a lot of fun operating the things that were builtCaveats - I think that it is a bit of a stretch to put the lower age limit at 8-years of age. My eight-year old grandson worked on building these models, but it required more than a little adult help. His sister, an eleven-year-old, had no trouble building things, and only needed a bit of help when she made a mistake and had to backtrack, but this was part of the learning experience.All in all, definitely five-stars, especially for an older child, and for a younger one if you are willing to help quite a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XUMDDZQ74FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J10B4E6#wasThisHelpful","R12XUMDDZQ74FT","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE  - This bulb stopped working after 11 months of operation, whereas it was supposed  to last 23 years.  I have therefore down-rated it from five to one stars.  Also, two of eight LED bulbs of this exact type from Sylvania OSRAM failed in only 7 months, leading me to believe that either the quality control for LED bulbs is poor throughout the industry, or that the industry greatly overstates the life of the bulbs.  I do not think that their short lifetimes warrant the high prices being charged when these bulbs are not on sale.I like LED spotlight bulbs as replacements for incandescent and compact fluorescent (CF) bulbs.  LED light sources are point light sources and are excellent for a spotlight or flashlight application, but I had my doubts as to their applicability for an omni-directional bulb.  I was therefore delighted to see that this bulb has been engineered to give excellent omni-directional light of the sort that I would expect from an old fashioned incandescent bulb, or the newer CF bulbs.  The color is the equivalent of a 2700-Kelvin light source, that is to say that it gives off a warm yellow glow.  Being an LED source, the bulb contains no mercury and is therefore not the threat to the environment that a CF bulb is when it is improperly disposed of.  While LED bulbs are more expensive than CF bulbs, the fact that they will not poison the environment with mercury makes them, in my opinion, a much better replacement for the energy wasting incandescent bulb.  This bulb gives the equivalent light (800 lumens) as a 60-watt incandescent bulb, but requires only 10 watts of power.  It is heaver than the equivalent incandescent or compact fluorescent bulb, but fits into the standard A19 base used by a 60-watt bulb. The outer shell of the bulb appears to be plastic, so it may be less prone to breaking if is dropped. I RECOMMEND THESE BULBS ONLY WITH THE WARNING THAT THEY MAY NOT LAST AS LONG AS ADVERTISED. This would be a great bulb if it lived up to its advertised life.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UAEW93AXNFGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHN5476#wasThisHelpful","R2UAEW93AXNFGA","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this inflator. Note  the advertising literature states that the extension hose is optional, which made me think that it was something that you had to purchase separately, but this is fortunately NOT the case  it comes with the unit. I found that the inflator worked as advertised and had some nice design features, and I am now carrying it in my trunk.Features The inflator has a light at the tip It has a chuck design to attach to the tire valve stem. It comes with a four-inch extension air hose and attachments for inflating beach balls, etc, all of which store nicely in the handle of the inflator. The inflator comes with an unpadded bag for storage, but not being padded it does not give any protection to the unit.How did it work? Attaching the chuck directly to the valve stem was difficult, making it necessary to use the four-inch valve stem attachment. I found this extension optional only in the sense that it might be possible to inflate a tire without it, but I think that it is actually quite necessary. It was impossible for me to read the pressure gauge when I tried to connect directly to the tire valve with the chuck. I could, however, read the gauge when I used the four-inch extension, but not easily. A longer extension would have made this easier. The four-inch extension uses a screw-in connection to the valve stem, as opposed to a quick connect, so I found that I had to connect to the tire valve first and then connect the extension connection to the inflator using the chuck connection. The dial indication gives only an approximate tire inflation value, and I agree with other reviewers that the pressure drops when the inflator is turned off. I also agree, that the inflator labored to get the pressure to over about 20-25psi, but this should be good enough in a emergency get to a service station. The pressure indicator goes to 150psi, but frankly I think that this is wishful thinking on the part of the manufacturer.All in all, this is a nice unit for inflating things like snow blower tires, beach balls and a car tire in an emergency, or if the pressure is low. I have found that if a tire is completely flat, the tire might not be contacting the rim, making it necessary to jack up the car to remove the weight of the car from the tire, allowing it to contact the rim and then seal when the tire is inflated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22PKYINUITEPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MB0CTBU#wasThisHelpful","R22PKYINUITEPK","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good basic vacuum.  It lacks some of the features of more high-end machines but does a good job at vacuuming.  The vacuum is a bagless wind tunnel type machine with a HEPA filter system, with clear plastic dirt cup, with the following attributes:Pros: I would rate the vacuuming as very good, the motor was loud, but not excessively so.  There are settings for hardwood floors and four carpet heights. The capacity of the dirt cup was sufficient to vacuum a large room, and even more depending upon the amount of dirt that was collected.  Emptying the cup and replacing it on the machine was simple, but as with all machines of this type, you have to be careful when emptying the dirt cup to insure that dirt does not fall out onto the floor. The machine has a hose and wand system plus attachments for doing chairs, drapes, and hard-to-reach places on carpets, and I found these to work as well as those of any of the other vacuums that I own. The wand and all the attachments can be stored on the unit itself. The vacuum is very easy to assemble out of the box.  One needs only to remove a single screw, insert the handle, and replace the screw. Then the machine is ready to go once the dirt cup is in place and a plastic holder for the powered hand tool is popped into place (no tools required) - that is, if you want to store this attachment on the machine.Features that this basic unit lacks.  (I do not consider these as negative features, just as tradeoffs for a less expensive machine.) This vacuum lacks a ball or other pivoting device, so it is not as maneuverable as the more high-end models that have these features.  However, while not quite as maneuverable, it was maneuverable enough to get the job of vacuuming done. There is no automatic carpet height adjustment, so when you go from a hardwood floor to a carpet, or from carpets of different pile heights, you have to bend down to adjust for this.  The adjustment is done via a knob as opposed to a slider bar.  I have a much more expensive machine that has such an automatic feature, but it does not work all that well, and the beater bar does not work on some pile heights, so I do not mind the lack of an automatic adjustment. To some degree, I prefer the manual adjustment, but I do not enjoy having to bend down to make it.  If you are to use the vacuum mostly on carpets of a single pile height, then the lack of an automatic adjustment is not a problem and may be a plus. There is no automatic cord retraction system.  Many people like a cord retraction system and when they work, so do I.  However, it does add a bit of weight to the machine and is another thing that can malfunction, and when they do, you may be left with an unusable short cord or a long one with no place to rewind it on the machine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FMQASS2Q3IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRALEB6#wasThisHelpful","R4FMQASS2Q3IH","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanksgiving update - This knife was the best of all the knives that were used to carve a turkey and slice a roast beef.I am not a professional chef or a knife expert, so I am rating this knife from the standpoint of the general kitchen user, and I found the following:Pros - This knife had a nice balance and the soft grip made it easy to hold without slipping - a great plus.  This knife is great for things like slicing meat, but its 8-inch length makes it a bit cumbersome for jobs where a shorter knife might be a bit more appropriate.  However, if you want a shorter knife OXO makes a 6-inch model that except for the length is similar to this one. Reasonably sharp out of the package.  I had no problems cutting meat and soft tomatoes.Minor Concerns - This knife was extremely difficult to remove from its plastic packaging.  Ordinarily I would not even mention this, but this is dangerous when dealing with a sharp knife that has no protection inside of the plastic case, so that if you slip in removing the knife you could be severely injured. The knife does not come with a protective case or sheath.  I realize that expensive knives do not necessarily come with a sheath or protective case (except for transporting them), as it is sacrilege not to store a knife in an oak block, ready for their use.  However, this is not an expensive knife and I no longer use my oak blocks because they take up too much counter space, and I do not have a magnetic wall knife holder.  Many of my knives do come with a sheath of some sort so that you can store the knife in a draw, which is how I store them, which is fine for my purposes.  I therefore had to make a sheath out of the cardboard insert in the package that the knife came with, but I should not have had to this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M7AF4V2XFXHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13OE8#wasThisHelpful","R1M7AF4V2XFXHU","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My experience has been exactly the opposite of the one-star reviews; my machine was very loud, but had a reasonable amount of suction.  This makes me wonder if there was something wrong with the units that people complained had no suction, but were very quiet.  All in all, this unit does what it was designed to do, but is very loud.  I am quite satisfied with its performance for doing things like vacuuming my car and stairs, but the unit is definitely not a good choice if you it want primarily as a carpet cleaner, which in all fairness is not what it was primarily designed to do.Pros - Relatively light weight and easy to handle Reasonable amount of suction, but not as much as a full-size corded unit Good for specialized tasks like stair cleaning, in fact the lack of a cord makes this unit ideal for that task.  It is also good for picking up crumbs and the like. The unit comes with several attachments, all of which fit into the wand, but can also be used without it. Easy to charge and clean. The unit comes with two plastic caps that you have to snap into the charging base in order to hold two of the tools.  If you put the pet hair tool over the crevice tool you can get all three tools to fit on the charging base.  Unfortunately the only reference to these caps comes in the parts list and I only realized their utility when I read a previous review.Cons- This unit sounds more like a leaf blower than a vacuum.  There is a high-pitched whine in addition to the motor sound.  It is far and away the loudest vacuum that I own, including very powerful corded models.  The sound is so loud and objectionable that I can only use the unit with hearing protectors. This vacuum was not designed primarily as a carpet cleaner.  It does not have a beater-bar and its suction is insufficient to do a good job on carpets.  It is OK if you want to pick up some crumbs, but you will have to leave true carpet cleaning for a regular, more powerful, vacuum. All the attachments just slide onto the end of the wand.  It is a tight fit and there is no locking mechanism to ensure that they stay in place and are properly oriented.  The fit is so tight that staying in place is so far not a problem, but could be with use.  Since the tools just slide in place there is no mechanism to properly orient them, which is necessary so that the handle of the unit does not have to be held at an odd angle.  One just needs to rotate the tool to prevent this, but it is annoying to have to make this adjustment every time the unit is used, especially since the fit is so snug.  I have had to put a line-up mark of the wand and tool to simplify this task, but this should have been part of the design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6VMI48DDZZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JILGZOC#wasThisHelpful","RB6VMI48DDZZ0","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is an excellent book  well written and informative.  There is a 40-page prologue that brings the story up to 1900, so the book stands alone even though it covers only a portion of TRs life.The book shows that Roosevelt enjoyed being President, and put a stamp on it like none other since Lincoln.  Few presidents have been more active in the job, more forceful or accomplished more.  He could point to: a reaffirmation of the Monroe doctrine with his own corollary, the construction of a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, contributing to peace in Asia, and the building of a great naval fleet.

About half the book consists of these illustrations.  All of the war in covered  the naval battles as well as the land battles and events in the Caribbean and the Pacific.  The text is generally superficial with a lot of quotes from the participants.  It is not, however, a detailed analysis of the war, but mostly just of the war itself and the men who fought in it.

"This is an interesting and well-written book.  It is a highly detailed biography of the life of Cornelius Vanderbilt - how he built up his steamship and then railroad empires, and his impact on the US.  It also covers his upbringing, marriage, and family. I enjoyed the book, but at times I found the level of detail a bit overwhelming and that some judicious editing would have, for me at least, raised this from a book that I liked (4-stars) to one that I might have loved (5-stars).  I recommend this book to anyone interested in US history, biography and railroad history.What is in the book  The book is divided into three sections, each of which is subdivided into many chapters.  These sections were:1) Captain 1794-1847.  This section details the earliest years of Vanderbilts life, from his birth to middle age.  This section details his boyhood and how it shaped his life.  It discusses his early life on Staten Island and how he became a steamboat captain and then owner of steamboats. The section discusses his marriage to his first cousin Sophia and the upbringing of their 13 children.  It discusses the disappointments that he had with his younger sons, but better relations with his sons-in-law.  I enjoyed this section the most of the three as in many ways it was the most exciting and gave me the most significant view of how Vanderbilt became the legendary Vanderbilt.2) Commodore 1848 1860. This section discusses the rise from Captain Vanderbilt, the captain of steamboats, to Commodore Vanderbilt the owner of a steamboat empire.  Among other things it discusses his involvement with the transportation to California - by steamship down the Atlantic to Central America, across Central America by various means and then by steamship on the Pacific to California.  Vanderbilts preferred route was through Nicaragua, instead of Panama, and the book describes many exciting incidents that occurred as he tried, unsuccessfully, to establish this as the land part of the trip to California.  It also discusses his steamboat empire and how this raised him to be called Commodore, then the highest rank in the US Navy.  (This was an unofficial title as Vanderbilt never served in the Navy.)  This section discuses the grooming of his oldest son to succeed him and the problems with his younger sons.3) King 1861-1877.  This final section discusses Vanderbilts efforts to have the US employ his steamboats during the Civil War, and his eventual sale of his steamboats so that he could concentrate on railroads.  There is a lot of details here concerning his Harlem, Hudson and New York Central railroad lines and of his struggles to consolidate his railroad empire. This part of the book contains a lot about his struggles with men like Daniel Drew, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk and goes into detail about the Erie War.  It also discusses his second marriage, after the death of Sophia, to a woman some 45 years his junior and the ongoing problems with his son Corneil, and his growing acceptance of his oldest son William as the inheritor of not only the bulk of his estate, but as the one who was to control his vast empire on his death.  This section also discusses a lot about the 19th century stock market, and the impact of railroads on the US.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33S45M61XA8W3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400031745#wasThisHelpful","R33S45M61XA8W3","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an extremely bright bulb.  It produces 2170 Lumens of light versus only 700 for the 65-Watt equivalent LED bulb that I have also used and reviewed.  These bulbs are a bit larger in diameter than 65-Watt incandescent bulb or a 65-Watt equivalent bulb.  They have a maximum diameter of five inches versus about 3.5 inches for the 65-Watt bulbs and about 4.5 inches for a 120-Watt incandescent bulb.  I mention this because this type of bulb is generally used in a ceiling can fixture, so one should be sure to measure the can diameter to make sure that it will fit.  It easily fit into my ceiling fixture and I was greatly impressed because:1. The bulb is not only very bright but has a nice white color compared to the yellowish color of most of the other bulbs that I have.  Furthermore, the bulb does all this while consuming only 25 Watts of power.  This is a lot of light, and may be more than is required in some applications, particularly when multiple bulbs are used in close proximity, in which case I would recommend a 65-Watt equivalent LED bulb.2. The bulb has an extremely long projected life (23 years if used 3 hours/day), but there is no way to confirm this at this time.3. The bulb is dimmable, but only for some dimming systems, which are noted in the packaging.4. Like all LED bulbs, this one is instant on, unlike compact fluorescent bulbs that are initially quite dim.5. Like all LED bulbs these bulbs contain no mercury.  While compact fluorescent bulbs only contain a little mercury, the hundreds of millions of them that will end up in land fills are poisoning the environment and should never have been promoted as a replacement for incandescent bulbs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDMSFVG0CE8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3OO9YG#wasThisHelpful","R1KDMSFVG0CE8C","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an entertaining and informative book that reads like a novel.  It is a fascinating study of betrayal  betrayal of ones country and the personal betrayal of ones friends.  The betrayer was Kim Philby, perhaps the most important soviet spy and the betrayed were Nicholas Elliott, who unknowingly covered for Philby when questions were first raised about his being a spy, James J. Angleton of the CIA, Philbys wife and lastly the whole British upper-class.  The book tells of these betrayals with the skill of the novelist that the author is.  It also tells of the blindness of the British who could never believe that a man such as Philby could be a spy, in spite of the fact that in the 1930s he was openly a communist.  It also tells of the blindness and arrogance of a man like Angleton who believed that he was so smart that he could not have allowed himself to be one of Philbys important sources of information.  This is another of those stories that would be unbelievable if it were not true.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of WWII, the cold war and to those who like to read non-fiction books that are as entertaining as any work of fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176UP3F716MZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804136637#wasThisHelpful","R176UP3F716MZ7","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say that I was greatly impressed by all aspects of this bulb, namely:1. The most important characteristic of a light bulb is the amount of light it produces versus the energy it takes to produce this light.  This LED bulb produces 700 lumens, while consuming only 12 watts of power, and is sold as equivalent to a 65-watt incandescent bulb.  I used this bulb to replace a 65-watt incandescent bulb that was rated as producing 755 lumens.  However, possibly because of the difference in the color balance between the two bulbs, this LED bulb appeared brighter than the bulb it replaced, while consuming only 18% as much power.2. A second important feature of a bulb is its lifetime.  This LED bulb is rated as having a 23-year life, when used three hours a day, or a life of about 25,000 hours.  The incandescent bulb it replaced was rated at 2,000 hours.  There is no way for me to currently verify the 25,000 hour life claim, but I will modify this review if the bulb fails in very much less time than this.  I should also note that compact fluorescent (CF) bulbs are also rated as having very long lives, but in my experience the claim of long life for a ceiling spotlight CF bulb is highly overrated.  This is because of the heat generated in this type of bulb when it is used in a ceiling, base up, configuration.  It remains to be seen if the LED bulb being reviewed here will suffer from the same problem.  The CF ceiling bulbs that I have are rated for 10,000 hours versus 25,000 for this LED bulb and draw a bit more power (15-watts versus 12-watts), for a slightly greater lumen output (750 lumens versus 700 lumens), but appear no brighter.3. The bulb was dimmable as advertised.4. The packaging was impressive and laid to rest any qualms I had about having a light bulb delivered in the mail.5. The bulb was instant on, unlike the compact fluorescent (CF) bulbs that I have used.6. Unlike CF bulbs, this LED bulb contains no mercury to pollute the environment.The instant on feature and lack of mercury feature are true for all of LED type bulbs, and as such are not specific to just to the bulb being discussed here, but they are nonetheless important considerations.  I have always found the slow increase in intensity of a CF bulb to be highly annoying and one reason why I have ceased using them.  A more important reason for not using a CF bulb is that they contain mercury - a small amount to be sure, but when hundreds of millions of them end up in the landfill they pollute out water supply.  I take my dead CF bulbs back to where I purchased them for proper disposal, but I doubt that most people do likewise.I consider the governments decision to effectively ban incandescent bulbs by requiring them to meet extremely high efficiency standards. to have been a very unfortunate piece of legislation because a few years ago CF bulbs were the only reasonable replacement for the incandescent bulbs. These new LED type bulbs are competitively priced when their extremely long life is considered, and most importantly they eliminate the mercury problem.  I am very happy to see such high quality bulbs such as readily available, and hopefully they will drive CF bulbs off the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9DJVPGJ5UIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3O1U2K#wasThisHelpful","R2P9DJVPGJ5UIO","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trying to discuss the Standard Model of nuclear physics and how the Higgs particle fits into this paradigm is not an easy task.  This book did an OK job in explaining this, but not as clearly as I had hoped it would have.  I have a reasonable technical background and I have read quite a bit about the Standard Model, so I found the treatment generally clearly written, but a little sketchy as to details.  However, I suspect that someone without a technical background would find the book over their heads, even though it contains no mathematics.I found the short Epilogue to be the best part of the book and in my opinion the book would have been greatly improved if it were expanded or if there was an appendix that summarizes the Standard Model in a little more detail.  While I have rated this book four-stars, I have my reservations about how useful this book would be for a reader with little or not technical background or previous exposure to the Standard Model and I would rate it at only two or at best three-stars for that audience.What is in the book - The book treats the subject from a historical perspective, starting with the idea of symmetry and how this relates to physical laws.  While this discussion was initially very clear, it shifted into a discussion of symmetry in Group Theory, of Lie Groups, without any mention of what Group Theory is and exactly what a Lie Group is.  I think that an appendix covering this subject would have been very helpful.  I think that much of this material would be difficult at best for someone without some background in this mathematics and the physics associated with it. The book then shifts to the historical development of the Standard Model.  Since I was familiar with this material I found this to be clearly written, but sketchy, perhaps too sketchy for someone with no familiarity with this material. The final sections of the book discuss the machines that have been developed in order to investigate the atomic nucleus, culminating in the development and operation of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.  This part of the book would probably be the most interesting for someone that might have been frustrated by the mathematics and physics discussed in the rest of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WDLB4AP0Y2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199679576#wasThisHelpful","R16WDLB4AP0Y2V","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are indeed tea towels, and as such are meant to cover a teapot or dish of scones, and are not primarily to be used as absorbent dishtowels. I was thus not disappointed by the fact that they were not very absorbent or as useful as a terrycloth dishtowel - I did not expect them to be such. However, they were in my opinion only just OK as tea towels.The stripe was a dull gray and not what I would describe as more olive, as shown in the picture. Rather, the stripe looked washed out and quite dull. These towels are indeed linen, but they were quite thin and not very luxurious feeling. They came in a plastic bag and would not be very suitable as a hostess gift. The lack of a box, or nice packaging, may be due to the fact that being a Vine item they cannot be gifted. However, if you purchase these and they do not come in a box you may be disappointed by their unsuitability as a gift.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O5N2I1LT67R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3C9NS2#wasThisHelpful","R10O5N2I1LT67R","A1KJO5VP4K3CHU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KJO5VP4K3CHU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is why I found this book so distasteful:  it's a caricature of a person with an illness.  It blithely bypasses the emotional aspects of a man suffering with Asperger's.  (And yes, Autism can cause intense negative feelings, depression, and loneliness among its numbers.)  As an educator, I taught a young man with Autism.  He was nothing like Don, the protagonist in the book.  His brain was incapable of thinking like most of us and could not grasp the social nuances attributed to Don.  Even those who are mildly afflicted just don't react in ways we expect.  I know of another individual who lives in his own world and is far removed from Don, who the author would have us believe is simply a step or two from 'normal' living.  And I have watched the painful humiliation and isolation of two other children with Asperger's.  Their lives and emotional well being have been scarred by our society's rejection of them.This book is written by someone who has no understanding of the thinking, feelings, and reactions of social 'misfits'.

"Author Alice Hoffman once again succeeds (but only partially)  with her lyrical prose, giving us a vivid description of the island of St. Thomas, her pen painting it in water-colored impressionist shapes and hues. Settings are life-like, yet surreal.  The reading experience is of stepping into a painting, much like Alice through the looking glass.While plot typically is driven with events, they become minor points.  What clearly drives this story is its protagonist, Rachel.  Rachel, as a child, vexed her own mother so, that she damned her with the ages-old curse, of someday being tormented by a child like herself.  She was a dutiful daughter--to a point--but clearly, lived her life as she saw fit, defying the  tenets of her society.Hoffman's storytelling excelled for about the first half of the book.  Life on the island, its native inhabitants (slaves and freed men), and the European immigrants were fascinating.  Descriptions of people, dwellings, foods, tropical plants, politics, clothing, etiquette, customs, medicinal herbs, and travel all brought the reader into this story of historical fiction.  We saw life through Rachel's eyes.  Then, without warning, the perspective  changed.  This was no longer Rachel's story.  Hoffman brushed her aside to bring us (one assumes) the real reason she wrote her book; namely to introduce to us Jacobo Camille Pissaro, the father of Impressionism--one of her sons.  It left me feeling adrift, as if I were abandoned as the solitary inhabitant of an island, watching the ship on which I was traveling, sailing off without me. Until this moment, this was a five-star book.  Then, Rachel's other children were neatly stored away, like so much memorabilia in trunks never opened.  As Camille's presence grew, they retreated to ghostly insignificance.  Hoffman lost me here.  If her intention was to create the background story of Camille's mother, it would have been better done in the form of flashbacks, leaving him as the protagonist.  It's not that her writing style and abilities changed, it's that the focus did, and I didn't like it.  That dropped my rating to three stars.If you have enjoyed reading Hoffman's other stories (such as The Dovekeepers), you will like her thorough research, style and adroit storytelling in The Marriage of Opposites.  Just be aware of the story's sudden metamorphosis into a completely different tale.  Hence, a rating of four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231AGZY56LHX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434ELO#wasThisHelpful","R231AGZY56LHX5","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're intent on learning how to play Mah Jongg, this book is a great help.  Yes, you can learn from other players, but if you still need remedial help (I did!), get this book.  Author Elaine Sandberg writes plainly, in uncomplicated sentences.  She has organized the chapters in the best possible way for learning.  Each chapter has a summary and then a small quiz at the end.  You need to do them, as they recap what you've learned and you can determine where you need to go back and re-read.Take her advice and set-up the hands.  It will familiarize you with the various possibilities.  I took it a step further.  I set-up hands using this year's card (not the dated one she supplies at the back of her book).  Then using the method she recommends (position tiles on rack by suits and numbers first, in ascending order; then look at the card, finding which section is the most opportune one with which to play your hand), choose the hand you want to play.  I did this, but with a variation.  I asked a knowledgeable Mah Jongg friend to come over and look at the four racks I'd set-up.  I then explained to her why I chose to play the hands I'd selected.  She listened, and then either agreed, or pointed out different ways to look at the tiles and play a different hand.  Sometimes, it was within the same section, sometimes not.  Using the book and a friend's help makes the lessons even more meaningful.The most important lessons I gleaned are:  how to set-up the rack (to better select the hands); familiarize yourself with the 50 different possible hands; and (for a beginner) do not change hands mid-game.  Allowing yourself to lose only strengthens your play, by seeing a hand through to its end.  After you have gained confidence, try to switch hands if your original choice isn't working for you.Aside from Ms. Sandberg's book, the next best advice I can give you for learning is to play with kind, non-threatening players.  Seasoned, no-nonsense, cutthroat players will not be patient and you will quickly become a Mah Jongg drop-out.  My group is patient, willing to teach, and helps me to re-hash each hand I play at the end of every game.  They are encouraging, supportive, and kind.  Without them--and the book, I would have given up months ago.  Really.  So, get A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KPKXEI7I5VR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080483878X#wasThisHelpful","R2KPKXEI7I5VR1","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when home scales weighed so much you started wondering how much weight you lost just by trying to move one of them.  Finally, a light-weight scale!  It was so easy to get started; just pull the little plastic tab out of the battery compartment and youre done.  Then, simply place the scale on a hard surface (bathroom floor).  (Is there anyone who doesnt put the scale in the bathroom?)  Next, step on the scaleand moan, cry, or jump up and downnot on the scale, pleaseas your weight is revealed to you.Using the scale is as easy as walking.  Just step on it.  My only complaint is that I wish the reading appeared for a longer moment on the scale.  I sometimes have to get a second reading because I missed it the first time.This scale comes with an app that keeps track of your weight and also your BMI.  I have tried the Nuyu app and it was simple to install.  I did have to set my current weight twice for some reason.  Thereafter, it was accurate.  (I knew because I had recently been weighed at my doctors office.) Also, since I paired the scale to my smartphone, I thought it would just update my weight to the app on my phone.  It doesnt.  You must first connect to your cell phone and the nuyu appa minor annoyance.  It would be nice if the nuyu app could retain the information, but alas, you must log that in yourself elsewhere.

"If you haven't tried it, don't poo-poo Poo-Pourri Before-You-Go Toilet Spray.  This product, as its name states, is used prior to using the toilet.  It's a novel approach to de-stinking the bathroom.  Instead of covering-up odors, it traps them in the toilet--under the water--before they can become noxious smells.  The only thing it can't control is the smell with the release of gas.  But, it greatly improves the 'smell-ability' of one of the most used rooms in the house.The Juniper Woods scent (juniper, eucalyptus, citrus) really has a woodsy aroma.  If smells make you think of colors, this one would be green.  It lingers for a little while even after the toilet is flushed.I like that it doesn't have a sweet, floral fragrance.  Another plus is that it isn't a layer of odor on top of a foul one.  It actually eliminates the bad one.This is an environment-friendly product, as the manufacturer claims, ""NO harsh chemicals, aerosol, parabens, phthalates, or formaldehyde; All stink-fighting good stuff!""  I like that.The four ounces bottle states that there is enough for up to 200 uses.  I disagree; it's more. The manufacturer suggests using three to five sprays per use.  I find that two are sufficient.  That makes it cost-efficient in comparison to other odor eliminators that aren't nearly as effective.The bottle is attractive enough to leave out and it's so much smaller than an aerosol can of spray, leaving more space in the bathroom.In fact, I can find only one negative.  My bottle arrived without a bottle top.  I think that was an oversight in quality control.  And the only reason I would want a top is to be able to carry it in a purse/briefcase/suitcase.Beyond that, I really like Poo-Pourri Before-You-Go Toilet Spray.

"Author Judith Keim is new to me and I bought this book on a whim.  I alternate between 'heavy' reading and lighter stories.  This one was perfect for a fun read.  Not only is this an interesting tale, I can see it becoming a chick flick, too.Keim gives us characters with whom we can bond: a flamboyant, older woman; a middle-aged newly divorced woman, unsure of herself and her future; their daughters; and people who come into their lives.  The premise is one many of us can relate to; divorce and its aftermath.  Life for these women takes a variety of twists and that's what makes the story interesting.If you are looking for a beach read, this is perfect.  Traveling?  Need something light?  Get BREAKFAST AT THE BEACHHOUSE HOTEL.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3108UVRWQCXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YD5X6NG#wasThisHelpful","R3108UVRWQCXD","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Powerfully written, this is a tale of both a very old woman and a teenager.  They seemingly have nothing in common.  Author Christina Baker Kline weaves her chapters of the lives of both, alternating with their stories.  While we think their lives run parallel to one another, they definitely converge in a most unexpected way.Baker gives thorough character descriptions, not just of our protagonists, but the minor players, too.  She deftly paints the settings, allowing us to settle into the picture right alongside the characters.  Her use of narrative and dialogue propel the story at the perfect pace.When you want to continue reading and not be interrupted, you know the tale is a good one.  Not only that, I didn't want the story to end; I liked being in Vivian's and Molly's world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RVQTP5PMXE33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOG02#wasThisHelpful","R2RVQTP5PMXE33","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then too, the subject matter is sensitive and hard to read.Many of us will think, how could a Jewish woman marry a man who would serve in Hitler's Nazi army?

"Maybe it's the cover photo,or the publishers' hype, but we definitely couldn't judge THIS book by its cover!  If you think this is a fictional beach-read, take a pass on this book.  This is a pseudo-scientific memoir of an Ivy league Ph.D. mommy living among her case studies.Yes, author Wednesday Martin has the creds--scholastically and as a successful writer.  And yes, she attempts to provide insight into the world of the wealthy and their social practices.  And initially, it works.  But somewhere as her 'experiment' progresses, the line is blurred and the scientist becomes one of the very primates she is studying.Frankly, I thought it would be interesting to learn how the uber-wealthy live.  What I read was more reminiscent of middle school cliques:  exclusivity, snobbery, and downright meanness.  And for all of our social advances with women's equality, this group is totally dependent upon their husbands, both socially and economically.  Their children's successes become THEIR successes--the standard against which they are measured.  Can you imagine the pressures placed on them by their parents!This is the adult version of being a copycat.  Shoes, clothing, handbags, jewelry, multiple homes, elite vacations, exclusive schools, hours spent daily in body exhausting exercise and perpetual dieting.  This group subscribes to Gloria Vanderbilt's rule that a woman can never be too rich or too thin.  If this is life as a rich and powerful matron, no thanks!If the author had only used her experiences to write a fictional account of life among the Park Avenue Primates, it would have been a far more interesting read.  There are no fully developed characters--no one with whom we can bond as readers.  And, with the exception of a personal loss, not one individual has empathy.  This is a pathetically lacking group of women; socially, intellectually, and personally.  For an experienced author, Martin falls short.  Don't waste your time or your money on this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PSX3VSCYAK8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4348G0#wasThisHelpful","R1PSX3VSCYAK8Z","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an exceptionally well-made cake pan.  It has substantial weight for even baking and its darker surface allows for better browning.  The inner surface is smooth, so cakes release without tearing.  (Be sure to coat the interior with cooking spray before adding your batter.)  As with all cake pans with holes in the middle, it makes sure that the cake will bake evenly.I like the dramatic, deep swirls of this pan.  I tried to get three different flavors and looks by alternately 'striping'-in chocolate, orange, and vanilla batters.  When baked and unmolded, the chocolate was beautifully dark and different looking.  However, despite putting orange coloring into the batter (to differentiate it from the vanilla), the two tones were nearly identical.  The cake can be glazed or dusted with 10X sugar.There is only one point that doesn't please me.  When placed on a plate, the tips of the swirls (the bottom of the cake) have a sharp, jagged appearance.  It almost makes it look unfinished.  This is just my perspective and should in no way be taken as a negative about the pan.Nordic Ware is a brand you can trust.  I have had two other Nordic Ware Bundt pans for many, many years and I've always been pleased with their products.

"This book is exceptionally well-researched and documented.  It is a 'coffee-table'-sized book about the life of Abraham Lincoln, containing photos and documents you have likely never seen. Lincoln was an anomaly for his time.  He developed an acceptance and appreciation for Jews early in his life and fought to change perceptions about them early in his career and in his presidency.  He felt so strongly about including them that, he changed American thought of our being a 'Christian nation' to being 'one nation under God'.He studied the Old Testament and frequently quoted from it.  It is believed that, the story of enslavement and the eventual Exodus is responsible for his desire to end slavery in our country and to embrace all people--whites, blacks, and Jews--as equal Americans. We think of Lincoln as the president who freed the slaves, but really, there is so much more to him and to his presidency.If you have an appreciation for (authenticated) history and good writing, you will want to read LINCOLN AND THE JEWS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVR7GBC6XNHER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059534#wasThisHelpful","RVR7GBC6XNHER","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He definitely is a proponent of 'show--don't tell'.  While he gives us enough character descriptions and background information, he doesn't allow them to overwhelm the story.Jack Reacher is the protagonist whom trouble seeks.  He always finds himself in situations demanding the skills he learned as a military cop.  He's smart, clever, and uses his size to his advantage.Each story features Reacher in novel situations.  As readers, we can try to figure out motives, next moves, and outcomes, but Reacher is always steps ahead.

"Almost perfect!  Thats the HP Envy laptop in a nutshell.  It is darn near perfect.  The HP Envy is aptly named as you will be the envy of everyone once you get this laptop.  This laptop is fast, with its 2.5GHz Intel i-7 CPU and 8GB of high speed RAM.  This laptop has many more great features yet is priced reasonably at around $800.Some laptops in the $600 - $800 range skimp on the display.  The HP Envy has a 1080P high definition display that is also a very accurate touchscreen.  The display is powered by a reliable Intel HD Graphics card which will more than adequately suit your needs, from video watching to even light gaming.  So, this laptop will let you watch Netflix or Amazon, while using another screen for MS Word, and have Skype Video Chat all at once.  You can even play games that dont require expensive video cards.  If you are looking for a gaming laptop, however, then you might be disappointed.The webcam works perfectly, even in bad lighting.  Some laptops have a lag with their webcam, but the Envys has no lag and comes ready to use with free software.So many laptops on the market consider two tiny speakers a sound system.  The HP Envy will easily satisfy your inner-audiophile with its beat audio, that includes a built-in subwoofer!  How cool is that!  Im not referring to a lame, simulated subwoofer.  Its a real bonafide subwoofer in the laptop!Theres plenty of room on the Envys hard drive for your music and movies because this laptop has a terabyte hard drive.  Thats a 1000 GB!  Some other nice features are the backlight keyboard, USB 3.0, and as previously mentioned, a full HD Display which is also the best touchscreen I have ever used!Still not convinced that this is the laptop for you?  Then, lets discuss the few cons of the HP Envy.  The built-in fingerprint reader offers an easy and interesting way to login to your laptop and websites.  However, it is also a nuisance.  Your left hand will tend to turn on the fingerprint reader when you type.  I solved that by disabling the fingerprint reader.My biggest gripe with the HP Envy and many other popular laptops is that it is a complete pain to upgrade.  HP clearly does not want us to upgrade the laptop by ourselves.  The (seemingly ridiculous) amount of screws and easily damaged exterior plastic shell was a challenge to overcome to say the least.  My son, however, was not content to have me pay an authorized HP vendor to upgrade my HP Envy.  If you are insistent on upgrading your HP Envy laptop, then know it is a bumpy road to completing your goal.All in all, the HP Envy gets four-and-a-half out of five stars.  This lack of a half-star is for the difficulty in upgrading the RAM.  But this is becoming increasingly common with todays laptops.  YOU CANNOT DO BETTER at this price level.  If you are looking for a laptop that more than meets your work needs and satisfies your entertainment needs, then get the Envy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294ZUPQTTBVE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5X2ZWA#wasThisHelpful","R294ZUPQTTBVE5","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hoover Commercial CH50400 is perfect for the purpose for which it was designed; cleaning a large area of varying floor types and heights.  Please keep in mind that this is a commercial unit and the review reflects that.  This means it only reviews the vacuum as it pertains to what it can do; not what it cannot do compared to a standard residential model.  If all you need is to clean large areas of varying surfaces, then this is the vacuum for you.  That's it.  That's all it does.  It has good power, it's lightweight, and has a super long cord.  There are no lights, no hose, no attachments; just a powerful, easy-to-use vacuum.The bag is HEPA rated and disposable.  A quick search on Amazon puts replacement bags at about $4.50 each, but they are quite large and if used in a residence would need infrequent changing.  Assembly was practically non-existent; just pop the pre-assembled handle into the unit and put in one screw.  It comes with a fairly long cord that nearly allowed me to clean the whole house without switching plugs.  Longer stand alone cords can be used, but I would recommend consulting the table in the owner's manual to ensure the correct gauge is used with the vacuum to avoid any electrical issues.There are also a quick release hook for the power cord and a sturdy carrying handle.  There is a ""stair cleaning handle"" in the front of the unit down by the bottom of the bag holder, but I got a back ache just from looking at the directions which has a drawing of the person picking up the whole unit to clean each tread.  Just remember that the name says it all; Hoover Commercial.  If you need all the doodads, bells and whistles, then just pass on this.  But if you need a basic vacuum that will last a long time, then this one is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11DLKW84FA8I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","R11DLKW84FA8I1","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PowerStroke PS14133 1700PSI Electric Pressure Washer does an excellent job as a residential pressure washer.  Its directions for assembly and usage are clearly written and it's quite easy to use--for both women and men.We used it to clean mold off our sidewalk and the faux stone columns of our patio.  It cleaned dirt off the pavers and can sometimes get rid of the small weeds that grow between the stones.It's important to note that, since this operates with electric power, precautions should be taken as it also involves water.  The electric cord will probably not be long enough  to reach all the places you want to clean.  This means adding an extension cord.  The directions include the warning that, if using an extension cord, the coupling needs to be raised well above the water area to prevent electrocution.So, why does it rate four--and not five--stars?  Despite its five-star performance, we considered storage of the unit.  After all, most of the time it will be sitting in your garage or shed.  We find one fault with the PowerStroke PS14133.  The long wand sticks out, taking up more storage space.  And most of us need more--not less--storage capacity.  If it were configured more like the PS14120 (less PSI, amps, and wheel base), the wand would be stored vertically.  If it were possible to rate 4.5 stars, that would be an appropriate rating.  But since we can't, and it would be misleading to tell you it worthy of five stars, we must rate it as four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4L0BOJ21LP4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TIK5TQ8#wasThisHelpful","R4L0BOJ21LP4A","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet is my first one.  I read research by professional techies, pored over recommendations at blog sites, and asked many others what they enjoy using for a tablet.  The overwhelming response was the Apple brand.  That said, the next best choice was the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet.Since I use an Android phone and dont have Apple products, it seemed pointless to buy a Tablet that would not seamlessly sync with my other electronics.  If you are an Apple user, you would probably be wise to choose one of this brands products.I love my Samsung tablet!  It was quite easy to learn how to use it.  The size and light weight make it a pleasure to use and carry.  The color is vivid; the clarity is sharp, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600.  Samsung lets the user determine the screens brightness.  As a result, it can be used both indoors and out with ease.The sound is sharp and I find no problems with it.  Watching a movie and hearing its content is a pleasure.  There is no sense of muffled sound at all.The tablet connects to my WiFi at home.  If I take it out, I can connect via my phone.  And battery life is remarkably long lasting.  After doing emails, reading, and practicing how to use it, my battery power (after three days) is a strong 56%.I like the touch screen technology and when writing emails, it has the ability to learn my writing style; often offering words before Ive even fully typed or selected them.I initially wanted to use my tablet to take pictures while on a trip.  It has more pixels (8 front facing) than my older Canon camera.  My phone can take a comparable picture, too, as compared to the tablet.  Money had to be considered, also.  So, I had a choice; I could buy a camera or a tablet.  I opted for the tablet, choosing to take pictures with my phone.  The Samsung Galaxy allows me so much more than a camera.  I can do emails, read my Kindle books, watch movies, listen to music, play games, and write.  Yes, it would be nice to have an extremely good camera, but this was the best choice overall.Whether this is your first tablet purchase, or youre replacing one, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet is one you can select with confidence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H4XGMM39KXZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHA5G6G#wasThisHelpful","R1H4XGMM39KXZN","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Nicolle Wallace follows the axiom of writing what she knows about; and she gives us an intense, realistic, and personal look inside the White House with her new novel, MADAM PRESIDENT.  She brings the cloaked, inner workings of the presidency, the press corps, and the West Wing to readers with an intimate style.  Drawing upon her years as a White House insider, Wallaces skills and writing are at their best when shes dealing with political strategy.Wallaces protagonist is a female US president who is forced to deal with multiple acts of terrorism on American soil.  As a woman, she must be seen as a strong leaderbut not so strong as to be void of emotions and the ability to connect with the electorate.  Her professional and personal lives are constantly scrutinized by the press.  Its a delicate balancing act and President Charlotte Kramers equilibrium endures many blows.The novels best features are fast-paced plot development within a 24-hour period, and allowing readers to experience events from the perspectives of multiple key characters.  It was during these periods that the story was most enjoyable.I wish the first 30% (read on my old Kindle, so no page numbers) had been written differently.  The need to give the reader back story was solved with narrative.  This telling and not showing detracted from my overall enjoyment.  As engaging as the remainder was, it impaired my overall impression of the novel.  If Wallace did it to pare down the number of pages, then I think it was a poor choice.  Dialogue is a powerful tool to drive plot.  It would have enhancednot hamperedthe readers connecting with the characters and seamlessly allowed for back story.  Since Wallace writes realistic dialogue, she would have excelled with this aspect, too.If you have ever wondered what its like to work inside the White House, MADAM PRESIDENT paints a vivid picture.  And if youve been curious about the careers of national news correspondents and the behind-the-scenes machinations for TV broadcasts, this is the real deal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2DHWGGZVJEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1ORTK#wasThisHelpful","R1K2DHWGGZVJEA","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First-time novelist Anne A. Wilson can add me to her fan list.  If you read Lee Child, Patrick Lee, or Alex Kava, youll want to read Wilsons HOVER.  It takes a genuine Navy helicopter pilot who worked with SEALS to write with her depth of understanding and realism.Protagonist Sara Denning is a multi-faceted character.  She has a side like any one of us; with insecurities, driven to excel, and striving to make it in a mans world.  Then theres the Sara with frightening fears; so crippling they can paralyze her in the most desperate situations.  Will they destroy her career?  And what about love?  Why is she so determined to deny herself what she craves?Through Sara, Wilson vividly portrays life on a carrier.  Whether its training exercises, flying a helicopter transport, or sexism, she writes with an authentic voice.  We can almost smell the engine oil, hear the chop-chop of the helicopters blades, and feel the towering waves rocking the massive carrier.Wilson nails the components of a great story; giving us a tight plot, replete with danger and unexpected turning points.  Dialogue has a natural flow, allowing characters to tell the story with little descriptive narrative.  Written in the first person, we not only have Saras dialogue, we have her thoughts, too.  The essential back story emerges slowly, pulling readers deeper into Saras psyche.It might be easy to dismiss these characters as super-human.  But the reality is that, they exist; these are the men and women who defend our country and protect us.  And that makes HOVER all the more genuine.

When I opened the (nearly one pound) plastic tub, I found a thick, dark green mixture.  Sniffing it, I couldn't detect any one specific aroma.  I thoroughly mixed the contents and tried a small taste.  The first sensation was overwhelming saltiness, followed by a mild heat.  It was after that that I got a very small hint of ginger.If I'd known this, I wouldn't have planned our dinner around this paste.  Too late, I diluted the saltiness and added layers of flavoring: coconut milk, julienned strips of fresh ginger, and (lacking oranges, I substituted) kumquats to the chicken and noodles.  It was not a memorable meal.  I won't be using the green curry paste again. If you prefer much less salt and rely on stronger flavorings (beyond jalapeno peppers), this is probably not something you will enjoy.  Remember, your taste buds may react differently than mine, so it's not the product itself that is bad, it's just my own reaction to it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NATVO49AF8UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6EGFG#wasThisHelpful","R3NATVO49AF8UH","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an ingenious device that actually works!  Now it's possible to hit my trigger points all by myself--and the Q-Flex.This arrived yesterday and I used it twice.  This morning, for the first time in years, the trigger points on the tops of my shoulders are not rock hard. There's improvement in the scapula area, but I'll need to use the Q-Flex more to get the results I want.  So far, though, this simple product is amazing for the relief I feel.The Q-Flex is quite lightweight.  It has small, pointed 'knobs' (thumbs) at each end.  When you apply pressure with them to your trigger points they work just like someone's hand would in performing accupressure.  The foam-cushioned grip makes it easy to hold onto the Q-Flex.  To use it, you place your hands (in close proximity) on the grip, moving the 'knob' to the exact spot needing accupressure.  The brief manual explains that the pressure should not cause pain and directs how to use it.Of all the methods I've tried to relieve pain at my trigger points (short of chiropractic adjustment and deep-tissue massage), the Q-Flex is the most effective.  I plan to try it at the base of my skull (as per the manual) when a migraine is coming.If you are plagued with muscle pain in spots that you can't reach, you may want to give the Q-Flex a try.  I can see using it at home, the office, and even on long car trips.  It's light enough to pack in a suitcase, so you can take your pain reliever with you when you travel.Update:  I get cluster migraines and had the opportunity to  use the Q-Flex with them.  Unfortunately, for the first one, I waited too long and it didn't help.  The second time I tried it much earlier (onset of aura and muscle spasm).  It definitely helped to break up some of the spasm at the base of my skull.  In my opinion, this is definitely worth a try--especially if you can alleviate pain without use of medication.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OR7M9CCINMSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMWWHUG#wasThisHelpful","R2OR7M9CCINMSO","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First-time novelist Stephanie Clifford delivers a powerful story. The setting of upper-crust society is so vividly portrayed that, readers will feel as if they are peeping behind the curtains of a fantasy stage, with characters unlike any they have ever known. This world has its own set of standards regarding etiquette, dress, and social responsibility. Extreme wealthand the older the money, the betterand the right schools provide entre into the tightly guarded world of the elite.Thanks to her fathers newly acquired wealth from his law practice and her socially desperate mother, Evelyn Beegan went to the right school. Lacking old money and an illustrious genealogy prevent her from securing her place among the privileged pack. Armed with a good education, her only objective is to be welcomed into this snobbish set. Frankly, as a reader, it was difficult to sympathize with our protagonist. It is only as we waded deeper into Evelyns troubled, dirty waters that it was possible to like her. Evelyn's social swimming upstream was improbable and staying afloat was impossible. Watching her drown was fascinating.Author Clifford knows how to play with her readers emotions. She takes us from feeling distanced, to outright dislike and disgust, and finally, to acceptance of Evelyn. Clifford ably handles the parents, Barbara and Dale, too. Its no wonder that their doses of superiority and humility have not given Evelyn a sense of balance. The reader cannot help but come away with radically changed notions of who they really are.Stephanie Clifford is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard and an award-winning The New York Times reporter. She is being called the 21st centurys Edith Wharton and it is a well-deserved comparison. She writes eloquently of lives most us will only read about. Emotions, settings, and dialogue flow effortlessly. Cliffords writing peels back her characters layers, giving us interesting personalities and a story that was disappointingonly because, regrettably, it had reached its final page.One can hope that, EVERYBODY RISE is the first of many novels for Stephanie Clifford. Move over, Edith Wharton","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11W5024MXYLSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077176#wasThisHelpful","R11W5024MXYLSF","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought three of these to use in a large, enclosed room.  After reading about its use to help with allergies and asthma, I decided to give them a try.  I put tea lights into each salt pillar.  (They have been drilled out to accommodate that size candle.)  The glow they produce from within the salt pillar is very pleasing to the eye.I used them on a day that had me sneezing and wheezing from too much pollen.  I admit that I was skeptical, but figured it was worth the try.  I stayed inside the room, reading, for about a couple of hours.  To my surprise, my sinuses quieted down.  The sneezing stopped and I breathed well.Now I'm thinking that I should buy a much larger one (like the electric one in my doctor's office) for our home.Whether you want the Himalayan Lights for health reasons or simply for their beauty, they will make a good addition to your office or home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CV25XBKH8P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LZUE7Q#wasThisHelpful","R13CV25XBKH8P9","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OXO does a wonderful job of product design.  This is a name I look for repeatedly, as I know they pay attention to quality, durability, and design.This scrub brush is no exception.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the rubber grip gives your hand better traction that its inferior counterparts.  The bristles are very durable.  OXO provides lots of them, to make cleaning faster and more efficient.  I use this brush on the tiles in the shower to get rid of soap scum and mold.  It also makes fast work of cleaning around toilet bases, too.It's nice to know that, in the age of shoddily-made throwaways, OXO is the exception.

"The smaller width of the brush allows you to concentrate on a much narrower surface than a broader scrub brush.  To that extent, it does the job quite well.  The plastic bristles are fairly long, placed close together and are far stiffer than a typical scrub brush.I was thinking this brush would be more along the lines of our stiff bristled BBQ brush with its metal bristles.  But, using that on tile and grout would damage their surfaces. ( I guess bleach and elbow grease, along with this brush are what's needed.)  While definitely better than using an old toothbrush, this isn't quite what I'm looking for, to really clean white grout and restore it to its original shade.  However, it certainly helped to lighten the darkened grout.If you need to clean a small number of tiles and/or their grout lines within a larger area, this will work. Be aware that, if you have large hands or plan to use it for more than a few minutes, it could use a better design.  A broader handle for gripping would make its use easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1E0YY3886QF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KDCLVI#wasThisHelpful","R1F1E0YY3886QF","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour with confidence, as I have used other products from this company and liked them.  Let me tell you why I bought it.  I wanted to make a pastry (almond crescents/horns) that requires one pound of almond paste.  At my local supermarket this sells for nearly $1/ounce--far too costly!  I looked at Amazon's price and determined that I could make almond paste for less than half that price.The box came well-packaged and swiftly with Amazon Prime delivery.  I made two pounds of almond paste from just one bag of almond flour and will freeze the second pound for making marzipan.  The remaining three bags are stored in freezer bags in my freezer and will eventually be used in pie crusts, cookies, etc.The almond flour blended perfectly with the other ingredients and produced an excellent paste.  The quality was very good; there were no dark spots (from almond skins), the flour had no lumps and appeared to be fresh.This is a brand you can rely on and I do--again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GT0R6L8KMVFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EDG598#wasThisHelpful","R3GT0R6L8KMVFE","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miracle Gro is a name that's trusted for quality gardening products.  So, I was willing to give this hose a try.  I am not disappointed.  The hose is fairly lightweight for its 50 feet.  The brass coupling is superior to those that offer similar hoses with plastic couplings and are more reliable to last over an extended period of time.  (I live in a zone with months of heat and high humidity; only time will tell.)I have used this hose to water potted plants and wash windows.  It performs well.  I did not turn on the faucet to full pressure, nor did I use the hose with a pressure attachment.  I don't know how well it would last if these are important criteria to you.Over the course of many months, I will be better able to give you a fair assessment of its usefulness and longevity.  Since it is well-made, light in weight, contracts compactly, and capably transfers water from the faucet through the hose, it rates five stars.  I can only hope it lives up to the Miracle Gro name.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OWENINZHCIOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6N9KI4#wasThisHelpful","R3OWENINZHCIOC","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you believe in the aphorism that with age comes wisdom, then please take advantage of my decades of cleaning expertise.  I'll eliminate all other methods except the two most modern ones; Bissell steam mop and the new Hoover Cordless Floormate BH55100.If we rate each method based on: Convenience Ease-of-Use Time-on-Task Supplies Needed Floors Dryness Floors Cleanlinessthen the only two reasonable methods remaining are the steam mop and the Hoover Cordless Floormate.  Lets compare them (below).Steam Mop  Bissell Cordless Floormate BH55100Has electric cordEasy-to-use, small head gets into smaller, narrow spacesAmount of time is about the sameWater only is neededTakes less time to dry, as the steamGets floor very clean and sanitized with steamFloor pads must be washedHoover Cordless Floormate BH 55100Has battery with about 3 hours charging time Larger head that is limited in small/tight areas  (ex:  behind toilet)Amount of time is about the sameOutstanding job of removing waterWater and a floor cleaning solution are neededGets floor very cleanEmpty dirty water container into sinkIf you have mostly open spaces with very few tight ones, this is a fabulous way to clean your floors.  For the few spaces where the head can't reach, it's worth the convenience of this little gem to do those others with a different method.The battery operation allows this floor cleaner to work hard for a half-hour.  It takes at least 30 minutes of charging time to get the battery capable of another several minutes' worth of cleaning.  For a full re-charge, the battery took 1 1/2 hours.  Should you have a large home with bare floors, you won't be able to finish without re-charging.  (I called Cusomer Service to see if it is possible to buy an additional battery.  I was told that it costs $99.  That's a prohibitive amount for a small convenience.  I bought a second battery for my Eureka stick vacuum and that's why I asked.) The charger has lights that tell you how much the battery has charged; with three lights indicating it's fully charged.  At that point, the light goes out altogether and you know you have 30 minutes of cleaning time for your battery.  When I received my Hoover Cordless Floormate, I anticipated it would need three hours to charge.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it required only a half-hour, as it arrived with a partially charged battery.  After depleting the battery's charge, I put it on the charger at 3:00 pm.  It took 30 minutes for one (of the three) lights to appear.  At 4:25 pm, there were two lights and when I returned home at 5:30 pm, there were no lights showing, indicating that the battery was fully charged.Additional Comments:  In addition to emptying the dirty water, you will occasionally need a new filter--a small nuisance in return for a very wonderful  floor cleaning machine.  The handle folds down to make storage easier.  The battery and charger need to always be kept plugged-in for instant use.  The weight of the Floormate is about 12 pounds and it has a plastic casing body.  I purposely cleaned a room without vacuuming first--not a good idea.  Dirt and hair then had to be carefully removed from the plastic bristles of the brushes.  Always operate your Hoover Cordless Floormate after the floors have been vacuumed.The packaging for this item was superb, maybe overkill.  The Floormate was in its factory box, placed within a protective box and was then packed into an even larger box with packing materials to make it airtight.  Short of being crushed, nothing could harm it. I received my Hoover Cordless Floormate as an Amazon  review item.  There was a note attached from Zach, the team leader of the group that developed this product.  He asked for feedback.  Here goes:  Zach, I really like your invention--a great product!  Our family will enjoy using it, as it makes our floor cleaning easier.  I have a request; can you make a very small (additonal) head that cleans in very tight, narrow spaces, too?","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGL3ZJ0L1M9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU3JG#wasThisHelpful","REGL3ZJ0L1M9E","A7YMD8MSOBO1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7YMD8MSOBO1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anita Diamant's RED TENT made me a fan of her work.  THE BOSTON GIRL is very different, but very good.  It's told in the first person; a grandmother being interviewed by her granddaughter for an assignment.  It took a little while to settle into Addie's (grandmother) story-telling, but once into it, I had to read it to the end.I dislike spoilers and re-hashing synopses within reviews.  I'll just say that Diamant shows us that, despite generational distances, we all share the same experiences while growing up:  our siblings' very different personalities, parenting styles, dreams for our futures, first loves, regrets, and wisdom that comes with age and simply living. This is a story all of us can relate to.  As a matter of fact, if you're a member of a multi-generational family, share this story with them.

"This book is a dog; as in ""Where, oh where, has my Jack Reacher gone?""  Seriously, this is the first Jack Reacher book that hasn't kept me turning pages until the end.  Come on, Lee Child, I've been a big fan until now!The lead female character is Casey--Ms. Nice.  (Really? ""Nice""?  Aw, c'mon!)  The author portrays her as childish, anxiety-riddled, a buffoon versus our super-hero, Jack Reacher.  In previous novels, Reacher was a hero because he was believable.  Impossible situations and quirky habits made each story engrossing and engaging.  In this story, we've been presented with a caricature and that's where Lee Child has let us down.I often read reviews prior to selecting a book, but found the Jack Reacher series such an enjoyable escape that, it wasn't necessary to seek professional opinions.

"I tried to conduct a simple experiment using Dr. Brandt's Do Not Age product.  I applied it twice daily to only one side of my face and neck.  To the other side, I stuck to my daily regimen of Clinique's moisturizer.  To be fair, I asked my husband and friends if they saw any difference between the sides of my face (specifically skin smoothness and small lines).  No one could discern any visible differences.  Maybe it was the fact that, I already use moisturizer and my skin wasn't dry.  Or, that my moisturizer already was handling the softening of tiny lines.  Perhaps it's not that this product doesn't do its job, it's simply that on skin already cared for, there is less improvement to see.Frankly, I think my moisturizer is doing a fine job and have no reason to switch to this product.

"I take a lot of wildlife photos (frequently with a telephoto lens) and many times it is impractical to carry a tripod into the woods on a hike and this monopod solves helps the problem in a number of ways.- It extends and locks anywhere from its collapsed length of 21 all the way up to 72 (higher than a standard tripod) and this makes it so much easier to use the cameras viewfinder and focus without bending or hunching down to camera level on a standard tripod.- The quick release head securely locks the camera into the monopod. Its easy and fast to break out the monopod, extend it, and snap the camera into the mount if the subject youre looking at might move away.- The 4-section leg is STURDY. I can extend the sections to make up any length I want and the locking mechanisms are strong.- At 10-ounces its incredibly light.AND HERES WHAT ELSE IT DOES: because the monopod has a cushioned grip and a wrist loop and the leg is so strong and rigid, I can easily use the monopod as a hiking stick.

"With goats and chickens this is a good tool for barn cleanup and I can even scrape the tough stuff off the floor. The blade is only about 12 wide but lets me use more pressure when I have to scrape. The 48 handle is long enough to easily get under roosts.The shovel is a little heavy to pick up and toss stuff into a cart and because theres no real grip on it, it can be a little awkward to use. Ive taped up parts of it with friction tape and this helps a lot - either way, its a very, very handy scoop and shovel and I use it almost daily.I have a number of Truper tools.

"Ive been using these rolls to seal moving boxes and cardboard shipping cartons and this tape is excellent for these jobs. The tape adhesive grabs immediately and the tape doesnt loosen or peel even under high humidity conditions. The tape itself is incredibly STRONG and doesnt break. I can start to seal a carton, pull the tape tight and lay it down and it lays down perfectly flat and tight. The tape will never come off that box. Because the tape is so strong, I only have to tape one layer on a box flap instead of taping it two or three times (like with some other bargain tapes Ive used).  This makes it very economical.I usually use these in a hand-held dispenser and if the end of the tape ever gets loose and sticks back on the roll its no problem to peel it off and start over  no more shredding and wasting tape trying to get it off the roll.I buy these rolls at a local big box store.

"This is a simple, rugged, handsome watch and I love it. Ive worn this watch daily for about 25 years now and it still works perfectly and still looks good. I wear it when working and when Im all suited up for a dressy event. The dial is high-contrast white on black and its luminescent. It is not a watch for a space cadet and I do not need split-second countdown timers or a tachometer on my wrist when all I want to do is see the accurate time when I need it.I do not care for, or use, the perpetual date calendar because it's manual and I always forget to reset it when the months change to 28, 30, or 31 days. In twenty five years a small pin-headed sized piece of the white coating on the hour hand has flaked off but it is of no consequence. The woven fabric band is plain and simple - and Ive worn out one and am on my second band in a quarter century. Battery life is extremely long and I think Ive changed batteries every eight years.Overall, this is the only watch you will ever need.

"I use these bulbs in two table lamps and so far they have been acceptable. The light is bright and comfortable and the color is not a harsh white. They dont create an interfering buzzing noise in a nearby AM radio as some other LED bulbs have done.There are a couple of negatives about them:- After it has been on for a while, the main part of the bulb itself remains cool but the plastic insulated bottom gets very hot to the touch. This is not good for an LED bulb. This also means it can be used only in a base-down position. I would not use these in a desk lamp or ceiling fixture because they may cause problems with the socket and the bulb itself.- There is a warning not to use these bulbs with a timer. Occasionally I must use a timer on some lights so this is a disappointment.

"I love this grater. I bought this from Amazon years ago and Ive used it at least once a week since then  and its still as sharp and easy to use as it was in the beginning.  Its easy to use and if I have problems with an exceedingly hard cheese like Pecorino Romano, I just brace the end of the microplane on the counter top and grate away. The result is a fine, thin grating that makes the cheese easier to use in baking recipes or pasta.Grating ginger is a snap if the ginger is first hard frozen.  Garlic can be a little messy  it grates as a paste than anything else, but its still good! Zesting oranges or lemons is easy and takes only a couple of seconds.Though the blades are sharp, cleanup is simple and easy. Clean the grate side with a soapy sponge by wiping up along the blades NOT down and across them.

"Just about all TOBS shaving creams are top-notch and this rose scented shaving cream is one of the best.  Like all the other TOBS creams just a small dab on a wet brush is enough to fully lather up for a full shave. It sets up the whiskers and lets you get a smooth, close shave without having to go over the same patches of skin more than once.There are emollients and softeners in the cream so theres no harshness or sting after you shave. The rose scent is very pleasant while you shave but rinses off when you are finish and you are scent-free.  The cream itself doesnt clog the razor and easily rinses completely off. It is a little thicker than the other TOBS shaving creams and needs just a little more hot water on the brush to make a good, creamy lather.This is one of the best shaving creams available.

"An excellent electric blanket and its much more convenient than the smart blankets that just warm you around your body.  The bed is actually WARM when you get into it on a cold night! The blanket itself is light but has a thick plush pile that is very, very soft and comfortable to the touch. Its nice to have a good warm blanket and coverlet in the winter instead of having to use a large comforter or quilt.The twin controllers each regulate the heat on either side of the blanket so that I can keep the heat setting comfortably high on my side and my wife can keep it comfortably low on her side.  With 20 heat settings its easy to set a precise comfortable heat. And the pre-heat setting actually works (unlike some other blankets weve used) and warms the bed for 30 minutes before reverting to the setting I like to use.Over the years weve tried several other brands of electric blankets and most of them were pretty good but failed after a season or two and certainly werent as warm as this one.

"I mainly use this for two tasks: to strip paint with high heat and to seal shrink-wrap on jars of honey with low heat and with the variable heat setting it works extremely well on both.  It's sturdy and lightweight.Stripping layers of paint is pretty simple. I fan the gun back and forth on a high temp setting and scrape away.  The gun isn't heavy and there is no fatigue after using it for long periods.Sealing corked bottles of honey with shrink-wrap is also simple on a low to mid heat setting and I can do 25 bottles a minute with no problem. The temperature is stable and delicate shrink-wrap heats and tightens very quickly with no damage.When setting it on its back for hands-free operation the gun is solid and secure and there's no fear of it falling over.

You can work with it and just lay it down on the table when you have to.Over the years this is the third heat gun I've bought and so far it's the best one. It's the usual Porter-Cable good quality.

"I've been using a Garmin GPS system for years and finally bought this one because of the free lifetime map upgrades.  It's much better than my previous nvi 265W.  The display is larger, the recalculations are much faster, and there is more optional detail displayed as far as conveniences on the road (restaurants, rest stops, ATMs, etc) and that makes a BIG difference to me when traveling.Maps load faster and upcoming turns display in a much clearer manner - my previous GPS was confusing sometimes when an upcoming turn suddenly appeared on the map and I was already halfway past it. Frustrating!  This model doesn't do that and the map turns are prominent and display well ahead of time.Battery life is much longer and using it as a hand-held lasts for a couple of hours - with my previous GPS I was lucky if it lasted 30 minutes before the battery drained.The one thing I don't like is the semi-permanent ball mount.  It's inconvenient and difficult to remove the unit from the ball mount when it's attached to the windshield glass (I remove it from sight when I park since I don't want it to tempt a thief).  The old unit had a snap-in frame that was simple and easy to use. I wish they had kept the same design for this one.So, overall, this is a very good GPS indeed.

"This is sort of a good book to introduce shortwave listening to new listeners, and the introductory chapters are well done.  The ""Getting Started"" chapter by Ken Reitz was originally published in 2002 but the basic ideas and techniques described still hold.Some of the band descriptions are outdated - the ""tropical"" bands are pretty much dead now and the 40-41 meter broadcasters have long since moved on to other bands and there is no ""mess"" on those frequencies. There are nice intros to utility and digital monitoring and a handy chart of service allocations right up to 30 MHz.  Even though this is the Summer 2015 edition, there are a number of references to the winter edition and I can only attribute this to sloppy or lazy editing.The general guide lists shortwave broadcasts by time slots from midnight to midnight with no separate listings breaking out region or country. With computerized listings it would have been simple for the editors to sort out and create separate listings by language, target area, and country and this lack makes it a little more difficult than necessary for the user to find certain broadcasts.Probably the handiest part of the book is the Internet Resource Guide which gives the URLs of a LOT of shortwave broadcasters and this may be the very best way for shortwave listeners to find broadcast schedules of the countries they want to hear.Generally speaking, despite some outdated information this is a decent introduction to shortwave listening but should not be considered the very best information available.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R264J21GBVWNXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8BIF0K#wasThisHelpful","R264J21GBVWNXB","A28X0LT2100RL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28X0LT2100RL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always read Renata Adler because she writes the truth. This is a good collection that has some of the best articles she has written and even though some of them go back as far as the 1970s, they always seem fresh. Her writing on the Selma march is one of the best accounts written; her letter from the Six-Day War is fascinating and gives new insights; her justifiable evisceration of the New York Times in ""The Porch Overlooks No Such Thing"" is brilliant.Only one article has always given me pause and that is ""A Court of No Appeal"" in which she takes down Judge John Sirica among others. Ms. Adler has a law degree. I don't believe she has actually practiced law but the case she makes against Sirica seems to be circumstantial at best and she makes a lot of assumptions. If she was a lawyer in a courtroom and was presented with this case from the other side I'd bet that she would dismantle it with ease.Anyway, it is great fun to see her eviscerate, dismantle, and puncture those who deserve to be eviscerated, dismantled, and punctured and there's plenty of that here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FMH3HD63HF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PBE2Y#wasThisHelpful","R10FMH3HD63HF7","A28X0LT2100RL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28X0LT2100RL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I looked closely at it before sending it off and I was impressed with the very careful editing that was done: the heart of the story is intact and a young reader will easily understand the plot and recognize the beauty of the story. It will probably inspire her to read the play itself.The illustrations are very well done - nothing cartoonish about them. My only criticism is that a number of the panels are printed in darker-hued inks than necessary and visually detract from the story.

The Velcro strap is long enough to attach around the top of a hiking stick, a backpack, or button hole, or even a dog's collar (but I don't recommend attaching it to clothing because it doesn't hang free and isn't very effective).In bear country sometimes more than a little noise is needed, so when we are hiking or walking the woods with more than one person, we all have a bear bell (sometimes I will attach two bells to a hiking stick).

"We've owned Keurigs all the way from the first B40 through the K75 Platinum. The most reliable was the old, original B40 but they don't make them anymore. Well, after the second expensive K75 bit the dust within three years and only Keurig 2.0 machines were available I was just about to give up with Keurig and go back to my reliable Cuisinart Brew Central when I came across this obsolete K45 in a hardware store.  It was the only one available and was high on a shelf in a dusty box. It was discounted and I bought it because it's the closest thing to the rugged old B40.It does not have all the bells and whistles of the later models. It has no on timer but does have an automatic 2-hour shut off option. It comes with a charcoal filter kit but I don't use it and use a Brita pitcher instead (since the 48-ounce reservoir isn't particularly big I would rather use the space for water instead of taking up room with a filter).  When first I turn it on in the morning the water heats up within 30 seconds and is ready to brew and it makes a nice cup of coffee.BIG BONUS: Unlike the terrible Keurig 2.0 machines, this one actually takes reusable and refillable baskets like My K-Cup so you can use your own ground coffee instead of a K-Cup.Prices vary tremendously, so shop around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZM7VKM8MNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ9NIO0#wasThisHelpful","R3QZM7VKM8MNX","A28X0LT2100RL1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A28X0LT2100RL1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The little cape fastens to the back of the shoulders with two small buttons and its the right length so it wont interfere with movement or diaper changing.Minor quibble: it needs an additional snap at the center of the crotch. The gap is too large and the diaper can visibly hang down through it.I gave this to the parents of an 18-month old baby who went into the hospital for multiple surgical procedures on the same day(!) and he wore it when he came home.

They require a LOT of adjustment by moving the glass body up and down on the clip before it even starts to work - and then it works poorly.

"Susanne Alleyn nails it with this book. She's an experienced, published author of historical novels and has little tolerance for the sloppy research and writing many HF authors inflict on us. She points out the more egregious errors typically found in many these novels (clothing, anachronisms, hygiene, daily life, and especially the misinformation spread about the French Revolution).No, underpants as such weren't worn by everyone and she explains why; potatoes weren't eaten in 7th century Europe, and neither were avocados, beans, and chilies.  She has a pretty detailed chapter on the use of English titles which is sort of interesting to a casual reader, but contains vital information for an HF author.Her basic lessons can be summed up: check your facts and then check them again. Use PRIMARY sources. Never depend on other historical novels or movies. Never ASSSUME something was true ""then"" because it's true now. In fact, never assume anything.By pointing out a lot of the mistakes made by HF authors she provides tons of fascinating detail about life in past times going all the way back to the Romans.

Hormones and teenage angst appear to be missing.But the story moves kind of slow with a number of repeat scenes.  Ive read over 1000 urban fantasy or paranormal books and in order for them to be believable, the non-paranormal stuff must ring true.  That wasnt always the case when it comes to the conversations and how different things are dealt with.  Were told that they love each other and show it with words and actions, but I never felt it.Overall its a decent read and I could easily see younger readers enjoying the romance and family closeness angles, because boy, wouldnt that be great to experience?","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLATPDFVYZT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615591736#wasThisHelpful","R1SLATPDFVYZT7","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Juliet had worked her way through college at the Java Jive, along with the owners son, her best friend, Pete. Now, at the age of thirty shes accepted the position of manager at the coffee shop that Pete now owns after having to close her own in another town when her fianc, a co-owner of her shop, wiped out the accounts and stole everything from their apartment. The staff doesnt like the idea of someone new taking over and that night, after find a body in a dumpster after hours, shes the lead person of interest in his murder.Similar to the writings of Janet Evanovich? There is quite a bit of humor, often at others' expense, but most of it is more subtle. There is one laugh out loud scene, though, that I dont think Ill ever forget.Juliet feels she needs to find the killer herself or shell be arrested and of course she doesnt have any experience in doing so. She and Pete find themselves in some interesting situations. There are two other characters that could be somewhat compared to the Stephanie Plum series. Both are interesting and one is a hoot.The story had a slow start and for a chunk of it I would have just said the story was okay. Then things started to pick up and I was really enjoying it. I thought the mystery was well done with the twists and some red herrings. I was surprised at the who and why. There is sex but its PG with nothing explicit using more of a fade to black technique and picking up the story afterward.Other than Juliet, we learn the most about Pete. No real in depth on any of the other characters and there is definitely one that I believe a lot of readers will want to get to know better.An ARC of the book was provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a review. I liked this well enough to pick up the first book in the authors Lizzie Hart series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7YGLG35MG88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOYNDKK#wasThisHelpful","RF7YGLG35MG88","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somewhat similar to the Kate Daniels series in that Serafina Dering works for a guild fighting monsters for very little money while needing to hide her magic.  In her case its because the Magic Council determined long ago that those with Dragon Born magic are too powerful to allow to live; its an automatic death sentence.She comes to the attention of Kai Drachenburg, a powerful mage that heads up one of the larger families when shes able to stop a mage from breaking into one of his buildings, and hes very interested.  Hes also a dragon shifter and a member of the Magic Council.The overall series could be considered a romance, although its just starting in this book as she keeps putting space between them, fearing both the discovery of what she is.  But shes definitely drawn to both him and has magic.I liked Sera, the situations, plenty of action and her non-magical abilities.  If I hadnt read Magic Edge firstAlexs storyI would have been more upset with Kais actions when it comes to getting to know her.  Hes definitely an uber alpha that gets away with doing things that no one dares call him on.  But having the male lead do something huge for the heroine to object to and use that as a reason to keep her distance from him, was done in both books.  It is obvious that Kai has her best interest at heart and shes not afraid to call him out on what she sees as unacceptable behavior.This was read via KindleUnlimited.  Im happy that I picked it up and look forward to the next release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PJB2PIFPFQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01676FS5C#wasThisHelpful","R20PJB2PIFPFQ5","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alex hunts supernatural monsters that either break the laws or hurt others.  Shes been in Zurich for the last 2 months to do so, having been hired by an incredibly old mage.  Alex has spent her life hiding her magicshed be killed outright if anyone knew what she isbut an assassin who is attracted to her is seeing more than he should.  They team up together when a group of magic haters called the Convictionites have a plan to wipe out all supernaturals.Ive never read this author before, but I picked this book up via Kindle Unlimited and really liked it, finding the type of book that you just absorb in one sitting.  We dont know a great deal about either of the two main characters, and as it turns out, they dont know everything about themselves either.  So were learning as we go.  But what we do know is interesting.Alex is both stubborn and uses sarcasm when shes scared or wants to change the subject.  She physically trains hard for stamina and her ability to use her sword and knives; rarely using magic as she doesnt want folks to know she has any.  Logan, the assassin known as The Slayer, is quite capable and has been watching Alex for awhile and is both drawn to and intrigued by her.  He wants nothing more than to partner with her.  Expect some fairly G-rated lust in the form of getting lost when kissing.The story starts off in the middle of an action scene and I was sucked right in.  The story obviously continues and we get an idea of the next threat theyll face.  But it doesnt have the feel of a cliffhanger.One thing that surprised me is that at no point did I feel like the story was set in another country, even though its in Switzerland.  That can be taken as either good or bad.  I was also surprised at the lack of editing errors.Ive just downloaded Serafinas first book and cant wait to get started.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3JQEK229I6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WNZI78#wasThisHelpful","RP3JQEK229I6N","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Second book in the series taking place about 6 months after the action in the first one.  Dina needs guests; its been awhile.  Not only does she need the money, but the inn requires the energy from guests.  So shes both surprised and alarmed when an arbitrator wants to hold a summit at the inn, hoping to get three warring factions to agree to peace.  Hes already been turned down by all of the other inns because the risk is too high for the reputation of the inn when youve got guests trying to kill each other.  This will either make her or break her.Two characters coming to the summit are people weve met before.  Arland, the vampire who is interested in her, and the Merchant she often deals with off-world, Nuan Cee.  And we pick up a new interesting character when she realizes she needs a chef to feed her 40 guests.I really like Dina.  The woman knows what she needs to do and she doesnt let people get away with stuff.  Shes not afraid to throw her weight around, especially when people show disrespect.  And we end up with a mystery and a no-win situation to figure out and overcome.But my favorite character isnt a character at all, but the house.  Who wouldnt want a house like that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZ772XWI7NB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WQUTTM#wasThisHelpful","RQZ772XWI7NB4","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part paranormal and part science fiction.  A ghost hunter and her team are approached by a man when he needs her help at the Winchester House, renowned for the number of ghosts it has and the purposely difficult layout that requires a guide to get through it.  Garrie needs some excitement and decides the team is going.  Little does she know that this sexy guy with the scary vibes is a bounty hunter from another world and what shes needed for is, in essence, to save her own world.The story is told from three points of view.  The main one is Garrie, or Lisa McGarrity, who as we are reminded of often, is a small person with a whole lot of power.  Exactly what Garrie does with ghosts isnt quite clear.  We do see two or three captured, but what happens to them from there?  Other than that, we see her talking to, attempting to negotiate with them or use her power to push them back when they become unruly.Trevaar is the off-world bounty hunter who in order to keep Garrie safe from the notice of a council on his world who would be very interested in her abilities, is keeping a whole lot of secrets from her.  The only thing we know about his past is told from the point of view of Nevahn, his grandfather who raised him once his daughter died.  This is done via scattered chapters and you dont realize if its the past or present until quite a ways into each of those chapters.The third voice is the most entertaining, although Sklayne, another off-world entity who often takes form as a cat, is somewhat difficult to follow at first.  The fact that hes not from around here and doesnt think like a human is showcased by very different thought and speech patterns.  But you soon get used to it.I like the idea of the storyline and the different threats that were faced, but there were just too many places where I didnt know what was going on.  Some of it is explained later.  Some of those flow okay from there but others are rather jarring, especially when the scene changes between one paragraph and the next.  And for much of it I was never really clear on what Garrie was doing when using her abilities.It took effort to keep reading and it did get somewhat easier about a quarter of the way in.  It especially got more interesting in the last quarter.  There is a love interest that is just beginning to take hold and I liked how that was being handled.  But it never really sucked me in and it was too easy to set aside a number of times.A copy was provided by the publisher to read in exchange for a review via LibraryThing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9ZPCHNKFBW15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VP2WC8#wasThisHelpful","R9ZPCHNKFBW15","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The need to stop Luciana, the witchs coven leader, becomes more critical than ever, and the stakes are raised for not only the werewolves, but for humans as well.The first part of the story overlaps the last book somewhat when it comes to whats going on with Raphael and the need to get him as close to Claudia as possible while she searches for a cure for him.We get action and a number of new situations in this storywhich I enjoyedbut I have to say the first half of the book was difficult for me to get through. Tessa has a lot of good reasons for her angsty thoughts and feelings, but it was really becoming a drag to read. But things really start to pick up and/or get more interesting around the halfway mark.I find the story arc interesting and like many of the characters, especially Tessa. Shes only been a werewolf for a couple of months and known shes a bruja for about the same length of time, yet shes more powerful than many. And her experiences as a human save the werewolves more than once.Id give this higher marks if the first half of the book hadnt dragged so much.

"I dont have bunions.  My problem is that my little toes curl in and the knuckle on one of them rubs against the side of my shoe.  So instead of pulling this down completely over my toe, I barely slide it down and it provides the layer of padding that prevents a sore.You cant just slide your socks on like normal when wearing it this way.  Youve got to put your sock on like youd put on nylons, pretty much rolling the sock down from the toes in order to keep the guard in place.  Other than the first time I tried this, I havent had an issue with it moving in the months Ive been wearing it since then.If the rubbing you are experiencing is due to the shoes being too tight, well this isnt going to help.

"Were back to being focused on Lily and Rule, but also with the point of view of an interesting new charactera touch sensitivethat not only sets the stage but fills in a great deal of information regarding a high-ranking conspiracy.  This one is set on the East Coast.  Mika, the dragon that sucks up the excess magic in the Washington DC area has gone missing.  Sam, the black dragon close to the Nokolai territory that has been teaching Lily mindspeak, has her go to Whisper, OH without telling her why; and Rule must stay behind with Rueben.  And thats when the conspiracy starts to unfold.Once again the world building, as well as the twists and intricate details of this mystery and how things work are incredible.  This type of thing with the theory on magic has blown me away since the first book.  This takes magical theory in a new direction.  Plenty of action, tension and emotion along with a lot of details on not only magical theory and the conspiracy, but on the investigative process that pulls it all together.  Ok, sometimes all of these details can get pretty deep, but the author is good at changing the course of the conversation or thoughts enough to prevent those details from becoming overwhelming.If you've been reading this series, you'll find this one difficult to set aside for a time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38JO3U0T12M85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263878#wasThisHelpful","R38JO3U0T12M85","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used these type of bottles for years.  The only thing different about this one is that the round sponge covers a larger area at once.  I mail out a lot of envelopes and find this easy to use.  Just turn the bottle upside down and squeeze over a plant, garbage can or sink until a few drips of water comes out.  You shouldn't need to squeeze the bottle again.  With that first envelope you might have to go back and for a few times to get the entire flap and sponge moist.  But after that, with each stroke of the sponge across the envelope you are also re-wetting the sponge.I'd give this a higher rating if you could replace the sponge heads (they will wear down) instead of purchasing a new bottle every time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYFT34VG2S6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HQ1578#wasThisHelpful","RZYFT34VG2S6C","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Half Moon Hollow with many of the characters weve already come to know, Libby, a widow with a soon-to-be 6 year old son, is dying of cancer.  Theyve run out of treatments to try.  Her in-laws are more than willing to take raise her son Danny, but in the image of Dannys father, not taking into consideration that Danny is a very different type of person.  So with a lot of trepidation and second guessing her decision, Libby puts an ad in the paper for someone to turn her into a vampire so she can raise Danny herself.As always, there is plenty of humor throughout the story which covers a wide-range of issues that Libby now must face; everything from what she physically experiences and learning to control her urges, to how to raise her son when shes not awake during the day, friends turning on you, fight for custody of Danny with the in-laws and a couple of guys who are now interested in her.The writer does a good job of letting the reader feel the characters emotions, which to me is an important aspect of my enjoyment of a story.  The story is interesting and has a number of fun conversations.My only criticism is that Danny, now 6 in the story, comes across as a much older child in his understanding of events and his conversations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUHI4XR8I423/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W061C18#wasThisHelpful","R1EUHI4XR8I423","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mason jar recipes have become more popular.  Fill them up  and it can be days ahead of time - and when its time to eat, dump the contents in a bowl.  But the glass jars are heavy to carry around and if you dont want to carry your dressing separately, you have to pay attention to the order the ingredients get stacked.This is both lighter and more convenient by having a place to store your dressing as part of the lid.  I definitely like the idea of this.However the lid on mine doesnt fit the jar very well.  Twist the lid into place and its not a solid fit.

"Private investigator, mother and vampire, Samantha Moon must make a very difficult decision.  Her son is going to die within hours; apparently his life was supposed to be short and Anthony is accepting of it.  Should she be selfish and turn him into a vampire to prevent his death? Would he be trapped in a seven year-olds body forever?  Can the medallion that she has and everyone else is looking for really reverse vampirism and make the person mortal again?  If so, how?  If she changes her son she figures shell only have 4 days to find the answer; thats the length of time before she started craving blood after being turned.The bulk of the story centers on finding a specific person who might have the answers that she needs about the medallion.  We had a cliffhanger in both the 2nd and 3rd books, but this one has a sense of closure.  Not for the series, but for the immediate story arc.  And it appears that a new back story has begun.I like Sam the situations and story line as well as the philosophy discussed between characters.  But Sam has cried a lot, especially in these last two books.  Its for a good reason, but the fact that shes cried harder than ever before in her life, many times now, feels overdone.  Id think you could really only convey that once for the reader to believe it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV6OME5GA0N6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CQ80R2#wasThisHelpful","RV6OME5GA0N6H","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very short book consisting of six, for the most part, scenes instead of short stories.  Two of them, however, are a little longer.Id picked this up via KindleUnlimited to read Fangs story from the Samantha Moon series.  Teeth is a more in depth explanation of the details surrounding his imprisonment than was provided in American Vampire.  He doesnt come across as a very pleasant person, but at least you understand why and can empathize with his character a little more.  I enjoyed this story the most.None of the other stories are related to the series, and honestly, if you cant get this for free you might feel like you wasted your money.  Most of the tales here are a tad disturbing.My Fathers Eyes is a scene that tells how a man learned that his father had passed away.  Okay, I can at least appreciate this one.The Fridge is a little more involved about a sentient refrigerator.  Somewhat humorous as well as scary.Die Spy is a scene in a bar about a spy being told by his mentor to get out of the business.  There just didnt seem to be a point to this one.Step on a Crack is a scene set in Jamaica about a not very nice eight year old boy and a curse.  More along the lines of a moral.Two Ghosts is a scene about the beginning of a relationship between two ghosts living in the same apartment.

This book starts off with meeting him for the first time, only to discover she has already met him a number of times and now doesnt know what to think.Two cases are worked on.  One involves a missing child who somehow phones Sam for help.  The other is a missing item taken from a small museum.  But taking up a good chunk of her focus is on a family matter.I like the story itself as well as the situations and characters.  Were starting to build more on a back story and it will be interesting to see where that goes.  But two things were really bugging me.  The more obvious one is the sudden cliffhanger, which quite frankly reminds me of watching episodes of Batman.  Tune in tomorrow to see what happens.  Im glad Im reading this years after the initial release so I dont have to wait for the next book if I dont want to.The other issue that came up this time is repetition within the story.  Im not talking about things described in one book and described again in the next.  Im talking about repetition in this book alone.  At least 3 times were told something wed already read.The story is entertaining, but additional effort needs to be put into editing and continuity.  Heck, a character from the last book was named Monica in Vampire Moon and in this one were told its Cynthia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13T4UQAWGYQXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UHLW1K#wasThisHelpful","R13T4UQAWGYQXW","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PI Samantha Moon, who happens to be a vampire, was forced out of her house by her soon-to-be-ex-husband who blackmailed her into leaving and is making it difficult for her to see or even speak to her kids.  Monsters come in all forms.  But shes keeping busy with a couple of cases.One is a woman whose husband has attempted to kill her twice and even though hes on death row, has taken out a contract on her.  The other is a guy whose wife was murdered in a plane crash along with everyone else who witnessed a murder executed by a powerful crime lord.  The widower wants vengeance.What I liked about this book and the series so far is that even though Sam has been a vampire for the past 6 years, other than her strength and recently learning how to turn into a giant bat, really doesnt know a lot about being a vampire and heavily weighs most of her decisions when using the abilities she does know about.  Her kids are so important to her that shes doing her best to be both human and a good mother.  Shes good at what she does and I like the resolutions she comes up with.This story leaves you with a cliffhanger when Fang, her online confidant shes fallen in love with, talks her into meeting him.An easy read, I just wish it had better editing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EW8LL2ILIWD4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046A9PC4#wasThisHelpful","R1EW8LL2ILIWD4","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long ago some non-humans staged a sort of coup that took out millions and now no people who arent completely human are allowed to live free, own any property or have any rights whatsoever.  They are locked up, sold for research and development, sold to hunters or purchased by traveling carnivals.Delilah has always been interested in the cryptids and studied them in school.  On her twenty-fifth birthday her boyfriend gives her tickets to Metzgers Menagerie, which makes her uneasy, seeing how those in cages are jeered at by the audience and abused by the handlers.  When a young girl in a cage is shocked with a cattle prod for not performing for the audience, something comes over Delilah and shes outed as one of those and is sold by the county sheriff to Metzger.  All of this is made worse because Delilah had no clue there was anything different about her.Through Delilah as well as a few others in the menagerie, we experience their stories, abuse and humiliation.  But Delilah is something a little different and shes not going to let them break her.  Her handler, assigned to break her, isnt quite what he seems either.Well written with great characters, the first half is definitely not a happy story; a combination of disbelief, abuse and hopelessness.  But the second half of the story starts to change as they finally learn what Delilah is and that she has a purpose.Id had the book for a couple of weeks before reading it, mostly due to already hearing that the first half of the book could be difficult.  But wow, I picked it up last night and it immediately sucked me in and wouldnt let go.  Monsters come in all forms and its not surprising that some of the worst are the ones that arent chained and caged.  Were provided small newspaper articles throughout the book that indicates what took place so long ago that caused the current laws and opinions; and it would be easy to see our own laws and opinions following the same course if it happened in real life.The book is the first in a trilogy, but it feels like a complete story on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAL9LCMA2DNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831605X#wasThisHelpful","R2FAL9LCMA2DNK","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the Charley Davidson series, this is Reyes story.  Not a lot that you havent already learned if youve been reading the series, but this is from his point of view beginning when he was 3, taking you through his coming out of the coma at Charleys urging.  It certainly gives a different perspective on not only him, but Charley who hes checked in with all of her life.Definitely not a happy story but it wasnt as difficult as I feared even though youll wish you could jump into the story and help him.  You do learn more about him and will appreciate him even more than you did before.If youre reading this series youll want to read this one.

"When purchasing this I'd done a search for Dial Anti-Bacterial soap.  Guess I wasn't paying too much attention when I saw this product come up.  It's not an anti-bacterial but states on the label that it washes bacteria away.  Apparently this is no different from most other body washes.The scent is light and pleasant and it lathers well.  I'm sensitive to scents and I can't smell this on my arm after drying off.It says it's moisturizing and I don't doubt that, but I've yet to find a moisturizing body wash that helps by itself when your skin is already dry.

"This is my second order of this GE filter.  Both times I received exactly what I was ordering.I'd been gifted with a 3 year old new fridge and immediately bought the filter.  These are supposed to be good for 6 months but it was 14 months before I purchased the second one, mostly because I felt I should, not because it wasn't filtering as well.  On average I probably dispense about 50 ounces of water, plus a couple of 15 oz cups full of ice cubes per day.I think it works well and it's pretty easy to install.

"Lark and Ash, elementals with Earth magic, are captured by the Enders from the Pitin the first story they killed four Enders there and the price of killing an Ender is deathso are being taken back to the place where those with fire abilities live, for their execution.  This is a place where people go swimming in lava.  The stakes are raised as not only does she have to get Ash out of there, but rescue a childhood friend and according to the mother goddess, a whole lot of others.  And in this one she picks up a familiar, the cat from the last book who wants nothing to do with Lark.Weve also got an interesting bad person who I expect well be seeing in the next book.Im definitely enjoying the series and seeing Lark get out of some pretty impossible situations; at least most of the time.  Shes kick butt, however not invincible, as well as compassionate.Her relationships with others, especially creatures not accepted by many, make her really likable to the reader.  I dont believe shes prejudiced against anyone or anything that hasnt done her any harm and shell go out on a limb for someone even when she has no reason to.  And I really like Peta, her familiar.  She makes a great addition.One thing bothers me and that's the resolution between two sides of a drama.

"This is my 7th year in a row, purchasing this for a small office.  This one covers December 2015 through January 2017.  The entire month is displayed over the 2-page spread with a 2 strip along the outside of the left-hand page showcasing 6 months of calendars; the prior month, the current month and the next 4.7 lines for notes are provided for each day with the calendar in the Sunday thru Saturday format.  Normally I wouldnt mention that format, but was surprised when purchasing a calendar and hadnt been aware beforehand that it was a Monday thru Sunday format which I dont like.  The lines are enough to give this office manager the information needed to know whats going on and when, as well as who will be out of the office.The calendar provides both the number of days into the year as well as how many are left.  All of the major North American holidays are listed along with some lesser known religious ones.At the back the planner also has a 2/3 of a page devoted to future years planning with the other third a contact list.  Also 1 page of calendars for 2015 thru 2017.Wirebound with a somewhat flexible nylon-type of cover, I've never had one that isn't still in perfect shape by the end of the year.  Actually I have all of them as once in awhile I need to refer to when something took place and all of them are still in perfect shape.If I wanted something more personal, Id get something smaller with more lines for notes allotted per day.

"This author is known for her gritty mysteries told from the perspective of law enforcement or the coroner.  In each book we see through these folks eyes the horror of what a human can do.  This story is quite different in that its told from the point of view of a victim and their family members; how a horrific event can drastically change all of their lives.  The story is more along the lines of psychological thriller.The story actually starts out in the novella-length prequel, Blonde Hair, Blue Eyes.  It follows a university student, Julia, who also writes for the school paper and wants to do a story about girls that have gone missing.  Through her we also learn about her family before her disappearance.  Its not necessary to read this book first, although its the only way to really get to know Julia.  This book picks up twenty-four years later with the story told from Julias sisters with todays actions, along with letters their father had written to Julia over the years about what was going on and how he was still looking for her, scattered throughout.But its so much more than a grieving family that was torn apart.  The youngest, Claire, is married to a really rich guy and on the night we meet her, her husband dies in her arms after being stabbed during a robbery.  Things quickly dont start adding up and eye-opening revelations are uncovered.  Its obvious that some in law enforcement cant be trusted so who do you turn to with the horror you uncover?This book isnt going to be popular with everyone.  There are some really horrific scenes described.  I had trouble as I wanted/needed to get away from the story while being drawn in as I had to know what happens.  I purposely had to set it aside to get some space from it and couldnt wait to finish the book.Well written?  Absolutely.  The characters are well fleshed out with details that might not seem important that often figure in later in the story.  Like any good mystery there are enough twists and revelations to keep things interesting.  And you will end up liking the entire family even though you probably wont care for any of them at first.Would I read the book again later?  No.  The author did a great job on the horror aspect of it and it took a lot of my energy to get through the story.Read as a ARC via Edelweiss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33FAVD616FENP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VES8D6K#wasThisHelpful","R33FAVD616FENP","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not much happens in the small town of Liberty; certainly nothing exciting ever gets written in The Liberty Chronicle, the newspaper Lizzie works for as a copy editor.  But that suddenly changes when a murder occurs just across the street, followed by a second one soon afterward.  Lizzie knows dang well the second one is a murder, but the cops are calling it an accident.  So what else can she do but find the murderer?Add to the mix the super sexy Blake Morgan who works as an investigative reporter for the newspaper.  Lizzie has a mind-numbing crush on him but when she sees how much hes hurting from the second death and finds out he doesnt have any friends (hes new in town) she decides he needs a friend more than a lover.The mystery itself was good; the who and why was a total shock to me.  And the relationship between Lizzie and Blake provides some sexual tension.  But too much of the story involves their weird relationship with Lizzies minute by minute changing attitude.  I found it somewhat hard to keep up with why shes suddenly feeling the way she does at any given moment.Wow, did the author come up with some interesting characters.  The antics of one in particular provide much of the humor.Read via Kindle Unlimited","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DNERJMXZDS0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7T1DIG#wasThisHelpful","R2DNERJMXZDS0F","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fairly simplistic and unbelievable tale about an heiress who runs away from her wedding by sneaking out the back door of the church and taking off in her fathers limo just minutes before shes to walk down the aisle.  She did try to call off the wedding days earlier but her autocratic father wouldnt hear of it and threatened to freeze all of her assets.  So without any identification or money, she ends up in a small town where people just want to help each other and shes such a kind and wonderful person that everyone loves her.Wow, I just dont know where to go from there.  A romance?  Yes.  No problem with that.  She meets a really nice guy whose only fault appears to be that he so easily jumps to the wrong conclusions.  And yes, there is comedy with the majority of it taking place at the beginning of the tale.  The characters are quirky, interesting and quite likable.But to specifically discuss the unbelievable aspects would be giving away too much of the story.  Although I will say that a piece of it involves how easily she gives away the only assets she has without having a penny or a job, and her apparent disregard for insurance fraud.Not a bad read and for the most part light and easy, but too many things just dont come across as realistic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TQ7SD4ULME1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RC2GUM6#wasThisHelpful","R1TQ7SD4ULME1I","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shoulder-length coarse, curly, colored hair, Ive been having a problem with it being too dry for years now and have used a number of products with varying degrees of success to prevent the frizzing.  A few months ago I changed the product being used to color my hair as well as the shampoo and I have seen an improvement, although my hair still looked bushy.I couldnt find my glasses to read the directions, so the first time I used this I applied the same number of pumps (5) that I use for another oil product on humid days.  While my hair was air drying I found my glasses and to my horror saw that only 1 pump was needed.  I feared an oily look with weighed down hair.  Nope.  My hair absorbed it all; it felt light and soft when it was dry and dang, it looked good.Since I let my hair air dry, its still damp when I get to work.  On those days I dont have the option to apply the product to both damp and dry hair.  For those days, 1 pump isnt enough, although 2 pumps works out quite well.I also apply a couple of pumps worth on the nights before the morning when Ill be washing my hair.  It does look somewhat greasy when I go to bed, but again, its been completely absorbed when I get up in the morning.Ive seen a huge difference in my hair since starting to use this and Im so happy with the results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GY1FGN7RIT7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SNL8ZZK#wasThisHelpful","R3GY1FGN7RIT7F","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seventeen year-old Lila stays under the radar in the tourist town that boasts its the most magical place in America; a place with mortals, those who have magic, and the monsters that live in the surrounding woods and mountains.  The town is run by magical mob-like families and you dont want to come to their attention if you arent a member of one of them.  Having been trained by her mother, Lila is an outstanding thief and excellent as a fighter with a couple of magical Talents that are kind of rare.Much to her chagrin, she steps in when seeing an assassination attempt and comes to the attention of the second most powerful of the families.If I were rating this book at only one or two chapters in, the rating would not have been too good.  Lila has a mouth and attitude that arent especially endearing, especially when coupled with what she does to earn money.  That and when recapping what took place 4 years prior that now has her in her current situation, too many things just felt off.But the story and her situation soon sucked me in and we see a much different side of her than what she wants and needs others to see.  Smart, capable, loyal and compassionate while attempting to not let others get too close.  The characters are interesting as is the mystery, action and the already building back story.Read from a library book.

"Zelda has just served a nine month sentence in the witches prison for killing her cat who just happened to be her familiar; it was an accident.  A strong healer, what had her sentenced for so long was that shed been using her magic for selfish reasons, conjuring up designer clothes as well as expensive cars and vacations.  On her release shes given back a portion of her magic and is on probation for a month and needs to complete a task during that time.  Her aunt had left her a house and shell know what to do when she gets there.  She had an aunt?  If after a months time she doesnt complete her task, all magic will be removed and shell become mortal.  Only shes not quite sure what that task is.One of the things Ive enjoyed about this authors writings is the crazy main character she often comes up with.  This one is selfish with not quite the intense potty mouth of another popular lead character.  With Zelda, its the names she comes up with for others that stands out.The situations are definitely unique and funny, but I found it difficult to like Zelda for a good chunk of the book.  Due to her upbringing, shes never been emotionally close with another and to protect her heart, just doesnt want to establish connections with the people who like and appreciate her.  Hang in there; it takes a while but things do change.

"My hair is over 95% hard to color gray.  The recommended 25-30 minutes has never been enough; I need 45 minutes, even when having it colored by a hairdresser.  This is the second Garnier hair color product Ive tried since starting to do it on my own to save money and hopefully get my hair in better condition, about 5 months ago.  Both products gave me a rich looking color and did a good job on the grays and my hair feels a lot better than when I had it done by my hairdresser.The first one I tried was Garnier Olia Oilmy hair was pretty dried out and more oil sounded good.  It did a good job with the color, but the bulb-shaped applicator was too large for my hand making application both awkward and messy.  It also required a great deal more product on the hardest to color areas around the temples.  My hair was definitely getting healthier using this versus having it done at a salon.This Nutrisse version uses a regular bottle-shape for an applicator and comes with the developer already in the bottle.  Squeeze out the color crme from a tube and fruit oil from a small plastic pack.  The bottle opening is not as large as the one on the Olia, so you have to be more precise when adding in the other ingredients, but this bottle is great deal more narrow and easy to grip for both shaking and application.It truly is a non-drip formula and I didnt have to put nearly as much product on the temple area to get the color to stick.  My hair feels better each time I color; approximately every 3-1/2 weeks if I dont want to look like a skunk.Okay there is one area that Id like to see an improvement on and its the size of the gloves.  My hands are on the short side of medium and the gloves fingers are almost  too short for me.  This makes it uncomfortable when first starting out.  Not sure if the gloves stretch out or you just forget about it and dont notice it any longer when concentrating on the applying the color.Of the two Garnier products I have to say I like this one better.  And the savings for doing it myself when factoring in the tip is roughly $750.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HN5BNF5U4DE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCSY64#wasThisHelpful","R3HN5BNF5U4DE8","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two romances for the price of one.  PR consultant Gillian is hired by those financing the SBC to steer Drew Black, the man who created and lives for the SBC, into a more personable figure.  He wants nothing to do with it, but is intrigued and turned on by her looks and her brain.  Someone wants to discredit him in the worst way and will do anything to bring that about.The other romance is between an up and coming fighter, Brett and Audrey, the woman who created WAVS; Women Against Violent Sports.  She has a change in attitude once she gets to know Brett and learns that there are rules in place to prevent the type of fighting that killed her brother.I enjoyed the dual romance, especially as there was enough ink devoted to each that you dont fill gypped on the second one.  Prior fighters met in the series are on hand but have a smaller role than in the earlier stories.  The characters are all likeable, but Drew does take a little getting used to.

"This is a compilation of short stories or novellas that had been released years ago.  Three are set in Kates world and the other two are either in the same world or one similar to A Hidden Legacy.  None are new to me.A Questionable Client is a prequel to the Kate Daniels series where Kate meets Saiman for the first time when she accepts a high-paying gig to be his bodyguard.  It explains why he gives her a break for his services.  It had been available for free for quite a long time on the authors website, and was released in Magic Graves.Retribution Clause is set in Kates world, but takes place in Philadelphia with Saimans frost giant cousin, Adam.  This story is about a claims adjuster and his partner who must fulfill the clause in a life insurance policy to terminate the person responsible for the policy owners death.  The story was originally released in Hex Appeal.  The story has some twists and might be confusing for a bit, but it all makes sense at the end.Of Swine and Roses had been released by itself back in 2011.  Set in the same or a similar world as A Hidden Legacy series, its about a teenage girl who, for her familys sake, needs to accept a date with a guy she knows to be a thug and bully so her family can get a loan from the bank owned by his family.  A short story with a nice outcome.  Quite a few editing errors in this one.Grace of Small Magics is also set in a world where families have magic and the stronger the magic the higher your place in society.  The story had been released in The Mammoth Book of Paranormal Romance as well as Under Her Skin.  Its about a girl whose family is indentured to another and they must come when called for help or her family will be killed.Magic Tests is about Julie, who when forced by Kate to check out a new school, accepts a challenge to find a student who has gone missing.

"Tiff Banks is an investigator and only a few understand or accept that much of the information she gets that leads to solving a case comes from ghosts that were victims of violent death.  She has two living in her house.  But she finds out what life is like from their side when her soul separates from her body and the doctors cant figure out why she isnt waking up.  Shes got to find a way to communicate with Royal to stop him from pulling the plug on the machines keeping her alive, as well as figure out how to get back into her body.Finding the solution has them crossing into Downside--magical world--and bringing characters together from both series as well as facing a scary adversary from their past; one who seems impossible to stop.Well this was a nice treat since the author had announced that A Conspiracy of Demons, released in December 2012, would be the last in the series as she started a new one.  There is enough information in this story to remind readers of what they might have forgotten, but its not a good place to start, especially if you hadnt read either series.  Along Came a Demon, the first book in the series, is free as of this writing.This story is loaded with a great deal of emotion; pretty much hitting on every one you can think of  with the story told from Tiffs point of view and the situation she finds herself in.  And through her eyes we see how it affects her Gelpha lover and investigative partner, Royal, as he needs to make a decision that would affect not only Tiff, but Downside as well as his own world.I liked how the characters from the two series were brought together.  We get a lot of interaction with Jack and Mel, her ghostly roommates as they help in the investigation and teach Tiff how to deal with her situation; experiencing the limitation in their existence certainly gives her a new perspective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1577NAX1NY0GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131ECPJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1577NAX1NY0GJ","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stephanie Plum quits her job as a bounty hunter after rolling in the garbage with a fugitive.  She just wants a normal life.  Only she has problems with every other job she takes on, a couple in a huge way when it seems a ghost from her past is toying with her with some spectacular results.Ranger offers her a job sitting in front of a computer at Rangeman, doing searches and background checks, specifically focusing on the disappearance of some men.  In this job shes actually safer as no one can get to her car when its parked in the Rangeman building, although Joe isnt too happy about it.Weve also got Valeries wedding, Joe gets hurt, Lula now working as a bounty hunter and needing Stephanies help, fire, car explosions, sexual tension and a great deal of humor.One of the things its easy to get bugged about is the fact that Stephanie doesnt seem to grow or get any better at her job.  And yet in this story, while shell never be as good as Rangercertainly never as capable or intimidatingit is obvious that shes better at it than she used to be, especially in comparison to Lula.Ive reread this one a number of times since it came out.  Even knowing what happens I find its a relaxing escape for a few hours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS8RWKP4QNUGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312985347#wasThisHelpful","RS8RWKP4QNUGP","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is on hand to witness the robbing of a store by the Red Devil, a masked guy who robs stores, sets fire to them and gets away on his bike.  Discovering hes part of one of the local gangs, she makes the mistake of cruising through their territory trying to spot him, and to escape when her car is mobbed, has to run a few of them over.  Now theres a contract on her head and they seem to find her wherever she goes.To add to her problems, Ranger is out of town, although this turns out to be a good thing as she discovers the location of the Bat Cave.  While trying to lay low and avoid gang members, she still has to bring in skips, deal with the preparations for her sisters wedding and her relationship with Morelli.As with the prior stories, chaos reigns and there is both plenty of action as well as humor and sexual tension.  And the ending is rather unexpected.Forget common sense and the fact that Stephanie doesnt seem to grow and many of the gags have been used before.  Its still a fun story and a great way to escape reality for a few hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENXXWPGMJFLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312936222#wasThisHelpful","RENXXWPGMJFLY","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a novella-length story following Julie, a woman going to the University of GA for a degree in journalism. She works for the campus newspaper and after a pretty young woman had gone missing without a trace, she starts looking into other disappearances of girls written off as the girls leaving on their own.  She wants to write a story for the paper about them.Set in 1991, the story is a precursor to Pretty Girls, coming out in September. The stories are stand alone; not part of either the Will Trent or Grant County series.I got this ARC free to review from the publisher via Edelweiss/Above the Treeline and hadnt realized when I started reading this that it was a shorter story or the precursor to another book and the story wasnt going along as I expected because of that. But it made total sense about halfway thru when realizing I wasnt reading a full novel.Tension and expect to be making some assumptions about people. It grabbed me. The attitudes toward physical crimes against women have changed since 1991, although still not enough; thought-provoking.I was also fortunate enough to read Pretty Girls from an ARC.  Is it necessary to read this before Pretty Girls?  Not necessarily.  However,  I recommend it just because we get so much information about Julie and her family in this story and youll see a big contrast to what theyre like in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19TDTG65BOJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z751DUY#wasThisHelpful","R19TDTG65BOJL","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally released in 2010 in the anthology, Inked, this novella takes place near the end of the novel, Night Season when Cynna and Cullen are off world.  Lily and Rule are in Washington when he receives a call that a Nokolai friend had been killed and another had been arrested for the murder.  Of course it doesnt help that Robert Friar lives in this small town and had just started the group, Humans First.  Lily first has to prove that magic was involved in order to stay on the case.Id just reread this story in my copy of Inked and its been so long between reads that I couldnt recall most of what happened.  You do get a complete story involving Rule and Lilys relationship, the mystery, investigation and action.  And of course magic is involved.  What it doesnt have that all of the novels in this series have is the rather deep discussions on magical theory.  In that aspect it makes this an easier read.Most of the series regulars are mentioned, if not on hand, including Arjenie, who we hadnt physically met yet at this point in the series.If you've been enjoying the series you'll definitely like this story.  But I don't suggest this as a place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X402UEGL7ID1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4D96#wasThisHelpful","R2X402UEGL7ID1","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly, practically anything sitting on a table or counter in my house will eventually get knocked to the floor at one time or another.  This timer has hit the floor twice now that I'm aware of - and it still works!  I find that thrilling since the timer this replaced - different brand - no longer let you know the time was up after hitting the floor the first time.As with all spring timers, if the time you want to set is for less than 30 minutes, it will be necessary to move the dial beyond that point before positioning it for the time you need.

Both of Annies divorced parents had to take out a child custody bond in case the other took off with their child and Evelyns ex is calling it in.  Not only is Mabel worried about her granddaughter, but shell lose her house if Annie isnt brought back.

"Bounty Hunter Stephanie Plum is shocked when told the next FTA her boss wants her to bring in is Ranger, her mentor that shes sometimes worked with.  She turns it down knowing she wouldnt stand a chance.  But then Ranger also becomes a person of interest when a Greek mob boss son is killed right after Ranger is caught on camera seeing him.  Now others are looking for Ranger and following Stephanie, believing she knows where he is.  And Ranger enlists her aid.If thats not enough, Grandma Mazur decides to move out of her daughters house and in with Stephanie, and Bob, a Golden Retriever is foisted off on her.  There are plenty of laughs and sexual tension and frustration in this story that branches off into so many different directions.Ive been rereading some of my favorites and many of them involve working with or for Ranger.  And its funny to see how tough he is and so many people afraid of him, and yet trying to force Stephanie to obey him for her own safety is something he cant seem to accomplish.If you read these books expecting to see much growth in Stephanies character or even her skills getting better over time, well thats an incredibly slow process that you might not even realize is happening.  And dont expect her to make a permanent decision between Joe and Ranger as that would end the series.  Just look at these stories as a few hours of escaping reality with some laughs from old favorites, and enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12DS54YTZMECD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312976275#wasThisHelpful","R12DS54YTZMECD","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bounty Hunter Stephanie Plum is partnered with Ranger when a man on a work visa bond goes missing and she finds herself caught up in a deadly game.

Dont expect any growth on Stephanies part and thats part of the charm, as is the sexual tension with Ranger while in an on again stretch with Morelli.

"Dria, a very old vampire and her human husband, Rafe, own property and a resort covering fifteen miles in Alaska.  The resort caters to vacationing vampires and their entourages with a heavy emphasis on sex.  The resort even includes some sex-themed rooms.  The mystery surrounds the corpse of a human found in one of the rooms being checked prior to a groups arrival.I had not been aware this was erotica when I picked it up for free and while those scenes are well-described, they take up a whole lot of the book.  Its cool that after fifty plus years that Dria and Rafe are still so turned on by each other that they have sex whenever and wherever possible (multiple times a day).  And even though many guys are drawn to and turned on to Dria, shes fully committed to Rafe.  Thats a nice change from so many other Urban Fantasy series Ive read.But a number of things bothered me and yet I can come up with a counter argument for each.  Sex is encouraged in the guests to the point that Dria does something considered illegal in the vampire world; messing with their minds, adding thoughts and pictures of others in attendance, guaranteed to turn them on.  It is with the intention that they have a good time, but that feels a lot like mind rape.The human employees are paid a really hefty salary and many of them are available as both blood donors and for sex.  Makes them sound like prostitutes.  And yet none of these employees do this unless they want to and it seems every one of them enjoys it.  When ready, they ask to be added to the resorts list of donors; but they dont have to.There is an observation room with monitors showing whats happening in each room.  Ewww.  And yet they use it whenever an employee donates blood or has sex with a vampire for the first time to make sure theyre okay.  And each of these employees wears a bracelet with a panic button on it in case things arent going well.  So its obvious that the welfare of the employees is really important.I did like the mystery although that took a while to get going.  And Im intrigued with this authors vampire culture and her place in it.  It seems obvious that the governing body will play a larger role in future books.  I am torn on what I think of Dria.  The enjoyment and safety of both her guests and employees is important to her and I do like her philosophy on not tying others to her as servants.  But that mind rape thing really bothers me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7QYBFLI9K16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044DELIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1W7QYBFLI9K16","AQNX0WN00JEVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQNX0WN00JEVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It might not stand up to day after day, week after week use building houses. But for the homeowner wanting to have something on hand for serious home remodeling and expansion projects it will likely serve long and well.

"The All-Clad Textiles Fiber Reactive Kitchen Towels are good quality but underwhelming in person. Although they are very good towels they are neither as thick nor as absorbent as many other less expensive towels.

The reverse side is all white. Bummer. Not sorry that I bought a few of these but I wouldn't buy them again.

"At 4.5 pounds a jug of Roland Barchetta Kalamata Olive Halves is a whole lot of Kalamata olives. But, if you consume a lot of olives for things like bruschetta and pizzas and other dishes, it is a super bargain. Quality is excellent. The olives come packed in natural oils and a bit of red wine vinegar that adds some edge to the already intense taste of Kalamata olives. For me the olives arriving already pitted and halved makes them extra easy too use for most recipes. Everyone has their own opinion about rinsing olives before use, but I would recommend giving a serving or portion of these olives a quick water rinse before use to get rid of the packing liquid and any debris.

"""How To Eataly: A Guide to Buying, Cooking, and Eating Italian Food"" is an outstanding and comprehensive guide to basic Italian food terminology and classic recipes, as well as a quick survey of techniques and sources. In Italy the book is available as ""I love Eataly. Il cibo italiano narrato e cucinato"".Although the name and brand EATALY is in the United States associated with Mario Batali, who along with his partners are the US partners of the brand, EATALY, founded in Italy by Oscar Farinetti, has been a presence in major urban centers in Italy since 2007. As such it has in many ways revolutionized Italian gourmet food stuff selling in Italy which, in some places, like Florence for example, has been plagued by local shops charging sky high prices and huge markups to tourists having major Italian food-gasms at the sight of culinary treats and ingredients that are hard to find in the US. Although EATALY's prices are not low in the shop they are usually much lower than the tourist trap food boutiques that cluster in tourist areas. In Italy EATALY also has a very good web site and mail order business that can supply almost everything sold in the Italian EATALY shops.""How To Eataly"" is not cutting edge info, it's traditional. But what's presented is spot on with staple recipes and a lot of solid info about Italian food cooking and preparation practices. It's beautifully illustrated and laid out, as one would expect from a book published by Rizzoli. A great addition to the resources of any cook interested in Italian food, and for any traveler planning a restaurant and market tour in Italy.

"The Lenovo Flex 3 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Convertible Laptop is an excellent laptop with an outstanding Full HD 1920x touchscreen. I will say right up front that my main interest in this unit was in its function as a laptop, not for its dual convertible laptop/tablet functionality. I am not generally speaking a fan of the convertible Windows based laptop/tablet systems. The interface paradigm that makes full screen apps and swiping and so forth so compelling and useful on smartphones and normal tablets starts to run out of gas in larger devices with 15"" screens, at least for this user. And, of course, the folded over keyboard and bottom section, no matter how thin, and the keys being exposed on what becomes the back of a quasi ""tablet"", is an awkward arrangement. All that said, when it comes to the ""flex"" aspect of this system, Lenovo has delivered excellence to the hardware design and implementation of what some may consider a half baked software concept foisted on computer makers by Microsoft as part of the Windows 8 roll out. Lenovo has done its part by delivering an excellent hardware implementation of the idea.Windows 10, due out in July 2015, goes a long way toward rolling back and reversing some of the awkward Win 8 interface elements while adding a lot of new and improved functionality for the Windows platform across multiple device types. But, reactions to the convertible concept and Windows 8 aside, the Lenovo Flex 3 is an excellent laptop system.When reviewing a computer it's sometimes easy to get the part that the computer maker is responsible for and the part that Microsoft is responsible for mixed up. So I will try and limit my comments to the part that Lenovo had control over, the hardware. Many features of any laptop are also generic to most laptops, or part of the specs, so I will also try and limit my comments to what I think are the distinctive aspects of this model.The Screen: The Full HD 1920x screen with touch function is outstanding. Contrary to what some might think, adding extra pixels does not make a screen sharper per se. But it does remove the subliminal perception of pixels, the retina effect, that can cause images and elements to look, or seem to be, slightly less sharp. It also produces a much smoother, less granular image. The screen on the Lenovo Flex 3 is just wonderful to work with for both text reading and, of course, for images. If you work with a lot of digital photos, or watch a lot of content on-line, it will be a huge step up over the lower pixel HD displays that have been pretty much standard on laptops for the past few years. It's a pleasure to watch films and edit photos on this screen. Touch functionality is excellent. The screen responded crisply to swipes and pinches and so forth with the standard Metro apps included with Windows 8.1.Sound: The Lenovo Flex 3 has quite simply the best built in sound that I have ever had on any laptop that I have ever owned. Volume is substantial and there is excellent mid bass. You can actually listen to music and films on this laptop. Paired with the excellent screen it's a joy to watch Netflix videos, for example, on this system. There are no speaker perforations on the top deck of the laptop. The speakers are located on the bottom of the laptop, although in use the impression is that sound is coming from the keyboard. However they are doing it the system has excellent sound with good stereo imaging. There is no internal CD/DVD player.The Body: The Lenovo Flex 3 has a fairly thin bottom section, where the keyboard and computer guts are located. Both the body shell and the screen lid are made of metal (it feels like metal to the touch, I couldn't find a spec for the material on the Lenovo site or in the docs), as is the top deck that surrounds the keyboard and track pad and so forth. The Lenovo Flex 3 body is admirably rigid. How this rigidity is achieved may displease a few users. For one thing, there are no access doors or hatches on the bottom of the base section, for accessing or replacing the hard drive or upgrading memory. The battery is internal and non detachable. The bottom of the base is featureless except for ventilation. The hard drive and the memory can be accessed, but only by a rather complex disassembly process that starts with removing the keyboard. This shouldn't be a problem for most users, who will likely never want to change anything. But users who are accustomed to adding memory or swapping out hard drives may be a bit put off. Likewise if the battery should ever die it will require a tear down, and probably a trip to a repair station that may cost so much in flat fees that it won't be worth it.SD Slot: The SD and card slot on the left side of the system is of the type that only allows the card to be inserted about a third of the way, just enough to make contact. Therefore, you cannot insert a card and then pack the system in a carry bag, or easily leave a card inserted for backup and so forth.The Keyboard: The keyboard for the Lenovo Flex 3 has a wonderful back-light. The back-light lights up the keyboard characters and can be toggled on and off with the space-bar + the Fn key. This makes typing in a semi dark environment, like an airplane, much much easier. It's a great design touch that really adds to real world functionality.The Wireless card: The Lenovo Flex 3 wireless card is dual band and supports 802.11ac.The Power Button: The power button is located on the side, rather than the top panel, of the laptop. There are no activity lights visible from the in use position on the top panel. There are no activity lights than a power on light. The power on light is also located on the side of the machine, by the power button. This means that when shutting down you can't see the 100% off state of the system. The screen goes black, as though the system has shut down, while the system is in fact still shutting down. So if you have your power options for closing the lid set to hibernate or sleep when closed you may close the lid too soon when shutting down if you don't keep eye on the side mounted power light.USB 3.0 Ports: The inclusion of two USB 3.0 ports rather than only one, as has been the case with many recent laptops, greatly eased copying back and forth and backing up between two USB 3.0 hard drives. No external USB 3.0 hub was needed.Bottom line is that the Lenovo Flex 3 is an excellent laptop with a few quirks and an excellent implementation of the convertible laptop/tablet concept, a feature that may not be very relevant to many users. For me the whole laptop doubling as tablet idea is a non starter. But, if you like the concept then the Lenovo Flex 3 is an excellent choice. It is also an outstanding choice as a laptop only. Performance was excellent, the system did not come with too much bloat-ware, although there was some, and Microsoft has gotten its act together with Windows 8.1 to overcome some of the really awful aspects of the original Win 8 release. Windows 10 should be a big improvement. After a couple of weeks of tweaking and smoothing out the system to my own habits and needs I am a happy user of the Lenovo Flex 3. RECOMMENDED.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3727ZS5MFLOIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TR05R2U#wasThisHelpful","R3727ZS5MFLOIY","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""National Geographic Traveler: Florence and Tuscany, 3rd Edition"" is an outstanding guide to Florence and Tuscany. I can say this because I have done just about everything described in the book, and if a friend asked me I would make a lot of the recommendations included in the book myself. It has been said that a travel guide isn't really useful until you have already been to the destination and so know what the content in the guide is really about. It's tough to read a guidebook at home, about a culture or country you have not been to before, and not have your eyes glaze over with facts and figures and histories that may not be meaningful for you until you are there, or you have been there, for context. But having spent a lot of time in Florence, and Tuscany in general, this book really hits all the right points, doesn't waste your time with a lot of filler, and has just the right amount of photos and detail drawings and maps to help you get the best from a visit to Tuscany.Travel books have evolved quite a bit over the past few years, and National Geographic Traveler: Florence and Tuscany is very much a contemporary travel guide in that it understands that people now have access to all kinds of travel information while traveling. For example, a staple feature of travel guides for decades has been restaurant and hotel recommendations. But, in the age of TripAdvisor and other rating and info web sites and apps and with every traveler, it seems, having a smartphone or tablet with them, is it really necessary to use up many pages, and to make a guide bulkier and less portable, to provide information and recommendations that may already be out of date by the time the ink dries? National Geographic Traveler: Florence and Tuscany wisely dispenses with an excess of these sections, although it includes a brief but concise guide to perennial favorites in an appendix at the back of the book. This would have been a minus many years ago, now it's a plus.The book strikes a fine balance between text and illustrations also, with very articulate and instructive explanations about what you need to know without veering off into lecture length presentations. It also avoids one of the great sins of many other recent travel books, in my opinion, which is the use of superficial, pithy adjective laden text and cheerleading. It is well written, has some opinions, but reasonable ones, and is a smooth read. It does not attempt to be your new best friend or to blog past personal feelings and experiences at you. It is well written and, perhaps more importantly, well edited.Likewise the photos and maps are very helpful without becoming the kind of illustration clutter that are one of the big shortcomings of the Eyewitness guides, for example. The walking tours are just right to take you through various parts of Florence. The section on Siena is shorter than the one on Florence but covers what you need to know to make an enjoyable day trip to Siena or to stay there for a day or two while visiting other Tuscan hill towns. The snapshot sections of features and history for Chianti, Lucca, Pisa, San Gimignano, many other hill towns and the coastal areas are just enough and not too much.But, best of all it's all very useful and spot on, and the book is neither too large to carry with you nor so brief as to make you feel you might be missing out on something. If I had never been to Tuscany I would have been enthusiastic about this book just on its design merits, but having been to many of the places described I can say it will be a wonderful companion for your own trip there.

"The Kanu Surf Men's Havana Trunks are good quality all around shorts for casual summer town and sport wear. They are 100% polyester, fit this user well, and they dry out quickly. The only negative is that the mesh pockets are unusually shallow. In fact, these may be the shorts that you remember some day as the shorts you were wearing when you lost your cell phone. I wouldn't recommend jumping up and down with a lot of spare change in the pockets either. But, that said, at the price these are real Columbia beaters on value and the quality seems very good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYVWWI267J6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DNVPHC#wasThisHelpful","R2AYVWWI267J6J","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bialetti 6956 Musa Stovetop Moka Pot is a wonderfully stylish update on the classic Moka pot design made by Bialetti. That said, it's not perfect. The Musa ontinues Bialetti's tradition of making pots that are both stylishly Italian while also looking and feeling distinctly cheap in manufacture. Although the Musa is a big upgrade in aesthetics due to its non tarnishing polished stainless steel, it still requires careful placement on all but the smallest burners to avoid the handle being overheated. and the art of detecting when the pot has pushed the last bit of water through the coffee, but before the coffee has started to burn, still takes a bit of practice. My main complaint would be that they did not bother to put an encapsulated aluminum disc on the bottom, similar to what is used on even cheap stainless pots and pans, to make heating more both more even and efficient, and that the Musa is not made in Italy. It's made in China, and some of the other recent Bialetti models are made in India. But, bottom line it makes a great mini pot of moka style coffee. RECOMMENDED with regrets that it's not 100% Italian.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOIBQOJ2VZJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032XJFAS#wasThisHelpful","RFOIBQOJ2VZJN","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Casabella Quick 'N Easy Upright Sweep Set is clearly a cut above most sweep sets on offer. Having used a lot of really cheap sweep sets in various vacation rental apartments I can say that the people who are complaining in other reviews may not have a clear standard of reference. Some of them seem to be complaining that the set was not made for military service. It's a sweep set, for your home, to be used maybe once a day. At the price it's really disposable after a year or two. But, I don't think that will happen. I found the Casabella Quick 'N Easy Upright Sweep Set to be actually rather well made, to have great design touches, and to have appealing looks. It works great. The detachable brush head for hand use is a nice feature. I leave the dust pan in the extended position and don't fold it up after every use. At the right price it's a winner. I'm a happy sweeper with the Casabella.

"The RCA RCARCRN06GR 6 Device Universal Remote with Learning and Macros is a very good, and low cost, universal remote. It is not perfect. But so many after market remotes are so very far from perfect that it shines in comparison. My previous favorite universal remote was the One For All URC-8820 which has, sadly, been discontinued. The RCA is not quite as flexible as the old One For All model, but it also has some distinct advantages. It is much easier to program to learn functions from other remotes and to assign keys and to make macros. It has a back-light for the keys -- despite what some other reviewers have said the example I have of the RCARCRN06GR illuminates the entire keyboard with a somewhat over bright blue light. The only negatives are that the IR emitter is somewhat recessed and so has a relatively narrow angle of operation, the finish is glossy piano black which is a fingerprint magnet, macros can only be assigned to number keys 1-8, and the OK button and the arrow surround for that button produce a very audible click when pressed. Other than that I am a happy user of the RCA RCARCRN06GR. It's not heirloom quality, what do you want for $12.00? But it will probably last until you step on it, spill something on it, or it suffers some other typical device end of life tragedy.

The bowl has a lovely polished black granite look, but both the inner bowl of the mortar and the tip of the pestle are finished in an abrasive texture to facilitate grinding.

"The BenQ TreVolo Electrostatic Bluetooth Speaker is a very attractive and innovative mini Bluetooth speaker system that utilizes electrostatic speakers, technology that is unique for a product of this size and in this category.Electrostatic speakers have been available for many years. Way back in the Jurassic era of audio, in the now ancient 1960s, when dinos roamed the Earth, back before CDs and digital music, the process of getting maximum fidelity from the grooves of an LP record to the ears of the listener was part science, part art and part black magic. Electrostatic speakers were, in that era, and today still are for many people, the ultimate speaker technology. They were also physically large, sometimes as tall and wide as a person, even if only a few inches thick, and were hugely expensive. Electrostatic speakers still are, even today, usually large, expensive and confined to enthusiasts for elite audio. Electrostatic speakers are also finicky about placement, excellent for some kinds of music but not so much for other kinds, unforgiving in the way they reveal shortcomings in other parts of a system, etc. They also have relatively narrow and focused sweet spots where the sound is best, think the audio equivalent of the useful viewing angle of a LCD TV. For the record: I have over the years owned the original Quad Electrostatic speakers as well as Acoustat electrostatic and Magnepan ribbon panel speakers, so I know of what I speak about these sometimes difficult and often times amazing audio devices.So, for BenQ to include two relatively tiny electrostatic speakers, that fold out like wings from a tiny sub-woofer and amp section, at under $300 both raises eyebrows amongst people who have previously owned this kind of speaker and raises the question of just how good can this product sound?The answer is: better than I expected, but also a mini/micro version of the same characteristics that define full size electrostatics. The sound from the BenQ TreVolo is actually very good for music that is either acoustic or involves ambient qualities like the sound of a room in which a performance takes place or the presence of a naturally recorded vocal. In other words it seems best for classical, jazz, acoustic music, vocals and so forth. But it suffers in comparison to a conventional mini system with regular drivers and bigger sub-woofers for rock, hip hop, electronic and other forms of highly processed pop music. The amount of mid bass produced by the BenQ TreVolo's twin 2.5"" sub-woofers was rather good. The system has pre-set DSP  profiles for various genres of music and some listeners may either like or dislike those effects, or like them less as volume increases. The system is not a huge volume producer. But it also does not seem to suffer from the sweet spot effect. That may be because the speakers are so small that they are heard more as a point source.To be clear, the unit will play loud enough to be heard in a large area, just the same way as a computer monitor can be seen from across a large living room, although you wouldn't try and use it that way. As is true with most ""personal"" audio speakers the system is best used and experienced in relatively intimate surroundings, like a dining table area or a small living room or a bedroom. It is not what you should pick to fill up a big living room or party space. Connectivity options were plentiful, with Bluetooth, USB in and a audio line in connections. I had a good experience with Bluetooth playback, but tended to prefer using the docking mode of my phone to pair with the system through a USB cable. Battery life was very good, easily lasting an entire evening, although for at home use I left it connected to the charger. I did not try the speaker phone/Bluetooth option.Generally speaking I am happy with the BenQ TreVolo Electrostatic system because I have the right combination of music and environment, it's great for playing jazz and blues at the dinner table. If your music tastes and listening area coincide with what the BenQ TreVolo Electrostatic is really good at you will likely be a happy buyer.

"The ThermoWorks DOT Model TX-1200 is a great successor to and replacement for the now discontinued ThermoWorks TW362B Oven Cooking Thermometer/Timer. I was sort of upset when ThermoWorks discontinued the TW362B Oven Cooking Thermometer. I had really liked that model. But, after trying out the DOT I am enthusiastic about the DOT and the re-design.Although the DOT lacks a number of functions that were in the prior model the DOT has boiled, so to speak, the basic function that people actually use most of the time down into a simple, elegant and, to my eyes, very well made unit. The DOT has the industrial design elegance of the original iPods, for example, and many other great devices that combine form and function. All the DOT does is measure temp and sound an alarm at a preset temp level. That's it. But the fit and feel of the system is so superior to the countless cheap knock off and other oven thermo-timers on the market, and the probe and cable are rated for so much higher a temp, up to 700 degrees for the cable, that the price is a bargain after using and contemplating the DOT in person.And, and I think this is long over due, the probe is both shorter than probes used for past models and competing products, making it easier to clear the edges of pans and to place the probe in upright, and the probe is straight rather than ""J"" shaped, which makes it easier to place. I am a very pleased DOT buyer.

"The Proctor Silex 40884A Stainless Steel Electric Kettle is a fairly representative and good quality example of the current fashion for stainless finish electric water or ""tea"" kettles on sale worldwide. The pluses are the satin stainless finish, that is easier to keep clean than chromed finished kettles, and the low selling price. The body is actual steel, not plastic in a steel like color. The lid snaps shut with a latch that is button actuated on the handle. Some people may prefer a lid with handle or knob that is manually opened and closed. The dual water level windows, one on each side rather than in the handle make checking the later level easy for both left and right handed users. The only real negative is that it takes a relatively long time to come to a boil. This is somewhat typical of appliances sold in the US and other 110-120v electric current markets. But it does seem to take a bit longer than past kettles we have owned. I am of course convinced that there is one gigantic factory in China churning out zillions of such devices for sale around the world under various importer brand names. This has to be one of them.

"It's important to state right in the first sentence the two reasons that the Kenwood KM080AT Cooking Chef Machine is different from every other stand mixer on the market, and why it is different than all the other Kenwood stand mixer with similar styling that may look to be much the same. Those two reasons are: it has a built in induction burner heating element AND Kenwood has re-imagined the mixing bowl as a combination cooking pot/mixing bowl. The Kenwood Cooking Chef Machine also includes a Cuisinart like food processor, chopper and shredder and a built in Blender attachment. Kenwood obviously has made its mission on Earth to allow you to need nothing else in your kitchen to fix a meal.How successful are they at that goal? That depends on a lot of variables that come down to both the cooking habits and practices of the user, the kitchen it's going to be placed in, and whether or not you buy into the whole meal prepped and cooked with one device idea or see it rather as a set of distinct tools you may use for this or use for that in concert with your other cooking pots and pans and routines.First, this thing is the Death Star of kitchen machines. It is big, it is heavy, it will dominate any counter top it is placed on. At forty-pounds in weight it will likely stay planted wherever you choose to place it. Those of you accustomed to taking the mixer off the shelf to use it and putting it back will need either a personal trainer or one of those kitchen beasts of burden known as a husband. It's likely to stay put.The food processor attachment is a reasonably good Cuisinart substitute, and the blender is pretty good as a blender. But the real question of course is ""what about this cooking in the mixing bowl thing?"".Although Kenwood would like to promote the idea that you can cook almost anything with the Cooking Chef Machine the fact is, as any experienced cook knows, that some recipes need a vessel or pan of a certain shape or behavior and other recipes need other types. The one vessel for everything idea has been promoted for decades to sell Crock Pots, for example. Although Kenwood has re-imagined the bowl as a pot it is still shaped like a bowl. That means that, aside from height and width, that it has a relatively small footprint, or base, in contact with the heating element. That's not a bad thing, but just as with a normal sauce pan or pot it does impact on what you will do with it.The Cooking Chef Machine would seem especially good for soups and sauces, especially for sauces that need constant whisking. I was able to make a very good Bchamel sauce, for example and let the mixer do the work of whisking the roux and then the milk until the milk set and the sauce thickened. Makers of chocolate sauces and various deserts would probably find the Cooking Chef Machine very useful. Although one can of course make risotto, notorious for its need for hands on adding and stirring until the right consistency arrives, in a bowl shaped pot, risotto is really happier in a skillet or saut pan. Nevertheless, I forged ahead using the Cooking Chef Machine to keep the risotto moving while adding liquid every few minutes and was able to produce a risotto with very nice texture. And lest we forget, the Cooking Chef Machine is a very powerful conventional mixer, and will easily conquer all kinds of baking and other projects that stand mixers are uniquely suited for. I used it to whip up several batches of quinoa muffins, which may not be a test of industrial strength, but it's a great mixer.A wide range of recipes can be cooked with the Cooking Chef Machine, but some of them may need to, and the operative words here are ""NEED TO"", be re-imagined a bit to adapt to the re-imagined cooking pot/mixing bowl. Although it was a little disconcerting to see something bubbling away in the bowl, I mean pot, of a stand mixer, the idea is sound if you have reasonable expectations. One slightly annoying issue is that Kenwood supplies a plastic shield to fit over the underside of the mixer head when using the machine for cooking. That of course is to protect the head from steam and so forth but it is, just like the pouring shields for KitcheAid mixers that we all think are a good idea and then lose or break, just another part to keep track of and avoid damaging.The big issues in assessing the Cooking Chef Machine come down to whether or not you will use it as Kenwood intends, as a complete solution, or will you see it as a set of discrete functions that you would use just the same way you would use a separate food processor, blender, hot plate and mixer? And, last but not least: price. The asking price for this system is easily equal to a restaurant style six burner gas cook top or a new behemoth side by side refrigerator. Kenwood knows their business, but I am not sure who the customer is for a two-thousand dollar mixer, no matter how ingenious and well made.But, one market that the Cooking Chef Machine might have worldwide, that might not be so obvious to Americans, accustomed to kitchens as big as shopping malls, is in the sort of tiny kitchens that are common in European apartments and many other places around the world. The typical Parisian apartment, for example, makes do with a two burner hot plate, a microwave, a bar sink, and a mini fridge. In such a small a limited cooking space the Cooking Chef Machine might loom especially large but it also might add a lot of functionality and be worth the price. In American kitchens, which are big enough to be subdivided into apartments, its value might seem more mysterious.I am giving the Cooking Chef Machine four stars for its quality, many useful functions, and unique and ingenious functionality. I am knocking a star off only due to the Hedge Fund manager level price. In the Hamptons, Aspen or Silicon Valley the cost of the Cooking Chef Machine is barely a rounding error.

"The weBoost Drive 4G-M Cell Phone Booster Kit delivers an effective increase in cell phone range for users working at the fringes of cell coverage in rural areas or in urban environments where obstructions or transitions from one tower to the next create cell coverage dead spots. The installation of the kit, including running the various cables and placing the removable external antenna, recalls the requirements that were once common in the days of CB radios or retrofitting older cars with stereo systems.I live in an area of low rolling hills with thick tree cover where there is a particular low spot that always seems to produce dropped calls. I also frequently go by car to a vacation area near the coast here that is just far enough away from ""civilization"" that cell reception is always spotty at best, and sometimes non existent. Although cell coverage in any modern urban area is near total and coverage along highways is almost always complete these sorts of problem areas can be frustrating. Travel too far away from the highway or from developed areas and you can rapidly be back in 1980 connection wise -- cut off from the Internet of your everything, constant updates of every little thing and comments flowing to and from your life. Some might argue that this would be good for you. But the practical reality is that people want to stay connected, even in the bottom of a sinkhole or the vast western outdoors. Using the weBoost Drive 4G-M eliminated the dead spot in my neighborhood all together and provided enough connection in the rural vacation area for a solid 3G connection.I was the only user so I can't comment on multi user access through the system. But for me it worked as intended. The only hitch with the weBoost Drive 4G-M is the installation. Installation is straightforward. But it does assume that you either don't mind cables being visible in your vehicle, for the inside antenna, the attachment of the power adapter to a cigarette lighter style power source, and for the cable run to the surface mounted external antenna, or that your vehicle is built in a way that makes lifting up molding edges or carpets straightforward enough to run cables out of sight. Depending on the style and fit of your vehicle interior you  may need a professional installer, if only for the sake of neatness. The assumption is that you will either place the head unit under the dash, an increasingly rare place in modern cars with center consoles, or under one of the front seats. Either way the external antenna is definitely not a fashion accessory for the beauty of your vehicle.I set my system up as a temporary installation with the cables visible as I didn't plan to use the unit all the time. But users planning on leaving the system in place should contemplate the requirements of their car or truck or RV interior. An RV is probably the friendliest installation environment for this system. For urban users the system may offer only minimal gains in coverage, due to the saturation of urban areas with towers. But if you work in or travel to rural areas and have to stay connected then the system could be a real connection saver.

"Let me say up front that I am a fan of Kraus faucets, and have previously bought and installed several of them in my home. I like the Kraus design sense, and I very much like the models that come in either stainless steel or a stainless steel look finish. In the case of the Kraus KPF-1630SS Single Lever Pull-down Kitchen Faucet reviewed here, it arrived at just the right moment as an IKEA single lever faucet that had been installed in a previous kitchen remodel was getting a little edgy. And, the new Kraus was my chance to redeem myself in the eyes of the significant other, who had never quite forgiven me for buying and installing a single hole sink with no spray attachment and then installing a single lever faucet with no pull out sprayer. The new Kraus set all that straight.Single hole kitchen faucets are, assuming you have some access and reach up to the rear of the sink, very easy to swap out. In under half an hour I had the old IKEA faucet out and the new Kraus faucet in. It looks great, I am very happy with the stainless look finish. Functionality of the pull out spray attachment is very smooth. All in all a win-win faucet choice in this house.

"Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream arrives in a jar that exudes the aura of a high quality cosmetic cream. The time line suggested by Scalisi for best results with the cream, up to six months, is a lot longer than the deadline for a review of the cream. But in the first three weeks of trying it out every day the cream has been a pleasure to use, very soothing to the skin, with a scent that is perhaps innocuous but pleasant and unlikely to clash with other products.The dispenser top is an interesting solution to the problem of jar tops that require the user to scoop some cream out with their finger tips and pumps that always leave a usable amount of the product in the container when the pump ""runs out"". You can have your cake and eat it too with the convenience of a pump, very ingeniously designed and embedded in the top, and the ability to take the jaw wide top off and get that last little bit of expensive cream.Of course topical creams can't really fix underlying conditions, that may be rooted in your DNA, your age and health issues, and of course everyone hopes that they might, a hope that springs eternal. But the results so far have been encouraging, it at least has had a soothing and somewhat softening effect. Long term or if you stopped using it, difficult to say so far. Will keep using the product and report back with a review update further along in the six months that Scalisi suggests for getting the best results. For now, although it is somewhat expensive, if the price point is within your comfort zone it's recommended to try with hopes for good things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R467O5KBAEASD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHXE948#wasThisHelpful","R467O5KBAEASD","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Linksys AC3200 Tri-Band Smart Wi-Fi Router has tremendous specs and potential but it is also a bit problematic. A quick survey of user reviews on Amazon of recent high-end high performance Linksys wireless routers reveals a small number of users who have a deep love/hate relationship with the various 802.11AC multi antenna models that Linksys has recently brought to market. Many users love the routers, the majority of reviews are positive. But there is a vociferous minority of recent buyers who swear the routers are ether possessed by the devil or are Satan himself masquerading as an access point. Many of the complainers are Mac users. I am not a Mac user myself, so I can't speak directly to what's going on there. But there does seem to be a built in problem with these routers that may not in any way derive from incompetency on the part of Linksys so much as a gross mismatch in both user expectations, real world use and compatibility.For one thing, although many new devices come with 802.11AC included the vast majority of devices in use pre-date 802.11AC and are probably 802.11N at best. NONE of the advanced features touted for the Linksys router will work without 802.11AC compatibility. Even if you have 802.11AC compatibility there is the issue of 5Ghz range and penetration. 5Ghz is generally speaking a poorer wall penetrator than 2.4GHz. Also, the monster bandwidths advertised for 802.11AC utilize a much broader, up to 160MHz, bandwidth and a multi antenna mode, which assumes a relatively non competitive environment with other devices needing their own bandwidth. And, of course as channel width increases transmit power decreases. Even with Beamforming and MIMO technology the trade offs may result in a wash on range and connectivity. And, last but not least, let's not forget all this horsepower may be throttled in the end by the user having only a 50-100 MBPS Internet connection to their ISP.I was able to get flawless 802.11N performance out of my Linksys AC3200 Tri-Band Router on the 2.4 band. However, in my own home environment I have never had much luck with 5Ghz connections, and the performance of the router in the 5Ghz band was spotty, including lost connections and connected thruput that was not terribly higher than on the 2.4 band 802.11N. As it's always worth saying: your results may differ. Despite a few hostile rants by some users about the firmware I didn't have any trouble at all setting up the Linksys AC3200 system using the browser interface. But the maximum performance available from the technology deployed here, beamforming and MIMO and so forth, is theoretical at best for most home users. As with all things involving the commodification of once advanced technology, the price point for this technology is falling rapidly. I wouldn't over pay for it now, when the benefits are largely abstract at best for 99% of the users and applications out there. I am giving it four stars because I think it's a quality unit with good technology, even if its absolute performance may remain elusive for many users.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9XUDLOHF90S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON7AX3U#wasThisHelpful","R2G9XUDLOHF90S","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's mostly the nostalgia effect, but I love this fan. There were many fans like this one in my childhood world, back in the Jurassic era. Way before modern plastic molding technology and computer design made it possible to maximize air movement, minimize noise effect and make a fan look like whatever zoomy shape you wanted it to be, there were these machine age fans.Although none of the fans from way back, that I ever saw, were finished in brushed nickel silver, this is a pretty good recreation of the classic post-WWII pre-60s metal desk fan. Just like the old days it has a sweep bar control on the base, and the styling is spot on, although the fan blades seem to have been updated slightly. It is retro in its noise versus wind produced ratio also. Some people may think it doesn't put out enough wind for the amount of sound that also is generated. But that's not the reason you buy a unit like this. It seems solidly made, looks great, and is authentic except for its lighter weight and not being finished in industrial black paint.

"I love this casserole. Part of it is nostalgia, I grew up with dinners being cooked in and served out of casseroles like this, but the larger part is the quality and practicality of the dish itself. Although I have a wide number of other casserole and roasting pans, in glass and nonstick coated metal,  that serve well for baking a casserole, the KitchenAid Streamline Ceramic Casserole is the only one that both cooks well and also looks good enough to use for serving on the table. It's solid and heavy duty, and has a pleasing heft and quality feel. The finish is very good and clean up was a snap. Although I wasn't sure about the color scheme when I saw the pics of it on-line the casserole in person is really charming and attractive. All in all this is great for lasagna and baked pasta dishes.

"The Linksys AC2400 4X4 Dual-Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router is one of the increasing number of hyper competent high bandwidth wireless routers on offer that are difficult to evaluate on a single criteria. Gone are the days when routers did little but create home or office networks for sharing a single connection to the net. These days modem connected bandwidth for some, but not all, homes has exploded to over 100 mps in many cases, and everything form streaming videos to on-line gaming now places previously unimaginable burdens on thru-put. But, that said, most day in day out uses of a net connection are very ordinary and mundane.As a wireless router the Linksys AC2400 will easily allow you to connect your home or office network and configure it for whatever security level suits you. It has all the standard interface features and security standards. It also has both USB and eSATA ports for connecting shared storage and printer devices. There really isn't much to say -- without repeating a long long list of industry standard features and specs and modes and commenting on the aesthetics of the plastics used for the box -- other than, like a microwave, it sits there and churns along doing a great job. That last statement in itself is testimony to how far we have come, that a feature rich, high performance piece of technology like this, that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, has now become a mere utensil, a commonplace consumer product sold at affordable prices.It's at the extreme that the router's high-end specs come into play. The ability to stream wireless bandwidth substantially above the actual bandwidth that the entire home net is connected to is a feature that may not be a value added feature except for a very small slice of the user base. The total bandwidth ability of the router may in fact be only relevant for large office installations where dozens of users are all attempting to use the system at once. Or for video gamers wanting to get max thru-put and take advantage of the system's MU-MIMO Ready connectivity for high demand video centric applications.For the average user these abilities are just not an issue. And the system may be over kill for a single person, a couple, or even a large family wanting to do basic net chores and tasks. That said, all the usual issues like setup and installation, security and so forth worked easily and flawlessly. Coverage was excellent and there were no dead spots in our house with this router driving the WAN. I am not a gamer, so I can't critique how it worked for intensely interactive purposes. And I am of course not fifty people all wanting to access the router at once.The Linksys AC2400 4X4 Dual-Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router  is unlikely to ever have its full potential used in an average household. But that doesn't mean that you should avoid it. Quite the contrary, if the price suits your budget you could probably do little better than to build its redundant capacity into your home network. At the end of the day the Linksys AC2400 is a very high end wireless router that will only be limited by the bandwidth of your connection to the net, and the wireless abilities of your connected devices of course, and allow print serving and shared storage for your WAN. There's no reason to buy a lesser router if this router hits your price point.

"""Amore: An American Father's Roman Holiday"", by Roger Friedland, has many fine qualities.  But it is also not without quirks, intermittent flat spots and tangents. What book of personal experience in a world of blogging and self-aware long form reportage of the minutely personal is not? That said, and although prose is wholly a matter of personal taste, this reviewer found the book a bit of a slog.""Amore: An American Father's Roman Holiday"" is in many ways representative of a modern genre of writing that might be termed a long form blog, a stream of topics, events, reminisces, opinion and idealized depictions of the environment, broken up into what might be called chapters or might be called posts, laced together by a recollection or an event, maybe many of them, all cohered by an underlying opinion or theory. A novel it is not. As a letter home it is too long, and as a 350+ page blog it is too much.The author has, for this reader, the annoying practice of mixing past tense descriptions in present tense situations, rather than telling thematically whole stories of what happened in the past or how something was. The author confuses recounting information and details with story telling, which it is not. If it had been written with a more literary sense of place, prose and events, and with both more discipline and more wit or anger in forming the narration of things seen and felt, the book could have been twice as long and four times more interesting. There are a wealth of interesting observations and fascinating individuals in it. As it is, the voice on the page makes it twice too long and, for this reader, rarely involving.Friedland nevertheless has a keen eye for cultural behavior and customs. There is a lot of texture and detail about Rome and life there in this book, as seen from his expatriate moralist viewpoint. The author idealizes Rome, and the implication throughout is that this is the better way to live, a view that reflects on American society in a way that seems to annoy some American Amazon reviewers. A main theme in the book is the author's concern for the toxic effect on his daughters of American style pop-feminist culture, personified for the author by the insidious person of Madonna, with its perceived emphasis on warrior bitches and role playing slut chic empowerment. Friedland's idealization of Rome assumes Rome to be a safer place with a distinct and more deeply human culture that is resistant to soulless American influences and gynokult propaganda. He was intent during his time in Rome that his daughters come of age in imperfect and sometimes traumatic Rome rather than in imperfect and sometimes traumatic America. The cultural context and style in which one is excited, traumatized, saddened, inspired or enchanted in youth leaves a lasting impression, and Friedland wanted his daughters to be cast and molded by experiences with a distinct not in America flavor.Friedland has a worthwhile point to make, albeit a politically incorrect one that is sure to annoy those fueled by received wisdom in the United States. But he does not illustrate his views with any narrative events that convey the choices, consequences or realities of the two worlds he has posed against each other. His ideas of Rome may be an expatriate's romance of place as much as it may be a reality. But if there is one thing true about the Internet as a global force, and about the techno-aristocracy and global media and marketing corporations that profit from it, it is the instinct to make the world like California and to make America like the world. There may be no escape, even for refugees seeking peace in the heart of ancient empires.It is interesting to note that Rome, especially ancient Rome, with all its many sins, faults, mayhem, dysfunctions, vanities, cruelties and debacles, has persisted through two-thousand years of history to remain a hazy ideal to many people in western societies. In the case of the ""Amore: An American Father's Roman Holiday"", the author takes the view that modern Rome, with its deeply ancient core at the heart of a sprawling city that is in so many ways deeply imperfect and brutal as an urban, civil and social environment, embodies an adaptation of human nature to reality that is more in tune with life and love. Rome has caused many Americans and British to exult in print about a freedom that they did not have at home. But Rome as a society frequently remains opaque and inscrutable to the readers of the many books that have been spawned by expatriates recounting their time spent and their loves had there. It's possible that it may be that way even to the Romans.Rome is the original Cosmopolitan society. But it's organized for a far older and perhaps more realistic set of assumptions about human nature than modern pious America, the land of perfectible human nature and experience. One can enjoy Roman Cosmopolitanism without being insanely ambitious, endlessly productive, tightly scheduled, fully booked, wealthy, morally obsessed or endlessly judged before courts of literal minded goodness. Who is to say which place is best for each reader? In fact America may very well be all about the perfectibility of human nature while Rome is all about he complete imperfectability of human nature, whether before God, law, science, history or authority.For the author of ""Amore: An American Father's Roman Holiday"" the old ways obviously make for a happier place, even if they do not make for a completely engaging or cogent book of his consciousness midst the subject. Although the world does not perhaps need a ""Daddy Dearest"" take by the daughters on Mr. Friedland's experiment, it would be interesting to know how this voyage seemed to the objects of his worry and the beneficiaries, for better or worse, of his quest. But that's another book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33NKRFPMCP1RO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325582#wasThisHelpful","R33NKRFPMCP1RO","A1ZPKKWT79C6HW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPKKWT79C6HW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ipevo CDCU-04IP VX-1 Internet Conference Station is an extremely well implemented conference call solution for the remarkably low price of about $200.00 on Amazon at the time of this review. Although I have no office colleagues to teleconference with, nor any distant workgroups or family members to teleconference with, I do have a spouse that has exactly those professional situations to cope with and who works from home frequently while conferencing with many different parties far and wide. The setup for the device is so simple that it barely rates a description, It really is pretty much plug and go.Although designed to allow multiple people in one place to converse with one or more people in a remote location or home office, the main use for it here was to allow someone to walk around while speaking in a normal tone of voice and to also listen to the remote parties speaking in something resembling good fidelity that does not sound like a squawking speaker-phone. On all counts the device worked smoothly, had good sound, and seemed to provide the remote listeners with stable and consistent voice quality whenever there was speaking from this end, even though the distance from and orientation to the station varied back and forth from moment to moment.The only downside of switching to this solution from a headset with attached mike or a blue-tooth headset is that now I get to hear the entire conference too. But that's what noise canceling headphones are for. One device addith better connectivity and sound, another device taketh away the noise and chatter. Progress. A great value.

"I really believe in this Scent A-Way Max, Odorless Spray. I am skeptical about scents and odor control untill I see the results firsthand. I wanted to see how animals reacted to my presense ,on a real  hunt. I just got back from a Western Style High Desert  Mule Deer spot and stalk, rifle hunt. I would spray this product on my clothing and me, right before I entered the sagebrush,into one of my several hundred yard long, honey holes.  It had also rained a little overnight ,so the stalking was a little bit quieter.  With this product sprayed on me and  my clothing, I was amazed at how much  closer I could get, to the small groups of does, before they busted me and scattered, compared to when, I had not used this product. Product is engineered to attract and attack odor causing bacteria. I never did spook up a buck this hunt, but had several opportunities for a harvest, had it been a buck I spooked up.  Remember these animals, deer and elk , live there on the high desert and are on the highest alert for movement and scent ,of their other main  predators ,the wily cougar and wolves  24 hours a day ,every day of thier lives. I really believe this product really  helps eliminate  human odor , that along with other prevailing  conditions , will help you achieve your goal of harvesting, the big  game animal, that you have a legal tag for.  I give this product a very high recommendtion for, overall human scent conrol  along with weather /wind conditions, to help a hunter in  harvesting a legal wild game animal.

"This New Hunters Specialties  Scent A-Way  Kit, comes with everything to keep you and your clothes  odor free, before and when you are  on the hunt .These products contain a biologically engineered enzymatic complex ,that provides odor prevention and control ,so you and your clothing, can be scent free on your next hunting experience. When my clothes are washed and dried with products in kit, I put them in a plastic bag,squeeze out most of the air, and tie it up, and only  open it up, right before I  get ready to put them on,for a hunt.  Product also features a $5 mail in rebate. I hunt spot and stalk style ,on foot,with my rifle,  for Mule Deer in the West and find if I use this system, I am more likely to get closer to all game  animals and have  the chance to get closer, to a bedded down  Monster Buck, before he gets a whiff of me. I give this kit a high recommendation for, an overall scent control system, from bath, to clothing, to the hunting woods.

"This new Kast King SuperPower Moss Green  Braided Fishing line, is taking my Pacific Ocean Bottom Fishing, to a new higher level of performance.

"This comes to us from 1972, more than 40 years ago at this writing. So, it's a nice enough plot: Our Heroes visit some backward world, have adventures, and save it.Add in 60s/70/ lines and drawing, not too different from Asterix, and you've got a lot of it.But, this also has the ""battle of the sexes"" theme going on, where Man vs. Woman was a confrontation..The M/F team split up early on, and she ends up in a bikini.So many comics and other stories from that era presuppose enmity - I find it so disappointing.Fair story, fair enough art, broken premises.

"The plot centers on petty jealousies and control posturing. Beautifully, elegantly done, but with emotional depth my middle school might have been ashamed of.But, I found the styles fascinating. Even a lady's fashionable figure is subject to the fashion of the moment, and those very fashionable ladies had broader shoulder, hips, and waist than any current magazine could advertise.But that was hot then, and I like it, and I like it in the very attractive ladies around me today.I might not remember the action in this movie, but I hope I remember the actresses.-- wiredweird","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R52MGCG1IGK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D1CRV2#wasThisHelpful","R1R52MGCG1IGK8","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Especially good if you and your date are well along in life.It's sort of an ""odd couple"" movie with a premise that needs to be taken seriously: experience keeps on counting. Business, business models, work, and workplaces change drastically over decades, but the people in them haven't changed much for thousands of years. Knowing the people keeps on mattering - much to the surprise of Jules, who complained ""He's too observant.""But, in the end, it's a feel-good flick. The older Ben doesn't come in like a white knight to save Jules from herself. He's there to help her succeed, both at work and at home, a subtlety that raises this one above cliche. Speaking of which, I kind of wondered about that workplace romance of Ben's until I realized that was another cliche-breaker. It gave Ben a romantic interest (and pajama party partner) other than the leading lady, so defused that potential complication. By directing Ben's love life elsewhere, it helped stabilize the personal and professional relationship between Ben and Jules. Yes, men and women can be friends and colleagues without Cupid mucking things up - I thank the movie for remembering that!So, this one's hard to describe. It feels like a happy genre flick, until you start to think about it. Then you realize that it undoes some of the most common tropes and re-does them, only better.-- wiredweird","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYH9PDBDDZMQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TGNFQK#wasThisHelpful","RYH9PDBDDZMQS","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is a charming one: An unlikely pair becoming fast friends and, in the end, reach for their dreams, together. It's perfectly chaste, but there's a Romeo and Juliet quality about their friendship in the face of objections from each one's family and community - or maybe more of a  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner feeling, toned down enough for a children's story.It's not the story I'll remember this for, though. It's the gorgeous, painterly animation. According to the extras, each scene had to be animate three times: once for the line work, again for the color, and yet again to put the physics of watercolor paints into each frame. Whatever they did, it works, and works beautifully. The watercolor feeling gives this a gentle feel, and ties the imagery together into a unified whole. Even more, though, it gives an expressive range that normal animation can't approach: dense, dark cellars, busy city scenes, or lone characters as the sole mark on the page. The artistic crew really got it, and made it come to life. I can think of only one other animation that uses that look and, as much as I love the other, E&C mastered it.As a kid's movie, I imagine it works well - but haven't kid-tested it myself. But, as a distinctive achievement in animation technique, I recommend it to anyone who loves the medium.-- wiredweird","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R280E12YJKK8SM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOT10SM#wasThisHelpful","R280E12YJKK8SM","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit, I haven't kid-tested it. To me, it's mostly a silly set of sight gags, on the general theme of cleaned-up movie monsters.

"Miss Naomi must have been huge fun at parties.This grandmother amassed a wonderful collection of art regarding human reproduction, apparently spurred my a mostly-innocent request from an adult son.It's an amazing assemblage. This doesn't divide into chapters, but it has some inner logic of its own, shifting from topic to topic, often before I knew it had happened. So what's here? Well, everything. 1950s girly kitsch, prehistoric sculpture, paintings from India in or imitating the Moghul era, African fetishes, sculpture, drawing, litho, painting, music boxes, ash trays, and pretty much everything else you can (or can't) imagine. Nothing goes far into the dark side, but an awful lot goes into the dork side.I call this a gold mine of erotic art. But, please remember that a commercial gold mine these days yields one gram of gold per tonne of ore, or less. You'll find some lovely nuggets here, but a fair bit more dross, too.

"As a technical manual for a 21st century student, don't get your hopes up. Where you or I might reach for any of several torches, Fuller relies on coal fires - but I never imagined how many ways you could build a furnace for, or in, or around a workpiece. I admire these guys (yes, all guys) so much more for the blunt instruments they made such fine work with. Forging, moving metal, hasn't changed since metallurgy hasn't changed, and the student looking for technique might find some novel approaches. Well, not 'novel' exactly, but ready for resurgence.The second reader that might benefit is the one working large - like a sculpture I once saw, saw, a deep-relief figure maybe a meter by two or a bit more, raised from heavy-gauge copper. Beautiful, but way beyond the dinner-plate sizes most modern authors address. This book divides work loosely into three scales: kitchen-sized, up to ten liter capacity (very roughly); ten to a hundred, for stills, dyeing, and such; and a thousand liters or more, for big industrial applications. I know I left a gap there - that's where steam locomotive and similar works fit in. My own interests lie in the size range you can hold easily in your hands, so the others interest me only academically.But the third reader - perhaps also one of the other kinds - reads the history of technology. Native copper gave the most primitive metal-workers their start, and metalworkers have advanced every other technology since the start of the Bronze Age. This book reveals some of the trade secrets of the time, and shows how these master artisans developed the craft that enabled industry, transportation, and the advancing days of the Machine Age. The scientists of that era stand out in history; the engineers gave that science a job, but the tradesmen and skilled makers brought the engineering to life. This book gives some idea of how the blue collar men (yes,men) made all of that real.But, books like this assume the reader knows things that have since been forgotten. For example, what is 'Spanish brown'? It seems to patinate and maybe texture the metal, but I have not yet learned the chemical how and why. The amazing mix of knowledge recovered and knowledge lost keeps me coming back to books like these.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2WAQUJ0BLFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D45HY4S#wasThisHelpful","R3B2WAQUJ0BLFS","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Heck even with her super-suit suffering dire wardrobe malfunctions, she could still outdo and out-think the lot of them - not that the latter would be hard even for a deranged squirrel.But, in the end, there's some chance she'll be vindicated. After all her unseen and disbelieved heroics, there's now that camera that captured her saving the world from deadly threats ...... which I take as a cliffhanger, teasing us back to see how events eventuate in the next chapter.

Through hard work, square dealing, other people's moral flaws, and an eidetic memory, he comes home as captain of same, with cutie daughter of interstellar nabob pretty much ready to follow him to the altar.But it has all the marks of Heinlein, too. 'Learn math - the others didn't, and look at them.' (I pretty much agree.) 'Stick to your core values.' (Externals change from one place and time to another.) 'Duty first.' (Responsibilities you take on constrain you at least as much as they empower you.) 'It's not about you.' (Not even your own life, lots of times.) And, in the end, the ship's captain gets busted back to the lowest rank - but still ahead of the game, and with the rest of his life ahead of him.It could have been worse. It almost was, lots of times and lots of ways. But it wasn't, in the end, and there's nothing wrong with a blue sky and a quiet place to sit.-- wiredweirdPS: This came from the era when Heinlein could still write an entire story.

"I have only vague recollections of the original, but this matches closely enough for remake purposes. And, like any good remake, adds a fair bit of its own to the classic characters. Napoleon Solo, for example, seems closer to the [[ASIN: B00004RG62 early James Bond]] in his taste for the finer things - a taste he supplies somewhat beyond a civil servants nominal income. Ilya Kuryakin comes across a good bit more gritty and less sane than I recall. All of which just amps up the personality clashes, and gives room for some Bond-like humor - as if the throwback 1960s fashions weren't smirk-worthy already.Then there's all the action and running around you might expect. But this isn't the 1960s any more. Half a century later, things have changed. In particular, the spy flick genre isn't a men's club any more, even if the modern movie portays a Cold War script. Alicia Vikander's character adds balance. And in the inevitable sequel-bait at the end, makes us look forward to the next installment.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RH64VGJ33QRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZS21LMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1RH64VGJ33QRY","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This clever and enjoyable book meanders across a surprising range of topics. It starts by discussing the mathematics of robot arms, with sidebars that define and explain the vocabulary of mathematical proof. After the abstract elements, it adds notions like limits on the angles at which joints can bend, and the idea that a robot arm can't pass through itself. This of course (?!) introduces the biological problem of protein folding, again reduced to its core abstractions.From the jointed connections of robot arms, O'Rourke moves on to linkages, like the pantographs you see on top of electric trains. It's easy to forget, in our digital age, that mechanical control once depended on the cleverness of engineers to turn the motion of a revolving shaft into the complex actions that would, for example, mechanically fold a box - or write someone's name. The author then translates this into paper pop-ups. That's where paper folding starts ...You get the idea. Each step in this narrative seems to follow naturally from the one before. Only in retrospect does the trip from protein structure to the Miura fold of a satellite's solar array seem improbable. The readable but fairly rigorous analysis in each discussion shows the mathematical richness of each structure. This neatly inverts the usual question about math: what's it for? Here, analysis and theory arise from physical structures, instead of residing in some realm of pure thought.Still, there's only so much any author can cram into about 175 profusely illustrated pages, Each section seemed like a bare introduction, leaving me hungry for more - or at least for references that could sate the thirst this stirs. It's a great way to show how theoretical questions arise from real-world observations, and an introduction to some startling but approachable conclusions.It just doesn't go far enough in any of its many directions to instil a real sense of satisfaction, though.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ESBY6WSXCOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521145473#wasThisHelpful","R14ESBY6WSXCOH","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know exactly who this book is for (me, among others, about 15 years ago), but I'm still not sure how to describe it. Thar reader is fluent enough with normal programming languages that bits of syntax won't be a problem - making it that much easier to address the problematic parallelism implicit in HDLs. That reader also has a fair understanding about the bits & bobs of logic design: gates, RAMs, registers, and the like, but maybe never took the second course in logic design.This book, a companion to Readler's ""VHDL by example,"" gives the novice a running start at the other major hardware design language. People on both sides can get pretty het up about which is The One, often along geographic lines (Europe vs. US, East coast vs. West coast). The fact is, though, that you don't often get to pick. Your employer, your work group or client, the tools and libraries available to you will often make the choice for you. So, it's best to know both, and Readler's books treat them with a reasonably even hand.In the unlikely event that you're free to choose, it's a matter of taste. I certainly have my preferences, but they don't matter much. Verilog reminds a programmer of C - I mean, K&R C, from way back, with all the good and bad that implies. Include files, scopeless macro definition, and uninformative module (or function) prototypes will all look familiar. VHDL, on the other hand, derives consciously from Ada, with all the good and bad that implies. That includes packages (which no one uses), operator overloads (which no one thinks they use, but do), and draconian type checking - something that will cost you a lot of time, but very likely save you even more.Like its VHDL twin, this gives only the basics, i.e. what you'll use for about 97% of your HDL coding. Like the other, it introduces test benches - just as well, and just as badly. On the ""well"" side, it shows the basic structure of a test driver, clock generator, test stimulus and housekeeping. On the ""badly"" side, it provides inputs but never checks outputs. In industry, your logic might be subjected to nightly regression tests, where a robot controller expects your tests to verify the outputs and give a go/nogo output in machine-readable form. These days, a big logic design includes billions or tens of billions of transistors. Believe me, you won't do eyeball checks of waveforms on each input and output. Saying ""I checked the output and it looked good"" simply is not an answer.And, I have to raise a personal peeve about every HDL book in the world, this included. There are lots of things you can put in the synthesizable payload logic: memories, boolean goodies, registers, and simple arithmetic. There are lots of things you can't: print statements, mod and div operators, and lots more. The synthesizable can go into your FPGA or anywhere; the un-synthesizable can exist only in your simulation environment. You need both, but you also need to draw a thick black line between the two, and never even think about the simulation-only features when you code your payload logic. No book I've seen (this included) emphasizes that distinction, and it's a huge barrier for many students. That said, this book is no worse than any other I know.So, it's basic. It's very basic. Any competent instructor would get you way past this level in a hurry. But many people, my niece included, don't have instructors, competent or otherwise. If you're lifting yourself by your own bootstraps into the esoterica of HDL logic design, this is the best Verilog book I know. You'll need a lot more to gain strength as a logic designer, but everyone has to start somewhere. Bon voyage!-- wiredweird","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUMZF7Y9NLH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983497303#wasThisHelpful","R2FUMZF7Y9NLH9","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doesn't everyone want attention? Face it, top or bottom, you get someone's undivided attention.There are lots of erotic comics out there, but I recommend only three. Four now. They're Foglio's laugh-out-loud XXXenophiles, Quinn's Shadow and Light series (still my favorite), and Coover's Small Favors. I like a few others, though not as much, and most I just give away or throw away. This one's a keeper.It has all the shy charm of a first date, but with the intense edge of two people desperate for the other half of something special. I thought it odd that Amazon categorized this as romance - but it is, with all the trust, openness, and hope that romance implies. Plus some fancy toys and costumes, but we're grownups, right?Another thing occurred to me, making me update this review. A boy/girl BDSM story has an inherent power role, whether he's top or she is (standard power role or reversed). Since the two who matter are both women here, the whole boy/girl thing goes away. It's about fun (edgy or out-there fun) and play, and who plays how. It's about giving and receiving, where gender equality brings that to the front. Yes, the girl-on-girl thing has its appeal, but I think I like the layer under that even more.If you're looking for the steamiest of encounters, well, they're mostly implied. All (almost all) of the squishy details hide discreetly in the space between panels. Lots of lesser comics can flood your pages with those body fluids. This is about the seduction, embarrassing moments (and haven't we all had a few?), anticipation, and afterglow that make each couple and each encounter a story worth telling. Think what you will about the unseen and implied - I certainly do - but what this portrays really is romance.

"I started life in software, but spent some years doing logic design for application-specific processors -- custom supercomputers on demand. I taught (or tried to teach) a second course in logic design, and spent more years developing tools for logic design. Way early on, this book could have done very good things for me. And, now that I have a college-age niece who wants to know logic design but has no path to it within her school, I picked this up as a possible crutch for getting her through a program that seemed like a good idea at the time.Given the level it approaches, this is the best book I've seen to date. It's what I'd recommend to anyone with interest, zero knowledge, and an FPGA eval board to play with. Like my niece will be,after Christmas. It starts around the ""Hello, world"" level, given that ""Hello, world"" might involve stdio etc.It moves gently up to simple functions and synchronous logic, then gets vague and theoretical about more complex systems and tools - as well it should. The tools change so often and so much (as he points out), and the fabric underneath changes so often (as he doesn't), that specifics can only hamstring this book's student.I can point out many weaknesses in this text, most of which are also strengths. It skips over package definition files in favor of cut&pasting interface definitions into the tens or hundreds of uses of that interface. On the minus side, packages encourage one definition one place, unlike this policy - but, on the plus side, this unfortunate policy really does prevail in industry. (Software guys accustomed to header files can face-palm now.) The author doesn't crisply distinguish compile time constant expressions (CTCEs) from synthesizable logic, nor synthesizable from simulatable. For me, these are hard lines: floating point, for example, can be CTCE and simulatable without being synthesizable. But, perhaps, these distinctions become clear only after some time spent in the software world. Drawing this line might be outside the range expected of this book's intended reader, and I have to honor that decision.The author also assumes the reader's ease in discussing output drive strength and slew rates, very analog concepts, at the same time as discussing modular design - a staple of the software world. Well, brace yourself. You finally fell into the crack between hardware and software. Both and neither apply. I wanted to score this text lower, and tried to, but can not honestly do so. For all its many and deep flaws, this does the best job I ever saw at the level it means to address. Now that I have a student at this level and studying on her own (we connect only sporadically), this has my highest recommendation.-- wiredweird","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBAQ115FLFVMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983497354#wasThisHelpful","RBAQ115FLFVMD","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... all those fairy tales were real? Or real enough, at least - and made real by some evil corporate type making a fast buck (or megabuck) from the characters. That's pretty much how this one goes. We follow some sly wolves, a dragon-slaying knight, a Riding Hood of a sort, and a witless prince through to the logically illogical end. In short, it's all the things Holt does best, starting with A) the classic stories and B) standing them on their heads. For example, the wolves fairly beg to be slain by the fortuitously placed woodsmen. Then, the Riding Hood knows way too much that she shouldn't, and knows that she shouldn't. The dragon-slayer makes a tidy living in the pest-control business (with bounty by the pound), all the better because of an inexplicable and ecologically improbable outbreak of dragons. All in all, a wacky bit of amusement that recalls (but doesn't quite rise to) Douglas Adams.But, by strange coincidence, I bought this at this at the same time as Scalzi's Redshirts. Despite great differences between the two, they center on a common plot device. In each, the major characters act on mysterious knowledge that pops into their minds at bizarrely opportune times. They act completely out of character, often against their own interest, even knowing they're doing it. It seemed like an odd device in the first book, but a striking coincidence when I came across it twice in a row.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYR0REOYN3P9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316368792#wasThisHelpful","RYR0REOYN3P9U","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On job of science fiction is to take ideas that aren't real yet, and to show what they mean. Ex Machina, to name just one recent example, did an eloquent job with it chosen topic. This, with a different topic, speaks just as clearly.The problem isn't it moving a human consciousness from body to another - plenty to quibble about there, if you're so minded, but I'll allow a movie three impossible things to get started. This comes in way under budget.The problem, instead is money - who has it and doesn't need it, who needs it and doesn't have it, and the shady dealings that sometimes connect the two. It takes a rapacious, amoral kind of mentality to complete some of these deals. Some of the people with buckets of money got it that way. And, however little it represents reality, the same stereotype sometimes attaches to scientists. (Maybe vivisection is long gone, in its goriest form, but its reputation lives on even as technologies it might use move on.)But people are still people, and human values still matter. I think that's the hopeful note here. Desperate people with grasp at anything , and desperate people will grasp at more, and maybe turn a blind eye to the details. But, however rich someone might be, their eyes can open. And, however high the cost might be, the moral sense that binds us together can come through.The sense of such movies, and The Island comes to mind, sink into that morass.

I'm sure she's a great lady, I'll believe she's done cool movies, I'll grant that she gave it her best shot. But, fair or not, an actor's physical presence has a lot to do with how the role plays out. (Don't believe me? Picture Stan Laurel as Dirty Harry.) Hamilton had the presence.

"At first, I didn't get it. Castelluci's text in the odd-numbered chapters, Powell's art in the even ones. They seemed distantly related, if at all. I mean, Catelluci's story has a certain appeal as a story about sisters in the companionship and competition of their teen years, discovering boys and themselves. Powell's walks the line between wrenching honesty and the surreal - as if teen years aren't surreal already, I just didn't see the link. Don't worry, it's there.Although Celluci scripted the graphic novel segments that Powell drew, she gave him free reign in presenting it his own way - an excellent choice on her part. In fact, collaborating with Powell was a brilliant stroke from the start. In an afterword, Castelluci says she was already enamored of his work to begin with. But Powell has a unique way of capturing a young adult's thoughts in imagery, even (or especially) when those thoughts stray from the ""normal."" He was the perfect choice for representing a teen pushed past her limits.So why not the fifth star? Some would give it, and I would have no reason to argue.

"I got this just because Nate Powell illustrated it. The man's brilliant. Other work I'm familiar with captures an emotional honesty that's hard to describe, set in the borderland between metaphor and nightmare.But I suppose even fine artists like Powell need to pay bills. His art's as good as ever. The text is the problem, though. It's a rehashing, with fresh FOIA documents, of some of the US governments more shameful and outrageous moments, vaguely connected with the theme of food. The Rosenbergs' Jello ID card, Castrol's un-poisoned milkshake, a pittance of stolen ice cream used to frame a civil right activist. Well, it's all true, and documented in the government's own words. But, as a screed of righteous outrage, the randomness blunts any point it might have made. As an ironic statement of something or other, the food theme comes across as tangential - I suppose it could have been pets, or clothes, or cars rather than food.Creative minds make the most surprising connections. Brilliant minds imbue those connections with depth and meaning. With so much raw data to pick from in the government's own records of its darker deeds, absurd coincidences become compulsory. These authors (and I don't hold Powell responsible) noted coincidences of the kind that can't be avoided, but failed in that second step: the one where they make it something more than a random fluke.-- wiredweird","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABWI0DS7RVYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1934620416#wasThisHelpful","RABWI0DS7RVYT","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, everything.That oily lab chief declaring that DNA composition is ""classified"", even to the park owner - doesn't that raise a handful of red flags? Then, I had to wonder about the slipshod safety procedures around the mighty predators. And, if that tranquilizer in an early scene was so good at dropping a huge beast in its tracks, I would have thought they'd use the same stuff ion an armor-piercing round when it came to the huger and much less tranquil beasts. Then there are the high heels - but we're so used to that inanity that it doesn't even call for comment any more.There. I picked some nits. It's still a pretty good flick. Well of course they'd turn the baby dinos into kiddie-park rides. I would have begged for that when I was of kiddie-park age. And of course they'd have bean-counters dealing ion marketing-speak, and the guy who wants to turn everything iinto a weapon, and ... well, once you buy into the improbable premise and a few other bits of silliness, it really does move pretty well. Nice action, nice heroics, and great CGI dinosaurs.BTW, it seemed like a glaring error. Yes, I can imagine the dinos being a genetic patchwork, filling in gaps in the DNA and making them ""cooler,"" but it seemed like slipshod work. Even real-life genetic engineers are pretty good at picking specific genes for specific purposes, so why were these guys getting all kinds of strange side-effects in their nucleic acid collages? Once the movie shows where loyalties lie and why, I think that objection gets answered very nicely.And, there's plenty of sequel-bait.

"Studio Ghibli has done it again: created a gorgeous world filled with credible characters, the kind you really care about. Ana, for example, the painfully shy twelve year old girl. Well, who, boy or girl, wasn't painfully shy at that age, at least some times? And there's the visual art. Ghibli has always met the highest standards in animation, and does that again. In 'Marnie,' pay special attention to the backgrounds - to the moss between the bricks, to the flowing grass, to the lichened stones. It's gorgeous.I won't say much about the plot because unintended spoilers would be so easy. I will say that this carries an unusual mood: eerie, but not threatening or ominous, and blends the supernatural with the here-and-now seamlessly. That brings up one small criticism of this movie, and only a small one. Other Ghibli films, Spirited Away among them, do have that foreboding edge. It pushes the drama up a notch, it adds an edge and depth that make a movie memorable. Even so, the gentler spirit of Marie will suit many viewers.

"I'm as much a nerd as anyone. The periodic table isn't just a icon of science for me, but a roadmap to all that underlies the material world. And I really do understand the collector's urge, the quest to fill in one's own table with actual samples of as many different elements as possible. I flirted briefly with that mania as a kid.So this disappointed me. The anecdotes, about hucksterism in announcing platinum group metals, the lure of gold, the alchemical transformation of thallium from industrial hazard to mystery-writer's poison - they're all fascinating. I never found a sustained, unified narrative, though, and the author's style fell well short of fireworks.

"First, the effects: Ava is gorgeous. I mean yes, Alicia Vikander and her robotic image present a very appealing female figure, but the CGI that brings the robot to life is flawless. Her natural, very human motion trumps the mechanical image, making Ava as human as Caleb - and possibly more than Nathan.All of which brings us back to the twenty-first century Frankenstein story. Movie-makers keep telling that story over and over, because it's too important to let it age into irrelevance. Nathan, the maker, lets his single-minded pursuit of creation dominate every human feeling and decency. Ava, the creation, resents her status as made thing. And, in a gorgeous nod to the original, the action takes place far from human society, not in trackless Arctic wastes but in lush forests and mountains. That setting adds another layer of contrast and analogy: the beauty of nature around the stark, Brutalist architecture of Nathan's ""castle."" Perhaps the setting inverts Ava herself: her inner beauty as a person set within the stark architecture of her man-made form. That isolation could have made this movie seem claustrophobic - instead, I found it that it added intensity, compressing it down to just the interaction between Nathan, Caleb, and Ava.  (BTW, I would like to believe that her name, Ava, offers equal homage to the first woman our species, Eve, and to the first computer programmer, Ada.)I'm sure you could poke some holes in the story if you try.

"Although brief (barely 150 pages), this novel taps into many strands of late-1960s concern: UFOs, the Cold War, and the plight of Native Americans. It's true: aliens have visited Earth, and are watching over us - some day, we'll head for the stars, too, and they want to know what to expect when we get there. But, with all those ships up there (from two different space-faring societies), something has to go wrong sooner or later.Three of the Watchers crash-land on Earth. The incident destroys their ship, their communications, and very nearly their mortal selves. Although injured, all three survive. Their human disguises, and perhaps just a bit more, get each one a human protector, someone to care for them while their broken bodies heal. But the humans need some healing, too: a man embittered by broken dreams, a single mother recovering from the shock of widowhood, and a small boy whose future was stolen from him before he was born.Perhaps only Theodore Sturgeon paints characters with more realism and empathy than Silverberg displays in this touching story. The aliens are healed, at least enough to return to their own kind. The humans, however, emerge stronger than before their chance encounters - but saying how would be a spoiler. This is science fiction, yes, but SF with heart.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24MJZJHMOUC3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESJA6TY#wasThisHelpful","R24MJZJHMOUC3Y","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The mutants are coming - our species is doomed!""That theme has been played out many times in many SF stories. In this one, the clandestine telepaths are secretly implanting suicide commands in hundreds of minds - and no one is known to have resisted more than ten weeks. This brief novel follows one such victim, his desperate fight to live, and his attempts to discover his tormentors.There's more, and it's all good. This rises above the genre, though. Yes the mutants are coming, and their vanguard is here already. H. sapiens 1.0 isn't their real target, though - a delightful twist on the old theme makes this a much better story than the premise suggests, and with potential for a much more optimistic outcome.Despite all the good in this compact (~150 page) novel, it remains a product of its time. Gender relations, brought out in an important sub-plot, are not just archaic, but somewhat revolting to a modern eye - surely there are better ways for men to treat women than as a virginity-checked household appliance.-- wiredweird","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRU8BF3YK8AMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345234391#wasThisHelpful","RRU8BF3YK8AMV","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brunner brought us such masterpieces as Shockwave Rider, The Sheep Look Up, and (a personal favorite) Traveler in Black. But, like any great master, it took time and practice to develop mastery. This book comes from that period of development.It uses a familiar trope: humanity growing outward from Earth, with its different branches headed in different directions. But, in this book, the branches have only just begin to diverge, and it seems that one early offshoot is ready for pruning, That sets the background for this story. I like this story and the fact that, back when this was written, a whole novel could fit into 150 pages or so. It really isn't my favorite, though. The whole ""cabal directing human destiny"" theme could have been stronger and darker, and the ""future depends on one child"" idea could have been worked for higher drama.Adequate entertainment, I can't call it a must-have for anyone but a Brunner completist.-- wiredweird","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGORD17TSDE23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EOITYU#wasThisHelpful","RGORD17TSDE23","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These meditations on life are delivered on the eve of a terrible battle. They acknowledge that and acknowledge Death ('The Unwelcome Visitor'), at the same time that they describe the joys and rewards of a life well lived. Deeply spiritual, this comes across as slightly theistic, but not at all religious - not anti-religious, but firmly based in each person's direct experience of the ineffable. It makes for a brief but warm reading experience.But, when I put it down, I didn't have all that much in hand. The collection of sermonettes could just as easily be read as one of the smarmier kinds of motivational/ self-help/ inspirational guides. Yes, it offers worthwhile thoughts, but largely without depth and without examining life's confounding factors.So, I see this as spiritual comfort food.

"Take Jack London's ""To Build a Fire."" Broaden the scope to novel length, put MacGyver in the leading role, then transplant the whole thing to Mars. Now, replace London with someone who really knows the science - and, more to the point, the engineering. Then swap out the unfortunate ending. Although this slots as 'science fiction,' it really falls better into the 'engineering fiction' category, application of scientific principles rather than  discovery of new ones.Despite the mindboggling ability of the Mars Rovers to outlast their design lifetimes, they were never meant to last forever. Likewise with Watney's Mars landing mission. A storm aborts his team's mission, instruments tell his team that he's dead, and they escape Mars without him, seconds before being stranded themselves. So the story begins.Despite indications otherwise. Watney is very much alive, and dedicated to staying that way. With communications dead, he's alive and alone. The story follows one miracle save after another, repurposing anything he can lay hands on to the emergency of the moment -month after month, for close to two years. His survival depends as much on his gallows humor as on his cleverness and dedication. Once NASA rre-establishes limited communication, even if it's one-way from him to them, that attitude becomes contagious. In the end, it's a feel-good paean to intelligence and determination - something we could use lots more of.And, if they don't make this into a movie, I'll eat my copy of the book.-- wiredweird","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQN8IJW7ATVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418025#wasThisHelpful","R3CQN8IJW7ATVX","AUTBHG6070SL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUTBHG6070SL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It felt like nothing built, too much seemed too obvious, a story going nowhere.Then Olivia showed up. All of a sudden things got interesting.

I don't mean just the universe, although that was creaking and settling like a house with termites in the foundation. I mean the story. One rabbit after another seemed to leap from the hat, creating a whirl of scenes and characters (or something like characters) that very nearly derailed the story once it had built up a head of steam.Then, in the end, the good guys win (enough), the innocents are saved.

"Gardeners will move plants to new settings, trim part, and encourage other parts to grow, in order to keep the plant alive and healthy. The same thing keeps old stories alive and healthy - in this case, the story of Kaguya. More or less by coincidence, I recently saw the story set in the language of dance, and again set in an updated kind of family.This puts the story in a new setting yet again, an animation in wonderful, painterly style. And, as in other renderings, this encourages its own set of themes to grow: the father's confusion of his wants vs. Kaguya's, the mother's low-key but deep affection, and all the wrong motives of her suitors. It develops some of the minor characters, too, especially Kaguya's maid and childhood friends.But really, what drew me in was the spare, expressive style of the animation. It feels almost as if I've walked into a living watercolor. The hand-drawn style lets the creators render Kaguya's adoptive parents almost as pudgy teddy bears, her high-caste teacher in a style of classic beauty, and Kaguya herself as elegant and waif-like. If you expect a certain look from Studio Ghibli, this might be a surprise.

"Another lovely tribute to the human animal at its best! This takes a sculptural approach to the nude - that cover image shows an example, a composition in human form, but without the abstraction that some other photographers have gone for. The poses are gorgeous and graceful, but project the power of these master athletes. And, although they're all twenty-somethings (or look it) in peak condition, this offers more variety than many collections do. Men appear about as often as women, singly or in couples. This also presents a range of features and skin tones, traceable to Africa or Asia as often as Europe.The slipcase is a bit much, and I would happily have skipped it for a lower price. The printing is what matters, though, and that's impeccable: crisp and dense, on lush, opaque paper.

"This disc has a lot going for it: It features a prominent, prizewinning Japanese-French pianist, Akiko Ebi, as the soloist in the First Concerto; and an equally distinguished soloist, the Polish pianist (and actor) Janusz Olejniczak in the Second. The conductor is the late Frans Bruggen, who knew his way around historically informed performances. The band is the Orchestra of the 18th Century, who have been playing on period instruments since their founding in 1981. And the performers use dated scores after the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin.On the other hand, not everything works. The performances have a good deal of competition and despite their ""authenticity"" seem little more than ordinary in a crowded field. What's more, the live sound, taken from two Chopin festivals, too often betrays its live origins.First, to the music: Chopin wrote his Piano Concerto No. 1 in 1830, within a year following his Piano Concerto No. 2. However, he published No. 1 first, so if No. 1 seems the more mature of the two, it actually is by several months. Chopin described the second movement of No. 1 as ""reviving in one's soul beautiful memories."" In Chopin's case, he composed the piece when he was about nineteen or twenty and smitten with a beautiful young student, Constantia Gladkowska, at the Warsaw Conservatory. Even though he barely talked to her and she soon married somebody else, he may have had her in mind when he wrote his piano concertos, as well as a few other things.Naturally, the piano parts dominate both piano concertos, the better to showcase Chopin's own virtuosity on the instrument. Yet with the Piano Concerto No. 1, the piano doesn't even enter the picture until the end of a fairly lengthy orchestral introduction. Maybe Chopin intended the prolonged preamble to make the piano's entrance all the more grand. It certainly works that way.Anyhow, Chopin wrote the concerto at a time when he and other pianists were breaking from what we know today as the ""brilliant"" style in favor of pure Romanticism That is, they were getting a little away from sheer virtuosity and ornamentation and more into lyricism and emotion. So, that's the way Ms. Ebi, Maestro Bruggen, and the Orchestra of the 18th Century appear to play the concerto, with a combination of the ""brilliant"" and ""Romantic"" styles.For those listeners worried that perhaps a period-instrument approach to this music would produce some exceedingly fast tempos, there is no such thing here. Indeed, if anything, both soloist and orchestra take the tempos in rather a leisurely fashion. The opening of the First Concerto seems quite heady, even at a relaxed pace, but then when Ms. Ebi enters, she takes the score in a fairly matter-of-pace manner. There is little misty-eyed Romanticism here, just an apparently note-for-note reading. Indeed, I felt little joy, warmth, or expressiveness in the playing. However, I confess that the performances of pianists like Maurizio Pollini and Martha Argerich may have conditioned me to such an extent that I was not able fully to appreciate what Ms. Ebi was up to.The slow second movement and the robust final movement go by in what I thought was perfunctory fashion as well. Nothing about the performance actually moved me much; it all sounded too deliberate, which may be entirely the intent, I don't know. Let's just say that Ebi and Bruggen attempt something a bit out of the ordinary, and except for a little spark in the final section it didn't work for me.The Second Piano Concerto hasn't as much poetic grace as the First Concerto or such an abundance of good melodies, which is probably why it has never become as popular, but it does showcase the piano considerably. On the present recording we find Janusz Olejniczak taking the solo part. I sensed a greater flexibility in his playing than in Ebi's, yet not quite enough for me to recommend this disc over its rivals. The exception, of course, is whether the novelty of the period instruments impresses you. For me, it didn't.Producer Stanislaw Leszczynski and engineers Lech Dudzik and Gabriela Blicharz recorded the performances live during the ""Chopin and his Europe"" festivals in 2013 (No. 1) and 2010 (No. 2) in the Witold Lutoslawski Concert Studio of Polish Radio and the Warsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall.The live sound appears a tad warm, congested, and broad, with occasional audience noise (coughs, grunts, and the like). At least it's not too close-up, as many live performances tend to be, but fairly natural in its perspective. Still, the moderate miking distance does no favors to transparency (although, to be fair, it's better in the Second Concerto), and the overall impression is hardly clean. I could also easily have done without the closing applause in both works. Let's just say the sound of this disc is more a memento of a live event than anything you'd want to put on to show off your stereo system.John J.

"If at first you don't succeed....In 2011 CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Pictures released ""My Fair Lady"" to Blu-ray. They did a horrendous job, one of the worst Blu-ray movie transfers I had ever seen or heard. However, in 2015, thanks perhaps to a multitude of complaints, they rereleased the film to Blu-ray, this time with completely remastered picture and sound for a flawless 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition. It was a long wait, but it was worth it for one of filmdom's great, classic musicals.Rex Harrison reprises his stage role as Professor Henry Higgens, the part for which fans will forever remember him.  Harrison was already an established star when he accepted the role in the musical, and it is one he seemed born to play. When the studio initially asked Cary Grant to do the movie role, Grant turned it down, saying if Harrison didn't get the part, he'd never do another film for them. Harrison is so convincing one would think he were the Professor in real life. I rather expect his fans thought he was, too. Shaw's play leaves the final relationship of the Professor and the flower girl ambiguous, but the musical is more romantic and hints at something more serious. It is a tribute to Harrison that audiences hardly notice the age difference between the two characters, although the twenty-one-year span is almost exactly what Shaw had in mind. Higgens's most notable songs are ""Why Can't the English?,"" ""I'm an Ordinary Man,"" ""The Rain in Spain,"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.""The part of Miss Eliza Doolittle went to Audry Hepburn, and therein probably lies the movie's major point of contention. Julie Andrews had made the role her own on Broadway and record albums, and for audiences who had seen or heard her, it was inconceivable that anyone else should get the part. But the studio felt otherwise, unconvinced that Ms. Andrews had the necessary drawing power they thought the film needed and also a little wary of Ms. Andrew's photogenic qualities. So they went with what they considered a sure thing in superstar Audry Hepburn, causing not a little bitterness on the part of theatergoers everywhere. Meanwhile, Ms. Andrews went on to do ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" in the next year and half; and while the Academy didn't even nominate Ms. Hepburn for ""My Fair Lady,"" they gave Ms. Andrews the Best Actress Oscar for ""Poppins.""None of which is to suggest that Ms. Hepburn's portrayal of Eliza is anything but delightful and charming. Yet the controversy was not to end there. Despite Ms. Hepburn's insistence that she do her own singing, Warners dubbed her voice by uncredited singer Marni Nixon, who had previously done the singing dubs in the movie versions of ""West Side Story"" and ""The King and I."" Again the studio got its way, and again there was a degree of bitterness involved, this time on the part of Ms. Hepburn, whom the studio had apparently assured could do the vocals and for which she had even rehearsed and filmed several. But it's all history now, and we will never know what more Ms. Andrews might have done with the role or, except for two songs mentioned below, what Ms. Hepburn might have done with the rest of the singing. Eliza's most celebrated songs include ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly,"" ""Just You Wait,"" ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" and ""Without You,"" among others.The indefatigable Stanley Holloway plays Eliza's father, a role he did on Broadway, and he all but steals the show with his two cockney music-hall numbers, ""With a Little Bit of Luck"" and ""Get Me to the Church on Time."" In other notable parts, fans of English television's Sherlock Holmes will be tickled to see the late Jeremy Brett playing Eliza's young, lovesick, high-society admirer, Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and singing ""On the Street Where You Live"" (uncredited singing voice courtesy of Bill Shirley). Wilfrid Hyde-White plays Col. Pickering; Gladys Cooper plays the Professor's mother; and Theodore Bikel plays the deliciously unctuous Zoltan Karpathy (""Oozing charm from every pore, He oiled his way around the floor"").The songs, cast, dialogue, direction, costumes, and set designs combine to make ""My Fair Lady"" one of the all-time great movie musicals in Hollywood history. The newest Blu-ray does it proud.Video:The first time around on Blu-ray (in 2011), the CBS/Paramount engineers apparently used the same 1994 restoration that had looked good on DVD, but they made no effort to restore the film any further for BD. Worse, they introduced some ugly artifacts into the BD, including some occasional white flecks and specks and an unconscionable blooming at the edges--maybe exposure issues, fading--in the lower sides of the screen that intensified as the film went on; and by the second half the print looked as though someone were shining a bright light on the imageFortunately, for this new ""My Fair Lady"" 50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray edition, CBS Home Entertainment and Paramount Pictures asked restoration expert Robert Harris (who had done excellent work twenty years earlier with the restoration of the DVD) to head up the team restoring this new Blu-ray version of the film. The results look splendid. The colors are vivid; the object delineation is well-nigh perfect; the screen is clear and clean. The whole thing is gorgeous.Audio:It was remarkable that the first time around on Blu-ray, the CBS/Paramount audio engineers couldn't correctly transfer the sound of possibly the greatest musical of all time to disc. Through a misplaced enthusiasm in the use of the surrounds, the solo vocals on the older BD often appeared soft and hollow and the orchestral accompaniment too reverberant, sometimes cavernous. What's more, the engineers even cranked up the bass in a few scenes. It was pretty awful, and if you still have that older disc, you might consider making a 100% better upgrade to this newer BD edition if only for its improved audio.For the current edition, the Dolby TrueHD 7.1 audio is excellent. That is, it reproduces the sound of the movie pretty much as I'm sure its original creators intended, but with a little more ambient action for a home setup equipped with multichannel sound. Instead of going all crazy with the surrounds and making the musical interludes appear as though the engineers recorded them in a barrel, the engineers perfectly blend the singing and orchestral accompaniment in the front channels where they belong, with a touch of ambient bloom from the surrounds to provide depth and dimension. Voices sound natural, whether in song or dialogue, and the orchestra sounds realistic. The frequency extremes are maybe a little less extended than we find today, but it's hardly an issue.Extras:The extras include a second Blu-ray disc with a ton of extras, plus a third disc containing a DVD version of the movie. But it's the second BD that has most of the bonus items, starting with a 1994 making-of documentary, ""More Loverly Than Ever: My Fair Lady Then and Now."" Next, there is a series of vintage featurettes, including the 1963 production kickoff dinner; the film's Los Angeles and British premieres; a Rex Harrison radio interview; George Cukor directing the Baroness Rothschild; some production tests; alternate Audrey Hepburn vocals; and comments on the film by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Martin Scorsese.Following these items are several more things, including ""The Story of a Lady,"" ""Design of a Lady,"" and ""The Fairest Fair Lady""; Cecil Beaton sketches, black & white stills; color production stills; documents and publicity; plus seven different trailers, and three awards featurettes.The disc extras conclude with fifty scene selections; English, German, Spanish, Italian, French, and Japanese spoken languages; English, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Finally, CBS/Paramount have packaged the three discs in a beautiful, glossy, trim-line, foldout case that is among the most attractive I've seen. It is in itself a small work of art.Parting Thoughts:As pure entertainment ""My Fair Lady"" makes other musicals seem almost crude by comparison, and it deserves to be the standard by which we judge other musicals. Movie fans' concerns about Julie Andrews notwithstanding, the film is absolutely loverly, now with Blu-ray picture and sound to do it justice.John J.

"Maurice Andre has been playing and recording the trumpet for about as long as anybody, and his many recordings point up one thing in common: the man's unflagging refinement. The various concertos on this ""Great Artists of the Century"" CD from EMI confirm the notion.The star of the show is the Haydn Trumpet Concerto, which Andre has recorded perhaps a half a dozen times. The performance in this collection dates from 1984, with Riccardo Muti and the Philharmonia Orchestra. I'm not sure why EMI chose the Muti when there was an even newer one available, but it suffices. Andre seems poised and relaxed, presenting the music in a most temperate manner, and the result appears the utmost in polish and repose. Not that it doesn't show its high spirits in the final movement, Vivace, but it basically maintains its grace under fire.I would personally not buy Andre's performance of the Haydn as a first choice in this repertory, mind you, but in this collection it does nicely. For stronger recommendations in the Haydn alone, I would go with Hardenberger, Marriner, and the Academy (Philips); Schwarz and the Y CO (Delos); Marsalis, Leppard, and the National Philharmonic (Sony); or, maybe best of all, Berinbaum, Somary, and the English Chamber Orchestra (Vanguard).The other works on Andre's album are similarly elegant: Trumpet concertos from Albinoni, Handel, and Hertal (with Mackerras and the ECO); and Telemann and Hummel (with Karajan and the BPO). I have to admit that I find some of the material here a little mundane, a little less than scintillating, but there is no questioning the vitality of the Haydn and Hummel, which open and close the collection. Nor is there any question about Andre's dignified way of handling all of it with equal aplomb.EMI released the present collection in 2005, with most of the recordings remastered in 1999. The overall tonal balance is remarkably similar in the six different recordings, warm and clear, with a touch of reverberation to lend a semblance of reality to the occasion. I did, however, find the position of Andre's trumpet varying a bit, from well left of center to center. I enjoyed the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic best of all for its integration of soloist and orchestra, but one should find pleasure throughout the disc.John J.

"Brilliant Classics has been reissuing some real gems over the past few years, often performances that the public regrettably overlooked the first time around. This is not one of them.Not that there is anything at all wrong with Theodore Kuchar's 2007 recording of Smetana's complete Ma Vlast. It's a perfectly respectable interpretation in acceptable sound. No, the trouble is that for the money there are already more colorful, more insightful, more dramatic, and better recorded discs available of this perennial favorite music. However, Kuchar does have one advantage that some of the others don't: His performance of the complete work fits on a single disc, and many other recordings require a couple of discs to accommodate it. Still, there are other, better single-disc recordings, too. So, my concern remains. If you don't already have a favorite CD of this music, some discs other than Kuchar you might explore include Neumann and the Gewandhaus Orchestra (Berlin Classics), Kubelik and the Czech Philharmonic (Supraphon), Dorati and the Concertgebouw O. (Philips or Newton Classics), Berglund and the Dresden Staatskapelle (EMI), Pesek and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (Virgin), and Wit and the Polish National Radio Symphony (Naxos), to name a few.Still, if you're a collector or if you just want to sample everything out there, Kuchar's recording is certainly one to explore. The price is reasonable, and everything about the performance and sound is at least unobjectionable.So, Czech composer Bedrich Smetana (1824-1884), an intense nationalist, wrote Ma Vlast (""My Country"") between 1874 and 1879. The work comprises six symphonic poems that describe his country, the composer dedicating the cycle to the city of Prague, the first two movements dealing with the sights and sounds of the city.Things begin with Vysehrad (1874), which Smetana named after the castle of Bohemian kings in Prague. Kuchar paces the movement pretty well, not too fast or too slow. There's a gentle spirit about it, too, the rhythms well judged for maximum lilt and spring, the whole thing culminating in an appropriate climax and fade.After that is probably the most popular movement of the piece, Vltava (1874), which describes the river called the Moldau in German, and which uses an old Czech folk tune as its principal theme. Smetana's original program notes tell us that the music traces the countryside the river runs through: meadows, forests, even conjuring up water nymphs along the way. Because this music is so famous, though, there are quite a few separate recordings it, my own favorite being one recorded long ago by Leopold Stokowski and available in a collection of rhapsodies (RCA or JVC). Anyway, this Kuchar performance takes it a bit too quickly for my taste. The river is not so much mildly flowing along as it is rushing downhill. The rippling waters seem not so much to relax a listener as to agitate. Moreover, the tempos fluctuate as though the river where ebbing and flowing in spurts.Next, we find Sarka (1875), which refers to a female warrior in Czech legend who exacts a bloody revenge on the male sex. This portion of Ma Vlast ties in with the final two sections in describing Bohemia's fierce struggle for independence, and I enjoyed Kuchar's interpretation as well as anyone's. He captures the dramatic tension persuasively and then plays with the contrasts delightfully.From Bohemia's Woods and Fields (1875) is rather self-explanatory. Here, we're back to the pastoral pleasures of the countryside where we started. This is another well-judged movement from Kuchar, although I didn't quite picture in my mind the trees and grasslands as clearly as I have with the aforementioned conductors, who seem a touch more attuned to the pictorial aspects of the music. Kuchar appears a bit more perfunctory about things.The two final symphonic poems are Tabor (1878), which introduces us to a Hussite war tune (the Hussites were followers of John Huss, who initiated a nationalistic movement in Bohemia in the late fourteenth century), and Blanik (1879), the mountain where the Hussites retreated before their ultimate fight for liberation. I always think of these final portions of the cycle as the battle sequences. Like other people, I'm sure, however, I have never found these segments as satisfying as Smetana's preceding music; it's a little long and more than a little repetitious. Whatever, maybe Kuchar wanted to be sure to squeeze the entire work onto a single disc or maybe he was just in a hurry to get things over, I don't know; but he seems really to skim over the surface of these final poems rather expeditiously. As a result, they lose some of their theatrical excitement. Still, he doesn't miss the effect completely, and within time he builds up to a fairly thrilling conclusion.Producer and engineer Jaroslav Stranavsky recorded the music at the Concert Hall, Ostravia, Czech Republic in 2007, and Brilliant Classics reissued it in 2015. For me, the sound is a little too close and one dimensional, but for the most part it seems good enough, nicely detailed and all. There's a sweet ambient bloom, very light, around the instruments that takes most of the effect of brightness or hardness away. In essence, it's an easy-listening album that should offend no one, while not exactly thrilling audiophiles. Kind of like the performances, actually.John J.

"Many years ago I fell in love with Stokowski's vinyl recording of Smetana's ""The Moldau"" from Ma Vlast. RCA recorded it in 1960, and although I didn't get to know it until the late Sixties, I had forgotten it even existed until it showed up in RCA's ""Living Stereo"" line of CDs some thirty years later. In fact, I probably walked by the disc a half dozen times in my neighborhood record store before picking it up and noticing that ""The Moldau"" was even on it. What a revelation it was at the time. Not only is it still the finest ""Moldau"" I've ever heard, but Smetana's Bartered Bride overture and the Hungarian and Roumanian Rhapsodies by Liszt and Enesco that accompany it are red-blooded, exciting, romantic, and heart-wrenchingly beautiful by turns. Then, when JVC (Victor Company of Japan) remastered it in their XRCD/24 line of audiophile discs, it was icing on the cake.Of course, one has to understand that Stokowski took his usual liberties with the scores, pulling and shaping them to his own sometimes eccentric tastes. Purists might take one listen to the various pauses, tempo changes, and dynamic contrasts and begin tearing their hair out. But this was Stokowski; he was his own man to a fault. Yet none of the music on this disc sounds in any way distorted or wrong. Indeed, to my ears, having heard it for so long and then living with it again on the RCA CD reissue, it sounds entirely ""right."" Stokowski takes the ""Moldau,"" for instance, at a relaxed yet enlivening pace, and while it may not perfectly capture the ebb and flow of the river it describes, it does communicate first and foremost a peaceful ease and then a rapture that transports the listener to an altogether different world than the mere living room. Isn't that what great music is all about?Anyway, the occasion for this review is JVC's 2004 remastering of the disc in their XRCD/24 series of audiophile discs. They are expensive, and they offer short measure for the money, but they are unquestionably fine transfers. On RCA's ""Living Stereo,"" the sound came up quite well, with a good stereo spread and a realistic orchestral depth. The top end appeared to me a mite suppressed, perhaps to reduce tape hiss, cutting off some of the music's ambient glow, but I found the effect an acceptable compromise. The JVC disc improves marginally on this situation, but there is a minor rub in my comparison. Since first buying the RCA on silver, I found it on a specially produced RCA gold disc, which was, to my ears, very slightly smoother than the RCA silver disc (and whether it was because of the gold plating or because of more-careful remastering is another question). So I made my comparison of the JVC XRCD to the improved RCA gold disc, and the JVC still came out on top.The sound, always a bit warm and lush on the RCA, was even smoother in JVC's remastering, with a tad more bass presence and a fuller lower midrange. For this incremental improvement, however, one gives up the RCA's further coupling of Wagner's Tannhauser Overture and Tristan und Isolde Act III Prelude. Plus, you pay about twice the price for the JVC, if you can even find it anymore. Worth it? As always, I can't say because the sonic differences are so small, they would not be worth the money to a majority of listeners. For the connoisseur of such things, though, I'd suppose price is no object, and for me, because I consider this album one of the finest ever recorded, I'm crazy enough to spend almost anything on even presumed improvements.Incidentally, the folks at RCA have also remastered the album in 3-channel SACD, which I haven't heard; but according to my friend John Sunier at Audiophile Audition, it sounds wider and more dimensional than the two-channel JVC XRCD product. I trust John's ear, so if you have a multichannel SACD system, that might be yet another way to go.John J.

"The idea of fusing classical and jazz (or pop) has been around for a long time. For instance, jazz player Jacques Loussier and his group have been doing it quite successfully for over half a century. Whether die-hard classical or jazz fans find the fusion entirely satisfying is another question, but as a once-in-a-while novelty, such fusions sometimes work.Anyway, what we have here is Peter and the Wolf (1936) by Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) adapted for big band, in this case The Amazing Keystone Big Band. Prokofiev's intention was to introduce children to the sounds of a symphony orchestra by telling a children's story with various instruments of the orchestra representing the various animals and humans in the tale. In the present case, the idea is to introduce children to the sounds of a big, eighteen-piece popular band, with jazz instruments taking the place of symphonic ones. And, of course, to help sell any new recording of the Prokofiev classic, you must have a famous actor narrator the proceedings, in this case David Tennant (Doctor Who, Broadchurch, Gracepoint).Everything comes off as expected, with the big band instruments doing an acceptable job imitating their counterparts in the symphonic orchestra. It's all quite jazzy, and it should please most kids. For adults, I'm not sure it's good jazz or good classical, but it goes down easy.Tennant makes a cheerful, enthusiastic narrator, and the band plays competently. Although I didn't find any of this material particularly inspiring, there is nothing particularly boring about it, either. As I say, the producers pretty much meant it for children, so I'm sure it will amuse them.Coupled with the Prokofiev is a series of items that is a sort of continuation of the story with instruments playing various animals, selections that I actually enjoyed more than the main item. There are the ""Bird's Tweet,"" the ""Soulful Cat,"" the ""Elegy for a Duck,"" the ""Hunter's Blues,"" ""Beware of the Wolf,"" ""Grandpa's Shuffle,"" and ""Peter's March."" Even though they don't match Prokofiev's inspiration, they display perhaps a tad more spark from the orchestra, which may have been playing it too reverentially in the main attraction.The disc comes packaged in a sturdy Digipak container, with a well-explained and well-illustrated (by Martin Jarrie) booklet.Executive producer Christian Girardin and engineer-director-editor Alban Moraud recorded the big-band music at the Studio of Theatre Durance, Chateau-Arnoux, France in February 2013 and the narration at Soho Voices, London in January 2015. The sound appears relatively distanced for this type of essentially pop music. The big band has a lot of air and space around it, the venue fairly alive with a healthy resonance. Then, too, the sound is slightly warm and soft, further reinforcing the notion that we are listening a little farther off than usual. The voice seems natural enough, although it, too, seems somewhat soft, even though the engineers recorded it separately and closer up. Still, it's all easy to listen to, just not quite audiophile material.John J.

"He's relatively young. He's unquestionably handsome. He has a big, powerful voice. Is it any wonder German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is one of the most-popular operatic singers in the world, if not the most popular? And, yes, I know the questions some listeners may have about this 2015 Sony release, Nessun Dorma - The Puccini Album: Does Kaufmann's essentially Germanic voice suit the operatic needs of Italian verismo composer Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924), and do we really need another album of Puccini arias when so many good albums already exist in the catalogue.The answers are pretty simple, of course. Appreciation of the voice (or any music for that matter) is quite a subjective thing; so you either like Kaufmann or you don't. I'm not personally a great fan of Mr. Kaufmann, but then I'm not personally a great fan of opera, so what do I know? He is certainly a fine singer, with, as I say, a big, robust voice, and that is enough to warrant him a place among the best opera singers in today's opera world. Then, does he sing any better than past greats in the field? Again, subjective. Every opera fan will have his or her own favorite opera singers. Older opera fans will no doubt favor older singers, maybe the ones they grew up with; newer opera fans will favor newer singers, and surely Kaufmann fills the bill. New fans could do worse.All of the selections are someone's old favorites, although some of the songs may appear more familiar than others. Kaufmann has already issued a number of albums, and he had already included many of Puccini's most-celebrated tunes on them. To avoid any overlap, we get a few things he might not have otherwise chosen. In other words, don't expect this to be a ""Puccini's Greatest Hits"" collection.One thing nobody can deny: Kaufmann is a passionate singer, and he fills his vocal renditions with dramatic tension and excitement. For myself, though, I find him, if anything, a little too muscular in most of these selections; yet that's a highly arbitrary opinion and obviously not one too many other people share. I wonder if a Di Stefano, Domingo, Del Monaco, Corelli, Bergonzi, or Pavarotti (to name just a few from the stereo age I'm familiar with) didn't have a stronger affinity for the Italian idiom. I dunno. Kaufmann seems to belt out everything as though it were Wagner. Again, maybe it's the fact that's he's German and not Italian or Spanish; again, I don't know.In any case, I quibble. Kaufmann does a splendid job with most of these songs. The fact that we get a wide variety of items and not the usual core selections helps, too, in keeping our attention. Still and all, if I continue to prefer Puccini's La Boheme above all the things he wrote, you'll have to forgive me; I'm a hopeless romantic. Kaufmann and Kristine Opolais do a wonderfully sensitive ""O Soave Fanciulla,"" and Maestro Antonio Pappano, Orchestra e Coro dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia provide fine accompaniment.Producers Philipp Nedel and engineers Philip Siney and Giacomo de Caterini recorded the music at the Santa Cecilia Hall, Rome, in September 2014. Kaufmann's voice appears full and round, with only a few traces of brightness, harshness, or hardness in the loudest passages. The miking of the voice is perhaps a trifle too close, but it is not at all distracting as so many close-up pop recordings can seem. The orchestra sounds nicely spread out behind him, somewhat one-dimensionally but never compartmentalized. Although the instruments could probably use a little more bass warmth and hall ambience, it's reasonably lifelike. When the other soloists (Opolais, Simeoli, and Pirozzi) join Kaufmann in various numbers, the sound gets a tad overbearing, the voices appearing to come forward a bit, the dynamics sometimes becoming too strong and wide for comfort. A fifteenth-row seat suddenly becomes a front-row seat, if you know what I mean. Anyway, it's good, modern sound in most ways, and it will not disappoint Mr. Kaufmann's fans.John J.

"As with his other recordings of Mahler for Telarc, like the Fifth and the Ninth Symphonies, especially, Benjamin Zander's interpretation of the Fourth is probably as close to the score and to Mahler's intentions as the conductor says he could get. This doesn't necessarily make for the most ravishing, insightful, or engaging performance on record, but it does help clarify some of Mahler's mood swings, and it does produce a reasonably good recording.Listeners have generally found the Fourth among Mahler's most accessible symphonies, and the composer intended it so. For one thing, it's short. In Mahlerian terms that means a little under an hour. More important, it maintains a positive, often cheerful, ultimately spiritual mood throughout. No funeral dirges here. Oddly, the booklet note by Michael Steinberg points out it wasn't always so. The first audiences to hear the Fourth Symphony found it disappointing, thinking it passive and undemanding. They expected more of a storm from the composer. Well, times change and people now love the Fourth as I'm sure Mahler expected them to.Maestro Zander's performance does sound a bit underwhelming compared to others I had on hand, however, like those from Szell (Sony or HDTT), Klemperer (EMI/Warner), and even the usually reserved Haitink (Philips). Still and all, the Zander reading appears to do everything it should, particularly in the enchanting third movement Adagio, one of Mahler's most serenely beautiful pieces of music, made ever more charming under the conductor's watchful guidance.Nevertheless, here's the thing: For me, Camilla Tilling's singing in the final movement sounds a bit earthbound. It's adequate, to be sure, just not quite the innocent and heavenly entrance into heaven we have heard before.Anyway, that minor interpretive quibble aside, Telarc's sound is also excellent, a good combination of hall ambiance and inner detail. It is, in fact, one of Telarc's best: very dynamic, with a really solid low end. By comparison, though, the old Szell recording on Sony sounds good, and remastered by HDTT it sounds terrific. What's more, Haitink's second Concertgebouw recording on Philips is positively radiant. The Klemperer sounded a bit thin and bright alongside the Telarc release, but it was not at all unpleasant. Be that as it may, with the Philharmonia Orchestra playing so well and sounding so luxurious, it's hard not to like the Telarc offering.As with Telarc's other Mahler recordings with Zander, the company provides a second disc accompanying the symphony whereon Zander takes us step by step through the four movements, explaining why he interpreted things the way he did. He uses additional recorded material from other labels by way of illustrating his points, a concept I liked. It reminded me of the audio commentaries on so many DVD and Blu-ray movies where the filmmakers discuss each scene. Zander tends to appear a tad pompous at times with his overly precise diction, but his ideas make sense, and he seems to be a remarkably knowledgeable individual. In any case, the second disc is a freebie, so take it or leave it.John J.

"Having already reviewed three of American concert violinist Anne Akiko Meyers's numerous record albums helped prepare me for what she gives us here. Certainly, two of the most salient features of Ms. Meyers's playing are her sensitivity and delicacy of touch, so it came as no surprise when she released the present program of romantic tunes, aptly labeled Serenade: The Love Album. It is as lovely as you would expect it to be.According to my Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music, a serenade in the 18th century was ""originally a vocal or instrumental piece performed outdoors in the evening for the benefit of some particular listener. As a title for instrumental works of the period, the term was closely related to cassation, notturno, and divertimento. It may apply to lighter multi-movement works in a variety of scorings, including mixed strings and winds, often intended for soloistic as opposed to orchestral performance.""Ms. Meyers's album concentrates on twentieth-century serenades, starting with the five-movement work titled Serenade by Leonard Bernstein, followed by a number of other pieces newly arranged for the violinist and orchestra. On the present recording, Ms. Meyers plays the 1741 ""Ex-Vieuxtemps"" Guarneri del Gesu violin, considered one of the finest-sounding violins in the world, with Maestro Keith Lockhart and the London Symphony most ably accompanying her.The album contains sixteen tracks as follows:  1. Leonard Bernstein: Serenade: I. Phaedrus; Pausanias (Lento; Allegro marcato)  2. Leonard Bernstein: Serenade: II. II. Aristophanes (Allegretto)  3. Leonard Bernstein: Serenade: III. III. Eryximachus (Presto)  4. Leonard Bernstein: Serenade: IV. IV. Agathon (Adagio)  5. Leonard Bernstein: Serenade: V. V. Socrates; Alcibiades (Molto tenuto; Allegro molto vivace)  6. Ennio Morricone and Andrea Morricone: ""Love Theme: from Cinema Paradiso  7. David Raksin: ""Laura""  8. George Gershwin: ""Someone to Watch Over Me""  9. George Gershwin: ""Summertime""10. Ennio Morricone: ""Gabriel's Oboe"" from The Mission11. Michel Colombier: ""Emmanuel""12. Jacob Gade: ""Jalousie""13. Astor Piazzolla: ""Oblivion""14. Leigh Harline: ""Wish Upon a Star""15. Sammy Fain: ""I'll Be Seeing You""16. Leonard Bernstein: ""Somewhere"" from West Side StoryBernstein based Symposium on Plato's work of the same name, where seven ancient Greek philosophers debate the meaning of love. It's typically Bernstein with one foot in the classical world and the other firmly on Broadway. Under Ms. Meyer's responsive control it sounds alternately tender, lyrical, and dramatic. I'm still not too keen on all of the music, but Ms. Meyers gives it full measure, her obvious virtuosity, meticulous attention to detail, and scrupulous subtlety winning the day.The popular tunes (in their new, world-premiere arrangements) worked best for me, probably because I'm a Philistine, I don't know. Ms. Meyers shows a wonderful affinity for each of the melodies, gracing each line with joy and love. What's more, Maestro Lockhart and the LSO provide her with as sweet an accompaniment as one could hope for.The entire album comes across as a single love song, the selections gently flowing into one another as a unified whole. If I had to make a choice of favorites, though, I'd probably pick the two Gershwin numbers for their maturity, strength, and innovation. Nevertheless, it would be hard to make such a choice, and who could not like ""I'll Be Seeing You""?Drawbacks? Well, I suppose some listeners might find the whole thing a bit too sentimental for their taste. They wouldn't be wrong, of course; love songs can be--indeed, one can make the argument that they should be--sentimental. My reaction to such criticism would be, So what? These tunes are what they are, frankly emotional, and that's the way Ms. Meyers plays them, although not in an hokey fashion. Really, it's a lovely program.Producer Susan Napodano DelGiorno and engineer Silas Brown recorded the music for Entertainment One at LSO St. Luke's, London, in February 2015. The soloist sounds well placed, not too far forward, the violin tone warm yet detailed. The orchestral accompaniment is likewise natural and dimensional, with a realistic sense of air and depth.

"No doubt, one of the best things Michelangeli ever did was this recording of Ravel's and Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos. Especially the Ravel. In my mind and having heard a whole lot of them, Michelangeli's Ravel interpretation reigns supreme.It was 1931 when French composer Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) wrote the Piano Concerto in G major, a clear result of George Gershwin's music having persuaded him to inject some American jazz into his music. This connection is evident early on in the concerto, but, as we might have expected, Ravel added his own suggestions of dreamy, Romantic impressionism to the mix. It's certainly one of Ravel's most-imaginative works, full of jazzy bustle one moment and the tenderest grace the next, and unless the pianist is careful, the piece can appear as merely a series of clamorous rants and dreamy allusions. In Michelangeli's hands, the music is magical.Yes, as I say, under Michelangeli, everything seems just right. He rushes nothing, a common failing in too many other performances of this work, instead gracing each note with a perfect timing. The result is almost mystical, the jazz elements present, to be sure, yet never with any overemphasis. What can seem merely hustle and bustle in some interpretations here sound exactly right, the transitions so effortless that the whole piece appears as one. Michelangeli never grandstands, every note unforced and effortlessly effective. And yet those long solo passages seem to grow organically from the ground up, the performer creating excitement in a fluid, flowing manner.With Michelangeli, the Adagio is practically hypnotic and casts a haunting spell over the entire piece. It's meltingly beautiful. Then we get a finale that sounds every bit as insightful and daring as the movements that went before it, filled with extreme but still graceful intensity and virtuosic playing.Russian composer, pianist, and conductor Sergei Rachmaninov (1873-1943) wrote his Piano Concerto No. 4 in G minor in 1926, but it would be a couple of more years before he felt it ready for publication. While today it rather takes a backseat to the more popular Second and Third Concertos, it still exhibits its own merits. In fact, if the overt Romanticism of those previous concertos bother you, the Fourth may be just down your alley. Like the Ravel work, the Rachmaninov piece displays some influences of Gershwin-like jazz, just not quite as much.Although the Rachmaninov concerto sounds more dramatically inclined that the Ravel, Michelangeli plays up its more-lyrical side with equal agility, letting the eagerness of the moment take care of itself. It's a kind of self-effacing performance from the pianist, one in which he fades into the music itself instead of standing out as its supreme commander. Then, as the icing on this most-delectable cake, the orchestra blends into the proceedings almost subliminally. Pianist and orchestra are so at one you can hardly tell these works are concertos at all. Meaning Maestro Gracis is with Michelangeli all the way, from the most-hushed interludes to the biggest crescendos.This is, indeed, an album for the ages.Producer Peter Andry and engineer Christopher Parker recorded the two concertos at Studio No. 1, Abbey Road, London in March 1957. The Warner Music Group reissued it in 2015, but if you were expecting a new remaster, it didn't happen. This is the same mastering EMI made in 2000 for their ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series. If you already own that one, you have no need for this one. On the other hand, if you don't already have this recording, the sound holds up extremely well, and you'll not find better performances.The sound, in fact, is very transparent, with a wonderful sense of dimensionality and air. What's more, there is a wide dynamic range involved, with reasonably good impact on the stronger transients. The instruments blend well, yet individual instruments stand out as well, without appearing too multi-miked. The piano itself feels well placed, slightly ahead of the orchestra but not too far. It also sounds clear and natural, with just a touch of realistic room ambience to heighten the illusion of being there. Maybe because the orchestration in the Rachmaninov is a bit more lavish, the sound there is a tad warmer.John J.

"One of the nice things to come out of Warner Classics taking over the EMI catalogue is that Warner has started reissuing some of the classic titles from the EMI ranks. This rerelease of Sibelius tone poems from Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic is a good example: The performances are first-rate; the disc includes two more selections than found on the LP; the sound is quite good; and the mid price is welcome.Unfortunately, it doesn't appear the folks at Warner knew what to call the collection once they put it together. The old LP simply listed on the front cover the tone poems it contained. This reissue uses the original LP artwork, so it's a little misleading by not having all the CD's titles on it. Additionally confusing, the CD spine calls the album ""Famous Tone Poems,"" while the disc itself says ""Popular Tone Poems."" Growing pains, I suppose, as Warner Classics finds its way; eventually, I'm sure the left hand will know what the right hand is doing.In any case, the slight confusion in labeling doesn't diminish the quality of the music or the music making. Karajan and his Berlin players are in top form as they offer up six short Sibelius works, pieces they would record two or three times for DG and EMI before Karajan's passing.Herbert von Karajan was among the most-popular conductors of the twentieth century, particularly leading the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestras. However, that didn't mean that everybody loved him, and his critics often complained that he often glamorized the music he was playing with his flowing tempos and luxuriant orchestral sound. Anyway, love him or leave him, Karajan had a special affinity for the music of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius (1865-1957), as this disc demonstrates.First up on the program is En Saga, from 1892 Sibelius's first purely orchestral work. It doesn't appear to have any specific story behind but, rather as Sibelius explained, ""En Saga is the expression of a state of mind. I had undergone a number of painful experiences at the time and in no other work have I revealed myself so completely. It is for this reason that I find all literary explanations quite alien."" Under Karajan the music conveys a strong harmonic structure. While maybe it doesn't project as much atmosphere as some other recordings or as much excitement, it has a taut yet resilient integrity and a somewhat brisk pace that make for a powerful narrative, and Karajan's handling of the slower parts is really quite fetching.Next is the lovely Swan of Tuonela, made even more appealing under Karajan's loving guidance. Sibelius wrote it in 1895 as a section of the Lemminkinen Suite, four legends from Finnish mythology. Like his earlier DG account, the performance is fluid and serene in almost majestic terms. With Karajan's fondness for poetry and the orchestra's opulent, luxurious effect, the piece sounds quite lovely.After that is a selection not included on the original LP: the Karelia Suite from 1893. Its three movements are a jaunty, marchlike Intermezzo; a medieval Ballade; and a rousing Alla Marcia. Here, the grandeur of the Berlin orchestra really comes to fore. Even if the music itself may be a little bombastic, Karajan and his players infuse it with an impressive richness, and again the conductor handles the slow movement with a deft hand.Then, we get probably Sibelius's single most famous piece of music, Finlandia, a patriotic piece written in 1899 as a protest against increasing Russian censorship in Finland (the country was at the time under the rule of the Russian Empire). Karajan's way with this familiar music is almost overwhelming. It's not the most subtle approach, but it is undoubtedly just what such vigorous music demands: strong, uplifting, and magnificently performed.Valse triste is another track not found on the original LP. Sibelius composed it in 1903 as a part of the incidental music for a play by his brother-in-law. Today, though, we mostly know it for itself. Karajan takes it at a rather slow, almost gloomy pace, bringing out the melancholy element of the music more so than many other conductors. Given the nature of what the music represents in the play (a dying woman mistaking death for her husband), the conductor's approach seems entirely appropriate.The album concludes with Tapiola, Sibelius's last major work, premiered in 1926. The music depicts Tapio, a spirit or god of the forest in Finnish legend, and the tone poem describes the forest in which Tapio lives. This is the most atmospheric of Karajan's Sibelius. The conductor's tempos are broad and the rhythms sweeping. He builds a most-evocative picture of the god and his misty, snowy, desolate northern woods. The storm section is especially thrilling as it arises from the quiet that precedes it.Producer Michel Glotz and engineer Wolfgang Gulich recorded the music at the Philharmonie, Berlin in 1976, 1980, and 1981. According to the Warner booklet notes, this disc uses the Abbey Road remasterings from 2002 and 2005, so if you already have EMI's issues from back then, these should sound the same. There's a fairly balanced frequency response involved; good, though seldom extreme, dynamics; some small degree of warmth but with decent detail; and moderately good lows and highs. These are relatively clean, clear recordings, in fact, although perhaps a trifle hard in the upper midrange, hardly noticeable.John J.

"This is by my count British concert pianist James Brawn's sixth album for MSR Classics, and in that time he has become one of my favorite classical performers. His work never fails to impress and delight me, the present collection no exception.As I said about Mr. Brawn the first time I heard him, ""He's been winning awards since he was a child, teaching, and performing (mainly in New Zealand, Australia, and England) to great acclaim, and this new recording makes one understand his appeal. He is a consummate artist.""Mr. Brawn has subtitled the album ""The Time Traveller and His Muse,"" which is also the title of many of his concert recitals. Certainly, with this collection he is a time traveller, indeed, as the selections on the program span some four centuries, from Domenico Scarlatti to George Gershwin, the tracks arranged chronologically.I continue to marvel that everything Brawn touches turns to magic. I have yet to hear him play anything I didn't like, that didn't sound just the way I imagine the composer intended yet with the added merit of Brawn's personal touch. Brawn never distorts the music and never uses it to call attention to himself and his virtuosic skills, yet he is also able to make all of it his own, reveling in every nuance of phrasing, contrast, tempo, and dynamics.Of course, that doesn't mean listeners won't have their favorites among the selections. Mine are probably just favorite pieces of music that I took pleasure in hearing anew and so well played. For instance, while I am not the biggest fan of the Scarlattis, the father Allessandro or the son Domenico recorded here, I have to admit the two pieces he plays make a good, dashing opening for the album, with Brawn providing a healthy splash of lan.James BrawnThen we get five of Bach preludes, which Brawn calls ""the Old Testament of keyboard repertoire."" Never mind that Bach wrote them for harpsichord or clavichord because under Brawn's ever-watchful control they make beautiful pieces for the piano. The ones Brawn has chosen to play alternate between fast and slow, the juxtaposition quite flattering.Of course, it's always fun to hear Mozart's ""Rondo alla Turca,"" yet Brawn doesn't overplay it to show off his skills. It's just as exciting played with care for the music rather than care for the thrills alone. Brawn's sensitive handling of the Fantasia that follows is exquisite in its subtle detail.The only piece we get from Beethoven is the little bagatelle ""Fur Elise."" Along with the opening movement of the ""Moonlight Sonata"" it may be the composer's most familiar piece of solo piano music. I doubt that anyone hasn't heard it and wouldn't recognize it, so it isn't easy to bring anything to it that pianists before Brawn haven't already done. Nevertheless, it comes off as perfectly as one could imagine, filled with nostalgic remembrances and an ever-sweet charm.And speaking of charm, whose music was ever more charming than Schubert's? Brawn approaches it with refinement, wit, and grace.Then disc one ends (and disc two begins) with what I found the highlights of the album: the music of Chopin: preludes and tudes. Brawn seems to have a natural affinity for Chopin, and the snippets he provides only whetted my appetite for more of the same. If you find the playing of Rubinstein a tad too cold or distant or Pollini a bit too quick or calculated and other noted pianists a touch too sentimental or matter-of-fact or romanticized or whatever, you might find Brawn exactly what you want. His Chopin is big when it needs to be big, extrovert when necessary, gentle, passionate, delicate, brilliant, you name it as the occasion requires. One listen to the Etude No. 3, Op. 10 or the Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, and you may find them as meltingly beautiful and as perfectly executed as I did.And so it goes. The Liszt is heavenly; the Brahms has a genuine lilt and lyricism without appearing excessively sad or melancholy for its own sake; the Grieg and Scriabin are flowing and melodic.Which brings us to Rachmaninoff, the great twentieth-century pianist-composer who never quite left the nineteenth century behind. Brawn shows us that despite Rachmaninoff's reputation, he incorporated any number of modern elements in his style, particularly in the five preludes presented here. In fact, they never sound overtly ""Romantic,"" except, perhaps, in their sometimes melodramatic underpinnings. In any case, Brawn pulls them off as well as anybody, with little or no exaggeration.The program ends with Prokofiev and Gershwin, both of them providing the kind of zingers the album needs to close strong. The Gershwin, incidentally, Brawn plays in a transcription he first heard played by Jon Kimura Parker, another of my favorite pianists.Now, Mr. Brawn: How about an entire album of Chopin? The nocturnes would be wonderful.Producer Jeremy Hayes and engineer Ben Connellan recorded Mr. Brawn at Potton Hall, Suffolk, United Kingdom in August and November 2014. The piano sound, as before, is clean, clear, rich, and resonant. The venue provides just enough ambient bloom to make the instrument come alive and appear lifelike. The natural warmth provides a realistic-sounding response, as though the listener were actually in the room with the piano, albeit at a moderate distance. Transient response, dynamics, and frequency balance are exemplary as well, nothing too hard, too soft, too bright, or too edgy. In other words, excellent sound.John J.

"Here, EMI have given us some of the world's top performers in violinist Kyung Wha Chung, conductor Sir Simon Rattle, and the Vienna Philharmonic. The results are not unexpectedly impressive in many ways, yet they're strangely underwhelming in others.Much is made in the booklet notes about Rattle performing this live recording of the Beethoven from the Jonathan Del Mar edition of the score, a version that attempts to strip the music of all the barnacles and appendages that conductors added since Beethoven's day to accommodate new instruments and new styles. So it's a kind of ""authentic,"" historical approach but without any period instruments. What this inevitably means is that the tempos are quicker, and certainly Rattle doesn't hold back; the textures are leaner, and despite the rich sonority of the orchestra, they are; and the sound is more transparent. But faster is not always better, and in the first movement, especially, Rattle's hell-bent-for-leather attack soon becomes a bit wearying. Don't get me wrong; it's not that it isn't thrilling because much of it is, and the Vienna Philharmonic continues to sound like one of the world's great ensembles. It's just that the performance becomes a little monotonous at so unvarying a pace, with Rattle showing little enthusiasm for the finer points of the music. However, after the first movement, the rest of the symphony fares better, actually becoming something near traditional by the end. The interpretation is different, to be sure, and rewarding in its own way, but it is still not so electrifying or so exciting as the renditions by, say, Carlos Kleiber (DG) or Fritz Reiner (RCA or JVC).Whatever, the Brahms concerto inhabits a slightly better world, and in at least one instance, a literally different world. Recorded in a studio, Ms. Chung produces an exceptionally exhilarating Brahms Violin Concerto. She storms, she rants, she rages through the monumental opening movement and then concludes it in a heartbreaking episode of sweetness and light. I like what Sarasate remarked when somebody asked him to play the piece; he said he declined on the grounds that he had no intention of listening, violin in hand, while the solo oboe played the only melody in the whole score. Well, the Brahms has never been my favorite concerto, either. In fact, every time I hear it I wonder if the violin is ever going to make its entrance at all. But in Ms. Chung's hands, it sounds rather captivating, at least for a while. She may exaggerate the stormier moments, but she handles the softer passages with such delicacy you can almost forgive her excesses elsewhere.EMI's sonics are pretty good for a live recording (2000) and even better in the studio (2001). The orchestra sounds leaner than usual in the Beethoven, thanks to the new edition, and the engineers take full advantage of the work's new clarity. The live sound is close but detailed. The stereo spread is wide, yet without leaving any holes in the middle. Ambiance is subtle but adequate for replicating a large environment. And in the concerto Ms. Chung's violin seems almost ideally balanced with the orchestral support. With at least an interesting Beethoven and a fairly nice Brahms, the disc makes a reasonably appealing though not entirely satisfying listening experience.John J.

"It is isn't hard to see why American John Adams (b. 1947) is among the world's most-popular living classical composers. Wikipedia says ""The music of John Adams is usually categorized as minimalist or post-minimalist although in interview he has categorised himself as a 'post-style' composer. While Adams employs minimalist techniques, such as repeating patterns, he is not a strict follower of the movement."" No, more likely, people don't really categorize Adams; they simply like his stuff. He produces a kind of modern music that, dare I say it, audiences actually enjoy. I tease, of course, but it seems like a lot of modern classical composers resent listeners liking their music; it smacks too much of populism. What am I doing wrong? People like it.Well, Adams seldom does anything musically wrong, and here he gives us one of his newest works, Absolute Jest, along with another piece in a similar vein from thirty-odd years earlier, Grand Pianola Music. Michael Tilson Thomas leads the San Francisco Symphony in the newer work, while the composer himself leads the orchestra in the older one.The first work on the album is Absolute Jest (2013), which Adams describes as ""a colossal twenty-five-minute scherzo in which I take fragments of Beethoven's music and subject them to my own peculiar developmental techniques, some of which I've derived over years of using 'radicalizing' musical software. The Beethoven ideas, mostly from the quartets Opus 131, 135, and the Grosse Fugue, are compact and succinct, lending themselves naturally to fantasy and invention. A swinging 6/8 figure reminiscent of the Seventh Symphony launches the piece, but this is interlaced with some famous 'tattoos' including the Ninth Symphony scherzo."" Then music historian Larry Rothe adds, ""Absolute Jest is post Minimalist Adams. The seed came when he heard Michael Tilson Thomas conduct Pulcinella, in which Stravinsky recast works by eighteenth-century Italian composers in his own musical language. Adams conceived a similar scheme, riffing on Beethoven scherzos. Beethoven's scherzos may be jokes, but Adams emphasizes they are jokes on a high plane. He loves the word 'jest,' derived from the Latin 'gesta,' a notable deed. A jest is not therefore by definition a thigh-slapper, nor is Absolute Jest a comedy."" Rothe goes on to quote Adams: ""To Beethoven, a scherzo is this inspired sense of movement and happiness. I wanted my work to be invested with that happiness.""Although Adams may not have intended Absolute Jest as a comedy, one cannot help but smile when the music breaks out into familiar bits and pieces of Beethoven. And Tilson Thomas does not shy away from the music's wittier passages, making it sound like high, good fun.Adams wrote the piece in eight movements for orchestra and string quartet, the ""Beginning"" a lengthy, spacious, swooping affair, with intermittent hints of Beethoven, the most obvious coming from the Ninth Symphony. The remaining movements last about one to five minutes each, most of them more animated than the opening section, except for the somewhat eerie, haunting fourth segment. The music is easily accessible, and Tilson Thomas and company make it highly enjoyable.The second work on the disc is the Grand Pianola Music from 1982. Adams says of it, ""...from the start I knew that I would have to shape my own language and find a way to get around Minimalism's rigor and endless pattern-weaving and form a language that was more dramatic and emotionally complex. ...Grand Pianola Music does it in a way that is not only meditative and trance-like, but also brash and picaresque.""Adams divided this one into three parts (fast, slow, fast), although the entire work is about six minutes longer than the newer one. It appears a tad simpler and more repetitive than the newer work, too, with traces of Ives and even Copland in its structure and wordless vocals interspersed with piano solos and accompaniment (Orli Shaham). Like the music of Ives, you'll hear a little of everything here, from the aforementioned vocals and piano to marches, gospel, and church hymns. Of the final movement, Adams explains that it yields up ""a tune that seems like an 'oldie,' the words for which no one can quite remember."" It's quite a lot of fun, actually.Producer Jack Vad and engineers Roni Jules, Gus Pollek, Jonathan Stevens, and Dann Thompson recorded the music live at Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, CA in May 2013 and January 2015. They recorded it in 96kHz/24-bit audio (Absolute Jest) and PCM 192kHz/24-bit (Grand Pianola Music) for hybrid SACD two-channel stereo or multichannel playback. I listened to the two-channel stereo SACD track.Before I talk about the sound, however, I suppose for the benefit of those of you interested in live recordings, I should say a word about audience noise. For the most part, there isn't any. But there is applause. I say ""but"" because some listeners don't mind it, while for me it tends to draw my attention away from a performance. In this case, the disc's producers have edited out any applause between the two major works but left it in at the end. So, for me it's still annoying but at least not as annoying as it could have been.Now, to the sound: It's slightly less close than usual in a live recording, and hall reflections and long decay times appear more in evidence. If anything, the sound seems softer than I've heard it before from this venue and ensemble, and even more natural and easy on the ear. The orchestral spread is quite wide and natural, with a reasonable amount of depth; and the frequency response, while not exactly reaching the heights of the treble or depths of the bass sound more than adequate for the occasion.John J.

"I want to commend this EMI recording of prizewinning Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina's 1997 work The Canticle of the Sun for one thing in particular: it gave me one of the best snoozes I've had in many afternoons. About fifteen minutes into the forty-minute piece I fell asleep on the couch, and twenty minutes later when I awakened I swear I was taking up right where I'd left off. I gave it a second chance, of course, but it wasn't much better for me. Let us say, then, that it's a strange but fascinating work that probably appeals to a very personal musical taste, and that taste may very well be more yours than mine.Ms. Gubaidulina, who admits to being a ""profoundly spiritual person,"" based The Canticle of the Sun on a text by Saint Francis of Assisi, and the composer dedicated the work to cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who here leads the London Symphony Orchestra in another of their meticulous performances. I believe this 2001 disc was the work's premiere recording.I have mentioned before that I have little understanding of or appreciation for much modern music. Certainly, my limitations as a critic of such music are no more in evidence than with this piece: I found Ms. Gubaidulina's work repetitive and not a little tedious; yet at the same time I did not find her minimalist view at all disconcerting or inharmonious as so much modern music can be. Indeed, some of Ms. Gubaidulina's piece is quite beautiful. Her seemingly random selection of slowly played cello notes, percussion dings, and eerie vocal phrasings actually demonstrate a certain brilliance, and there is no questioning Ms. Gubaidulina's sincerity or the LSO's intensity.Ms. Gubaidulina writes in a booklet insert that she was trying to ""reveal the sunny personality of a brilliant musician, Mstislav Rostropovich."" Well, there you could have fooled me; the music seems anything but sunny. She also writes, ""Under no circumstances should the expression of this canticle be intensified by music."" I'd say she succeeded there beyond expectation. ""This is the glorification of the Creator and His Creation by a very humble, simple Christian friar."" This would account for the seeming simplicity of the music, I suppose, but I hope that the good Saint Francis was not so unusual as I found some of Ms. Gubaidulina's material.On the other hand, I quite liked the Music for Flute, Strings, and Percussion, which Gubaidulina wrote in 1994. Although it tends to go on at times for too long, occasionally losing its rhythm, it exhibits an honest and uplifting soul in its more-accessible sonorities, helped no doubt by Mr. Pahud's playing.Anyway, as I say, lovers of contemporary classical music will undoubtedly vilify me for not understanding much of Ms. Gubaidulina's Canticle; I stand open to the criticism and admit my ignorance. The work seldom entertained, uplifted, or enlightened me in the way I'm sure the composer intended. Indeed, until I read Ms. Gubaidulina's notes afterwards, I had no idea what she was up to. And then, after I read her notes, I still didn't know what it was about. Nevertheless, I cannot suggest that other listeners should not try it for themselves, especially when the accompanying work is so haunting.In its favor, too, I can say assuredly that EMI recorded the music exceptionally well. The cello and flute sound most natural, the percussion is clean and transparent, and the voices are realistically integrated into the aural stage. For lovers of pure sound alone, the disc may prove a worthwhile investment. More important, fans of modern music may also find the disc of interest.John J.

"Having read some time ago Jane Juska's hugely successful autobiographical memoir A Round-Heeled Woman (2003) and recognized what a splendid writer she is, I should never have had any doubts about her latest book, Mrs. Bennet Has Her Say. However, this time was different. She was writing a novel, a fiction, and a historical-literary one at that. Happily, my concerns were quickly dispelled. Before I was little more than a few pages in, I realized that Ms. Juska could write a zombie apocalypse chronicle and it would be head and shoulders above anything else written in the field. Although Mrs. Bennet features no zombies, it is delightfully charming, witty, and outright funny.Juska chose as the starting point of her novel a work she had known for many years, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. But, I hear you say, haven't other authors done this sort of thing before? Haven't we had, for example, any number of prefaces to or continuations of Elizabeth Bennet's misadventures, some of them even set in modern times? Of course we have, so Ms. Juska takes a different approach while examining much the same social and cultural landscape as the original. Juska writes her novel from the points of view of the Bennet family parents, Edward and Marianne, when they were young and in the first years of their marriage, some twenty-odd years before the circumstances of Pride and Prejudice. So, no, this is neither a pastiche (Ms. Juska is very much her own person with her own style, and while her writing may remind one of Ms. Austen's, it is still Juska all the way) nor a sequel (a prequel is more like it, yet even then the change in emphasis to the parents dispels any notion of imitation).Here, in order not to give away too much of the book's plot, I quote from the publisher's notes: ""1785 was to be the most marvelous year of Marianne's life, until an unfortunate turn of events left her in a compromised state and desperate for a husband to care--or rather cover--for her. Now, she is stuck in an undesirable marriage to Mr. Edward Bennet, a man desperate in his own way for a male heir. But as she is still carrying a smoldering desire for the handsome Colonel Miller, Mrs. Bennet must constantly find new, clever ways to avoid her husband's lascivious advances until she is once again reunited with her dashing Colonel. Except that the best-laid plans of a woman in good standing can so often go awry, especially when her contrary husband has plans and desires of his own. . . .""In other words, both the husband and wife have married for reasons other than love: The husband to provide a male heir for his estate (women had no rights of inheritance in those days or many rights of any kind) and to provide himself a measure of relief from his own lust; the wife because she needs a husband to maintain her respectability. They are not happy with their lots in life when the husband discovers that his wife does not share his more-carnal desires, and the wife recognizes that she cannot have the man she really wants and, worse, that the husband she does have is, as he himself admits, ""a boorish, awkward, country lout."" Life can be so cruel. ""O la!""Anyway, Ms. Juska tells the story through a series of writings by her two main characters (Mr. Bennet in a diary and Mrs. Bennet in letters to her sister). In establishing this alternating framework, Juska is able to explore two very differing points of view on essentially the same topics. Marianne will describe an event, and in the next chapter Edward will usually describe the same event from his own perspective. Often the views are hilariously at odds, as the wife is something of an airhead (or, to be fair, naive, as she is still in her teens) and the husband a confirmed loggerhead (no other way to sugarcoat that one). The husband's diary, he says, is a private affair detailing his lascivious desires for his wife, his tenant farmer's daughter, and any other girl he sees, insisting he wants the whole thing burned to ashes when he dies. The wife's letters describe her continued longings for her dear colonel, and she doesn't want her sister sharing them with anybody. ""Be still, my heart.""That Ms. Juska should look more favorably on the nincompoopery of the wife over the blunders of the husband is the author's understandable prerogative. (Mrs. Bennet is the titular heroine of the novel, after all.) As Juska writes in an Afterword, ""You know, I think Mrs. Bennet got a bad deal. Five children in eight years is enough to unsettle anybody. On the other hand, maybe she was always dotty, or do you think she got that way after she married Mr. Bennet or only as all those daughters were being born?""Incidentally, there are more Janes involved with this book than you can shake a stick at (if that's your idea of a good time). There's Jane Juska, there's Jane Austen, and there's the main character's sister Jane to whom she writes her letters. My Random House Unabridged says that ""Jane is a female given name derived from French Jeanne, Old French Jehane, from Medieval Latin Johanna (John). As a generic name for 'girl, girlfriend' it is attested from 1906 in U.S. slang. It may owe its 'everywoman' reputation rather to its association with John."" I dunno; maybe Ms. Juska liked having Mrs. Bennet write to Jane in order to personalize the messages, as though the main character were speaking directly to the book's author. Or not.Ms. Juska's strong suit has always been her ability to shape and tone her writing. She is a true wordsmith, whether she's describing Mrs. Bennet's visits to the neighbors, a trip to Bath, or a grand ball. The old dictum of ""show not tell"" is in evidence in everything Jane Juska writes, and we get a genuine feel for being there with the characters and a sincere understanding of their situations. More important, Juska does it all with grace, elegance, wit, and good humor. There isn't a page goes by that won't have you at the very least smiling and at the very best laughing out loud.Flaws? Yes. For me, the story's 300-or-so page length seemed too short. No sooner do you get engrossed in it than it's over. Well, I suppose that is also a tribute to Juska's writing style. She pulls you in, and you want more. Although the book may fly by, its large number of very short chapters maintains a healthy, lively rhythm and forward-moving pace.Jane Juska's Mrs. Bennet Has Her Say is an entertaining read, more amusing and more engaging as it goes along. You can't ask much more of an author than that.John J.

"Isn't it remarkable how many early twentieth-century British composers of light orchestral music sound alike? Percy Whitlock lived from 1903 to 1946, producing the bulk of his musical output during the Twenties and Thirties. Although primarily known as a composer of organ music, he also wrote light music, and Marco Polo have resurrected some of this material for its series of discs called ""British Light Music."" Unfortunately, ""Light"" is hardly the word for it. Most of this stuff is in danger of floating right out of the CD player.The music is all over the board, from waltzes to marches to polkas to romantic ballads. The program begins with a rambling ""Concert Overture: The Feast of St. Benedict,"" and then proceeds through three suites: the derivative ""Wessex Suite,"" the relatively delightful ""Music for Orchestra,"" and the mundane ""Holiday Suite,"" with shorter pieces like ""Ballet of the Wood Creatures,"" ""Come along Marnie,"" ""Balloon Ballet,"" and ""Susan, the Doggie and Me"" in between. To be fair, the ""Ballet"" is often quite charming, while the others are mainly unmemorable.The titles pretty much sum up the substance of these things. Best of all I liked the concluding march called ""Dignity and Impudence,"" the title taken from a Victorian oil painting of two dogs but sounding like a take-off on Sir Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance."" Indeed, it does sound exactly like a parody of the more-familiar march. So, at least if you view it as a spoof, as I did, it works. But maybe the composer meant it seriously, who knows.Largely, though, this is a disc of cheerful, frothy, carefree, and totally forgettable music, mostly reminiscent of some of the folk melodies of Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frank Bridge, Percy Grainger, and the like, but with not nearly their soul or essence. What's more, Maestro Gavin Sutherland and the RTE Concert Orchestra play almost everything in a wholly nondescript manner, serviceable, to be sure, but without too much flair, which might have helped the music out.Likewise, Marco Polo's sound seems rather lacking in distinction. While not being bad in any obvious way, it is, nonetheless, somewhat soft and lifeless, with little depth and even less sparkle. This is the kind of album that might appeal to the completest who wants every piece of early twentieth-century British music he can lay his hands on. For the rest of us, it should come with a mild warning label.John J.

"Spanish guitarist Narciso Yepes (1927-1997) practically made a career of performing and recording (mostly for Decca and DG) Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez. I'm familiar with several of these recordings firsthand: the HDTT remastering of his excellent 1957 Decca rendition with Ataulfo Argenta and the Spanish National Orchestra; his less-than-scintillating 1970 DG account with Odon Alonso and Spanish Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra; and the popular 1977 DG recording with Garcia Navarro and the Philharmonia Orchestra reviewed here, remastered by Pentatone for hybrid SACD.Joaquin Rodrigo (1901-1999) wrote the Concierto de Aranjuez for guitar and orchestra in 1939, and it eventually established Rodrigo's reputation as a leading composer for the classical guitar. I say ""eventually"" because it wasn't until Yepes and Argenta recorded it in monaural in the late Forties that it really took off worldwide.The composer described the first movement Allegro con spirito as ""animated by a rhythmic spirit and vigour without either of the two themes interrupting its relentless pace."" A couple of things you notice right away about Yepes's performance, and it's indicative of his general style: First, it appears extremely well articulated, every note clearly and sharply delineated; second, he takes it at a fairly leisurely pace. The first movement, for instance, is rather more relaxed than the ""con spirito"" notation might suggest, so it may not exhibit quite the lively spirit some listeners would like to hear. The result, however, is a performance that is probably everything Yepes's fans love and his detractors dislike: It's a clean, well-executed interpretation, with the easygoing approach mitigated somewhat by the precision of its execution. Still, the performance may appear slightly distanced and colorless compared to other guitarists' renditions.Rodrigo said that the second movement ""represents a dialogue between guitar and solo instruments"" (cor anglais, bassoon, oboe, horn, etc.). What he didn't say was how utterly beautiful it was, something audiences have been saying for close to eighty years. Certainly, it's in this second movement that Yepes scores over most of his rivals. His reading is passionate, lovely, and gracious, the mood always tranquil and fragrant.Then there's that perky little closing tune, the one Rodrigo said ""recalls a courtly dance in which the combination of double and triple time maintains a taut tempo right to the closing bar."" Yepes emphasizes its delightful dance-like qualities, and, again, although Yepes and company take it at a moderately slow speed, they help it come sweetly together.Pentatone fill out the disc with Rodrigo's Fantasia para un gentilhombre for Guitar and Small Orchestra, Navarro again conducting but this time leading the smaller English Chamber Orchestra; and the Concierto madrigal for 2 Guitars and Orchestra, with Navarro back with the Philharmonia and the second guitar played by Godelieve Monden. It's really here that the program shines, especially in the work for two guitars, which sounds radiantly alive, Monden a first-rate partner in the piece. Together, Yepes and Monden bring the various little songs brilliantly to life, and it's a charmer, to be sure. Also of note, the Fantasia might use a smaller orchestra but it actually sounds lusher and richer than the Concierto. Go figure.In all three works the Philharmonia and English Chamber Orchestras accompany Yepes splendidly, lending plenty of polished zip and sparkle to the proceedings.The folks at Pentatone fill out the disc generously with almost seventy-six minutes of music, and they enclose the SACD case in a light-cardboard sleeve.Producer Rudolf Werner and engineers Volker Martin and Joachim Niss recorded the music for Deutsche Grammophon at the Watford Town Hall and the Henry Wood Hall, London in April 1979 and June 1977. Polyhymnia International/Pentatone remastered DG's original multichannel tapes for hybrid SACD playback in 2015. You can listen to the music in SACD two-channel stereo or SACD multichannel if you have an SACD player, or you can listen to two-channel stereo using any regular CD player.I listened in SACD two-channel stereo, where I found the guitar a tad close but nicely integrated into the orchestral framework without being too large or too far out in front. The sound has a pleasantly natural quality about it, never overly bright or dull, forward or recessed. The frequency response sounds well balanced with an especially well extended high end. The imaging places the soloist(s) and ensemble in a realistic perspective, with a moderate amount of depth and ambient warmth to give everything a lifelike feel.John J.

"The late Sir Colin Davis's 1978 Concertgebouw recording of Stravinsky's complete Firebird ballet was the very first compact disc I ever bought, way back in the early Eighties when Philips and Sony introduced CDs to America. I remember I had a grand selection of about a dozen classical releases total to choose from at my local Tower Records store back then, and I played the Stravinsky disc on one of those early Magnavox top-loading players. Interestingly, I soon sold the player to a friend who is using it to this day; the thing was built like a brick. Anyway, back to the topic, a lot people, myself included, complain about today's exorbitant CD prices, but I must point out that this 2002 rerelease two-disc set under review costs today about the same as I paid for the single disc over thirty years ago, and the two-disc set includes three more full-length Stravinsky ballets. Understandably, you may find it difficult to find a new copy of it, since Philips has been out of business for many years, but you should be able to find it used at a genuinely bargain price.Philips remastered the recording in their 96 kHz, 24-bit Superbit transfer series, but I can't honestly say the sound of The Firebird is much better than it was on the old disc. It doesn't matter, though, because the sonics were always outstanding, just as the performance has held up after all these years. Both the sound and interpretation are first-rate--refined, and elegant. This is a magical ""Firebird,"" with all the subtle orchestral colors neatly traced out in delicate pastels, and all the overt drama underscored in great swathes of thunder. The Concertgebouw ensemble is just the orchestra to convey these wide extremes of music and sound, too. Perhaps some listeners would opt for a closer, more clinical aural picture, but I prefer the strong, resonant quality of the hall reinforcing the performance. This remains one of my favorite Firebirds on record (although, to be fair, Dorati's recording for Mercury does surpasses it in my view), and it's also good to have it properly indexed at last. Yes, that early CD had exactly one track on it; this newer edition has fifteen.Davis's Rite of Spring sounds equally well recorded, but I find his performance here somewhat underwhelming, to say the least. As an add-on to The Firebird, it's useful to have, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first choice. You will find more color and excitement in the Rites of Bernstein, Solti, Muti, Boulez, and Stravinsky himself, among others.Davis's Petrushka, on the other hand, is quite good, very much the picturesque and sometimes eerie showpiece it has always been; and it comes in sound that is, if anything, even more vivid than in the other two ballets.Bringing up the rear is Davis's rendition of Orpheus, which he recorded in 1964 with the London Symphony Orchestra. I can't say I care much for the performance or the sound, but that may be a reaction based largely on my not caring overmuch for the 1947 composition itself. The sonics here seem softer, slightly harsher, and more recessed than in the other recordings. However, it again makes a good filler, especially to get a taste of the composer's later work.Anyway, buy the set for The Firebird and Petrushka, among the better performances you'll find, with The Rite of Spring and Orpheus marking time for the curious.John J.

"We all know that Italian composer, violinist, teacher, and priest Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) wrote hundreds of concertos for various instruments, along with almost countless other compositions. What's more, in the twentieth century, especially, people began transcribing many of his works for other instruments. As a result, you can find Vivaldi's music played on practically every instrument imaginable. Not that there wasn't precedence for this kind of thing in Vivaldi's own Baroque era, where composers themselves would often rewrite their own works for other instruments. I mention all this in preface to the present disc in which pan flutist Hanspeter Oggier performs eight of Vivaldi's concertos (most of them originally written for flute) on the pan flute, with able support from the period-instrument Ensemble Fratres. It makes for unusual and fairly interesting listening.The pan flute--sometimes referred to as the panflute, the panpipe, panpipes, or Pan's pipes--consists of a row of hollow, closed tubes of varying length, which produce tones by being blown across their upper ends. The pan flute has been around seemingly forever and shows up in one form or another in almost every culture.According to his bio, ""Hanspeter Oggier began studying the panpipes in his home town and in 1996 commenced taking lessons from master panflutist Simion Stanciu 'Syrinx' in Geneva. From 2002, Hanspeter Oggier continued his education in Geneva and Zurich at the Society Suisse de Pedagogie Musicale, and obtained a teaching degree in 2006. A laureate of the Kiefer Hablitzel Foundation in 2007, he acquired an Artist Diploma in Music Performance the following year, and released his first record with Musica nobilis, entitled Arpeggione, in collaboration with Marielle Oggier (flute) and Mathias Clausen (piano). He completed his musical training at the Hochschule Luzern-Musik with a Master of Arts mit Major Performance Klassic Panflote (2010) with flautist Janne Thomsen."" Since then he has built a career as a chamber musician and soloist, participating in concerts all over the world.A fascinating part of his bio informs us that ""Like the Ensemble Fratres, Hanspeter Oggier is dedicated to integrating as much as possible the characteristics of the common language into the musical language. He derives his inspiration from the commitment of the musicians of the Renaissance and Baroque era to imitate the human voice.""Mr. Oggier's program consists of the Concerto La notte in G minor Op.10/2 for flute, strings and basso continuo; the Concerto in A minor Op. 3/8 for two violins, strings and basso continuo; the Concerto in G major Op. 10/4 for flute, strings and basso continuo; the Concerto in D minor Op. 3/11 for two violins, cello, strings and basso continue; the Concerto Il gardellino in D major Op. 10/3 for flute, strings and basso continuo; the Concerto in A minor for flute, strings and basso continuo; the Sinfonia al Santo Sepolcro for strings; and an extract from Nisi Dominus, the Andante for flute, strings and basso continuo.Yes, much of it sounds alike. That's what you get from Vivaldi; anybody who produced the prodigious body of work he did is bound to include some repetition. If you're not fond of Vivaldi, you might not appreciate so much of his work in one place. However, if you do like Vivaldi, Oggier's handling of it on the pan flute makes for an intriguing diversion, particularly as the panpipe sounds breathier and more open than a conventional flute.The performances are lively, spirited, without sounding too rushed or frenetic. There's a nice, even flow to the music, a comfortable if somewhat varied rubato, and a sweet spirit all the way around. These may be historical performances, yet neither Oggier nor Ensemble Fratres sound in any way stiff or scholarly. The performers are virtuosic in the animation of their playing and, in essence, create a good deal of fun, which no doubt Vivaldi intended.My only hesitation in fully liking the album is the sound of the pan flute itself. Its breathiness doesn't project the warmth or richness of either a Baroque or modern flute. It is, in fact, a rather coarse sound in comparison to the flute. Still, the ear adjusts, and, besides, pipes do not feature prominently in all of the music, so we do get a couple of breaks in the agenda, which gives the program variety. Then, too, the place in the proceedings the pan flute probably works best is in the concerto Il gardellino, where the instrument delightfully mimics the sound of a goldfinch. It's quite charming and worth the price of the entire album.For the Vivaldi fan who has everything, Oggier's disc should provide a pleasant diversion from the usual fare. And there isn't a Season in sight.Recording engineer Jean-Daniel Noir made the album at the Academia Montis Regalis Onlus, Oratorio di Santa, Croce, Mondovi, Italy in August 2015. The recordist has certainly captured a wide dynamic range, with good impact and a quick transient response. Along with an airy, modestly resonant acoustic that never interferes with the reproduction's transparency, the results sound, if fairly close, impressively realistic.John J.

"Based on Daphne du Maurier's best-selling 1938 novel and winning the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1940, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" is moody and atmospheric and boasts some of the finest characterizations found in any Hitchcock film.  Stars Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and George Sanders turn in memorable performances to make this one of the half dozen best projects the old master ever framed.  Its release on Blu-ray brings added sharpness and detail to the black-and-white print as well as clearer audio, as expected, further heightening our enjoyment of an old favorite.My ""Random House Unabridged Dictionary"" defines ""gothic"" as ""noting or pertaining to a style of literature characterized by a gloomy setting, grotesque, mysterious, or violent events, and an atmosphere of degeneration and decay.""  That pretty much describes the movie ""Rebecca,"" a gothic romance in the classic sense.Olivier stars as the tormented Maxim de Winter, a wealthy and sophisticated man whose wife, Rebecca, has recently died in a boating accident.  While in Monte Carlo, where the story begins, he falls in love with a shy and modest young woman (Fontaine), the paid traveling companion to a snobby dowager.  After a whirlwind courtship they marry, and he takes her away with him to his family home, Manderley, a mansion overlooking the sea on the coast of Cornwall.  The great house, with the echoes of its former mistress, is as much a character in the story as Olivier or Fontaine.And then there is Mrs. Danvers, the sinister housekeeper (Anderson), whose icy demeanor would freeze tulips in May.  I daresay it is she and the house that people tend to remember most about the film, despite the excellence of the other cast members.  The devotion of Mrs. Danvers to the late Mrs. de Winter is unshakable to the end.Once the setting focuses on Manderley, the tone of the film changes abruptly.  The chill of the house, the storm-tossed waves, and the memories of Rebecca's death haunt its occupants, creating an almost palpable tension.  While the film offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense, thanks largely to Hitchcock's deft direction, the air of gloom and melancholy cast by the house itself, George Barnes' award-winning cinematography, and Franz Waxman's haunting musical score.Sure, ""Rebecca"" is a little too long, the beginning too wordy, and the ending dragging out beyond its major revelation toward too many anticlimaxes.  Audiences have come to accept these things as part of the process of adapting a book to the screen.  Still, it was enough for the Academy to award it Oscars for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, beating out perhaps worthier films like ""The Great Dictator"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" and to nominate it for nine more.  Personally, I tend to see ""Rebecca"" in the same category as I see another of my favorite films of the period, ""Jane Eyre"" from 1943.  Both stories are gothic romances involving a poor, young, innocent woman; a huge, isolated manor house; and a rich, mysterious, brooding master of the estate.  Oh, and both movies star Joan Fontaine.  Maybe it became a matter of typecasting for her.  No matter; it worked.Video:A high bit rate MPEG-4/AVC encode and a dual-layer BD50 ensure that we get the most from a newly remastered, 1.33:1 ratio, black-and-white print.  The first thing one notices is that the video engineers retained the movie's natural grain, which is especially prominent during the opening titles and the prologue.  By the time they pass, one probably will have forgotten about any issues of grain, as it tends to fade into memory as the film goes on.  There is hardly any noticeable print damage except also during the opening shots, where one can see some occasional noise, ticks, and flecks.  More important, the high-definition Blu-ray image looks well detailed and well delineated, with excellent B&W contrasts.  Indeed, it probably hasn't looked this good in seventy years.Audio:Monaural sound from 1940 is still monaural sound from 1940, no matter how good the audio processing is.  But at least a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track such as the one we have here can ease our minds about losing anything in the replication process.  As a result, the midrange, which is where about ninety-nine percent of the sound emanates, is quite clean, smooth, quiet, and easy on the ear.  Don't expect much more, however, as there is obviously a limited dynamic range, bass, and treble.Extras:Here we find a healthy set of extras that begin with an audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who by now is an old hand at this sort of thing; he provides a no-nonsense description of the movie, its stars, its production, and so on.  Next, we get an isolated music and effects track, if you don't want the dialogue to interfere with the score.  Then, there are two featurettes:  ""The Making of Rebecca,"" 2008, twenty-eight minutes, widescreen, with comments from Hitchcock's granddaughter and a number of filmmakers and film historians; followed by ""The Gothic World of Daphne Du Maurier,"" nineteen minutes on the author, three of whose works Hitchcock turned into films:  ""Jamaica Inn,"" ""Rebecca,"" and ""The Birds.""Next up we find a pair of screen tests, the first with Margaret Sullavan auditioning for the role that went to Joan Fontaine and the second with Vivian Leigh trying out for the part.  After those items, we get three audio-only radio plays:  A 1938 radio show with Orson Welles, Margaret Sullavan, Mildred Natwick, and Agnes Moorhead; a 1941 radio show with Ronald Colman, Ida Lupino, and Judith Anderson; and a 1950 radio show with Laurence Olivier, Vivian Leigh, and Betty Blythe.  Additionally, there are two audio-only interviews with Hitchcock, one conducted by American writer, actor, and director Peter Bogdanovich and the other by French writer, director, and producer Francois Truffaut.The extras wrap with an original theatrical trailer; twenty-eight scene selections; English as the only spoken-language choice; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:Despite whatever the new Mrs. de Winter tries to do, despite all her efforts, the shadow of the beautiful Rebecca comes between her and her husband.  That is, until we learn the truth about the mysterious former wife.  I love this story.  ""Rebecca"" is a movie that rewards a multitude of repeat viewings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335PMNGW47939/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065N6JSI#wasThisHelpful","R335PMNGW47939","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know why it so pleasantly surprised me that John Eliot Gardiner handled these perennial English favorites so affectionately, but surprise me it did, and delighted me as well. I suppose I expected the conductor to be more matter-of-fact or more Germanic in his approach, because so many of his previous recordings have been in the German baroque repertoire. Anyway, Gardiner does a splendid job illuminating four of Elgar's early twentieth-century tone poems.That anyone might call these pieces ""tone poems"" at all may itself be a misnomer. I doubt that English composer Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934) would have described them as such. But certainly they conjure up pictures and feelings beyond their abstract musical values, and especially as the first work on the disc, In the South, sounds so very much like Richard Strauss, the term ""tone poem"" comes readily to mind and seems appropriate. Whatever, Maestro Gardiner conveys the sweep and grandeur of each piece quite well, perhaps missing out on some of the commanding scope expressed in the performances of Sir Adrian Boult or the ethereal beauty of readings by Sir John Barbirolli, but worth a listen in their own, darker, more introspective way. Needless to say, too, the Vienna Philharmonic sound wonderful, whether or not they're fully experienced in playing English music.Yes, Gardiner displays his own merits, particularly in the lovely Sospiri, where the strings, harp, and organ so delicately intertwine. As for the centerpiece of the collection, the Enigma Variations, well, Gardiner does try to differentiate each of the themes well enough that whatever puzzles may be there a person might find clearly delineated. You'll recall that Elgar premiered the work in 1899, and it was his first big success. He began his fourteen variations by writing an improvisation and then continued to toy with each one, bringing into the work all kinds of clever, hidden, and not-so-hidden meanings. Gardiner adds his own personal insights into these variations, successfully integrating them into some kind of whole rather than sounding like a collection of disparate items.My only concern with the disc is that the engineers appear to have miked the Vienna Philharmonic rather close and flat. My comparisons to the aforementioned Boult and Barbirolli discs (both on EMI) found the older recordings more transparent and more three dimensional. This is isn't a big fault, as the DG disc, recorded in 1998, at least appears nicely balanced in its frequency response, extremely smooth in its tonal response, and fairly wide ranging throughout. But it is a little disappointing to hear any newer recording sounding less natural than ones made decades earlier.John J.

"In the mid Sixties Dr. Robert Moog invented the Moog music synthesizer. A couple of years later, American composer and electronic musician Wendy Carlos put the instrument on the map with the best-selling album Switched-On Bach. Now, we go back to the future with Bach to Moog, an updated realization of that landmark release, this time performed by Craig Leon, complete with a newly reconstructed Moog synthesizer and accompanied by violinist Jennifer Pike and a small ensemble of players, the Sinfonietta Cracovia.As producer, performer, and conductor Leon explains, ""I had a discussion with the folks at Moog Music about creating a recording that would coincide with two significant events that they were going to be celebrating. The first was the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Moog Modular synthesizer, which was occurring in 2014-15. The second was the upcoming 10th anniversary of the death of Robert A. 'Bob' Moog, their founder, who was the pioneer who brought the synthesizer to the world's musical stage.""For the anniversary events, Moog Music manufactured a carefully reconstructed version of the Moog modular 55, which, though not the actual instrument that was used on Switched-On Bach, was very close to the original instrument on the recording. This was the instrument that was to feature on my project and indeed I would be the first person to record with it.""I was faced with the daunting task of ensuring that the piece was not simply another retro version of the original Switched-On Bach. That was an album that has stood the test of time and remains a classic to this day. Instead I wanted to find a place for the synthesizer as an equal to acoustic instruments in the modern recording environment, both as a solo instrument and as a member of an ensemble. Doing research with theremins and a DI'd string bass as an audio source for processing via the Moog, I felt that string instruments would be the most useful for my purpose.""The arrangements were written for small string ensemble, solo violin and solo Moog, using Moog as a processor for the acoustic instruments.""So, is Leon's new release an improvement on its famous precursor? That's hard to answer because it may depend on one's attitude toward the original. Most of the classical-music listeners I knew in the late Sixties viewed Switched-On Bach as a sort of novelty; I mean, if you wanted to hear Bach played by an organ or a harpsichord or an orchestra, that's the way you bought it. But a synthesizer? While it was fun and began to tap the potential of electronic instruments, I'm not too sure a lot of Bach fans took it seriously. After all, not every Bach fan appreciated Stokowski's orchestral arrangements of Bach, either. Bach to Moog may find itself in the same company today. It's fun but obviously far from authentic and probably another novelty.Here's a lineup of what's on the program:Violin Partita No. 3 in E Major, PreludioViolin Sonata No. 4 in C Minor, Siciliano""Herz Und Mund Und Tat Und Leben""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor""Ich Steh Mit Einem Fu Im Grabe""Brandenburg Concerto No. 4Orchestral Suite No. 3: AirGoldberg Variations: AriaFourteen Canons on the Goldberg groundIt's all pretty familiar territory, but only a couple of items duplicate material from Carlos's album. The opening number, the Violin Partita No. 3, sets the tone for the rest of the program. The arrangement is tasteful, and Leon's playing and conducting are basically pretty conventional, with no helter-skelter tempos or exaggerated pauses, lengthening or shortening of notes, or tonal contrasts. Indeed, Leon could just as well be leading a traditional chamber version of Bach, except that we get a healthier amount of electronic music-making along with it.The famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor sounds for all the world as though Leon is playing it on a typical church organ, so I'm not entirely sure what the point is. Fans of the Moog, of course, will point out that I'm simply untutored in the art of the instrument, and surely they would be correct. The Moog is capable of producing a remarkable variety of tones, so it can duplicate the sound of almost anything you program and play on it. The entire presentation from everyone involved seems energetic and enjoyable, with only the slight buzzing and burbling of the Moog a minor distraction for non-Moog enthusiasts.Probably my favorite selection on the program, though, was the complete Brandenburg Concerto No. 4. But my reason for liking it may not be a compliment to the Moog because it is the very fact that the electronic sound is less obvious in these tracks than in any of the others. Whatever, I liked it.Anyway, I found Leon's way with Bach more to more liking than Carlos's, more cultured and refined. And, of course, the addition of the violin solos and chamber accompaniment provides for a fuller, more-complete sound. The main thing is that it's all quite pleasurable, and none of it does any harm to Bach.Producer and engineer Craig Leon and engineer Piotr Witkowski recorded the music at Bottomwood Recording, Buckinghamshire, UK, and Alvernia Studios, Alvernia, Poland and released the disc in May 2015. It's hard to judge the electronic part of this music as there is no absolute counterpart in the real world with which to compare it. The ""sound"" of electronically generated music in concert is often a matter of the kind of loudspeakers employed and their placement. Nevertheless, the sound on this disc will not disappoint fans of the Moog instrument or chamber orchestras, as it all sounds very close, very dynamic, and very clear. Yet the sound is not at all bright, steely, metallic, or edgy. In fact, everything appears exceptionally smooth, smoother than the old Carlos album. It's also a very big sound, the ensemble stretching very wide left to right. Expect room-filling sound with strong impact in a fairly warm acoustic setting.John J.

"He is not an outlaw; he is...the most interesting cat in the world!If you loved him in ""Shrek"" 2, 3, and 4, you'll probably love him even more in this 2011 animation devoted entirely to that charming and lovable cat, Puss in Boots.  Although the film doesn't really say so, it is clearly a prequel to the ""Shrek"" films, providing a background on Puss's childhood and the growth of his legend as a desperado, hero, and lover.  And for what it's worth, the new film is superior to any of the ""Shrek"" movies in which he's appeared.Directed by Chris Miller, who helmed the third ""Shrek"" film, the new ""Puss in Boots"" gets a big lift from not only Miller's continuing influence but the returning presence of Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss.  Banderas has just the right amount of self-assurance in the vocal characterization, the right amount of heroic dash and lan, the right amount of romantic bearing to keep our attention.  And it helps that Banderas's voice is almost instantly recognizable.  He makes Puss the ""fashionable, famous outlaw"" of his claims.  ""What can I say; I was a bad kitty.""  What's more, he helps the cat throw ""a long shadow.""The story takes us back to Puss's childhood, somewhere in a make-believe land that looks remarkably like Spain in some indefinite, long-ago time period, and we learn of his adoption by a kindly lady, Mama Imelda (Constance Marie), who raises him along with about 800 other children and animals.  Of course, in cartoons such as this one, humans and animals coexist as equals, speaking to one another in a perfectly natural manner as though it were the most common thing in the world.  So, it's here in Mama Imelda's home that Puss meets the character with whom he will become both a best friend and a worst enemy for life, Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a highly conflicted egg.  Although the animators vividly capture Humpty's appearance, Galifianakis's voice realization is perhaps the weakest link in the film's chain of characters because he doesn't have as distinctive a voice as the other actors.  Still, he gives it his all and alternates between our loving and loathing his character.Humpty continually gets the young Puss in trouble, leading to one of the movie's two primary conflicts, which is the question of whether Puss can trust Humpty or not.  The second conflict relates to the first; namely, when Puss and Humpty grow up, they plot how they can steal the celebrated magic beans that will take them to the Giant's castle in the clouds, wherein they hope to find the goose that lays the golden eggs that will make them rich.  Obviously, the movie combines fairy tales and nursery-rhyme characters of all kinds in a rich tapestry of escapades.The film's third major character is Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss's companion in adventure (after a brief period of rivalry) and the film's main romantic interest.  She is a cat burglar, voiced to excellent effect by Ms. Hayek, who often upstages Banderas's Puss, both figuratively and literally.  In either case, Ms. Hayek and her character make perfect counterpoints to Banderas's Puss in Boots, and she soon joins Puss and Humpty in their search for the magic beans.Along the way, Puss, Kitty, and Humpty meet up with a number of other children's storybook characters, the most important of them being Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris), who in this tale are villains.  They are the ones who have the magic beans in their possession, so it is they whom our heroes must rob in order to get them.  Needless to say, Jack and Jill, two rather rough-looking rogues, are not keen on giving up the beans, and the couple show up throughout the film as antagonists.Anyway, the film does almost everything right, starting with the gorgeous animation by the DreamWorks team.  The amount of detail, dimension, and individuality they put into their creations is striking, the equal of the best-looking cartoons you'll ever see.  Just as important, ""Puss in Boots"" is a fast-paced, amusing adventure for all ages.  It's clever and witty enough for adults to appreciate and colorful and zany enough for children to enjoy.  Moreover, it's adventurous enough for anyone to like, no matter what their age.Early on, there's a ""Dance Fight"" at a local canteen that's wonderfully inventive and musically entertaining in a flamenco-inflected manner; the sequence is one of the highlights of the show.  Then, the segments at the Giant's castle are quite thrilling, as are several other episodes.  In all, ""Puss and Boots"" delivers the goods in terms of sheer beauty and excitement.  No, there isn't any mention of Shrek or Donkey, who would presumably come into Puss's life later on, but at no time during the present film do we care, we're having such a good time without them.  That's pretty high praise for the movie right there.Video:Using an MPEG-4/AVC encode and a dual-layer BD50, the DreamWorks team produce an opulently detailed succession of colors and images.  Combine the high-definition picture with the beauty and complexity of the animation, and you get a spectacular visual feast, one that equals most Pixar creations as well as DreamWorks's own ""How to Train Your Dragon.""  It's in that league, and a very exclusive league it is, too.Audio:One can surely have no objection to the sound:  The DW engineers use a lossless Dolby TrueHD codec and 7.1 channels to reproduce the movie's soundtrack.  The results are inevitable:  The movie sounds great.  We get clean, clear, dynamic audio, with excellent, pinpoint surround activity and a smooth, natural midrange.  The movie is as much fun to listen to as it is to watch.Extras:Disc one of this two-disc Combo Pack contains a ton of extras, mostly aimed at children.  First up is a thirteen-minute short subject, ""Puss in Boots:  The Three Diablos,"" with our hero involved in a new animated adventure.  Next comes a series of Blu-ray exclusives.  These include ""A DreamWorks Fairytale"" in which users can build their own nursery rhymes; ""Puss' Paw-Pouncing Challenge,"" a game played rather awkwardly with one's remote; ""The Animator's Corner,"" a picture-in-picture commentary; and a pop-up Trivia Track.After those items, we get previews of other DreamWorks attractions; ""Pur-fect Pairing:  The Voices Behind the Legends,"" nine minutes on the voice characterizations in the movie; ""Kitten to Cat:  The Progression of Puss in Boots,"" twelve minutes on the main character; three deleted scenes; ""Glitter Box Dance-Off,"" five minutes on how to dance like the movie's stars; ""Klepto Kitty,"" three minutes on a real-life cat thief; ""Kitty Keyboard,"" a musical selection; a ""Fairytale Pop-up Book""; ""Kitty Strikes Again,"" another game; and ""World of DreamWorks Animation,"" which looks at yet more DW movies.The extras on disc one conclude with eighteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Disc two contains a DVD of the movie and a digital copy for iTunes and Windows Media, the offer expiring on February 24, 2013.  The two discs come housed in a solid Blu-ray keep case, making one hope the studios are giving up or at least reconsidering the flimsy Eco-cases they've been using for a while.  A light-cardboard slipcover encloses the case.Parting Thoughts:At first I had my doubts about ""Puss in Boots.""  I wasn't too sure a spin-off character from ""Shrek"" would work, and I didn't figure the character alone, without support from Shrek or Donkey, could maintain my attention for ninety minutes.  But work it did and splendidly, too, aided not inconsiderably by the movie's beautiful animation and the Blu-ray disc's outstanding picture and sound.  In any case, the results are entertaining, making the movie one of the best animated features of the year.""You may know my name, but you do not know...the legend.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UOWTNO9DODA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LWZW88#wasThisHelpful","R3UOWTNO9DODA5","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite a title that makes 1996's ""Primal Fear"" sound like a horror flick, the movie is really a nifty little mystery thriller, now in Blu-ray high definition.  It was the big-screen debut for director Gregory Hoblit after more than a decade of TV work.  To give you an idea of the kind of thing Hoblit does, he went on to make ""Fallen,"" ""Hart's War,"" ""Untraceable,"" and ""Fracture,"" which I think was his best film since ""Primal Fear.""  I might add that ""Primal Fear"" is also notable for its fine performances by Richard Gere and Edward Norton, the latter also making his big-screen debut.  So, it's a noteworthy motion picture all the way around.Gere plays a hotshot, headline-hunting Chicago defense attorney, Martin Vail.  Or so it appears.  He's very smart, very successful, and not above representing known mobsters.  Vail sees the brutal murder of the city's Archbishop as a perfect high-profile case for him, especially since the young man accused of the murder, nineteen-year-old Aaron Stampler (Norton), has no motive for the crime, and there were no witnesses to the event.  What's more, Aaron is an altar boy, a shy, small-town kid from Kentucky with no prior record.  Vail figures that all he needs to do is persuade one member of the jury to find reasonable doubt, and he can win an acquittal.  With an angelic face like Aaron's, Vail figures he can't lose.  On the other hand, the District Attorney (John Mahoney) thinks the prosecution has an open-and-shut case, too, a slam dunk:  The police caught Aaron running from the scene of the crime, covered in the Archbishop's blood.  Still, Vail feels he can successfully defend the young fellow and, given the sensational nature of the crime, make an even bigger name for himself.But life is never so simple, whether you're one of the good guys or one of the bad.  The D.A. assigns Vail's former business associate and onetime girlfriend, Janet Venable (Laura Linney), to prosecute the case, and she is every bit Vail's equal.  Moreover, she understands the way Vail thinks and reasons.  If anybody can beat him, she can.Now, here's the thing:  Aaron seems truly to believe that he didn't do it, even though Vail doesn't care.  Vail even tells Aaron it makes no difference to him if he committed the crime or not.  It's his job only to defend him and get him off the hook, period.  Yet, as the case proceeds, Vail comes to believe in Aaron's innocence himself.As the trial progresses, the story begins developing an ever-widening web of complications, not the least of which is that the Archbishop's financial affairs seem to implicate him and other powerful city officials in dealings of a shady sort.  And, worse, the Archbishop's private life may not be everything it should be.No, nothing is simple.  As the tale unfolds, it becomes twistier, with a new turn at every corner.  Vail is more complex than the show-boater he appears; and Aaron may or may not be all he seems, either.  Aaron says he can't remember a thing after wandering into the crime scene, seeing a third person there, and then running for his life.  He says he often has blackouts.  The movie even raises some doubts about the character of the D.A.  What a nest of vipers we get in this film.Certainly, ""Primal Fear"" is a good courtroom drama, but more than that it's a good brainteaser, with new puzzles to solve in every scene.  Plus, it's got a wealth of fine acting going for it.  Gere is no mere automaton walking through the part of a slick suit but invests the role with mixed emotions, strength and vulnerability.  Then, too, we couldn't ask for a better actor as the defendant than Norton, who transforms his character into a pure enigma.  It's fun watching these guys work together, with excellent support from Linney and Mahoney, and a fine minor portrayal from Francis McDormant as a psychiatrist Vail hires to investigate Aaron's personality.Note, however, that in a movie that makes very few missteps, it is odd that Hoblit allowed one big distracting element to creep into the proceedings.  About halfway through the film, there is a lengthy foot chase, at the end of which no one is in the least bit winded.  I mean, such a chase would have exhausted even an Olympic athlete, but not here.  They don't even break a sweat.  It's the kind of thing that momentarily takes a viewer out of the picture and has him scratching his head.Any other issues?  You bet.  The plot has loopholes in it big enough to drive a getaway car through.  But I'm thinking you won't notice them as you're watching the movie.  It's only when the film ends and you start analyzing it that you have to question some of the things that happen.  Best not to analyze.You might guess the outcome of ""Primal Fear"" well in advance of the ending, but you're not likely to forget the characters.  Or, who knows, you might find yourself guessing to the very last and being surprised, anyway.  I hope that's the case.Video:The video quality on this Blu-ray disc varies considerably, from merely passable to truly outstanding, so it's a little hard to judge except on a scene-by-scene basis.  Since it is so good at times, it's difficult to see how the transfer itself could be at fault, and certainly the folks at Paramount do their part to ensure the best possible picture using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode.  OK, to be fair, compared to the standard-definition version the Blu-ray does look smoother, so much smoother that it's possible Paramount added some DNR filtering to the image.  Nevertheless, the colors show up nicely in the 1.85:1-ratio film, almost always looking realistic.  In a few scenes the hues tend to fade into a kind of pastel, but it isn't often, and it's probably on purpose.  Definition runs the gamut from soft and blurry to sharp and precise; just pick your scene.  Fortunately, the brightness of the image tends to make even the less-detailed scenes look better.  There are moderately good black levels and also a touch of film grain in the picture, more so in darker scenes, but, as I say, some filtering may have removed a bit of the original grain.Audio:Although I had some concerns about the video quality, I had almost none about the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio.  Considering that this film is largely dialogue driven, one can hardly fault the soundtrack.  The sonics are very full, warm, and natural yet well balanced, too, with speech clear and faithful.  There is also a strong sense of surround throughout, with ambient environmental noises and musical bloom creating a pleasing all-around soundstage.  Trains, cars, helicopters, radios, etc., fill in the corners of the listening room.  This is not a superspectacular soundtrack, just an ideal one for the type of film it's supporting.Extras:There are several featurettes and the usual audio commentary on this Blu-ray disc, although they are all in standard definition.  The commentary is a joint effort by director Gregory Hoblit, writer Ann Biderman, producer Gary Lucchesi, executive producer Hawk Koch, and casting director Deborah Aquila, all of whom blend well.  Next, there is an eighteen-minute featurette, ""Primal Fear:  The Final Verdict,"" a behind-the-scenes affair with the filmmakers; an eighteen-minute featurette, ""Primal Fear:  Star Witness,"" that focuses on the casting Edward Norton as Aaron; and the thirteen-minute featurette ""The Psychology of Guilt,"" which examines the subject of the criminal defense in the film.The extras conclude with twenty-six scene selections, plus bookmarks; a widescreen theatrical trailer; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:If you like mystery yarns, detective stories, or courtroom dramas, you're likely to enjoy Gregory Hoblit's film version of William Diehl's novel, ""Primal Fear.""  The plot is engaging, the cast is exceptional, and Hoblit moves things along in commendably straightforward fashion.  Very entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSTPPA2620U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFYWDC#wasThisHelpful","RLSTPPA2620U9","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Add this one to your list of movies that nobody needed to remake.Just because a film like 1972's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was popular and made money doesn't mean it was particularly good or needed an update.  In the case of the 2006 remake, ""Poseidon,"" reviewed here, it lost money big time, earning back only about a third of what it cost to make.  I mean, why don't studios just ask people ahead of time what they want to see?  They could take a poll at their Web site.  Or, better yet, they could just ask me.  ""Do you think a remake of ""Citizen Kane"" as a romantic comedy with Jennifer Aniston and Jason Statham would be a good idea?""  ""Um, let me think.  No.""Anyway, this was my third go-round with ""Poseidon,"" first on DVD, then on HD DVD, and now on Blu-ray.  The best thing I can say is that the high-definition renderings definitely improved my appreciation of the film.  The movie is a visual-effects extravaganza first and foremost, and in high def, at least parts of it can be rather fun.Getting back to the original, you may remember that the Seventies were big on disaster films, what with sinking ships, crashing airplanes, and burning buildings, and Fox's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was one of the first and better of the breed.  It was big, silly, escapist fare with people like Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, and Shelley Winters scrambling for their lives.  The 1978 Warner Bros. sequel, ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,"" was a dreadful outing, so I guess WB wanted to give it one more try by making the first movie all over again.  ""Poseidon"" falls somewhere in between the campy excesses of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and the sheer boredom of the sequel.To ensure at least a modicum of success, Warners hired director Wolfgang Petersen to helm the new venture, Petersen having had some experience in watery films like ""Das Boot,"" still his best work, and ""The Perfect Storm,"" besides doing up adventure in ""Air Force One, ""In the Line of Fire,"" and ""Troy.""  Never mind that ""Poseidon"" may be Petersen's weakest movie yet; although no one seems to have provided him with anything more than an action script and a special-effects team, for fans of high definition, that might be enough.The story follows the pattern set by the 1972 movie and Paul Gallico's novel.  It's New Year's Eve aboard a super luxury liner at sea when a huge rogue wave (formerly known as a tidal wave) hits the ship and turns it over.  Most of the passengers are at a party in the main ballroom as the disaster strikes, and when some of them hear the captain say those famous last words, ""We will be safe,"" they know it's time to make for higher ground.  With the captain trying to comfort the passengers in the ship's ballroom, a small group of people decide to forego the warnings and escape on their own by making their way to the bottom of the ship, which is now the top of the ship because it's upside down, and get out through the propeller openings before the ships sinks.Two things interfered with my enjoyment of this catastrophe (if ""enjoyment"" is the proper word for a film that capitalizes on the touchy subject of disaster).  The first problem is the overabundance of special effects, which are both a boon and a hindrance.  Obviously, today's CGI can produce some startlingly realistic results, and the computer-generated graphics here are fairly good.  However, things do not get off to the best start when the first shot we see is a 360-degree pan of the luxury liner that looks too good to be true, too perfect to be real.  In short, it looks like a computer-generated ship, even though the animators seamlessly integrate a real actor running around its decks.  From then on, the CGI works better, in a ""Titanic"" sort of way, but that and the continuous, noisy action rather take over the movie, leaving the characters to hang in the wind (or sink in the water, or whatever).Which brings us to the actors.  In the original movie, we tended to care about them.  Here, we hardly get to know them and, therefore, couldn't care less about what happens to them.  The first movie also established a tradition of using big-name actors in main and even minor roles.  Here we get only two well-known faces and a collection of sort of familiar, maybe, kind of recognizable faces.Two people you will recognize immediately are Kurt Russell as an overly protective father on a cruise with his nineteen-year-old daughter.  The other is Richard Dreyfuss as a gay architect, despondent over his partner leaving him.  However, the film does very little with Russell's character being a former fireman and a onetime mayor of New York; nor does it make much of Dreyfuss's character being gay.  OK, perhaps the fireman part helps Russell's character in the heroics department, but the oblique reference to his being a mayor and Dreyfuss's sexual orientation seem like one-shot gimmicks that the filmmakers never really explore.An actor you may or may not recognize is Josh Lucas, who gets top billing in the credits, as a professional gambler.  As for myself, Lucas's biggest claim to fame is reminding me of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen.  Otherwise, he's not exactly a well-known face.  From there on, the actors will probably get a little more obscure for many viewers.  Emmy Rossum plays Kurt Russell's daughter, and viewers may remember her from ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  It will no doubt please fans of Ms. Rossum's heaving bosom to note that it is not only generously in evidence but plays a part in the film early on.Moving forward, Jacinda Barrett plays a single mother, and Jimmy Bennett plays her little boy; Mike Vogel plays Ms. Rossum's character's boyfriend; Mia Maestro plays a beautiful stowaway; and Kevin Dillon plays the movie's designated slimeball.  Any bets on which of the group is the first to go?Here's the thing:  Director Petersen uses a couple of minutes to introduce these characters to us, and then it's off to the races.  The big wave hits, the special effects take over, the characters fight to get to safety, and it's over.  If we didn't recognize at least a couple of the actors in the lead roles, we wouldn't even care about them.  Viewing ""Poseidon"" is a little like watching a documentary in that we feel detached from any of the people in it, overcome by the sights, sounds, and action.So the characters get lost amid the elaborate sets, the flying debris, the explosions, the fireballs, and the surging waters.  The movie is only ninety-eight minutes long, but the action is so repetitive it feels a lot longer.  Moreover, some of the derring-do is so preposterous and the coincidences and hairbreadth escapes so far-fetched, they significantly destroy any semblance of believability.  Although there is one harrowing moment in a ventilator shaft, the characters up against a grate with the water rising, and another with the characters trapped in a ballast tank, these are only brief moments.  Most of the action is simply redundant.Let me just say, too, that it's a lucky thing all the characters in the story are good swimmers and have really good lung capacities, or they wouldn't have lasted a second.  Perhaps that was my problem.  The last half hour or so of ""Poseidon"" is such nonstop noise, I found myself quickly tiring of it, despite the fine DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack.  Still and all, if you're into high def, the movie may be a treat, especially in the audio department.Video:When I first watched the standard-definition edition of this movie, I found that despite the studio engineers transferring the movie to disc at a fairly high bit rate with an anamorphic image, it still looked slightly fuzzy, dull, and blurred to me.  The Blu-ray high-definition picture looks, as expected, much better focused, although it is still never quite crystal clear in every scene.  Nevertheless, the picture is easy on the eye most of the time and makes watching the film in high def a pleasure.  You can count every hair on Richard Dreyfuss's chinny-chin-chin.The video engineers maintain the film's original 2.40:1 screen ratio using a VC-1 codec and a dual-layer BD50.  Yet, because of the dim interior lighting of many of the scenes, plus the smoke and cinders, the transfer seldom allows the image to look great, even at a 1080p resolution.  The picture is expectedly dark, and facial tones in particular tend to vary between clear and natural and overly dusky.  I can only assume this was the condition of the original film print.  So, yes, this is about as good as it gets; but, no, it's not exactly perfect.Audio:The SD disc's Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack provided a big, dynamic impact, with a sometimes overly robust, occasionally even boomy, bass, the sound very flashy in the front channels yet subtly nuanced in the rears, so it seemed mostly realistic without coming off as too overbearing.  By comparison, the Blu-ray disc's lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 goes it better by providing more clarity, more dynamic range, more smoothness, and more naturalness, with a tighter, room-shaking bass to boot.  It's also more dimensional, especially in frontal depth, offering up clear, red-blooded sonics, very dynamic and very wide ranging.  The surrounds do everything they can to add to the excitement, too, filling in an enveloping 360-degree radius around the listening area.  Very impressive.Extras:The Blu-ray disc contains almost the same bonus items as the two-disc SD edition and HD DVD, with the exception of the HD DVD's ""In-Movie Experience,"" here omitted.  What we do get are the featurettes.  ""Poseidon: A Ship on a Soundstage"" gives us a twenty-two minute look at what the keep case calls ""the complexities of making a modern adventure movie.""  Needless to say, it's a making-of segment with the cast and crew on set design and special effects and such.  After that is ""Poseidon: Upside Down,"" a ten-minute examination of how the studio spent the movie's budget on CGI effects, models, and full-scale sets, most of them built upside down, of course.  Another item is a twelve-minute affair, ""A Shipmate's Diary,"" in which film-school intern Malona Voigt, a production assistant on the film, shares with us her own experiences on the set.  And the final featurette is atwenty-eight minute History Channel documentary, ""Rogue Waves,"" which explores the nature of real such tidal waves.The disc also comes with twenty-two scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, German, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Portuguese, and other subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Shots:""Poseidon"" is loud, noisy, and often frenetic, its characters getting lost in the hustle and bustle of a script that leaves them completely at the mercy of the special-effects department.  I remembered as I watched this film the first time that Petersen had spent almost the first half of ""The Perfect Storm"" developing the movie's characters, while here he spends about ten minutes.  I think that says it all.Be that as it may, I couldn't help admiring the craft that went into the building of all the fancy sets and the development of all the elaborate special effects.  If you liked the original movie, you might like this remake as well.  With its high-definition picture and sound, the movie on Blu-ray comes off better than I would have expected.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111RCSH0FN66A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R209NY#wasThisHelpful","R111RCSH0FN66A","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a few words about the movie and a word of explanation from your humble reviewer.  ""The Polar Express"" is one of those computer animations that try to look as photorealistic as possible in their representations of the actual world.  As a result, the humans appear almost but not quite real, like wax figures in a museum come to life.  I've never understood this concept, which makes everyone look kind of creepy to me.  If the studio figured to save money using the CGI animation technique as opposed to using live actors, saving money didn't work.  This 2004 production cost about $150,000,000 to make.  If the filmmakers figured the animation would provide some visual treats we couldn't otherwise get with live action, well, it doesn't do any more than one of today's comparable live-action CGI fantasies does.  If director Robert Zemeckis hoped to open our minds better to the world of imagination, the movie does so at cross purposes.  Would ""Willy Wonka"" or ""Harry Potter"" have been any better done in animation than in live action?  I doubt it.  When I finished watching ""The Polar Express"" the first time I saw it, I remember being left intrigued by the visuals but wondering why the filmmakers did it as a cartoon when they could have accomplished the same thing in live action without looking so...odd.  Therefore, please, temper my remarks with this preliminary grousing in mind; and understand that the animation will probably not bother most anyone else.Zemeckis based the movie on a short, illustrated children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  Zemeckis, as you know, is the fellow who gave us such spectacularly creative delights as ""Back to the Future,"" ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" and ""Contact,"" all of them filled with fascinating characters and glorious visual sights.  In ""Polar Express,"" however, the director stretches (an unkinder soul would say bloats) a simple story idea with so many visual effects that some of the characters get rather lost in the proceedings.The animation technique produces varied results.  The scenery and surroundings are exquisite, imaginatively rendered in every detail, especially in high def, often looking like one of those Christmas globes with the snow swirling around inside; and from everything I can ascertain, the animation does a good job capturing the look and feel of the paintings in Van Allsburg's book.  It's the people who inhabit this world who look artificial in a spooky sort of way.  The filmmaking process that Zemeckis used requires live actors to perform their roles and then computer animators to duplicate their actions.  It's the modern equivalent of the early rotoscoping done by pioneer animators in the days of silent films.  Although it's quite a bit more advanced now, the basic idea is the same.  What I always have to ask, though, is if live actors perform the parts, why not make it a live-action movie?  What more does animation do to make something a fantasy?  Is the mere act of watching drawings instead of real people oblige us to believe all the more in a film's make-believe?  Well, it may, and if it works for you, more power to the filmmaking.The plot, what little there is of it, concerns a young boy at an age where he's about to lose his belief in Santa Claus and the magic of Christmas.  In this most crucial year of his life, the Polar Express, Santa's personal train, shows up at his doorstep one Christmas Eve to convince him there really is a Santa.  Other children of a similar age and with similar feelings of disbelief fill the train.  From here, the movie offers a sweet and moving fable of regaining (or retaining) one's faith in the Christmas spirit, as the boy learns to be kind to other people and never lose his power of imagination.  No complaints here.Tom Hanks stars in the movie, and stars in the movie, and stars in the movie.  He is the voice behind most of the main characters, which works well for several reasons.  First, he's a fine actor and provides good voice characterizations for, among others, the boy's father, the train conductor, a mysterious hobo, and Santa himself.  Second, having Hanks voice so many of the characters makes it feel all the more like storybook time, as though one person alone were telling the tale; which, in fact is the case, as Hanks also voices the boy grown up, looking back on his own childhood.I enjoyed the other characters voices as well, all of them ably, if not always so colorfully, voiced:  Nona Gaye as a little girl that the boy befriends; Leslie Zemeckis as the boy's sister Sarah; Peter Scolari as a shy, lonely boy; and, best of all, Eddie Deezen as an annoying, know-it-all kid.  You'll recognize Deezen's distinctive voice instantly from things like ""1941"" and ""WarGames.""  He practically saves the day by being the most unique and entertaining voice of all the characters in the movie.  Every time he appears, the movie livens up.The action of the story takes places almost entirely on the train and then at the North Pole in a series of short episodes.  These brief segments involve the boy in various adventures, none of which are particularly involving because of their brevity.  After a somewhat slow start, the episodes begin to come along rather quickly, and it's shortly afterwards that we realize there's not going to be much more to it than that; nothing lasts long enough to develop much tension, and there aren't many clear transitions between events to sustain an engrossing story line.Zemeckis possibly intended the rapid succession of incidents to remind us of a child's dream, because certainly it never induces us to believe the boy is awake while all this is going on.  Nevertheless, I found my mind wandering at times, maybe indicating I'm not a child anymore.Several of the segments have a rousing spirit, though, and they display a verve sometimes lacking in the rest of the film.  There is a scene with dancing waiters and a song, ""Hot Chocolate,"" that comes alive in an energetic, Monty Pythonesque way; there's a stunning shot of an eagle flying through a gorge that is lovely enough to frame; there's a sequence with the train sliding down a roller-coaster track and then slipping sideways on an expanse of ice that is really quite harrowing; and there is a passage set in a roomful of puppets that is scary in the way only puppets and marionettes can be scary.But offsetting these instances of beauty and excitement are too many songs that seem less than memorable (""Believe"" being the main one); too much background music that tries to be uplifting and inspirational and comes off gushy; too much pacing that is awkward and herky-jerky; too much that should be surreal that only seems tedious; too much that is simply sentimental; and too little storyline to tie it all together.The moviemakers might better have called the film ""The Bipolar Express,"" with so much that is sweet and light on the one hand and so much that is tiring and humdrum on the other.  I liked the movie's first half a lot; I found the second half going on and on rather slowly.  Although I have no doubt most kids and many adults will love it, this Scrooge came away with somewhat mixed feelings.Video:My friend and fellow movie critic Eddie Feng and I once discussed two issues related to this film.  Namely, (1) the inability of animators to realize fully the nuances of real human faces and (2) the relative ease in capturing animated characters on disc as compared to capturing the subtleties of human faces.  The result is that ""The Polar Express"" looks more realistic than most animated movies but not quite realistic enough to pass for the real thing.  Nevertheless, like it or not, it shows up gloriously in 2-D high definition.However, since the disc contains both a 2-D and a 3-D version of the movie and since the 3-D is the main attraction here, let's start with that format first, the special 3-D process rendered by Sony Pictures Imageworks.  Because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the Wife-O-Meter's favorite films, she was anxious to watch it in its new three-dimensional trappings.  So, we dutifully put on the red-and-blue 3-D glasses and attempted to enjoy the picture.  No dice.  The same thing happened that I had experienced with previous 3-D films.  I wear eyeglasses for distance, and the 3-D cardboard-and-cellophane frames would not fit comfortably over or under my regular glasses.  I resorted to cutting one pair of 3-D glasses apart and taping them to my own glasses, but it still didn't work.  The 3-D glasses were always uncomfortable, and the 3-D picture was always out of focus, with quite a bit of ghosting going on.  The Wife-O-Meter fared no better.  She doesn't wear glasses, but she has had her eyes surgically corrected, with one eye adjusted for reading and one for distance.  She could never focus on the 3-D picture, always coming up with two different images slightly apart.Worse still, in 3-D neither of us saw the brilliant colors we had become used to in the 2-D editions.  Instead, we found a dull sheen, like a veil, over the hues.  After fifteen or twenty minutes we both agreed to give up on the ghosting effects and the veiled colors, and we watched the movie in regular 2-D.One could hardly fault any part of the Blu-ray 2-D presentation.  The video engineers retained the movie's 2.40:1 widescreen dimensions in a 1080p, VC-1 transfer that looks identical to the HD DVD encode.  (An insider friend told me it is, indeed, the same encode.)  The colors are deep and the overall focus is as sharp as it can be.  More important, the colors are extremely natural (for a cartoon or for real life), rich and lush, with intense black levels.  Believe me, like its HD-DVD counterpart, the Blu-ray picture is a joy to watch, and my Video rating below reflects my reaction to the 2-D version only.Audio:If there is any improvement in the Blu-ray edition over the HD DVD, it is in the audio.  Where the HD DVD used Dolby Digital Plus 5.1, the Blu-ray uses Dolby TrueHD, a genuine lossless codec.  There is a tremendously deep, taut, room-shaking bass, combined with ultrawide dynamics for a sometimes awesome sonic experience.  Just wait until Santa's train thunders into your listening area.  The effect is enough to rattle the rafters.  The fact is, the disc's TrueHD sound is just as good as the video, with an impact so strong it'll blow your hair back.  What's more, the sound is clear and clean, with well-integrated dialogue and sonic effects.  It's an impressive soundtrack for an impressive audiovisual presentation.Note:  By default, the disc also includes a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 track.  Remember to select TrueHD when you begin watching the film.Extras:As I found with the previous SD and HD editions, the extras are only so-so, again with no audio commentary.  I suppose Warners figure the main bonus items this time are the two movie formats, 2-D and 3-D, on the same disc, along with the four pairs of 3-D glasses.The other extras begin with a four-minute segment, ""You Look Familiar: The Many Polar Faces of Tom Hanks,"" explaining why Hanks played so many roles in the film.  Then there's a five-minute bit, ""True Inspirations: An Author's Adventure,"" profiling the work of author and artist Chris Van Allsburg; followed by four minutes taking us ""Behind the Scenes of 'Believe'"" and into the recording studio.After that, we find the main documentary, ""A Genuine Ticket to Ride,"" lasting about twenty-five minutes and covering the usual topics:  ""Performance Capture,"" ""Virtual Camera,"" ""Hair and Wardrobe,"" ""Creating the North Pole,"" and ""Music""; and a new ""Flurry of Effects"" gallery, about eight minutes of motion-capture sessions comparing the live-action preliminaries with the final animation; followed by four minutes of singer Josh Groban performing the song ""Believe"" at the Greek Theatre.Finally, there are about two minutes of Christmas memories, ""Meet the Snow Angels,"" reminiscences from various of the filmmakers; plus a seven-minute, never-before-seen deleted musical scene with Smokey and Steamer, the train's engineers; and a ""THQ"" PC game demo with two playable levels.  The disc also has twenty-four scene selections; English, French, Spanish, and Dutch spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Dutch subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.A final added incentive:  The keep case comes housed in a colorful slipcover with a 3-D holographic picture on the cover.  Very attractive.Parting Thoughts:As a counterbalance to my curmudgeonly reactions, I would remind you that the Wife-O-Meter thinks very highly of this movie.  She feels the stop-and-go action is much like the way a child thinks, the colors, excitement, and adventure are right up a child's alley, the themes are moving, and the characters are fun.  She has persuaded me that children should love it as much as she does.  It undoubtedly is an enchanting movie for children, and it even began to grow on this cranky adult after the third or fourth viewing.Now, indulge me a moment longer.  Strangely, perhaps, I saw many similarities in this film and, of all things, Steven Spielberg's ""1941.""  What's that, you say?  Yes, in the movie's episodic construction, its fitful, irregular execution, its musical interludes and march music, its Eddie Deezen character, and its elaborate special effects, it reminded me of Spielberg; which may be no coincidence given that Zemeckis worked extensively with Spielberg early in his career and was a wizard at special effects.  And like ""1941"" the sum of the many elements in ""The Polar Express"" don't quite add up to as much as they should.Nonetheless,  as the Conductor says, ""One thing about trains:  It doesn't matter where they're going; what matters is deciding to get on.""  If you can believe strongly enough, you can do anything or be anything you want.  It's hard to knock so winsome and earnest a notion, and even though neither the Wife-O-Meter nor I liked the 3-D version very much, we positively loved the Blu-ray's 2-D picture and sound.""The spirit of Christmas lies in your heart.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242UBALCHUEBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Q7ZO8U#wasThisHelpful","R242UBALCHUEBV","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quintessential film noir.As such, it's good that Warner Bros. chose to remaster on Blu-ray the original, 1946 ""Postman Always Rings Twice"" from MGM with John Garfield and Lana Turner simultaneously with their own 1981 remake with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.  Of the two, it's still the Garfield-Turner film that reigns supreme.As you probably know, the French coined the term ""film noir"" (or ""dark film"") back in the Fifties to describe movies of the previous decade and beyond that derived from the cynicism of World War II, movies popularized in the United States, movies depicting a dark and despairing atmosphere where paranoia abounded.  The settings for these dark films were usually urban worlds of shadow, smoke, and fog, and the subject matter usually concerned some sort of crime or detection.  A film like ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) is among the first good examples of the genre, which reached its peak in things like ""Double Indemnity"" (1944) and ""The Third Man"" (1949).""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) exhibits all the characteristics of the noir film, including the femme fatale, a deadly female who lures the hero into a web of mystery and intrigue.  The screenwriters based their movie on the best-selling novel by James M. Cain, whose admirers weren't at all pleased with the changes the filmmakers made to the author's rather racy book; but there was the Production Code to think about at the time, and the studio had to impose a good deal of censorship.  Which means the film had to suggest a lot of sensuality rather than show it.The movie features the enigmatic tough guy John Garfield as a penniless drifter who picks up a job at a lunch room and gas station located on a side road outside Los Angeles.  Garfield's character, Frank Chambers, is a decent sort of guy, but he's not above the occasional con game, and it's obvious he has led a rough-and-tumble life, never settling down.  He's also something of a ladies' man, and the boss's wife, Cora, is a knockout.  It takes Chambers less than two minutes of meeting her before he plants a big one on her kisser, and she doesn't resist.Movie siren Lana Turner plays Cora Smith, the young woman who has married a much older man, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway), for security rather than love, and who is quick to see the prospects of the hired hand.  The first time Frank sees Cora, she's in shorts, all legs, and looking helplessly, teasingly sexy.  It makes for a terrific introduction to Cora's character, actually, shown from the feet and ankles up.From there, the movie develops two stories.  The first is the romance between Frank and Cora, carried on under the nose of the naively trusting husband; the second is the mystery and its consequences when Cora and Frank decide the old man's got to go.  Cora persuades Frank to arrange an ""accident"" for the unsuspecting sap.But the local DA (Leon Ames) is on to them and their schemes, and before the movie's out, you'll find further infidelity, suspense, blackmail, double crosses, triple crosses, and surprises galore.  In fact, if there is any serious problem with the story, it's that it tacks on too many twists, especially at the end.  It never knows when to quit.Still, in addition to Garfield and Turner, you'll relish a standout performance by Hume Cronyn as the couple's clever but unscrupulous lawyer, a performance that almost upstages Garfield and Turner themselves.  And along the way there is some smoldering passion, at least in appearance if not in deed, and some terrific noir cinematography in the use of light and shadow.Finally, the movie treats the viewer to a few delicious double entendres as well.  If the censors wouldn't allow the film to show too much, at least the filmmakers were going to imply what was going on, and the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions and sexuality.  The looks between Garfield and Turner are a joy to behold.  Then there are lines like Garfield's ""I could sell anything to anybody"" and Turner's ""You won't find anything cheap around here.""  Even the ""Man Wanted"" sign at the beginning of the picture suggests more than it says.""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" exemplifies the noir movement in Hollywood, as I've said, even if Hollywood didn't call it that at the time.  Part sultry romance, part mystery thriller, the movie continues to keep audiences involved with its edgy character relationships and unforeseen tensions.Video:Warner Brothers use a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec to transfer the 1.33:1 ratio, black-and-white picture to Blu-ray, the image clean and free of most age marks:  no specks, flecks, scratches, or apparent fades do we notice.  The overall appearance of the picture is slightly grainy as we might expect, and some scenes are a bit on the soft side, particularly nighttime shots.  Definition looks, as I say, a tad softer on some occasions than others, but otherwise it's fine.  There are fairly good black-and-white contrasts, too, with often deep blacks and glistening whites.  The resulting PQ is probably about as good as the improved source material allows.Audio:The sound here is neither good nor bad but typical of a 1940s' monaural soundtrack, reproduced as well as possible in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.  What seemed to me a bit forward and hard in the earlier DVD's Dolby Digital now sounds smooth and easy on the ear.  Anyway, don't expect too much in the way of frequency range, although dynamic response is surprisingly wide.  For an old movie, the audio comes off well, and dialogue is quite clear.Extras:The Blu-ray disc carries over the same extras found on the DVD release and adds a few more.  The first item is a five-minute introduction to the movie by USC film professor, historian, and author Richard Jewell.  Next is an eighty-six minute biography, ""Lana Turner:  A Daughter's Memoir,"" followed by the fifty-seven minute biography, ""The John Garfield Story.""  After these documentaries are the featurettes ""Phantoms, Inc.,"" a seventeen-minute entry in the ""Crime Does Not Pay"" series; ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" an MGM cartoon directed by Tex Avery; and a twenty-nine minute Screen Guild Theater radio broadcast of the story starring Turner and Garfield.The extras wrap with a theatrical trailer; thirty-two scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:Warner Bros. remade ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in 1981 with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, mainly to capitalize on the new freedom the cinema provided by then to include some of the steamier scenes they had to tame for the original.  Unfortunately, the newer, sexier version was less effective than the first, despite its greater frankness.  I suppose it goes to show that the imagination is still a filmmaker's most potent ally.In any case, viewers will enjoy the strong, smoldering relationship between John Garfield and Lana Turner in the original ""Postman,"" and they'll get the benefit of some fine stylistic photography, a slew of surprises, and the whole noir atmosphere.  It's not a great movie, perhaps, and maybe not the absolute best movie in the noir genre, either, but it's a good, absorbing movie, nevertheless, made all the better by high definition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBAJI2GIPWZOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PJZE0E#wasThisHelpful","RBAJI2GIPWZOQ","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm of a somewhat skeptical mind about the movie ""Poltergeist.""  It's a fun film, an entertaining film, an occasionally frightening film, but it shouldn't be a film by which to judge real-life parapsychologists (or poltergeists and hauntings, if you believe in such things).  ""Poltergeist"" is Hollywood, after all, with typically Hollywood ghosts and typically Hollywood exaggeration.  Heaven help us if such demons as the ones depicted in this movie actually frequented our homes.Now, here's the thing:  Co-writer and producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") wanted to do something a little different in the way of a ghost story.  Rather than setting it in a conventional haunted house, they decided to place their tale in a tranquil Southern California housing tract, with a tranquil, almost fairy-tale musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.  Their idea was to show how spirits of the dead can exist anywhere, even where you least expect them.  Of course, Spielberg was riding high at the time, having already made ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and he probably would have directed ""Poltergeist,"" too, if he hadn't been working on ""E.T."" the same year.  As it was, Spielberg probably did more than just write, produce, and edit the film.  He probably gave Hooper a good deal of advice in managing it as well, hearsay indicating that he directed a few scenes himself.  In any case, ""Poltergeist"" shows all the signs of a Spielberg picture, from the happy family to the ""lost"" kid to the elaborately exaggerated special effects.So, what's a ""poltergeist""?  My Random House Dictionary defines it as ""a ghost or spirit supposed to manifest its presence by noises, knockings, etc.""  But that's something of a misnomer in the case of this movie because what we have in ""Poltergeist"" is a full-fledged haunting, something the movie's characters even mention.The family involved are the Freelings:  Dad Steve (Craig T. Nelson), who sells houses in the fictional Cuesta Verde housing track; Diane (JoBeth Williams), his wife; Dana (Dominque Dunne), their teenage daughter; Robbie (Oliver Robins), their eight-year-old son; and Carol Anne (Heather O'Roarke), their five-year-old daughter, the only one in the family who can hear the spirits living with them.  A trivia footnote is that two of the three actors playing the children died relatively shortly after making the movie, Dunne strangled by an ex-boyfriend the year of the movie's release and O'Roarke a few years later of an intestinal inflammation.In the story, the first indications we get that things aren't all they appear is when we see a monster tree outside Carol Anne and Robbie's window and a clown doll in their bedroom that would scare the bejabbers out of anyone, child or adult.  When the poltergeist (or spirit) shows up, the Freelings think it's kinda fun.  The spirit rearranges furniture and moves objects across the kitchen floor.  Things soon turn bad, however, when the tree tries to eat the boy, and the spirit inside the house kidnaps the little girl, taking her into some other dimension.And what do the Freelings do when these horrifying incidents occur?  Do they go to the police like sensible, responsible parents?  Nope.  They call in parapsychologists from the local university (no offense, Loyd), a team headed by Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), who soon discover they're in over their heads.  Consequently, Dr. Lesh calls in a psychic, Tangina (diminutive Zelda Rubinstein), to exorcise the demons in the house.Although most of us are quite familiar with the film, another good friend of mine had never seen it until a month or two before this writing.  He rented it on DVD and was sorely disappointed.  He thought it was the dumbest film he'd seen in years.  Maybe you had to have grown up with it; I dunno.  ""Poltergeist"" does get rather preposterous, with hyperbole the order of the day.  Spielberg's ghosts don't just do a few spooky things; they literally turn the Freeling house into a demonic hell.  Well, if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean.Spielberg and Hooper seem determined to create a blockbuster more than merely scare an audience.  There are a couple of creepy scenes, to be sure, like when the clown doll crawls under Robbie's bed.  But most of the time, the movie contents itself with fancy special effects--a multitude of objects flying through the air, monstrous heads appearing in doorways, gigantic light displays, and a finale in which the filmmakers pull out all the stops and go for a huge pyrotechnic finish.I have to admit the movie has never frightened me.  Not when the Wife-O-Meter and I saw it in a theater on opening night, not later on tape and DVD, and not now.  Nonetheless, I have always enjoyed its humor (""Mosquito ever suck on you, son?""), its characters (""Y'all mind hanging back? You're jamming my frequency""), its flamboyant attitude, and its disregard for tradition.  Think of it more as a fun-ride than a horror movie, and you'll get more out of it.Video:The movie's colors are intensely deep and rich, with strong black levels to set them off.  Some viewers will find this image extremely attractive, while others, like myself, will find it more extreme than real life.  When I look out my window, these are not the colors I see.  What I see looks more subdued.  Anyway, that concern aside, the video quality is quite good, the Warners engineers using a VC-1 video codec and a single-layer BD25 to reproduce the movie's 2.40:1 ratio picture.  Would the engineers have been able to use a higher bit rate on a BD50?  I don't know.  VC-1 is a pretty efficient tool, so a single layer may have been all that was necessary for the best possible video.  Still, whenever I see a single-layer disc, I have to wonder about PR at the very least.  People feel more reassured when they think they're getting the best.In any case, Warner Bros. tell us on the packaging that this is a ""new digital transfer from regenerated picture elements.""  The ""regenerated"" term is new to me, but I kind of think it means they restored all or part of the movie.  The colors are deep, as I've said; a natural film grain provides a realistic texture; and definition is usually sharp, although there are also some stretches of softness.  On my television, Venetian blinds showed a degree of shimmer, which was oddly distracting in otherwise so pristine a print.Audio:The disc offers English audio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1, and Dolby Digital 2.0.  Note, however, that if you are going to listen in TrueHD, you'll have to select it from the menu, as the default is regular DD 5.1.  The TrueHD has a slightly lower overall volume level than the other tracks, perhaps due to its slightly wider dynamic range, so you may also have to turn your gain up a bit more than usual.  Once selected and adjusted, the TrueHD supplies wide dynamics, an ample frequency range, and strong impact.  The midrange is mostly smooth, with occasional lapses into nasality.  Additionally, you'll find a broad front-channel stereo spread and, from time to time, an impressive rear-channel response.  While the movie may not exhibit current state-of-the-art audio, it's the best we've heard from this particular movie, maybe ever.Extras:The disc's primary extra is a two-part documentary made in 2007, ""They Are Here:  The Real World of Poltergeists Revealed,"" totaling about thirty-one minutes.  Part one, ""Science of the Spirits,"" contains comments by various psychic investigators and ghost hunters on how science tries to find answers to paranormal phenomena.  Part two, ""Communing with the Dead,"" is more of the same, with an emphasis on the question of whether there is life beyond this existence.  It doesn't seem to occur to any of them that almost every religion in the world for the past 5,000 years has believed in an afterlife.The next important bonus is having the disc packaged in one of WB's Digibooks, a hardbound, glossy-covered, book-like affair with some forty-four pages of color pictures and text information on the film.  OK, personally, I'd rather see the studio spend their Digibook money on dual-layer BD50s and possibly higher bit rates than on pictures and text that I may never look at again, but that's just me.  The extras conclude with thirty scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:""Poltergeist"" is more of an extravaganza than it is a horror flick.  It's certainly not a traditional ghost story, which is more to the point.  Spielberg and Hooper wanted to do something similar to what ""Rosemary's Baby"" had done some years earlier; that is, show that demons can exist anywhere, not just in old, spooky mansions but in downtown apartment buildings or peaceful suburban housing tracks.  In this regard, ""Poltergeist"" works, and the filmmakers bring their usual flair to the proceedings.  It's just that the more I watch it, the sillier a lot of it looks.  Oh, well, it's still a good amusement-park ride toward the end, which is the main thing, I suppose.""This house is clean.""

"After writing, directing, and producing a string of comedy hits about teenagers, John Hughes (""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Weird Science"") turned his attention to a movie about adults (as a kind of transition before turning to comedies about children in his later career).  In 1987 he got Steve Martin and John Candy involved in the comedic hazards of cross-country travel in ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles.""  The results were typically Hughes:  funny, zany, silly, a little bit dull and annoying, and, eventually, a whole lot sentimental.I've talked to any number of people about the movie over the past few decades, most of whom have loved it.  But there are also those viewers for whom the movie is a major irritation, the movie's characters grating on their nerves.  Take your pick.  In any case, Paramount now make the movie available for the second time on Blu-ray disc, this time in honor of its twenty-fifth anniversary and no longer a Best Buy exclusive.For those of you who haven't seen it, the film stars Steve Martin as Neal Page, an uptight marketing executive who's been out of town a few days for an important business presentation; now he wants only to fly home as quickly as possible to be with his family for Thanksgiving.  However, a mix-up in tickets and a severe snowstorm strand him in Wichita, Kansas, where he continues to meet up with a total stranger, a well-meaning but irritating and unwanted fellow traveler, Del Griffith, played by John Candy.  Del is a salesman for shower-curtain rings and, in his own words, ""an annoying blabbermouth.""  He's a bighearted, lovable lug, a persona Candy would pursue throughout his relatively short movie career.  Anyway, Neal can't shake him (""Stick with me""), and together they get into a series of sometimes humorous, sometimes peevish mishaps.Stuck in Wichita, they get a room together in a cheap motel Del recommends, but they not only have to share the room, they have to share a water bed together, with predictable results.  ""Those aren't pillows!""Del never stops making noise:  talking, cracking his knuckles, clearing his sinuses.  The pair make an obvious take-off on ""The Odd Couple.""  Del gets on Neal's nerves from the moment they meet.  ""It's like going on a date with a Chatty Cathy doll!""There are some big laughs in the story among some frivolous gags and some decidedly flat ones.  A thief steals all their money in the motel room.  Not funny but necessary for later plot developments.  With the airports snowed in and flights backed up, the fellows decide to take a train, which inevitably breaks down.  Again, not funny, but it does land them in hostile territory:  farmland.  Next, they try the bus, where they continue to bicker and argue, Del leading the passengers in a goofy sing-along.  After that, it's a rental car, gone missing.  Then another car, this one rented by Del.  Letting Del drive at night in a snow storm while singing to the radio and smoking a cigarette is an obvious recipe for disaster.  One catastrophe follows another.Neal says Del is ""the biggest pain in the butt that ever came down the pike,"" and one can hardly disagree with him.  Yet, after the whole raucous journey, Hughes, who wrote, directed, and produced this one, ends it on a note viewers over the years have found either sweet and touching or pathetically manipulative.  It's that kind of movie.Trivia note:  The cover art and all of the accompanying materials for the movie list the title as ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" with the word ""and"" spelled out.  However, the movie's opening title uses an ""&"" sign, which I have followed in this review.Also, look for cameo appearances by several well-known faces, like Kevin Bacon as a man racing Neal for a cab, Ben Stein as an airport flight announcer, and Edie McClurg as a rental-car agent.Except for a string of profanities at one point, which earns the film an R rating, there are no serious gross-out jokes involved.Video:For this second Blu-ray release, the folks at Paramount use the same dual-layer BD50 and MPEG-4/AVC encode they did last time for the transfer.  In other words, it's exactly the same disc.  The restored picture reduces the film's original 1.85:1 ratio to 1.78:1 to fit a widescreen TV, and the image is quite clean, sharp, bright, vivid, and well focused.  While there is a little natural print grain here and there, which we should expect, there is almost no sign of age or noise anywhere, even in dimmer, indoor scenes.  Skin tones look as natural as one could want, with more-than-adequate black levels to set off the colors.  In short, the PQ looks quite fine.Audio:The Blu-ray disc uses lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the soundtrack, which may seem like overkill for a film that is probably 99% dialogue.  However, it does what is probably a near-perfect job in reproducing the sonics.  The sound is quite clear and reasonably dynamic, with a wide stereo spread making up for any lack of surround activity, which is indeed sparse.  So the front-center channel takes the brunt of the load, with speech rendered smoothly and realistically.Extras:The first item on the Blu-ray disc is a sixteen-minute, making-of featurette, ""Getting There Is Half the Fun:  The Story of Planes, Trains and Automobiles.""  Following that is a two-part documentary in high def, ""John Hughes: Life Moves Pretty Fast,"" which includes ""The Voice of a Generation,"" twenty-seven minutes, and ""Heartbreak and Triumph: The Legacy of John Hughes,"" twenty-six minutes.  Together, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the writing, producing, and directing career of the late filmmaker.  Then, there is ""John Hughes for Adults,"" four minutes; ""A Tribute to John Candy,"" three minutes; and a deleted scene in high def, ""Airplane Food,"" three minutes.The extras conclude with twenty-seven scene selections; bookmarks; a flimsy Eco-case; English, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  The disc comes housed in a flimsy BD Eco-case, the only difference from the previous Blu-ray packaging being the lack of a slipcover with a holographic picture on the front.Parting Thoughts:In 2010 director Todd Phillips pretty much remade ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" this time calling it ""Due Date,"" with Robert Downey, Jr. in the Steve Martin role and Zach Galifianakis in the John Candy part.  The newer film was more mean-spirited than the earlier one and Galifianakis's role less sympathetic than Candy's.  Filmmakers should leave some things alone, even when they're as uneven as they are here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38EIFDJ14H1HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFYVGU#wasThisHelpful","R38EIFDJ14H1HX","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maybe the ironic title says it all:  There is no such thing as ""A Perfect World.""  Clint Eastwood co-stars with Kevin Costner in this offbeat 1993 crime drama, which Eastwood also directed.  The story is just as morally ambiguous as its title, which pretty much sums up how moviegoers may react to it.  Eastwood has always had a tendency to present multisided views of his subject matter, from ""Dirty Harry"" to ""Unforgiven"" and particularly evident more recently in things like ""Hereafter"" and ""J. Edgar,"" views not always conducive to producing strong, positive reactions in audiences.  Viewers don't always take to ambiguity; they like their movies and TV shows to offer simple, straightforward answers to life's problems, where right is always right and wrong is obviously wrong.  People seem to find such oversimplifications offer relief from the uncertainties of the real world.  Eastwood, however, is not at all keen on proffering easy answers to tough moral dilemmas, and, thus, we get movies like ""A Perfect World.""  Some of it works; some of it doesn't.For reasons somewhat unclear, screenwriter John Lee Hancock sets the opening of the story on Halloween night in Texas, 1963, just a few weeks before the Kennedy assassination.  Yet the story is wholly unrelated, as far as I can tell, to the assassination, literally or symbolically, unless Hancock meant the date to show a turning point in America's societal values.  Anyway, it's 1963 and a hardened criminal, Butch Haines (Costner), is escaping from a Texas prison with a fellow inmate.  After breaking out through an air vent, the two of them get away in a stolen car.  Then they stop in a small town looking to find a hostage they can take with them, finding an eight-year-old boy to abduct, Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther), who comes from an ultraconservative religious family without a father.And off the three go, with a Texas Ranger, Chief Red Garnett (Eastwood), in hot pursuit.  The state governor gives Garnett a big, new vehicle for the manhunt, a specially outfitted Airstream trailer filled with electronic equipment to serve as Garnett's command center.  Garnett is an old-school lawman who doesn't much take to these newfangled things, but he accepts and uses it.  Tagging along with him, also much to his displeasure, is a young female criminologist, Sally Gerber (Laura Dern), whom the male-chauvinist officers treat with disdain, and a really creepy federal agent, Bobby Lee (Bradley Whitford), whom nobody much cares for.Butch soon jettisons his fellow escapee when the cretin tries to abuse the boy, and from then on it's just Butch and Phillip riding down the dusty Texas roads.  Now, here's the part you're probably expecting:  Butch and the boy develop a kind of father-son relationship, the boy not having a father anymore and Butch having had a difficult upbringing with his own father.  Butch treats the boy well, and can't stand anyone mistreating any child.  Before long, the boy becomes the escaped convict's willing accomplice.Meanwhile, Red keeps cruising around in his caravan, setting up roadblocks and monitoring his patrols, all the while getting advice he never asked for from the female criminologist.The movie meanders leisurely along, sometimes threatening to stall altogether; then it will suddenly shoot ahead at a breakneck speed or create moments of extreme tension.  This tendency of the movie to move in spurts is at first disconcerting, but one gets used to it.  It's part and parcel of Eastwood's sometimes sentimental, sometimes action-packed, sometimes reality-oriented directorial style.The flight through the back roads of Texas reminds one of old-time gangsters of the Thirties, Bonnie and Clyde or Pretty Boy Floyd, for instance.  What's more, the film is not without its sly humor, and there are moments of levity to lighten the load, such as Garnett's distaste for the Geritol he's taking or his trailer coming loose from the pickup towing it and crashing on its own through the woods.  There's also an unlikely stop at ""Dottie's Squat 'n' Gobble"" cafe that adds a touch of spice to the tale.The fact is, for reasons of his own, Red would rather not be chasing Butch, but the reasons for his reluctance are a long while coming.  At the same time, Butch teaches the boy how to have a little of the fun his mother and their religion have never allowed him to have.Butch is neither a good man nor a bad man but as he says ""a breed apart.""  Eastwood takes a backseat here, his character intentionally rather easygoing and stereotyped.  It's pretty much Costner's film, playing a man out of character for an actor who usually sticks with clean-cut, all-American types.  Costner, though, is terrific in the role of the antihero and makes the whole film worthwhile.  Indeed, it may be the best role of Costner's career, the armed robber escapee with the blood of several men on his hands who is, nevertheless, clearly a caring, loving, if unpredictable and dangerous man.While the movie's conclusion goes on too long (the film overstays its welcome at 138 minutes), it's hard not to feel something at the end.  I'm not entirely sure what the ultimate moral is of this obvious morality tale, but it's a wonderfully entertaining ride as it plays out.  Maybe it has something to do with Garnett's final words:""I don't know nothing.  Not one damn thing.""Video:It appears that Eastwood chose to shoot much of the film under natural lighting conditions, which makes for good realism but not always the best definition.  Indeed, the object delineation can be downright soft much of the time, but it is, as I say, probably intrinsic to the original print.  The colors are fairly natural, however, deep and lifelike, with strong black levels that can produce some murkiness at times.  A light, natural film grain gives the picture a realistic texture.Audio:The lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio remix is not much to talk about because there isn't much in the film beyond talk.  It's a rather plain-vanilla mix, quiet and clear, with a few environmental noises in the surrounds--birds, wind, the rustle of leaves, that sort of thing.  The Chief's trailer rampaging through the woods offers some convincing sounds as well.  Beyond that, it's not spectacular in any way, just efficient in getting its job done.Extras:There are practically no extras on the disc besides a ton of language choices and subtitles.  We do get a widescreen theatrical trailer, although it's in standard definition.  Beyond that, we get a hefty forty-two scene selections; English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:As you can see by now, ""A Perfect World"" is more of a character study than an action film.  This is understandable when you consider that the movie Eastwood made just before this one was ""Unforgiven,"" a Western character study, and the movie he made right after was ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" another character study.  Indeed, most of the films Eastwood has directed have been far more character studies than action films, and it's to the man's credit that he does as well as anybody at it.  ""A Perfect World"" will not please everyone because it presents things in shades of gray and takes few easy outs.  Don't expect a thrill ride, just a touching slice of life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7XBTK84IBAW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076YFJKO#wasThisHelpful","R7XBTK84IBAW0","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may or may not remember 2007's ""Paranormal Activity"" or 2010's ""Paranormal Activity 2,"" depending on how interested you were in fake reality shows about ghosts and demons or how patient you were getting through them.  In 2011's ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" we get more of the same.The premise of the movies involves a Southern California family being haunted by a demon or demons, and they do everything they can think of to find it or at least film it, using handheld video cameras and surveillance cams all over the house.  What we found in the last installment was a lot of empty time as we waited for something to happen on the surveillance tape, and then got a few startling moments as doors banged shut.  Episode two ended with all hell breaking loose in the final few minutes in a most unconvincing manner.  The movie wasn't awful, just tedious:  a long wait for a dubious wrap-up.When you think about it, these kinds of films are gold mines for studios.  Like television reality shows, they don't require much in the way of scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, direction, or acting.  Indeed, the more amateurish they look, the better they work as slices of so-called ""real"" life.  So they cost relatively little to make and promise huge returns at the box office if they can be scary enough.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" seems to have been the progenitor of these things, so you know who to blame and the kind of thing you're in for if you didn't already see the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" films.Anyway, we take up in ""Paranormal Activity 3"" two decades before the first movie began, a prequel that occurs in 1988.  We meet the two sisters, Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), as children, before they grew up, got married, and experienced the paranormal mischief of movies one and two.  The newest movie sort of explains why demons have been following them around since childhood.  It doesn't explain it very well, mind you, but at least it gives you an idea.Katie and Kristi are living with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) in the suburban community of Carlsbad, California, during the several weeks of the story.  Dennis is a wedding videographer, so he has an array of VHS video cameras at his disposal.  When he begins to observe odd happenings in the house--noises and such--he sets up an array of cameras around the place and takes to carrying a video camera with him wherever he goes.  The result of all this video handiwork is what we see in the film.  It's a sort of documentary with a wink and a nod; a documentary that wants us to believe in its reality when we know full well it's just a fiction.The movie's formula is the same as before:  The family members hear noises, weird stuff starts occurring, things go bump in the night; the camera captures it all, while the audience waits around for something, anything, to please hurry up and happen.  Needless to say, much of the camera work is shaky and the edits jerky to simulate a home movie.As usual, the film depends more on startling us than in genuinely frightening us.  Still, that's enough for a lot of viewers who apparently can't tell the difference.  There are a couple of scenes where people in the film actually jump out of nowhere and yell ""Boo!""  Yeah, both scenes are startling, but are they scary?  Hardly.  There are almost no points in the film where the filmmakers even attempt anything like creating tension or suspense.  When they do attempt it, the scenes turn out pretty well, like one involving a baby-sitter (Johanna Braddy) and another involving a ""Bloody Mary"" game.  They are truly creepy, and if the writers could have come up with more such creepiness, it would have improved the movie considerably.  Unfortunately, they don't and rely on shock tactics instead.Also as usual in horror movies, at least one person refuses to believe any of it, in this case the mother, who won't even look at Dennis's video footage of possible paranormal activity in the house.  When young Kristi starts seeing and talking to an invisible, malevolent entity she calls Toby, the mother dismisses it as childish imagination.So on we wait for something to happen, with doors opening by themselves, slamming shut, and objects flying around various rooms being the major activities of the first hour.  How many times in these movies can the filmmakers repeat the same things before audiences throw up their hands and cry Surrender?  Apparently, not enough times if box-office receipts are any indication.Basically, the film does little for the first eighty minutes or so and then picks up in the final fifteen.  However, just as the previous film went off the deep end into mindless Neverland material in its climax, so does ""Paranormal Activity 3"" jump the shark or nuke the refrigerator in the end.  The conclusion is so over-the-top and comes so out of the blue, it pretty much ruins what little believability the movie generated in the beginning.  Thus, you take your pick:  a slow, boring start with a few promising moments in the middle or a faster-paced but totally ridiculous conclusion.To add insult to injury, there are scenes in the trailers (see above) that never appear in the final movie.  So much for truth in advertising.One aside about this whole ""paranormal activity"" business:  While I know these movies are just movies, after all, and one should not take them too seriously, the filmmakers do try to pass them off as something approaching reality, as though they were documentaries.  So I feel it a minor obligation to point out that actual parapsychologists don't deal much in theories of demons from hell.  If objects fly around a room seemingly on their own--a poltergeist experience--parapsychologists believe the objects move because human agents either physically or psychically move them.  That is, live people, not ghosts or demons, almost always instigate poltergeist activity.  As a friend of mine, Loyd Auerbach, a noted author, investigator, and researcher of things paranormal, remarked a few years ago in his preface to Movie Met's Blu-ray review of ""Poltergeist"":  ""If that was the reality of what we investigate and encounter, I certainly would not have stayed in this field for as long as I have.  I'm brave, but I'm not stupid!""Video:Since the filmmakers want us to believe that one of the movie's characters shot the video we're watching, they made the image quality look intentionally dull and soft, something like VHS tape footage of the Eighties, despite Paramount's having transferred it to Blu-ray in high definition on a dual-layer BD50, using an MPEG-4/AVC codec.  The thing is, while the picture quality doesn't look much better than most standard-definition DVD's, it is probably a lot better than anything we'd see on a VHS tape of the era.  Go figure.  I'd say the movie likes it both ways.Audio:OK, so the filmmakers want us to believe that what we're seeing is what the VHS cameras caught in 1988, right?  How, then, to explain the film's surround sound, reproduced here in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1?  Did the character shooting all the footage have multiple microphones set up in every room?  Sure, it's only a movie, as I've said, so we shouldn't sweat the details.  In any case, the sound is mostly quiet, really quiet because nothing is happing most of the time, and when something does happen, it's usually loud.  The soundtrack works fine in this regard, with a deep, rumbling bass during an earthquake scene; good, quick transient response; wide dynamics; and strong impact.  In fact, the sound does most of the work of the scares.Extras:This two-disc Combo Pack contains the feature film in two HD versions on disc one, a Blu-ray:  the regular R-rated theatrical version (83 minutes) and an unrated extended version (94 minutes).  In addition, the Blu-ray provides three minutes of ""Lost Tapes,"" additional footage; fourteen scene selections for the unrated version; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages;English audio descriptions; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.The second disc, a DVD, contains the unrated edition of the movie in standard def; access to a digital copy of the unrated version; and access to an UltraViolet edition for instant streaming.  The two discs come housed in a flimsy double Eco-case with cutouts front and rear, I assume for ghosts or demons to enter and exit more easily.Parting Shots:""Paranormal Activity 3"" is much the same as its predecessors, although more the worse for wear; that is, we've been there and done that already.  One would think it was time to move on, but I suppose as long as the films make money (and how could they not make money, given their modest budget and prodigious returns?  This one grossed over $200,000,000 worldwide on a budget of about $5,000,000), who can blame the studio.  If you liked the first two ""Paranormal Activity"" movies, you'll probably like this one as well.  For me, it was a matter of diminishing returns on a product that wasn't very good to begin with.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BW3ZA12E3WXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EPZ02A#wasThisHelpful","R3BW3ZA12E3WXP","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Steve McQueen has the distinction of having starred in two of the most-memorable prison-escape pictures of all time, but where ""The Great Escape"" was just that, great, 1973's ""Papillon"" is merely good.  Of course, it helps to have had Dustin Hoffman as a co-star in ""Papillon,"" but neither of them can quite overcome the movie's length and repetition.  Personally, I would have preferred a film closer to two hours than two-and-a-half and a film depicting maybe one fewer escape attempts.  Still, we have what we have, a good movie, so let's get on with it.Franklin J. Schaffner (""Patton,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Boys from Brazil"") directed the film; and the writing team of Dalton Trumbo (""Roman Holiday,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Exodus"") and Lorenzo Semple Jr. (""The Parallax View,"" ""Three Days of the Condor,"" ""Never Say Never Again"") adapted the screenplay from the memoirs of Henri ""Papillon"" Charriere.  According to the book, published in 1969, Charriere spent about thirteen years in the penal colony of French Guiana, partly on Devil's Island (Ile du Diable), from 1932 to 1945, for a murder he always claimed he did not commit.  His memoirs recount about fourteen escape attempts, one of them successful; the movie recounts about four or five of these attempts.  The big ""however"" is that researchers have now discounted much of Charriere's book, claiming he based most of it on the exploits of others.  Whatever, the story makes a good, rousing adventure tale on screen.Good and rousing, that is, if you don't mind the movie's aforementioned length and the fact that much of it takes longer to unfold than you might like.  There are parts of the story that are not only slow paced but positively leaden.  Fortunately, the tension and excitement of the escape sequences make up for the longer, slower stretches.McQueen plays the main character, Charriere, a safecracker known as ""Papillon"" (Butterfly) for the butterfly tattoo on his chest.  Hoffman plays Louis Dega, a fellow inmate at the penal colony, a counterfeiter with a ton of money.  He's a good ally to have and becomes a good friend to Papillon.In ""Papillon"" McQueen probably gives the best performance of his career.  He's still the ultracool Steve McQueen, mind you, but his character is more vulnerable than ever before.  The French authorities have, after all, sentenced Papillon to one of the harshest prisons in the world, where ""40% of all prisoners sent there died in their first year,"" where ""you're in the middle of a swamp, a thousand miles from no place.""  When the warden locks Papillon up in solitary confinement, for instance, in darkness, living on half rations, eating bugs, and basically dying, McQueen makes the experience intensely convincing.Yet McQueen's got Dustin Hoffman as a co-star, and by comparison Hoffman is clearly the more persuasive actor.  It is to Hoffman's credit that he never tries to upstage McQueen or get in his way, underplaying his Dega character most of the time and giving McQueen plenty of room to shine.  Sadly, ""Papillon"" would be among McQueen's final movie appearances before disappearing from the screen for half a dozen or more years, returning for a couple of films in 1980 before his untimely death at age fifty.Anyway, Papillon is planning his first escape before he ever reaches the penal colony.  He just needs enough money to bribe people to help him, and he sees that Dega is the only one with enough loot to be of aid.  Therefore, he makes friends with Dega early on, offering him ""protection"" in return for cash.  Then a fellow prisoner tells Papillon it's hopeless, there is no way out, no matter how much money he's got, because there's nowhere to run, nowhere to escape.  Until Papillon figures out a way.The narrative unfolds slowly, but the two stars are compelling, cinematographer Fred Koenekamp's photography is striking, and Jerry Goldsmith's musical score helps maintain one's interest throughout.  After a lengthy introduction, we finally see Papillon's initial escape attempt at about the forty-minute mark.  It's worth the wait.The script is lean with its words and big on its visuals, so just sit back and take it in.  The movie is also pretty serious, with only a couple of lighthearted intervals.  McQueen's aging in the story also looks remarkable, so the film has the appearance a viewer looks for in a big adventure yarn.Years go by, escape attempts continue, Papillon endures.Trivia:  According to John Eastman in his book ""Retakes"" (Ballantine, 1989) ""Henri Charriere visited the prison set built in Jamaica and found it 'all too realistic.'""  (Charriere contributes to one of the vintage featurettes on the disc as well.)  ""Dustin Hoffman found the physical and emotional demands of his role so rigorous that he lost twenty pounds during production.  His wife, Anne Byrne, made her screen debut here as Dega's wife.  Cast and crew found location work not much less strenuous than serving a term on the actual Devil's Island.  Some six hundred German-descended Jamaican farmers served as the French prisoners.  For the butterfly-chasing sequence, 2,500 blue morphos butterflies were imported from South America; not one survived.  Allied Artists financed this production mainly from the profits of 'Cabaret.'""Video:Warner engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode to transfer the movie to Blu-ray in the movie's native aspect ratio, 2.40:1.  In doing so, they obtain strong, natural colors, lifelike but never bright or showy, set off by strong black levels.  Definition varies from extremely sharp in close-ups to fairly ordinary in medium and long shots.  One notices some small degree of grain inherent to the print, never objectionable even when it's obviously noticeable in outdoor scenes.  By and large, the picture looks clean, free of age deterioration, specks, lines, or fades, making the movie easy on the eye and the location shooting a pleasure.Audio:For a film four decades old, the sound holds up nicely, remixed and reproduced on Blu-ray in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It displays a reasonably wide front-channel stereo spread and an agreeable ambient bloom in the surrounds.  On occasion one hears a terrifically deep bass lending authority to the sound.  Dialogue is clear, backgrounds quiet, frequency response extended, and impact decent.  Best of all, except for a few isolated instances, the sound is quite smooth.  Like the PQ, it's a pleasure.Extras:There isn't much WB provide for extras on the disc.  They did manage to find a twelve-minute vintage featurette, ""The Magnificent Rebel,"" on the making of the picture.  It's in a standard-screen ratio and in standard definition.  And there's a theatrical trailer, also in standard definition but in a 1.78:1 ratio.  Both items look rather the worse for wear.The main bonus item here is the handsome, hardcover Blu-ray Book packaging, with thirty-two pages of glossy pictures and text, the disc fastened to the inside back cover.  The extras wrap up with thirty-nine scene selections; English as the only spoken language; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Thoughts:Believe it or not, when Allied Artists first released ""Papillon"" in 1973, movie critics were not entirely kind to it.  In fact, some of them were downright hostile:  ""So overloaded with details that the stars are almost lost in exposition, repetition and unfocused drama.""  --Judith Crist.  ""So solemn one would think it the story of a pope at the very least.""  --The New Yorker.  ""Papillon offers torture as entertainment but winds up making entertainment a form of torture.""  --Paul D Zimmermann.  ""A 2 1/12-hour epic trampling the corn growing round the theme of man's inhumanity to man.""  --Sight and Sound.Well, what do critics know.  In the years since its release, ""Papillon"" has grown in stature, with most critics now agreeing that it is among the better prison-escape pictures around, and the public at IMDb give the film an average score of 8/10.  As I said in the beginning, ""Papillon"" is a good movie, overlong as it is.  With a little judicious trimming, it might have been a great one, but we have what we have, and it's plenty good enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KL4JD1I6B5AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KWVDWI#wasThisHelpful","R1KL4JD1I6B5AC","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sometimes, trouble just follows a man.""People have been debating which Western movie is the best one ever made since the days of Broncho Billy Anderson.  OK, so which one really is the best Western of all?  ""Stagecoach,"" ""Red River,"" ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""High Noon,"" ""Shane,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Tombstone,"" either version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" or ""True Grit""?  The front-runners go on and on.  For my money, ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976) is as good as they get.Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, clearly the only actor since John Wayne to have assumed the mantle of ultimate Western hero, ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" demonstrates every characteristic that marks a legendary film about the Old West.  It features the laconic loner in the white hat, the rousing shoot-outs, the rescues in the nick of time, the glorious outdoor scenery, the colorful cast of supporting characters, and, of course, the inevitable pretty girl.  Add a touch of sentiment and a dose of soul to the stirring action, and you get a quintessential Western and an extraordinary motion picture.The story begins in the waning years of the American Civil War, Josey Wales a peace-loving farmer with wife and child.  But a marauding band of Red Legs, cutthroats working for the Union and led by a man named Terrill (Bill McKinney), attack and kill his family and burn his house.  Seeking revenge, Josey joins a group of Rebel guerrillas in the hope of catching up with the villains.  It doesn't happen.  The War ends, and the law puts a price on Josey's head for being among the few men not to surrender to the North.  Instead, he heads West--Southwest, to be exact, perhaps to Mexico, through the Indian Nations and down to Texas, he isn't sure.  Ironically, the very man Josey is seeking, Terrill, heads up the posse assigned to track him down, accompanied by one of Josey's former friends, a man named Fletcher (John Vernon).On his journey, Josey acquires a reputation as a notorious gunfighter, most of it justified, some of it not.  In addition, he meets up with a rich variety of castaways, who, despite Josey's penchant for independence, insist one by one upon tagging along with him.  At first it's a young soldier (Sam Bottoms); then it's an aged Indian (Chief Dan George); a young Indian woman (Geraldine Keams); an elderly lady (Paula Trueman); her beautiful granddaughter (Sandra Locke); and, finally, a mean red hound that Josey continually abuses with his expectorations.  Josey also encounters on the trail veteran character actors Royal Dano, John Russell, Woodrow Parfrey, and Sheb Wooley (from Eastwood's old ""Rawhide"" days), as well as Will Sampson as a tribal leader, Ten Bears.Phil Kaufman (whom Eastwood replaced as director of the film) and Sonia Chernus wrote the screenplay based on the novel ""Gone to Texas"" by Forrest Carter.  Jerry Fielding (""The Wild Bunch,"" ""Scorpio,"" ""The Enforcer,"" ""Semi-Tough"") wrote the music.""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" combines the easy pace and amiable humor of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" with the grand, sweeping vistas of ""Jeremiah Johnson""; and it throws in some of the picaresque adventure of ""Little Big Man"" with a lot of the mythic heroism of ""A Fistful of Dollars.""But Eastwood's hero is more than a ""Man With No Name"" coming out of nowhere.  We know who Josey Wales is, we know his background, and we know his motivations.  He's bigger than life, certainly, but he is also a troubled fellow with genuine doubts and limitations.  Indeed, it's his very indecisiveness that is indirectly one of his most favorable qualities, especially as the movie proceeds, since it is because of his hesitations that he finds new acquaintances and confronts new experiences.There is nothing profound about ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" no heavy messages, deep psychological insights, or intense social issues at stake.  It's just welcome entertainment, straightforward Hollywood filmmaking at its best.Video:Using a dual-layer BD50 and MPEG-4/AVC encoding, the WB video engineers do a good job transferring the movie to Blu-ray disc in its original aspect ratio, 2.40:1.  The image quality is not quite so vivid or detailed as some other HD films, but it conveys as fine a sense of realism as any.  The definition ranges from average at worst to excellent, a little soft in some scenes, with colors that are mostly natural, the greens, browns, and yellows particularly lifelike.  Facial tones are sometimes a bit intense, there's a modicum of inherent print grain visible at all times, and the overall picture is somewhat dark, owing, no doubt, to Eastwood's and director of photography Bruce Surtees's desire for capturing natural lighting conditions.  In other words, it looks on disc pretty much the way I remember it in a theater.Audio:Warners use lossless DTS-HD Master Audio to reproduce the film's soundtrack in a 5.1 remix.  There is both depth and clarity to the sound, tremendous deep bass, an exceptionally wide left-to-right stereo spread in the front speakers, and good channel separation in the back.  Indeed, one would swear when listening to this remix that the engineers had originally made it specifically for five-channel reproduction, with the surrounds used to advantage in gun battles, musical ambience, and environmental noises.  What's more, there is a strong transient response involved and some terrific impact.  Yes, the 1976 soundtrack still gives away its age in occasional lapses into hardness and nasality, but on the whole it's quite attractive.Extras:There's a welcome collection of bonus materials on the disc.  The first of these is a new audio commentary by film critic and historian Richard Schickel, whose words are spare and informative.  Next comes a newly made featurette, ""Clint Eastwood's West,"" twenty-nine minutes, in widescreen and HD that covers the actor-director's career, especially in Westerns.  Then, we find two vintage featurettes, ""Hell Hath No Fury:  The Making of The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" thirty minutes in non-anamorphic widescreen and standard definition, and ""Eastwood in Action,"" eight minutes in standard screen and standard def.After those items we get thirty-five scene selections; a widescreen theatrical trailer; English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish spoken languages; French, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Spanish subtitles; and English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired.Finally, because this is a Blu-ray Book package, we have the disc attached to the back cover of a handsome, thirty-six page, hardbound book of text and pictures.Parting Thoughts:Some years ago, my best friend, a professor of film, told me flat-out he considered ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" the best Western ever made.  I hadn't looked at it that way.  He said Eastwood did nothing particularly new in the film, but like Orson Welles years earlier, he combined all the best ingredients that came before him in a new, fascinating, and highly captivating way.  For him, I guess you could say ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" was the ""Citizen Kane"" of Westerns.  Although I wouldn't go quite that far, I still love the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KU7QC8NPOR0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RG9LMS#wasThisHelpful","R3KU7QC8NPOR0D","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no question about it:  Judging by this 2009 thriller, ""Obsessed,"" Beyonc Knowles has a great career ahead of her as a singer.Unfortunately, Ms. Knowles doesn't sing in the picture.  It is, in fact, her first screen appearance where she doesn't sing.  Maybe she should have.  It would have improved things.The fact is, Knowles is not at all bad, nor are any of the other actors; it's the movie that's bad, a variation on the old ""Fatal Attraction"" ploy.Everything in the film proceeds according to formula.  We start with an ideal couple:  Sharon (Knowles) and Derek Charles (Idris Elba).  They have been married for three years and have a beautiful baby boy.  Derek is the executive vice president of an L.A. asset management firm; the couple live in a plush, three-story home in a ritzy suburban neighborhood; and they drive recent-model Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac automobiles.  Life is good.Then a new temp, Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), shows up at Derek's office.  She wangles her way into a job as Derek's personal assistant and becomes obsessed with him.  She appears, outwardly, as intelligent as she is gorgeous, but we know she's up to no good when the music becomes ominous whenever she shows upWhen wife Sharon meets the new temp girl, it doesn't take her long to get jealous, but Derek assures her that Lisa is only there for a short while.  Meanwhile, it doesn't take long for the audience to wonder what Lisa's motives are in hanging around Derek so much.  Is it innocent infatuation?  Is she conniving, plotting some sort of extortion scheme?  Or is she just crazy?  If the filmmakers had followed that line of doubt, the film might have built some tension or suspense.  But neither director Steve Shill (a prolific TV director doing his first feature film) nor screenwriter David Laughery (""Lakeview Terrace,"" ""Flashback"") seems at all interested in creating tension or suspense so much as boring us to death with talk and then shock and awing us with stupidity.  Haven't any of the filmmakers seen a Hitchcock movie?I mean, everyone in this film acts stupidly.  The story quickly reveals that Lisa is not devious or cunning; she's simply sick and delusional.  She creates fantasies about Derek loving her, and at an office Christmas party she pushes herself on him in the men's room.  Derek pushes her away immediately, but he tells no one except his close friend and colleague Ben (Jerry O'Connell) about the incident.  When Lisa continues to come on to Derek, he keeps it a secret.  Apparently, he has never read a newspaper or watched a TV broadcast about the scandals of famous politicians, so he doesn't understand the consequences of keeping sexual encounters a secret...or denying them.  The one time he does determine to tell his wife about this deluded woman stalking him, it's at the exact moment when Sharon has gotten off the phone talking to one of her female friends who's in tears about her husband admitting an affair to her.  Derek decides that it might not be the best time to spring his own secrets on her.  It's a coincidence worthy of the best (or worst) daytime soap opera.For her part, Sharon remains rational for a longer period than anyone else in the story, but then when she finds out about Lisa's advances, she goes completely nuts.  Par for the course in this film.As the story progresses, Lisa's actions become more seriously outrageous, and the plot gets more seriously harebrained and idiotic.  The temp girl is an idiot; the husband is an idiot; the wife is an idiot; even the couple's baby-sitter and Derek's regular personal assistant are idiots.  No one behaves rationally in ""Obsessed,"" making the plot not at all scary or exciting, just frustrating.There is one unintentionally humorous aspect to the film, though, one I alluded to earlier.  Every time the music becomes louder, more dramatic, and more threatening, the more likely something baleful is about to happen.  It's so corny and overdone, it might elicit a few giggles from viewers with nothing better to do.Video:No complaints about the video quality.  The Sony engineers do their utmost to present the film in the best possible condition they can, using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4 codec to replicate the movie's original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are beautifully realistic, deep and solid.  Whites are clear and vibrant; black levels are fairly deep to set off the rest of the hues; and overall delineation is sharp.  The screen is clean, with the merest whisper of grain to provide texture.Audio:Although there is nothing particularly spectacular about the soundtrack, the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio does a fine job with all aspects of the reproduction.  The surrounds display some excellent musical bloom, along with a little environmental noise; the dynamics are incisive; and the low-frequency response shows its presence on more than a few occasions.Extras:The primary bonus items are three featurettes, all in high definition.  The first featurette is ""Playing Together Nicely,"" a fifteen-minute segment wherein director Shill, producer Will Packer, screenwriter David Loughrey, and various of the actors comment on the film's casting and direction, and how great the movie is.  The second item is ""Girl Fight,"" eleven minutes with director Shill, stunt coordinator Lance Gilbert, and stars Beyonc Knowles and Ali Larter commenting on the film's climactic fight scene.  And the final item is ""Obsessed:  Dressed to Kill,"" nine minutes with costume designer Maya Lieberman, who talks about the film's wardrobe.  It's all pretty boring, but it beats watching the movie.The extras conclude with a digital copy disc of the film, compatible with PCs, PSPs, Macs, iPhones, iTunes, and iPods; BD-Live; sixteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Shots:""Obsessed"" kept making me madder and madder as I watched it because the characters' behavior kept getting dumber and dumber.  By the time it ended, however, I wasn't so much angry anymore as I was a little giddy at the film becoming so laughably bad.  Seldom does a movie thriller misfire so severely as this one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDX3IJ8WBZAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CAWNDS#wasThisHelpful","RWDX3IJ8WBZAS","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Believe and you will see.""Given the popularity of the ghost-story genre, it's surprising that the cinema has given us so few really good ones.  In the past couple of decades it seems as though movies have abandoned things like tension and suspense in favor of blood and gore.  But there was a time, and, fortunately, there still is a time, for old-fashioned frights.  Among the ghost stories I have found most entertaining through the years are ""The Uninvited"" (1944), ""The Haunting"" (1963), ""The Legend of Hell House"" (1973), ""Poltergeist"" (1982), ""The Others"" (2001), and ""The Ring"" (2002).  I suppose you could also throw in a couple of nontraditional ghost stories like ""Alien"" (1979), which may seem outwardly like science fiction but at its core is really a good, old haunted-house story, and ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999).I mention all this to point out that good chillers are hard to come by.  What we usually get are ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" clones, things like the more-recent ""One Missed Call,"" ""Rest Stop,"" or ""Feast of Flesh.""  That's why I find a film like 2007's ""The Orphanage"" (""El Orfanato"") so welcome.  It's a Spanish production, directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, whose work has mainly been in Spanish television and music videos, but Guillermo del Toro co-produced it, he of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""Hellboy,"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"" fame.  You can see del Toro's hand in many of the scenes, and if you like his touch, you'll like Bayona's work and ""The Orphanage,"" too.  It's an extraordinarily impressive, low-key shocker in extraordinarily impressive high-def picture and sound.Like all good ghost stories, this one's got a creepy old house at its center.  It's a former orphanage on a rocky coast of Spain, a huge, rambling place where the main character, Laura Sanchez (Belen Rueda), spent a part of her childhood.  Now thirty-seven years old, Laura persuades her doctor husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), to buy the long-abandoned building of her youth and turn it into a home for special children.  Their own son, the adopted boy Simon (Roger Princep), is a child of special needs:  He's got HIV and must take medications each day to survive.All goes well for the first few days the family is there, and then things turn peculiar.  Simon insists he sees and plays with invisible ""friends,"" presumably imaginary.  An old lady, Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla), shows up claiming to be a social worker that no one has heard of, and later Laura finds her prowling about the house in the dead of night.  Shortly thereafter, Laura finds that someone, or some thing, appears to be trying to communicate with her and Simon, as Simon leads them on a treasure hunt around the grounds of the old place.  A mysterious little boy with a gunnysack mask shows up, and he seems none too friendly.  Laura finds a curious doorknob lying about in the house, but she cannot fathom what it's for, as there is no door without a knob.Then one of Simon's invisible friends, Tomas, tells him that his parents adopted him, a fact he relates to Laura and Carlos.  And shortly thereafter Simon goes missing, almost driving Laura mad with grief.  Thus, the movie is more than a spine tingler; it's an adept psychological study of a mother's loss.So that's the story's setup.  The movie goes on to explore Laura's growing obsession with the supernatural, her growing belief that the house contains spirits of the children who used to attend the orphanage with her, and her determination that her own child is still alive and is somehow with these spirits somewhere nearby.  She even calls upon a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin), to conduct a psychic investigation of the house, something Laura's husband as well as a police psychologist, Pilar (Mabel Rivera), thoroughly disapprove of.Meanwhile, the tension grows by the minute.  This is a quiet film for the most part, but it's an imaginative one, well filmed, with lots of odd angles, plenty of dark corners and corridors, and a musical score that elicits shudders from the outset.  Still, it's those quiet moments that are most telling because it's from these most serene intervals that the movie's most frightful elements arise.Not only is the story spooky, with the pressure mounting throughout, there are several good shocks along the way that will knock you out of your seat.  Mostly, though, the film just makes your hair stand on end.I've seen ""The Orphanage"" three times now, and even though I liked it the first two times, I enjoyed it all the more the third time around (thanks in no small part to the excellence of its high-def picture and sound).  Yet, it's still strange that I have enjoyed it as much as I have on subsequent viewing, given that this latest time I knew everything that was going to happen.  Perhaps it's because I saw things this time I had missed the first times, like the significance of the Peter Pan story and the nearby lighthouse.  Perhaps it's because I began to see more clearly the relationships among all the story's characters and events.  I even liked the ending more each time, an ending about which I had some initial reservations but now see opens up to several possible new interpretations.  And I grew to appreciate the acting of Ms. Rueda as the distraught mother.  I suspect I was so caught up in the plot and events the first time I saw it, I overlooked how much this fine actress's portrayal helped to sell the horror.While ""The Orphanage"" moves along at a leisurely pace, it builds to a terrifying climax.  Viewers expecting something quicker and more gruesome may not like it, and viewers who don't speak Spanish may resist it for its English subtitles.  Frankly, I didn't notice the movie even had subtitles, so engrossed was I in the goings on.Video:New Line transferred the 2.35:1 ratio picture to Blu-ray disc at 1080 resolution using an VC-1 codec with splendid results.  The video is about as clear and well delineated as that of any high-definition disc I've watched.  Colors are bright and vivid when necessary, although often they have an intentionally cold, subdued, iron-gray pastel cast to them.  While there is a slightly shiny appearance to the image, it usually helps to distinguish and clarify objects.  Black levels are deep, yet even in darker scenes the detailing is above par.  Shots of the old house, set on a cliff between a rocky coastline and a woods, are sometimes stunningly beautiful, the greens of the foliage, the blues of the ocean, and the whites of the snow creating a panorama of gorgeous portraits.  I saw zero artifacts and just the merest hint of normal film grain in an otherwise immaculate print.  Needless to say, object delineation is unusually sharp, except in shots where the director intended a degree of softness.Audio:The Blu-ray edition provides a single Spanish soundtrack in DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you haven't heard a good Master Audio 7.1 track, even in 5.1 as I listened to it, then you've missed something.  However, if you've heard ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in DTS MA, then you'll get the idea.  The audio for ""The Orphanage"" is very atmospheric, thanks to the widely dispersed channel information and the abundance of eerie surround sounds, like creaking doors, groaning boards, dripping water, rain, thunder, voices, and footsteps, which are now more pinpoint accurate in their directionality than ever.  More important, though, is the clarity of the midrange.  There were times during this film when I thought some of the movie's noises were real and in the room with me, and I actually put the film into pause to check them out.  Then, too, you'll find exceptionally wide dynamics, a taut bass, and a quick transient response.  This is not a particularly ""blockbuster"" type soundtrack, just an effective one.Extras:The extras are the same as on New Line's SD version of the movie, and they are quite welcome, consisting primarily of four useful featurettes on the making of the film.  The first is ""When Laura Grew Up:  Constructing The Orphanage,"" seventeen minutes and especially enlightening insofar as these things go.  The second is ""Tomas' Secret Room,"" ten minutes specifically on sets, special effects, art direction, and the like.  The third is ""Horror in the Unknown:  Makeup Effects,"" nine minutes, self-explanatory.  And the fourth is ""Rehearsal Studio:  Cast Auditions and Table Read,"" about three-and-a-half minutes.  All are in standard definition.The extras conclude with an extensive set of still galleries covering the cast, make-up effects, design, black-and-white photography, production, and conceptual art.  Then, there are twenty-four scene selections (but no chapter insert); a ""Marketing Campaign"" that includes two Spanish and two U.S. theatrical trailers and teasers and posters; Spanish as the only spoken language; and English and Spanish subtitles.Parting Thoughts:Viewers who don't appreciate a good ghost story and would rather watch a mad slasher use a stainless-steel machete to tear his way through a dozen hapless teenagers will probably find ""The Orphanage"" disappointing, even boring.  For the rest of us, the movie will be a quiet and disquieting thriller, made all the more fascinating for the beauty of its high-definition picture and sound.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQXFYJYY9V92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015ET3YY#wasThisHelpful","RNQXFYJYY9V92","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""One flew East, one flew West,And one flew over the cuckoo's nest.""""Five Easy Pieces,"" ""Carnal Knowledge,"" ""The Last Detail,"" and ""Chinatown"" had already made Jack Nicholson a star.  ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" made him a superstar.  Now, to do further justice to a genuine classic, Warner Bros. make the movie available in a new, high-definition Blu-ray box set they call the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition.""  While the picture and sound qualities appear to be the same as in the previous Blu-ray Book edition, at least we can be thankful for the additional bonus items the studio now offers in the new set.The easy interpretation of Ken Kesey's popular 1962 counterculture novel, upon which producers later based the stage play and the Oscar-winning movie, is to say that only crazies are able to see the world clearly.  However, the book's protagonist, Randall Patrick McMurphy, is not crazy.  Like Paul Newman's ""Cool Hand Luke,"" McMurphy is an emblem of determined individualism in a world of conformity, a symbol of people's capacity to overcome odds and accomplish whatever goals they set for themselves no matter what the circumstances.  McMurphy shows people how to stand up for themselves and be themselves, and the story in its various guises has been an inspiration for several generations of dedicated fans.Michael Douglas brought ""Cuckoo's Nest"" to the screen in 1975 after a long and inexplicably arduous battle to get it made.  Douglas's father, Kirk, obtained the rights to the novel in the early 1960's and starred in a stage adaptation by Dale Wasserman, but the actor could never get a studio interested in producing it.  His son took over trying to get it to the screen in the early 1970's, finally succeeding (by which time his father had grown too old, or too obstreperous, for the main role).  Even given that Wasserman's play was altered considerably by Douglas and that the eventual screenplay gutted Kesey's novel of its point of view, changing it from Chief Bromden's to McMurphy's, the movie's history is remarkably saddening when you consider the sheer quantity of junk that finds its way into motion-picture theaters every year.  I mean, Kesey's story should have been a natural for the rebellious nature of young moviegoers in the 60's and early 70's, but Hollywood must have thought a nuthouse setting was too far outside the norm for its mainstream audiences.  It makes you wonder if Hollywood itself isn't being run by the inmates of the asylum.Anyway, the younger Douglas found his financing in Saul Zaentz, the head of Fantasy Records in Berkeley, CA.  Together, Douglas and Zaentz spotted their director in Milos Forman, the Czechoslovakian filmmaker whose ""Fireman's Ball"" caught their attention for its sharp-edged humor.  Zaentz and Forman would collaborate again on ""Amadeus"" a few years later and share their second Academy Award for Best Picture.The main character in ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is R.P. McMurphy, a boisterous, at first a self-absorbed roustabout serving time for antisocial behavior, fighting, and statutory rape.  But it occurs to McMurphy that he might be able to get out of doing hard labor by pretending to be crazy and being sent to a relatively cushy mental institution for ""observation and evaluation.""  The movie, set in 1963, begins with his admittance to the hospital and moves on through his experiences with the patients there and his eventual endeavors to get them to help themselves.His nemesis at the hospital is the hard-nosed, self-assured Nurse Mildred Ratched.  She's the authority figure, more important than the head of the institution because she directly controls the conduct and activity of the patients on her floor.  And that includes McMurphy, who finds her exacting regime demeaning, depriving the men on her ward of their very souls.  The plot becomes a battle of wills between the tyrannical Big Nurse and the free-spirited McMurphy, with McMurphy betting the other patients that he can eventually get under her skin and make her lose her cool.From the outset the filmmakers agreed they wanted only the best possible actors for the movie's characters, rather than big-name stars.  Director Forman says on the disc's accompanying documentary that he always wanted Jack Nicholson for the character of McMurphy, the actor having impressed him after he saw his energetic performance in ""The Last Detail.""  The filmmakers also discussed the possibility of Gene Hackman as McMurphy, Hackman having recently made an impression in ""The French Connection.""  In any case, Nicholson, initially unavailable, got the job, and he proved the perfect combination of extroverted rabble rouser, con artist, and sympathetic motivator the movie needed.  Likewise, the filmmakers made an inspired decision to use Louise Fletcher as the frigid Nurse Ratched.  Like Nicholson, she was not the only choice for the part, but she brings to the role an icy calm that makes her presence all the more threatening and her evil all the more insidious.Also from the beginning director Forman wanted actors who looked as distinctly different from one another as possible.  He has said he doesn't like to watch movies where an actor enters the story, goes away for a while, and when he returns you've forgotten who he is.  Consequently, for supporting roles Forman chose relatively unknown actors with unusual physical makeups, most of whom we now know well.  There's Danny DeVito as Martini, Sydney Lassick as Cheswick, Christopher Lloyd as Taber, Vincent Schiavelli as Fredrickson, and in pivotal roles William Redfield as Harding and Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit.  Finally, Scatman Crothers plays the night orderly, Turkle, and Will Sampson plays the huge Native American, Chief Bromden.  In the novel, the Chief narrated the story, but the movie relegates him to a lesser job, that of trusted friend to McMurphy, a change that infuriated the book's author, Ken Kesey.For the sake of authenticity, the filmmakers chose to shoot the entire movie on location in a real mental institution, the Oregon State Hospital being the only one they could find that would allow them the privilege.  For an added note of authenticity, Dr. Dean R. Brooks, the head of the real hospital, plays Dr. John Spivey, the head of the fictional one.  Furthermore, the filmmakers insisted that all the actors spend as much time as possible with the real patients at the institution, and that they try to remain in character even away from the camera.  Obviously, the hard work and dedication paid off.The book, the play, and the movie have all been accused over the years of misogyny, a hatred of or disrespect for women, which seems a little unfair.  The story focuses on a group of men living together under trying circumstances, so we might expect for all practical purposes that they would often refer to women as sexual objects.  And most films center on a male as the bad guy, so it only seems fair that an occasional film like this one use a female as the antagonist.  Besides, there are still more female nurses in the world, and symbolically the female authority figure is a convenient representation of the matriarch against whom the boys rebel.Critics have also denounced the story for portraying a drunken libertine, McMurphy, as a hero and portraying a woman doing her job, Nurse Ratched, as a villain.  But Kesey never intended McMurphy to be a hero; he's an antihero in the best possible sense, just as Nurse Ratched is no ordinary heavy.  McMurphy can't help himself, whether acting selfishly or selflessly, because he's basically a good man with bad faults.  Likewise, the cold-blooded Nurse Ratched is a good woman who believes firmly that what she's doing is in her patients' best interest, oblivious to their real needs, something like the totalitarian societies she symbolizes.  She would never admit to the evil lying within her icy self.Among the highlights of the film, look for sequences involving the World Series, a fishing trip, a basketball game, electroshock therapy, a climactic Christmas party, and a heart-wrenching finale, all tied together by Jack Nitzsche's haunting musical score.  ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a terrific piece of moviemaking--thoughtful, poignant, funny, and uplifting.Video:In this new Ultimate Collector's Edition, Warner Bros. offer the movie on a dual-layer BD50 rather than a BD25 as they did for the earlier Blu-ray Book edition, again using a VC-1, 1080p transfer taken from a digital master created from restored elements.  However, the actual video encode appears to be the same, WB using the extra space on the BD50 for additional bonus documentaries.Anyway, you'll find no lines, scratches, or age marks here.  Yet, despite this, given that director Foreman filmed entirely on location and went for as realistic a style as he could get, the WB video engineers probably didn't have the absolute best video with which to work.  For the high-definition Blu-ray transfer the video engineers seem to have tried to mitigate the film's slightly grainy appearance, and in the process they may have softened the picture a little too much.  In comparing the BD image a few years ago with an upscaled image from WB's latest DVD mastering, I found that in scene after scene, I had difficulty telling many of them apart.  In medium and long shots, the Blu-ray had a distinct advantage in clarity and object delineation, but in facial close-ups, the grainier standard-def picture appeared to have as much or more detail, the BD being a bit smoothed over.What we get on the Blu-ray disc, then, is a picture quality that varies from crystal clear and razor sharp to somewhat soft and blurred, almost from shot to shot.  Fortunately, colors remain fairly natural, and there is nothing that cries out as desperately bad.  Still, as I say, the source material may not have always been the best, even cleaned up.Audio:Now here's the thing about the audio:  Even though Warner Bros. now offer a bigger slate of language choices, they still give us only a regular, lossy, Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on the disc.  I have no idea why they chose to release an ""Ultimate Edition"" and not provide lossless DTS-HD Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD sound.  Maybe because the soundtrack has little to do, being about ninety-five percent dialogue, WB figured it was pointless to offer it in a lossless format.  Film studios move in mysterious ways.In any case, the Dolby Digital 5.1 continues to deliver a reasonably decent sound, widely dispersed in the front channels, with good transient impact.  Note, however, that the filmmakers shot almost entirely on location, and just as the video sometimes differs in quality, so can the sonics differ from scene to scene, the indoor audio often sounding constricted, nasal, pinched, and even muffled, revealing the aural limitations of the actual hospital rooms used throughout the production.  Whenever the musical track kicks in, the stereo spread increases dramatically and the sound stage opens up, but there is still never much information directed toward the rear speakers except in the isolated case of a helicopter fly-by.Extras:I reviewed the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" Blu-ray box set, which may or may not still be available. In any case, for it Warners carried over many of the extras from their earlier Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray Book sets, and they add a ton of peripheral items to the mix.  First, on the disc itself, there's an excellent audio commentary by director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz.  Next, there's an eighty-seven-minute documentary, ""Completely Cuckoo,"" that includes interviews with almost everybody associated with the making of the film.  (The Blu-ray Book contains only an abbreviated version.)  Then, there is another, briefer documentary, ""Asylum:  Empty Nest for the Mentally Ill,"" that includes recent interviews with Dr. Dean Brooks, the real-life hospital administrator who played the head of the institution in the movie, and Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film.  After that, there are eight additional, deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer.The extras on the disc conclude with thirty-three scene selections; English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Turkish, and other spoken languages; French, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and other subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.In addition to the Blu-ray disc, the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" box contains a fifty-two page commemorative hardbound book, filled with pictures and text; a reproduction of the original press book; a deck of playing cards with McMurphy's picture on the back and characters from the film on the face (if you were hoping for the girlie cards McMurphy used in the movie, no such luck); four small reproductions of original theatrical posters; and a whole collection of photo cards.Lastly, for those of you with limited shelf space wondering if you have to make room for the big box, the disc itself comes in its own foldout cardboard container, a kind of Digipak, that you can place on your shelf if you haven't room for the box.Parting Thoughts:For a motion picture that no studio wanted to produce, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" did all right for itself.  Not only did it become one of the top box-office attractions of 1975, it swept all five of the most important Oscars of the year, winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Best Director (Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).  Finally getting the film made was as much a triumph over adversity as McMurphy's selfless final decision in the story.  It's an all-around great show, and for the ultimate collector, the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" ain't a bad deal, either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVJK1L5U2535/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00168IWU0#wasThisHelpful","R3MVJK1L5U2535","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first and only other time I encountered Maestro Cohen and Arcangelo, they were providing the accompaniment for violinist Vilda Frang on an excellent album of Mozart violin concertos. It was a pleasure at the time hearing them play, and it's an equal pleasure listening to them here.On the present album, Arcangelo play three selections, one from Haydn and two from Mozart, all from approximately the same period, the late eighteenth century. The first item is the Sinfonia concertante in B flat major by Joseph Haydn (1732-1809), a piece he wrote in 1792. A sinfonia concertante is kind of a mix of symphony and concerto, this one featuring a violin (Ilya Gringolts), cello (Nicolas Altstaedt), oboe (Alfredo Bernardini), and bassoon (Peter Whelan).The playing of Arcangelo appears silky smooth, every phrase, every note, every nuance gliding effortlessly from one to another. And since this is Haydn, we can expect a plenitude of charming tunes strung together in a seemingly unending display of delightful music making. Arcangelo do Haydn justice with a reasonably lively, always graceful and elegant performance. I should also single out the soloists for their commendably gentle yet virtuosic work. Everything about the production displays a glistening polish that is most enjoyable. They go on to create a lovely Andante and a most-spirited conclusion.Next, we get the Oboe Concerto in C major by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), a piece he wrote in 1777. The featured player is Alfredo Bernardini, oboe. The two Mozart works are both equally felicitous, and Arcangelo perform them with refinement and finesse, Mr. Bernardini playing a mean oboe.The program concludes with Mozart's Bassoon Concerto in B flat major, written in 1774. It features Peter Whelan, bassoon. Again the ease of Arcangelo's playing perfectly enhances the mellow nature of the oboe, as the ensemble also seem well attuned to the concerto's sense of fun in the opening movement. In the middle Andante, Mr. Whelan's oboe plangently voices an operatic voice, a touch of melancholy present but not overpowering. The finale seems a tad too formal to me, but I suppose it's in keeping with the cultured nature of the rest of Arcangelo's approach.Producer Adrian Peacock and engineer David Hinitt recorded the music at St. Jude-on-the-Hill, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London in February 2012, November 2013, and April 2014. Ultrasmooth sound marks the key feature of this release, complementing the ultrasmooth performances. Not that there isn't a good deal of detail, too, but the smoothness seems paramount. There is also a wide stereo spread, a fairly good dynamic response, and a pleasantly enveloping ambient bloom. It makes for a big, satisfying sound.John J.

"The clarity of the picture and the dynamics of the sound on the Blu-ray edition of 2007's ""The Number 23"" are steps up from the comparatively soft image and sonics of the DVD.  Combine that with at least half an intriguing movie, and you get something you might enjoy watching, at least part of the time.When I first saw ""The Number 23,"" I couldn't help remembering the little 1998 film from Darren Aronofsky called ""Pi.""  That was the offbeat story of an eccentric mathematician who was slowly going mad while hunting for numerical order in the universe in the number for pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, approximately 3.1416 to infinity.  I rather enjoyed the Aronofsky film, and its similarities to ""The Number 23,"" although superficial, are apt.  ""The Number 23,"" you see, is also about a man becoming obsessed by the implications of a mathematical integer.The differences in the movies, though, are more striking.  First, a bigger-name director, Joel Schumacher (""St. Elmo's Fire,"" ""The Lost Boys,"" ""Flatliners,"" ""Falling Down,"" The Client,"" ""Phone Booth,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera"") helmed ""The Number 23.""  Second, two bigger-name actors, Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, star in it.  And, third, the budget for ""The Number 23"" would have financed about 500 movies like ""Pi.""  Yet, for all that, ""The Number 23"" carries its plot through to such an exaggerated conclusion that it ruins everything it builds up so carefully in the beginning.  In that regard, the little indie ""Pi"" is the better film.""The Number 23"" concerns a very ordinary man named Walter Sparrow (Carrey), a dog catcher working in the suburbs for the Animal Control Department.  One day his wife, Agatha (Madsen), buys him a secondhand novel she happens to see in a bookstore, a novel called ""The Number 23"" by Topsy Kretts.  It's all about a fellow named Fingerling who becomes obsessed with the number 23, and the most surprising thing about the book's character is that it seems to reflect the real life of Walter himself.  The more Walter reads, the more convinced he becomes that the book's main character is really him.  Coincidence?Then, the book introduces Walter to the number 23.  Now, before long it seems like everything in his life adds up to 23, and it starts Walter thinking:  His name, his birthday, his driver's license, his social security number, even his address all add up to 23.Even scarier is that in the book, Fingerling is a killer, and it's then that Walter begins to have terrible nightmares.  The number begins to consume his life and warp his mind.  Not his wife, not his teenage son (Logan Lerman), not even a family friend (Danny Huston) can persuade Walter that the business of the number is all in his mind, that it's all just an elaborate sport for paranoid delusionals, or that it's all simply a big, clever game, like the so-called ""Bible Code,"" where you can find whatever you want in it.Nothing stops Walter's phantasms.  He becomes possessed by the number, and he begins to see schemes and conspiracies all around him.  He even takes a hotel room with the number 23; the number is coming to get him.All for the good.  The movie's first half holds up reasonably well, even if it seems repetitious at times.  I especially liked the slow decline of poor Walter into fantasyland, and I liked Schumacher's darker and darker tone as Walter gets nuttier and nuttier.  I felt a small distraction, though, at the beginning where Carrey is exploring the character and looking for the role; I wasn't quite sure if the actor were doing the character for laughs or not.  But Carrey soon enough finds the characterization and gets down to serious business.It's halfway through that the movie falls apart.  By the second half, the story takes an abrupt right turn and suddenly becomes a noir mystery thriller, at which point its gets spacier, spookier, and a whole lot sillier.  The plot becomes more melodramatic and muddled, finally following no logic and making almost no sense whatsoever.When the denouement arrives, it is too contrived, too convenient, and far too unlikely to satisfy one's curiosity.  Worse, the revelation comes much too soon, leaving too long for its concluding explanation, which is an even further let-down.  It's all a decided disappointment, given the decent buildup we've experienced and the payoff we've anticipated.In all, ""The Number 23"" promises more than it delivers.  And, worse, it can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to deliver, either.Video:New Line engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec to preserve the movie's 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio in 1080p high definition.  The image comes off remarkably clean and sharp in most medium and long shots, although a few close-ups are rather soft.  When it's good, it's as crisply delineated and well defined as any picture I've seen in high def, and when it's not, it's no worse than ordinary.  It is still a very dark film, however, and you will notice a slightly dull veiling in any number of dimly lit scenes.Audio:The audio arrives via DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 (and a regular lossy core track for folks who cannot play back the lossless audio), which is quite impressive for the most part.  Sometimes, though, it gets more than rambunctious for its own good.  The music is often too loud relative to the dialogue, and everything comes blasting out at the listener with a huge dynamic range and impact.  The bass is strong, deep, and taut, too, yet can also be so prominent it occasionally becomes distracting.  The surrounds hold out until the second half of the film before they really start coming to life, and then their sounds can be effective.Extras:The Blu-ray disc carries over all of the extras from the DVD, with a few HD flourishes of its own.  To start things off, the disc includes both the unrated, extended version of the movie (101 minutes) and the R-rated theatrical version (98 minutes).  Then, on the theatrical version there are ""Focus Points,"" a series of pop-up video segments that allow the viewer to see options that go beyond the film.  ""Fact Track Trivia"" presents a number of informational pop-ups throughout the theatrical version; and a director's commentary by Joel Schumacher accompanies the theatrical version as well.  Then, there are sixteen deleted scenes, about fourteen minutes' worth, with an alternate opening and ending.  Next, in high def, there is a twenty-five-minute documentary, ""The Number 23 Enigma,"" where a group of mathematicians provide the amazing math behind certain ""mystical"" numbers.  And after that are ""The Making of the Number 23,"" twenty-two minutes; ""How to Do Your Numbers,"" all about numerology; and ""Creating the World of Fingerling,"" eleven minutes on the look of the film, the sets, locations, CGI, etc.If that weren't enough, there are twenty-three scene selections (of course) for both versions of the movie; a widescreen theatrical trailer; a counter for elapsed time; English as the only spoken language; and English captions for the hearing impaired.Parting Shots:""The Number 23"" starts with a promising idea, allows it devolve into chaos, and, finally, grinds it into the trite and mundane.  Certainly, the movie has its good points, Jim Carrey's and Virginia Madsen's performances, for example, and the story's basic premise, and some eerie, David Fincher-style atmospherics.  But ultimately it can only frustrate those viewers who invested so much time in its first half.  What could have been an intriguing psychological drama turns into a mediocre crime thriller.  Oh, well....My thinking is that I'd give the first half of the movie a 7/10 rating and the second half a 3/10, averaging out to the 5/10 rating you see below.  Nevertheless, with the BD's above-par sound and picture, you might just enjoy it for its audiovisual qualities alone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVJ2SACNWC0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CVQAXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XVJ2SACNWC0H","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warner/New Line must think they've hit upon a pretty good idea here:  the Limited Edition Blu-ray gift box.  Apparently, the studio powers that be liked the big box for ""Casablanca"" so much that they decided to give the same treatment to 2004's ""The Notebook.""  I have no objections.  What does concern me, though, is that the studio is not providing a regular Blu-ray edition for those fans who might not want all the bells and whistles of a big set, to say nothing of not wanting to give up the shelf space a big box takes up.  At any rate, the box set is no more expensive than a regular release, so except for its size, this Limited Edition does come with some interesting bonuses.The thing is, ""The Notebook"" seems an odd choice for Blu-ray release in the first place.  It's the kind of romantic weeper that would have made Bette Davis proud and clearly has a female audience in mind.  Yet Blu-ray is still a predominantly male niche market.  How many males will buy a big BD gift set of ""The Notebook"" unless they really, really love the movie or unless they intend to give it to a girlfriend or wife?  I dunno.  I'm sure it would make an ideal Valentine's Day present; it satisfies both the giver and the receiver.The Wife-O-Meter had never seen the film before, but she had read the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks and said it made her cry.  Right there you've got a built-in fan base, particularly among female readers.  However, with a script adapted by Jan Sardi, a screenplay by Jeremy Leven, and direction by Nick Cassavetes, ""The Notebook"" worked for this male viewer as well.  It is definitely, as I say, an unabashed weeper for anyone but those with the most stoney of hearts.Jim Garner plays an older gentleman living in a nursing home, where he reads the film's story aloud to a fellow patient, played by Gena Rowlands.  Her character is suffering from dementia, an impairment of her mental capacities leaving her with a loss of memory.  Her doctor says her condition is irreversible, but Garner's character doesn't buy it.  He feels he can jog her mind if he reads to her each day.The story he reads concerns a pair of young people, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams), who in 1940, while in their late teens, fall madly in love.  But love ain't easy, as all of us who have experienced it can testify.  She is from a rich Southern family; he works in a lumber yard and lives with his widowed father (Sam Shepard).  It's a typical Romeo and Juliet tale, with Allie's mother (Joan Allen) especially against the young couple's plans to run off together.  Can anything stop true love?  The mother, behaving like the Wicked Witch of the West, certainly does her best to shut things down.After pressure from Allie's parents, Noah and Allie's summer fling ends, and the two young people reluctantly go their separate ways.  Seven years pass, and Allie has fallen in love again, this time with Lon Hammond, Jr., ""handsome, smart, sophisticated, and charming""; the fact that he is also ""fabulously wealthy"" impresses Allie's mother no end, and Allie and Lon become engaged.  Meanwhile, Noah has bought a crumbling old plantation mansion, the scene of his first tryst with Allie, with the intent to renovate it.  Somehow, he feels that if he restores the old house, Allie will come back to him.We get two sets of narratives in the movie:  the flashback to the youngsters and their romance and the account of the oldsters and their relationship to one another.  Both sets of events are poignant, but it is the actions of the older people that eventually win over our hearts and minds.The movie makes its intentions clear from the outset.  It wants you to go with its emotional romanticism, starting with Aaron Zigman's soft, warmhearted musical score and cinematographer Robert Fraisse's lushly atmospheric photography.  To the cynic it will all seem mushy.  If you go with it, which I admit I resisted for a while, it will hook you.Yes, the characters are stereotypes, and the story is predictable in most ways.  Yet, it's the movie's saving grace that the characters always remain real, fleshed-out human beings.  Even the seemingly one-sided mother and the fiance turn out to be more dimensional than they first appear.  More important, there's a genuine chemistry between Gosling and McAdams, and Garner and Rowlands have never been better.Straight-out romance movies are rare these days.  In the past decade or so, Hollywood has given us precious few, with ones like ""The Painted Veil,"" ""Atonement,"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" among my own personal favorites.  Add ""The Notebook.""I have the feeling that movie critics who didn't like ""The Notebook"" are ones who saw the story as simply manipulative and overly sentimental.  But that's what romance is about.  Love does manipulate people, and love is damned sentimental.  What's more, love is the best thing people have going for them.  We need more ""Notebooks.""Video:I'd say this is one of the more beautiful live-action Blu-ray transfers I've seen, ever.  Using a dual-layer BD50, a VC-1 encode, and, of course, 1080p resolution, the Warner Bros./New Line video engineers capture probably everything that was on the original 2.40:1-ratio print with a startling clarity and vividness.  Colors are nothing short of gorgeous, deep and rich, with strong black levels to set them off.  Facial tones, which are usually hard to capture realistically, are also quite good, even if facial detailing seems a bit smoothed over.Audio:The disc provides Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio choices in English, with Dolby Digital unaccountably the default.  If you can decode the higher audio codec, remember to change it at start-up.  In either format you'll find a good sense of surround, beginning with the carnival sequence where the crowd noises literally come from all directions.  A brief war scene stands out in this regard as well.  Mainly, though, the sound reproduces dialogue naturally and effortlessly, the lossless TrueHD having an advantage over the regular Dolby Digital in being slightly clearer and smoother.Extras:The Blu-ray disc contains a number of extras beyond the feature film.  Primary among them are two audio commentaries, the first by director Nick Cassavetes and the second by novelist Nicholas Sparks.  Each of them is illuminating, and I recommend them both in their different ways.  Next up are four promotional featurettes.  These include ""All in the Family:  Nick Cassavetes,"" eleven minutes on the director; ""Nicholas Sparks:  A Simple Story, Well Told,"" six minutes on the author and the impact of his book; ""Southern Exposure:  Locating The Notebook,"" eleven minutes on the setting, mostly Charleston, South Carolina; and ""Casting Rachel and Ryan,"" four minutes on the film's co-stars.  Then, we have a Rachel McAdams screen test, three minutes, and twelve deleted scenes with optional director commentary totaling over twenty-eight minutes.The disc's extras conclude with twenty scene selections but no bookmarks; a theatrical trailer; English, German, and Russian spoken languages; Spanish, German, and Russian subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.In addition to the bonus materials on the disc, there are several more extras in the package.  First of all is the container itself.  It opens from the top like an old-fashioned box of stationary.  Then, inside you'll find a forty-six page photo album and scrapbook with pictures from the movie and space for one's own photos and remarks.  The disc fits into a plastic Digipak fastener on the inside back cover.  After that is an envelope full of scrapbook accessories:  stickers, photo corners, and bookmarks.  Finally, there's a ""Notebook"" stationery set with sixteen themed note cards and envelopes.Parting Thoughts:I hadn't read the book nor seen the movie before watching ""The Notebook"" for the first time on Blu-ray.  But I prepared myself for a tearjerker; what I didn't prepare for was an outright gusher.  When an older Allie looks out at a river and says ""I've never seen anything so beautiful,"" Noah responds, looking directly at her, ""Neither have I.""  From that point on, I had to pause the movie every few minutes to wipe my eyes.  And who'da thunk that Jimmy Durante could add such sentiment to the tale.  It's a lovely film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTFO2EHDMI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B1X80Y#wasThisHelpful","R1GTFO2EHDMI4","AGLHCU1KX96DZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGLHCU1KX96DZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We needed another computer here at home, so I was happy to be offered the HP 20-e010 19.45-Inch All-in-One Desktop to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  I own several HP products, and Ive found them to be of good quality and to perform well.  This computer is for my wife, who typically uses a computer to read email, surf the internet, and move/store pictures, so she doesnt need a high (or even middle) end powered machine.  An economically priced all-in-one seemed to be just the thing for her.  It has the convenience and overall small footprint of a laptop and the larger screen of a desktop.  So, how did we like it?  Read on  .For starters, HP advertises this as practically priced and feature rich.  On the surface, at least, this is very true.  It comes with a nicely-sized 19.45 inch screen, a discrete video card with 2 GB (which means that it does much/most of the  graphics work, vice the CPU, which lessens the load on the CPU), a DVD player (which many if most laptops, no longer include), and a 500 GB hard drive.  Additionally, it has built-in speakers that are of decent quality and sound much better than most laptop speakers, a webcam, a digital media card reader, 4 GB of RAM, and a dual-core AMD CPU.  And with a MSRP of less than 350 dollars at the time of this review, it is very practically priced.  However in this case, Im sad to say, overall package is less than the sum of the parts, not greater.When I was setting the computer up for the first time (which was easy to do, including internet and printer connections), I found that it took a long time.  Ive set up many computers over the past few years, and this one was the slowest by far.  I didnt think much of it, as you only have to do this once.  However, when my kids and wife started using the All-In-One, they all complained that it was slow, from start-up to web surfing and just about everything in between.  So I took a look under the hood so to speak.  Using Windows installed task manager, I discovered that the CPU was almost always running at 99 percent unless it's idle, which is to say it was maxxed-out and not a good thing.  In an effort to free up a little more resources, I checked what was running at start-up, to see if there was a lot of bloatware slowing things down.  Only four programs were set to automatically run when the computer started: Microsoft Onedrive (which I disabled as I dont want any Cloud-based storage), and programs for audio and video control panels, which I also disabled for the purpose of the testing.  While I think the computer boots up marginally faster now, the CPU still runs pretty much maxed-out when browsing the web or doing anything the least bit strenuous.  Email was about the only thing that ran fairly well.So I took a look on-line, and this units CPU, the E1-6010 1.35 GHz and its graphic card, the Radeon R2, were both near the very bottom of list for CPU and graphics power.  While checking out the systems performance, I could see that the CPU (and probably graphics card) were the bottleneck driving the slow performance.  The 4 GB of memory wasnt maxed out (although it could have been the problem if the CPU were more powerful), and while the disk drive would occasionally hit 99 percent utilized, it wasnt the problem either.  So basically the CPU and graphics card are already obsolescent, if not outright obsolete before you even buy them.While I like what HP tried to accomplish here, unfortunately they tried to pack too many features into this machine for a low price, which forced them to use cheaper components, and to not include other features altogether.  In addition to the CPU/graphic card problem, there is no provision for blue-tooth connectivity or touchscreen (which wasnt a problem for me, but could be for you), the 4 GB of RAM is pretty much the minimum youd want for Windows 10 and a display resolution of 1600x900 dpi to run smoothly.  And while the monitors picture looks pretty good, its not HD, another example of HPs cost optimization decisions.Overall, HP has built, priced, and marketed this as a budget-priced, entry-level machine, and I understand that.  But while you get a lot for your money here, it has performance issues that cannot be overlooked, unless you only want to use it to read email and play DVDs.  Two stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LVBCE3A817FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVLW3M#wasThisHelpful","R3LVBCE3A817FJ","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My youngest son (a 6 year old) is a big fan of Iron Man and of the Avengers. So, we ordered this toy, the Playskool Heroes Marvel Super Hero Adventures Ultimate Super Hero Set for him to try. While he typically goes for the complex power ranger figures, he also likes playing with simpler toys, particularly if they have a good unifying theme. The set comes with 8 Avengers and two bad guys (Ultron figurines), that have simple articulation (i.e., they stand and you can position their arms), and look close enough to the comic book and movie equivalents for him to identify with them.

"Over the years, Ive sampled a lot of pre-prepared food.  As a boy, wed go camping and eat freeze-dried camping food.  When I first joined the military, we were occasionally fed the canned Meal, Combat, Individual ration, which basically were same as the C rations and K rations developed after World War II. In the mid 80s the MCIs gave way to the ubiquitous Meal, Ready to Eat (MREs), which were initially had dehydrated meals, vice todays MREs, which are called wet rations, where you dont have to add water.  And if any of you reading this were in the military back in the 1980s, you likely remember the joys of trying to reconstitute Salisbury steaks so that they were less like cardboard and more like meat.  Even now, I occasionally like to buy a case of MREs to keep in the house as emergency food, eating them after a couple of years and buying another case to replace them.So, although the purpose of this product, the Mountain House Just-In Case 4 Day Emergency Food Supply and MREs are not very similar, I thought it would make for an interesting review to compare one type with the other.  Note, that for the purposes of this review, Im talking about standard issue MREs, not one of the many official variants for special forces, aircrew, religious people with dietary restrictions, and so on.  While many people buy MREs from on-line auction sites, Im retired military and buy mine from my local military commissary, which sells them as single MREs or in a 12-pack case.  So sit down, and get comfortable, because I have a feeling this is going to be a long review, even for me.  :-)Whats included:  With the Mountain House (MH) product, you get a 12 entres (well, 2 each of 6 different entres), each contained in a pouch.  Each pouch contains 2 to 2  servings.  With MREs, you get a main course (entre), a side dish, bread or cracker, a dessert, condiments (seasonings, a moist towelette, toilet paper, a long spoon, powdered beverage, a matchbook, and so on) and a flameless ration heater for one person.  If you buy a case, you get 12 meals, which also consist of 2 each of 6 different meals.Cost:  Based on the current suggested retail price on Amazon for the MH and the sale price in the Commissary for MREs, they are with 50 cents per meal of each other.  And I suspect you can find both a little cheaper, if you look around, than full price.Convenience:  You tear open the MH, add 1 to 1  cups of boiling water, stir, close the pouch for 4 minutes, stir again, wait another 9 minutes, and then eat.  Its very easy, except in a true survival situation, where you might not be able to come up with hot water (Ill assume you can get clean water, or meals wouldnt be your highest priority).  Ive eaten 3 of the entres, but I didnt try any of them with cold water.  I suspect that this might be a problem for some of the entrees, such as the Lasagna which has cheese that should ideally melt a little.  With the MRE, most of the items can be torn open from their pouch and eaten immediately. For those entres that need to be heated you have the flameless ration heater, which is a plastic bag that has a chemical heating element.  Add the entre and a little water into the bag, and in 8 minutes or so, you have a very hot entre.Weight:  The MH, by virtue of being both freeze dried and only providing an entre (vice all the other stuff in the MRE) weighs about 4  ounces per meal.  Note that this is perhaps understated if you also need to carry the water you need to reconstitute the meal.  The MRE, by contrast, weighs between 18 to 26 ounces, depending on the meal, and can be quite heavy if you pack enough of them.  Until the advent of specialized MRE packs, a lot of troops would go into their MRE pouches and discard what they didnt want in order to cut back on their weight if they had to travel any distance by foot.Caloric values:  The 12 included MH entres total 6400 calories.  If you take MHs servings claim of having 28 servings at face value, each serving would only give you 228 calories.  So if you had a single serving at breakfast, lunch, and supper, youd only be getting 685 calories per day.  However, MH correctly shows this as a 4 day supply for one person, so youre eating the whole entre, not just a portion of it.  That averages out to 533 calories per meal, or a more reasonable 1600 calories per day.  Each MRE, though, is supposed to give you around 1200 calories, as the intent is to keep a very active soldier fed.  The MREs are also better balanced with regards to overall nutrition, as that is their mission.Product Life expectancy:  The MH pouches are good for 15 years which is stamped right on the pouch, another testament to a benefit of freeze dried food versus wet rations.  MREs are initially good for 3 years, are tested at that point, and are *supposed* to be gotten rid of after 5 years, regardless of testing.  But a lot of their shelf life is dependent on the conditions theyve been stored under.  Hot weather will make them go bad faster, while cool weather can prolong their life span.  Ive personally eaten MREs that were 7 or 8 years old that I kept in my basement, and they were fine.  But that points out another reason why I buy my MREs from the commissary even though they may be more expensive  that way I can look at the packed date and inspected date myself.  Ive heard stories on how some of the MREs sold from the on-line sites are either time expired or sellers mislead you about actual packed date.  Caveat emperor.And finally, what youre really been waiting for, Taste:  Maybe Im just jaded, but the MH was much tastier than the MREs.  (I had to add a bit of salt to one of the MH meals, but its better that they are under-salted to my taste rather than over-salted.)  You get more of a selection with the MREs.  If you include the companion MH 3 day supply, you have 12 different food varieties to eat from MH, but with MREs you get 24 choices.  However, while very filling, MREs taste like something somebody concocted first to give you enough calories, second a balanced nutrition, and with taste coming in around 9th or 10th.  I've eaten three of the MH entres so far.  All reconstituted very well.  The meat even tasted like real meat, not like some of the meats in the early versions of MREs that I mentioned above.  And they tasted a lot better than the stuff we used to take camping years ago.One TMI side note: While on active duty, whenever I ate MREs for more than a day or two, Id get constipated.  A lot of my buddies said the same.  I dont know if we werent hydrating enough, not getting enough fiber, or what, but what was going in wasnt coming out.  :-)Anyway, I felt that this product, the Mountain House Just-In Case 4 Day Emergency Food Supply is an excellent choice for a back-up food supply should the need arise, or for camping and other outdoor activities.  Its very tasty, packs well, is lightweight, and is easy to reconstitute.  My only potential nit is that they seem a little pricey for what you get, but I have no real way to tell what they should cost.  But color me a happy camper, so to speak.

"In New Zealand author Ben Sanders first novel published in America, former New York Police Department officer Marshall Grade, now living near Santa Fe and wanting to atone for past sins, decides to find a girl who has recently disappeared.  In doing so, he sets himself against two different criminal organizations, one from his present and one from his past.  Below are my thoughts on this novel, and note that I dont give spoilers.This is Sanders fourth published novel, but as noted above, the first one published in the US.  This is one of the best plotted novels Ive read in months, with some really effective twists that I didnt see coming at all.  Each chapter is told from the point of view of one of books characters, and this technique works well here.  The writing is solid and the characters are interesting.While I have no proof, Im pretty sure this book will be the first of a series featuring Marshall.  While the book is complete in-and-of itself, there are plot lines that could be further explored in a future novel.  Plus, the author leaves some small mysteries about Marshall, showing some quirkiness that almost borders on OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) that didnt play into the plot.  (I was expecting this quirkiness to come back and hurt him, as it almost amounts to an inadvertent calling card.  But, I suspect it still may, perhaps in future books.)Overall, while I think the author is still learning and refining his craft, hes well on the way to becoming an outstanding writer.  One (very) minor nit I had with the book is that I dont think he fleshed out the backstory and motivation of one of the major bad guys enough, so that I was a little unsatisfied at the end of the book, although you never know, he could come back in a future book.  But I greatly enjoyed the book and am hoping for future novels featuring Marshall.

"Every Halloween I buy bags of candy to give out.  Some of the candies that I buy are the ones I used to like when I was a kid  Hershey Bars, Kit Kats, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, and so on (although not Almond Joys, as Im not a huge coconut fan).  And every year, the young trick-or-treaters largely ignore what I liked and go for things like Nerds, Sour Patch, Wonka Laffy Taffy, and so on.  Such are generational differences.But I was happy to be offered this 3 pound box of Hershey's Assortment Candy to review (and scarf down) as part of the Amazon Vine program.  It offers 20+ pieces of each the aforementioned Hershey Bars, Kit Kats, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, and Almond Joys.  The bars are snack-sized bars, and come in a solid cardboard box that opens from the middle-downward so that it displays candy so that people can grab what they want.  I dont think this box is really intended for home use, its more the kind of thing youd see in a break room or lobby for people with a sweet tooth.I love these brands (except the Almond Joys, which Ill only usually eat in a pinch).  The box is handy and convenient.  My only nit is that I believe you can get the same amount of candy a little bit cheaper when bought individually in bags as compared to this mix of candy in this box.But overall, the candy is tasty and the price is reasonable, particularly if you want the cardboard box to hold the candy and let your friends grab a piece or two.

"If youre looking for a practice book for the ACT, this is a good, inexpensive choice.  It contains 556 practice questions in the book and a 6 month free subscription to access another 1000+ questions and 20 quizzes online.  (Yes, the title of the book looks a little misleading unless you read the cover fully, because youre only getting the 550+ questions if you dont register on-line.)  However, registering also allows you access to those quizzes as well as on-line analysis of your weaknesses based on your answers to the online questions/quizzes.Its not perfect; for example, it doesnt really discuss any test taking tips or strategies.

"The Murdstone Trilogy by the late author Mal Peet is, by and large, a very successful satiric merger of several genres  High Fantasy, the authors who write it, and the publishing industry. The story centers around a quirky author, Phillip Murdstone, who had a hugely successful young adult (YA) book early in his writing career, but whose books have been selling fewer and fewer copies ever since, until his agent directs him to write a sword and sorcery fantasy novel, as they sell and his books quite frankly arent. The story flows from there.Mr Peet crafts a darkly humorous, satiric, almost sadistic story, which caught me in its spell. For the most part, that is. The first 70 percent of the book was just about everything you could hope for, with twists, turns, and several delightfully improbable situations building on one-another. However, it almost seems as if somebody else wrote the last 30 percent of the book  it seems rushed, loses much of the sly humor of the early part of the book, and in my opinion, ends poorly.Overall, the good outweighs the not-quite good, and given its interesting premise, is worth your time. If I could, Id give it 3  stars, but Ill round it up to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EY9CRU2325QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763681849#wasThisHelpful","R2EY9CRU2325QA","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Vanishing Games"" is author Roger Hobbs second novel and second novel starring ""ghostman""Jack White.  (A ghostman, in the parlance of the book, is someone who fixes things, although this fixing can take many forms.)  The story revolves around what Alfred Hitchcock used to call a MacGuffin, something that all of the characters in this story are chasing after.  Jacks friend and mentor, Angela, becomes deeply involved and calls in Jack to try to help her.The book is set in an exotic locale, Macau, and shows both its glitter and seedy underside.  The author is a very gifted writer, and the book's plot flows smoothly, with compelling twists and turns.  The characters, both major and minor, are interesting.I have also read his first book Ghostman, which was quite good, but I enjoyed this one even more.  My main criticism of the first book is that it seemed nothing bothered Jack, no matter how dangerous the situation, and that took away from some of the tension.  This book is much better in that regard  while Jack doesnt quiver in fear, you do get the sense that he realizes whats at stake when he is forced into tight spot.While Hobbs is still honing his craft, hes already better than most authors out there for this type of novel, and I predict he will continue to improve.  Id give him 4  stars if I could, but Ill round it up to five stars for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JPP1B7EK07D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352646#wasThisHelpful","R22JPP1B7EK07D","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The overall cut wasnt bad, but they didnt quite fit her right for her size, but this is probably a function of her not having any other Lee products so as to get to know their cut, and thereby knowing which size would fit her best.

"My old Bose noise cancelling headphones bit the dust a few years ago, and while they worked well on trips, I dont travel as much anymore, and didnt have a real need to replace them.  Fast forward to now, when I have a fourth grader taking trumpet lessons and aspiring singers/dancers in second grade and kindergarten who sing and dance along to loudly playing background music at home, and I find an occasional need for something to help cut down on the volume.  So, I was happy to be given the opportunity to review these headphones, the Philips NC1/27 Fidelio Noise Cancelling Headphones as part of the Amazon Vine program.  Below are my thoughts.These headphones come with a semi-hard carrying case, a USB cord that you plug into your computer, phone, or other device to recharge the headphones, and some converter plugs (including, amazingly ones you can use on airline seat ports).  I typically buy over-ear headphones vice on-ear headphones, as I think that I get better sound isolation from the over-ear phones.  However, these give as good sound isolation as my over-ear headphones.  Im not a true audiophile, but to my ears, these headphones give a great sound  crystal clear and no hiss or buzz across the entire dynamic range.There is a button/switch on the headphone that you press to turn on the noise cancelling feature.  Ill be honest in that I wasnt able to hear much difference with this feature turned on or off.  However, the headphones sound isolation with the feature turned off was extremely good  it may be a matter of it not being noisy enough for me to actually need the sound cancelling.  Either way, Im happy with how well these headphones reduce the ambient noise around me.They also are very comfortable (both when you put them on and after a couple of hours of wear), are reasonably lightweight, and fold for easier storage.  The only (slight) drawback that Ive noted is that the cords are somewhat short, so you need to be close to your device when wearing them.  Its not necessarily a problem with a phone or .mp3 player, but could be a bit more of a problem if you plug them into a laptop.Overall, these are very good noise-cancelling headphones for the price.  As noted in the title of this review, I can certainly enjoy listening to my son practicing the trumpet much more than I used to.  :-)  Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q70O3M6UFMT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V4X6R2C#wasThisHelpful","R3Q70O3M6UFMT9","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a boy, I learned to play ping-pong and by the time I left for college, I had gotten very good.  I really havent played much over the years since then, but when I was offered the opportunity to review this product, the JOOLA Studio Compact Portable Table Tennis Table with Handle Carrying System through the Amazon Vine program, I realized that I could get it to teach my own children how to play.  Below are my pros and cons for this table tennis table.Pros:- The quality of the wooden portion of the table is very good.  Its made of medium density fiberboard (MDF), which isnt a bad choice, as it allows for a very smooth surface.- As advertised, it does fold neatly up and is portable, although at 40 pounds its not *that* portable.  A downside to MDF is that its heavier than, say, plywood.- A net is included as well as a storage bag for the table.Cons:- The metal parts of the table are a bit flimsy.  When pulling the folding legs straight, my son popped the screws out in the bracket that attaches the leg to one of the tables.  Another downside of MDF is that when the fibers are messed up, such as when a screw is pulled from its hole, it may not re-seat  well.  Luckily, I was able to screw the leg bracket back into place.  However, three other small screws fell to the floor when I flipped the table onto its legs.  I couldnt find where those screws may have come from, but they had wood fibers on them, so I have to assume they werent included as spares.- The net is held up by two small metal rods that seat into aluminum posts on the edge of the table.  On mine, the net was saggy.  I very carefully bent the aluminum back a little to take up some of the slack, but Im afraid to do more for fear of damaging the posts.Neither a pro or a con:- The company clearly states that this is a compact table, and gives its dimensions.  My advice to you is to take a measuring tape and mark out those dimensions on a table, so you get an idea of what those dimensions really mean, and see if you can live with them.  If not, JOOLA makes larger (and regulation) sized tables.  I found that the table was too compact for me to really be able to play on, although my kids seemed to enjoy it, not having anything else to compare it to.- Be aware that it doesnt come with balls or a paddles. But as the manufacturer doesnt claim that it does, its not a problem, just something to know up front.  Balls and starter paddles can be bought pretty cheaply.Overall, unless you are really space constrained, youd be better off buying a larger table to play on.  You *can* play on it, but if youve played much in the past, you probably wont enjoy it.  This isnt a knock on the product, as again, they clearly state the dimensions, but thats my opinion.  I am a little more concerned about how the legs attach to the table.  My 10 year old son wasnt pulling that hard when he managed to pop the leg bracket off from the table, but on the other hand, the screws could have just worked their way loose during shipping.  Anyway, I rate this product as being OK, which equates to 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M7ZT064CTE76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5TNWR6#wasThisHelpful","R3M7ZT064CTE76","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pivotal Living Tracker 1 (2nd Generation) is a comparatively inexpensive, activity tracker that gives you most of the functionality of activity monitors that cost a lot more.  Although you theoretically can use this tracker as a stand-alone item, in order to get more than just very basic information, youll need to download an app to your iPhone or Android-based devices.  (It wasnt too hard to download and set up the app, but I had a few hiccups that I was able to work my way through.)From the product description, it uses sensor technology to track daily activities, such as steps walked, daily activity, calories burned, and the amount (and quality) of sleep.  It also allows you to set goals for your activities via the app, as well as some ""bells and whistles"".  The strap that houses the tracker is unisex and comes in one size and one color, so you get can get it however you want it, provided you want it in a one-size fits all black band.  It actually doesnt look bad, and fit me pretty comfortably, but if you are petite with small wrists you may want to try it on for size.About the only mild complaint I have is that it didnt seem extremely accurate.  On the other hand, the Pivotal Living app uses activity sensor data from a Members smartphone to reconcile the data returned from Pivotal Tracker 1, and overlays this information every 20 minutes to corroborate basic health data for a higher degree of accuracy.  But as I often leave my cell phone turned off while at home and don't take it with me when I'm out exercising, that could be part of the problem.The company has an interesting business model.  When you buy the product, you get to use their app for 12 months.  If you like it, you pay $12 for another years usage, plus you get a new band.  So, the price up-front is cheap, and you pay as you go thereafter.  While its a risk for the company, I think its a good idea and will be interested to see how it plays out in the future.Overall, this is a decent, inexpensive fitness tracker.

"I actually ordered this planner for my young daughter, who is in second grade. She is very organized, and likes to write things down  not only her schedule (amazing full when compared to the comparative social desert that was the norm for the children of my era), but also her thoughts, hopes, and ideas.So, we were pleased with this product, the AT-A-GLANCE Weekly / Monthly Planner, Garden Party Design, Academic Year, 12 Months, July 2015-June 2016.  The planner is 8  by 11 inch size (double that when opened), which basically gives you a monthly calendar with space each day to place any meetings, a little room to the side of the calendar for notes, and best of all, on the following pages, you have a 7 line, 8  inch section for each day in the month to write more detailed information.  So, there, plenty of room to let an imaginative 8 year old not only keep a schedule but document her life.  And my daughter loved the Garden Party design of the cover, but my wife, no so much.  :-)Overall, a very nice planner, and not just for kids.

"I have a six year old son who is prone to be afraid of many things  heights, going fast, bees (Im with you there, big guy), the dark, and so on.  I thought Id give this toy, the Worry Eaters ""Saggo"" a try to help him calm his fears even though hes not into dolls. (Power Rangers action figures, yes; cloth dolls no.)  As can be seen by the pictures of the product, Saggo is a very colorful (well, colorful if your colors are white and orange), soft cloth doll with a zippered mouth.  You write your worries onto a piece of paper, put it in Saggos mouth, and close the zipper, letting Saggo eat your worries.When I gave it to my little boy and explained what it was for, he immediately was captivated by the idea, and went off to get a piece of paper and pencil.  After he had written down something and zippered it shut in Saggos mouth, I asked him what he had written down.  He answered Monsters.  Well, at least Saggo is a monster he can deal with.Overall, Im not sure how much its helping him with his fears, but he does like to sleep with Saggo and hasnt put him away or out of sight, so Ill consider that a win for this toy.  I like it, and if you have a boy or girl with worries or fears, I believe this product is worth a try.  Four stars.

"One of the things I like about books by Robert Forczyk is that he either finds new things to write about, or new things to say about things that have already been written.  This Osprey Campaign book, The Caucasus 1942  43 is no exception.  The book follows the typical Osprey Campaign format - typically about 96 pages long, consisting of analysis of the campaign, commanders, forces and styles of warfare, pictures, illustrations, and maps.What makes this book different/special is that this campaign was part of Case Blue, but even though the drive to the oilfields in the Caucasus was the main point of the operation virtually all of the literature in English focuses on the secondary objective  to destroy the Soviet forces between Voronezh and Stalingrad  mainly because of the German disaster at Stalingrad.  Any discussion of the efforts to take the oilfields is typically summarized and brief.  This book is fairly unique in describing the huge struggles in the Caucasus in great detail.As typical of books by this author, he is able to pack a lot of detail into a limited page count, and still make it interesting.  He does a tremendous job of covering the fighting from all possible angles, from conventional to unconventional warfare, showing where the combatants did well and where they didn't.  The included maps, photos, and illustrations are better than average for this series, and are excellent.  Although very well read on the Eastern Front, I learned a lot of new things in this book, the most surprising of which was that the Germans were both qualitatively AND quantitatively superior during the campaign, and the important role that lend-lease aid played here.  I was also surprised at how poorly the German leaders (primarily Field Marshall List) directed the operations, and that with better ... even average ... leadership, the Germans could have accomplished more.  It is very doubtful that they could have accomplished all of their goals, due to the  logistical nightmare that they were operating under, but the oilfields at Grozny could have easily been captured.Overall  an outstanding book, particularly given the dearth of other in-depth material in English.  On a side note, this book is detailed and complete on its own, but I can only hope/dream that Mr Forczyk will do a full-length book on this operation as he did after his Osprey Campaign book on the fighting in Sevastopol in 1942.

"This tool-less, top-shelf TV mount is one of those products that make me go wow! and wonder why nobody has thought of it before. It literally installs to the top of your TV in seconds, and gives you six inches or so to place a TV remote, game controller, small speaker (I dont know about you by my LCD speakers are terrible), or such. (And you can get this in larger sizes if you need more storage room.)You install it by hooking the front of the shelf to the top of your TV, adjusting the supporting arm, and then twisting a small lever to lock the arm in place. It literally took me less time to install it than it did to type this sentence. They also include a small mesh pad to put on top of the shelf to keep a speaker from rattling on the metal stand should you put one there.About the only drawback, and its just a minor point and not a problem, is if your TV has its speakers on the top rather than the sides or bottom. If you do, this will sit over them on the side you install this shelf. It wouldn't totally block the speaker, but it could divert the sound a little.But I really love this gadget. Its easy to install, sturdy, and gives you a place to put things that would otherwise be clutter around your TV. I give this product my highest recommendation.

"I originally ordered this necklace (through the Amazon Vine program) for my wife. I liked the simple, yet somewhat elegant look of the heart-shaped pendant jazzed up by the Amethyst, as shown in the picture of the product. My wife has a large neck (dont read this honey! :-) ) so the advertised 18 inch length with a 2 inch extender was also a big plus, to my eyes. So now that we have it, here are my impressions.It is attractive, and the Amethyst looks better than I thought it would, but the pendants are smaller than I expected. Its actually looks a little better on my 8 year old girl than my wife because of the smallish size (although it's not ""kiddie"" jewelry). Without the 2 inch extender, it would have ridden too high on my wifes neck, so the extender was indeed a nice touch for this jewelry. The two chains are on the thin side and get tangled if youre not careful. They do not adjust individually. But the chains and pendants ride well together for my two ladies.Overall, this is a nice necklace for the suggested price, but it could be a little bigger. Im going to go along with the majority if other reviewers here, and give this a solid four star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8CB9W0WF3PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFRSZA6#wasThisHelpful","R2B8CB9W0WF3PC","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me at least, Samsung is not one of the names that come to mind when I think of vacuum cleaners.  TVs, yes.  Cell phones, yes.  But vacuum cleaners, thats a new one.  But, as my wife wanted a lighter vacuum cleaner to replace a failing one on our upstairs floor, and the Amazon Vine program just happened to offer me a this product to review, the stars lined up and here we are.  Below are my pros and cons about this upright cleaner.Pros:- It is lightweight for its size, coming in at just over 13 pounds.- Very strong suction.  And I mean very strong.  It does an excellent job cleaning big carpets.  At full power, it pulls up lighter weigh rugs, like throw rugs, right off of the floor (my wife said it felt like the vacuum was sticking to the rug like a magnet to metal).  But you can adjust the cleaning strength to suit the carpet you're cleaning.- It was very easy to snap together/assemble.- As seems to be the norm nowadays, its bagless.  While bagless vacuums are by nature more messy to empty and you have to clean the filters, I like not having to keep buying bags and filters.- The cord is pleasingly long.Cons:- The cord doesnt self-retract.  I only consider this a very minor con, because if you want a light-weight vacuum, you have to eliminate things like a self-retractor to keep the weight down.  It also doesnt self-propel itself, which again, was a way to save weight.- The cleaning head swivels.  While this can also be considered a plus from a cleaning perspective, it feels a little too loose for my tastes when I vacuum.- The optional hand tool doesnt have a place to hang on the cleaner, you have to store it elsewhere.Neither a pro nor a con:- It has a dust sensor on the cleaning head area  vacuum until the sensor turns from red to green and the rug is clean.  I cant tell how well this works  it seems kind of gimmicky to me, but I could be wrong.- When I went to dump the dust container, it was packed down and I had to poke around inside to get to all come out.  (I also had a small piece of plastic wrap get stuck inside, which also required me to take things apart.)  I dont list this as a con, though, as I think this is a byproduct of the strong suction and because tight compaction means youd have to empty it less often.Overall, I consider this Samsung a little quirky, but its an above-average vacuum cleaner.  It is lightweight and does a good job, albeit at the trade-off cost of a few features that heavier vacuums have.

"I have three children, and I'm making a set of the common coins for each of my children, so I own a few dozen different sets/volumes of Whitman Coin Folders.  What I do is collect my pocket change and buy rolls of coins from the bank to find coins to put into the folders, and when I find a coin of better quality in my change/rolls, I replace the poorer quality coin with the better one.  And whatever I have left, I roll up and sell back to the bank.  Whitman coin folders are my favorite brand of folders for holding my coins, and most of the are very good for the price you pay and for what you get.  Sadly, these folders don't quite measure up.  I have three problems with them.First, the coin slots are generally too tight, so that you have to force the coins into slots in the folder.  In some cases, you almost have to deform the slot to get the coin in.Second, the ""backing"" between the coin slot and the back of the folder is thin ... so thin that when I pop a coin out to replace it with a new one, I occasionally tear the backing.  Exacerbating the problem is that the coins are wedged in too tightly so I have to push harder, but the thin material is most of the problem, and is not the same quality as in other Whitman folders I've purchased.And third, the other folders give you two coin slots per year, one for the Philadelphia Mint and the other for the Denver Mint.  (Virtually all common coins are made at both mints.)  These only have one slot per coin.  This means that you have to buy a second folder for each volume if you want to store the coins from both mints.  Other Whitman folders of similar size/style do not force you to do this.  This folder very generously spaces out the spots for the coins and has four ""blank"" spots in the end of the folder which has no real purpose ... it could very easily be re-organized so you could have two spots per coin like in the other Whitman Folders.Overall, I'm very disappointed in these folders for Presidential Coins, especially when comparing them to all of the other excellent Whitman folders for other coins.  I won't stop buying them, but I'm not happy about the general poor quality and the need to buy two folders per volume instead of only one for this set.

"As I get older (and older!), my typical activity level has gone from running/playing softball to biking and trying to keep up with my kids. One thing that hasnt changed, though, is my appreciation for a good pair of sunglasses that are comfortable, fit well, and stay-in-place during activities. How do these sunglasses, the .Under Armour Men's Core 2.0 8600082-000930 Sunglasses, measure up? Read onPros:- Are adjustable to allow a custom fit  mostly (see my cons below). They stay on my face very well when Im sweating and being active.- Do a great job of glare reduction (per the manufacturers specifications, they block 100 percent of UVA, UVB & UVC rays)- Have good, low distortion peripheral vision from the wraparound lenses- Are lightweight yet toughCons:- You need to try these on in the store (or *really* know your sunglasses size); I have a round-shaped face, and while otherwise very comfortable, they were tight across my temples.- They dont fold flat so you cant store them in a more standard sunglasses case. They do come with a soft bag you can carry/store them in, though. This honestly is not a major flaw, but with a bunch of active children, Id personally feel a little better with a more protective case.Overall, these are good shades, provided you try them on before you buy them to ensure they fit your face. They arent cheap, but theyre worth what youd pay for them. 3  stars, rounded up to four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MNYBDOWN4Y3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM2LSQ8#wasThisHelpful","R3MNYBDOWN4Y3F","A19JDXB5R33C7R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19JDXB5R33C7R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Legend: A Harrowing Story from the Vietnam War of One Green Beret's Heroic Mission to Rescue a Special Forces Team Caught Behind Enemy Lines, by Eric Blehm, is a nice surprise  a tense, taut story about an American Hero, Green Beret Staff Sergeant Roy Benavidez that reads like fiction but is very, very true.The book covers Staff Sergeant Benavidezs life but also covers the supporting characters as they all zero in-on May 2, 1968, when a Special Forces team gets inserted into Cambodia and things rapidly go from bad to worse.  If youre not aware of SSgt Benevidezs story or the outcome of this mission (like I wasnt), there are a lot of twists and turns to the narrative that keep you hooked until the end.The author does a fine job of balancing technical jargon, mission and personal details, and gripping writing to enthrall anyone with a desire to read about the Vietnam War, heroism in the face of mortal danger, or how a person preservers though the hard times in life.

"Isn't That Rich?: Life Among the 1 Percent, by entrepreneur Richard Kirshenbaum, is a collection of his monthly columns for the New York Observer, along with a few new essays for this book. As the title suggests, the author writes about the ultra-wealthy, wryly observing how they live and how they differ from (or are alike) compared to the common man. (Although hes probably writing more about the top one-hundredth of the top one percent with regards to wealth.) Organized thematically, the book covers various topics such as divorce and dating, vacations, diets, how rich you have to be to be rich, and so on.Kirshenbaum writes in an easy, whimsical style that make this a good book for when you just want to read something light and gossipy. When he discusses a new topic, he often gets his friends and acquaintances opinions, such as on how some people have paid friends, or the (bad) trend that some high-end restaurants are intentionally offering poor customer service. He cloaks his sources with nicknames to protect both the innocent and guilty, although if you follow along closely over several columns, you may be able to guess who they are with a good degree of certainty (such as with Lactrice and her husband Silver Fox).My only minor nits with the book is that it gets a bit repetitive, so you might want to read it a chapter at a time rather than the whole book at once, and I dont like how the author often transitions by saying things like and I raised my glass of (high priced alcohol) or "" and then we ordered the (fancy food). Both of these are just minor annoyances to me, not serious problems.Overall, this is a nice book for the beach or for when youre looking for something different to read.

"""Marine at War"" was originally published back in the 1960's by Russell Davis about his experiences as part of the First Marines Regiment in the First Marine Division.  While first published in 1961 in hardback form for adult readers, in 1965 it was published in paperback, interestingly enough, by the Scholastic Book Services for school children to read (I would guess middle-school and up).  But don't let that age grouping fool you; this is one of the best war memoirs I've ever read and not written primarily for young readers.The book, which comes in at 246 pages, seems shorter than it is, due to Davis's storytelling ability.  It begins as Davis and his fellow marines begin their assault on Peleliu during World War II, follow their battle there, subsequent rest/rebuilding/recovery on Pavuvu, and then their assault on Okinawa, the book itself ending rather abruptly at the end of the battle.  Davis does not give you his ""backstory"" nor subsequent life, just the time frame from the start of fighting at Peleliu to the end of Okinawa.I would hold this book as a near equal to E. B. Sledge's ""With the Old Breed"", which covers the same time frame.  Although each book is a little different stylistically, both Sledge and Davis became college professors after the war, so both books are very well written.  I only recently (and accidentally) learned of this book's existence, and after reading it, I am surprised that it is virtually unknown today.  Perhaps adult readers weren't aware of the book due to it's publisher, or maybe it was released at a time when war memoirs flooded the market and it was missed, but if you relish taut, tense, descriptive war memoirs, then this is a book you should not miss.

"My oldest son suffers from allergies (as does my wife), and with the spring pollen season upon us, I was happy to be offered the Febreze HEPA-Type Tower Air Purifier to review as part of the Amazon Vine program. Below are my thoughts on this unit.It comes pre-assembled right out of the box. The only things you need to do is to open up the doors on the unit to remove the plastic bags from the two HEPA filiters and to drop your scented cartridge into its slot in the purifier. Then plug it in turn it on. There are three fan speed settings. The lowest setting is whisper quiet, the middle setting is noticeable, and the highest setting is loud. The amount of scent you get is dependent on the fan setting  higher speed means more scent. The unit is rated to purify an area up to 170 square feet, which is roughly 12 feet by 14 feet, or enough for an office or bedroom. As with similar portable purifiers, youll need to close the rooms door in order for it to really clean that rooms air, vice leaving the door open and trying to purify the entire house. My son and I didnt mind the scent, but my wife is not a big fan of scented air, so we removed the scent cartridge. The unit runs fine without it. The manual says that the scented cartridge will last about a month and the two HEPA filters for four months.Im running it in my sons room at night, and it seems to be helping. Hes not coughing in his sleep as much, which is a very good thing as hes also prone to throw up in his sleep when he coughs. Overall, this is a good purifier.

"I ordered this product, ""Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed - Tall Fescue"", to try and fix a problem with patchy grass spots in my front yard.  The grass there is fully exposed to the hot summer sun and tends to start browning-out by mid July, which I can deal with.  However in several spots, a few square feet each, the grass dies completely and I have a patch of bare soil.  So, I decided to give this product a try.I put the seed down in these area about 18 days ago, and carefully followed the instructions with regards to prepping the area and watering.  After about 12 days, the new grass began to appear, albeit not as widespread within the spots as I would have liked.  However, I'm hoping that with additional time, the grass will fill in better.Since I've just planted the grass, I can't yet say how well how things will look in late July, so I'll update this review as needed.

"Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck is Osprey Publishings 36th entry in its Weapon Series, where to quote from Ospreys website, they present the most important, famous and infamous weapons throughout history  (examining) the full story of each weapon, beginning with its design and development, following through its operational history, and finally analyzing its impact on warfare and violence.  This book, as typical for the series, is 80 pages long and contains over 70 period pictures and illustrations, as well as charts, tables, and so on.Author Gordon Rottman does a very good job of covering both the Panzerfaust (designed as a cheap, single use, throwaway rocket-propelled anti-tank weapon) and the Panzerschreck (a German built weapon based very heavily on the American bazooka) from inception through the end of the war and beyond.  He covers both types clearly and lays out how each was used by the Germans, and details the changes to both as the war progressed.  For example, one interesting fact I didnt know was that the Germans developed seasonally adjusted propellant charges for the Panzerschreck, as the propellant was very sensitive to temperature.  The aforementioned color illustrations and black and white photos were also excellent and many give good details that will be useful to modelers.These weapons were built in huge numbers, particularly the Panzerfaust, and were important in that they gave the beleaguered German infantrymen a better way of defending themselves from enemy tanks.  (Until these weapons were deployed, individual infantrymen typically had to either place a charge directly on the tank or use other, near-suicidal methods.)  The Panzerfaust was also useful against concrete, masonry, log, and sand structures, due to its large high-explosive warhead.Overall, these weapons were far from perfect (as shown in the book), and the local situation had to be bad for them to be used at all.  But they gave the infantrymen a fighting chance, so to speak, when faced with enemy armor.  I recommend this book.

"As a child, I was always fascinated by lightning bugs and later glow sticks.  It seemed magical to be able to take a glow stick, bend it, and have it produce its own light.  My children now share a similar fascination with glow sticks (and lightning bugs for that matter), which made this product, the 100 8 Premium Glow Stick Bracelets Mixed Colors, something that I was interested in.What you get is a re-closable tube with 100 glow sticks and 100 connectors, that you can use to  make a bracelet or circle, of various colors.  My daughter is particularly enamored with these.  In addition to just wearing the glow sticks as a bracelet, weve played a sort of ring toss in the dark with them, and shes had a sleepover where all of the little girls were playing little girl games in the darkened basement and bedroom with them.  Weve even put bracelets on our children while we walk around the neighborhood in the early evening dark of winter, to keep better track of the kids while waking in less-well lit areas.  Well be saving some for a similar use during Halloween later this year, too.Youre only limited by your imagination as you can do with them  you could make a chain, a looping necklace, use them as accents on other shapes, and so on.  These are a good value for the money.

"""Archie in the Crosshairs (The Nero Wolfe Mysteries)"" is author Robert Goldsborough's 10th book featuring novelist Rex Stout's detective Nero Wolfe and his able assistant Archie Goodwin. (As I'm pretty sure everyone reading this review is aware, Mr Stout passed away in 1975, and his family authorized Mr Goldsborough to write additional stories featuring Wolfe and Archie.) As I don't discuss any plot details that aren't on the back cover or give any spoilers in my reviews, below are my thoughts on this book.At the time I'm writing this review, I see that there is a wide variety of ratings for this book from other reviewers ... there is no consensus of ""love it"" or ""hate it"" here. Me, I by and large fall into the ""love it"" camp. I think the author does a very good job of capturing the mood, style, and sly humor of Rex Stout. The only very mildly false note was that Archie felt a little bit off sometimes, something other reviewers have noted. But there was nothing wrong or incorrect about Archie, and he was very Archie-like throughout, it just seemed that occasionally he hit a b-sharp rather than an a b note, to butcher a musical analogy. I even chuckled out loud at a few of Archie's wittisms to others or asides to himself, much like I used to do with Rex Stout's works. I disagree, though, with some other reviewers' criticisms about how the author characterized Nero Wolfe ... I thought Mr Goldsborough nailed it.With regards to the plot, this is one of Goldsborough's best efforts and is on a par with those conceived by Stout. I happen to like the timeframe the author chose for this story ... late 40's-early 50's, as to me that's solidly in what I feel is the golden era for Nero and Archie, where detective work was more brainpower and hard work, at least in fiction, as opposed to today's CSI-style of vacuuming up small bits of evidence and running it through spectro-analysis and the like. Goldsborough writing style is easy to read, and the story flows well.I've read all of Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" novels and stories, and while I'm not a card-carrying member of the Wolfe Pack, I'm very familiar with Stout's work. This novel is very good, and it satisfied my hunger for more adventures from my favorite detective duo. As I stated in a review of an earlier Nero Wolfe pastiche written by Mr Goldsborough, as long as he keeps writing them, I'll keep reading them.

"The Zume Games Tenniz Set is a great set that includes everything you need to play a little tennis  and I make a small pun here, as this is a bit of a miniature tennis set.  As can be seen in the product description, the net is 12 feet wide, and a few inches over 2 feet tall, so its not a full-sized net by any means.  But I mildly digress.  The set includes 2 rackets, 2 somewhat heavy, foam tennis balls, the net, framing to support the net, and a nifty carrying case/bag.  The total package weighs 7-ish pounds.You need around 15 feet of width (more would be better to allow for angled shots), and per the included instructions, 24 feet of length for your playing area (although again, more would be better).  As its too cold outside at the time of this review to lure the kids out to play, I set it up in my large basement (after moving furniture and stuff out of the way).  I was easily able to set it up in less than 10 minutes the first time (and around 5 minutes in subsequent attempts).  The instructions say you need a hard, flat surface to play on, and my Berber carpet was both flat enough and hard enough to allow the balls to bounce well.My kids had a fun time playing this set in the basement, and Im certain it will work even better once the weather warms up enough to take it outdoors.  (My basement, while large and relatively open, is too space limited to really be able to let loose when playing.)  I really like how everything is included and fits into the included small carrying case, making it portable enough to take anywhere, to include summer parties and visits with relatives.  Given the dynamics of the ball, I think you could even play it on grass and have a good time.Overall, this is a very well thought-out toy, and I dont see any downsides to it.

"As you can tell from the green ""Vine Customer Review of Free Product"" under my name, I'm a member of Amazon Vine, which means I get offered stuff to review (more often books than other things) in return for a fair and honest review.  When I got offered the chance to review ""TurboTax Deluxe 2014 Fed + State + Fed Efile Tax Software + Refund Bonus Offer"", I did a little happy dance, as I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years now, so I saw a chance to both offer a balanced review of how well this new 2014 version works as well as to compare it to previous years' version.  Oh, and I could also save 50 bucks from having to buying it again myself this year, too.  ;-)Fast forward to when I'm doing my taxes with TurboTax Deluxe.  So far as the program itself is set up, the changes from previous years are minimal ... you load it, let it update itself, import your files from previous years, and then start answering ""questions"" and filling in information.  So far, so good.  But then, as so many other reviewers have noted, if you have to file a schedule C, D, and or E with your return, bam!  This year's version informs you that you need to upgrade to a higher level version in order to do that.  WHAT???  As I mentioned, I've been using TurboTax Deluxe for years, and Schedule D and E was part and parcel of what I expected to be able to do with this version.So, I started researching what had happened.  If I understand it correctly, TurboTax states that the problem is that these schedules were not included in the Deluxe version for other platforms (mobile and tablets) and it was causing cross-platform problems because they were included in the desktop/laptop versions.  So, in order to make everything hunky-dory, they deleted them from the Deluxe version.  They did add a small notice in their advertising that TurboTax has changed this year and to look at feature charts to make sure what you buy is the best version for you.  However, in my experience, most people don't either read that warning because they're buying the same product title as in previous years and don't expect any changes, or they order it online and don't necessarily see the warnings until after they've received the product.What I don't understand, from a marketing point of view, is why Intuit, the makers of TurboTax, would take a product ... a more expensively priced product than what their direct competitors charge mind you ... and strip features from the desktop/laptop version, while leaving the price the same.  I would think that a more customer friendly approach would be to add the missing functionality to the other platforms, while perhaps increasing the price marginally, if at all.  Maybe the vast majority of people using the Deluxe version don't need to use one of those schedules, but based on a quick reading of the reviews posted here, there seem to be a lot of people like me, who do.Intuit has belatedly began doing damage control, after appearing to ignore the problem for over a month.  They are offering a $25 rebate to anyone who bought last year's version of TurboTax and had to upgrade this year, collectable when you file your returns.  And I recently saw an ad from TurboTax where you can do your tax returns for free this year, which I haven't checked this out yet for veracity or conditions.Anyway, if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't file my taxes this year without paying for an upgrade, I would have given TurboTax Deluxe either four or five stars, as the product itself is solid.  However, I did need to get an upgrade.  I won't give this product only one star, as they did advise potential customers to check to see what product would work for them, albeit not nearly clearly nor aggressively enough, in my opinion, for a feature change that impacts what I can only assume to be a significant minority of their customers.  I'm somewhat like a sheep ... if I find something that works well, I'm likely to buy it again next year.  It's only when I have a reason consider other options do I actually re-visit my original opinion.  Well, now I have a reason.

"""The War That Forged a Nation: Why the Civil War Still Matters"", by Pulitzer Prize winning historian James M. McPherson, consists of a series of essays he'd written about the Civil War, including two written specifically for this book.  The essays cover a wide variety of subjects  - from Reconstruction and President Grant, a discussion on the Naval War, several on President Lincoln from various perspectives, and so on.  In many ways, the essays represent the views of Mr. McPherson on the various topics, which given the fact that he has devoted his life to the Civil War, are well worth reading.To my mind, the essays run from ""ok"" to ""great"" (my favorite in the book is #6, the one regarding the Naval War).  One thing to be aware of, though, is that while the title reads ""Why the Civil War Still Matters"", and although the author stated he had re-written several essays for this book, I really didn't get the sense that most of the essays really showed that the Civil War still matters today, except perhaps indirectly.  So if you buy this book with the mindset that you just want to read some insightful essays by one of America's premier historians on the Civil War, you'll be happy with your purchase.  But if you're looking for the essays to provide a strong correlation as to why the Civil War still matters, you might not see this to the level you're expecting.This is a very good book covering a wide variety of topics about the Civil War.  I'm well read on the Civil War and I found his insights both interesting and compelling.  I also like the fact that you get to read about a variety of subjects in good depth in the multiple essay format, as compared to only covering one subject in a longer effort.  I recommend this book.

"In ""Iron Hulls, Iron Hearts "", author Ian W. Walker takes a deep look at whether the Italians ground troops poor fighting reputation in World War II was truly deserved.  He selects the Italian armored units to analyze in North Africa from 1940 to 1943, as these units were as elite as any other Italian ground pounder in World War II.Although on average the Italian mobile divisions were not as good as the Germans and British ones, the authors point out why this was initially so, while also showing the improvements they made over time, so that by the end of this period, they were every bit as good as their contemporaries once you adjust expectations because their smaller size and obsolescent equipment. The poor reputation of World War II Italian fighting men that carries forward to this day was cemented in the losses the Italians suffered in 1940, and as the authors show, was a result of many factors: obsolescent/obsolete equipment, very poor leadership both at the national level and within armed forces, an inadequate industrial base, as well as wartime and post-war propaganda by the British and Germans. However, the Italians performed better after 1940, although they seldom received the credit they earned.The book is well-organized and well-written, and provides a great deal of information on the Italian armed forces in general and on how Italian armored doctrine and tank development specifically evolved from inception through the Axis surrender in North Africa in 1943. The descriptions and analysis of the fighting during the desert war clearly show the strengths and weakness of the Italian soldiers, and provide a more balanced portrayal of their true combat capabilities.  The 8 pages of black and white period pictures were also interesting, and would be useful to modelers.This book does a good job providing a full view of the Italian armored units and gives the reader a more nuanced view of the fighting, and shows that without large number of Italians fighting at their side, the far less numerical Germans would not have been able to win their spectacular victories in Libya and Egypt, before their eventual defeat.  I strongly recommend this book.

"Aircraft of World War I: 1914-1918 (The Essential Aircraft Identification Guide), by Jack Herris and illustrated by Bob Pearson is an outstanding reference book that covers all of the relevant aircraft (both airplanes and airships) of World War I.  Although first and foremost an illustrated guide to these aircraft, the author organizes the aircraft into general time frames and specific mission types, and provides an excellent narrative to accompany the aircraft.  Chapter titles include Opening Moves, Air Combat Turns Deadly, Strategic Bombing, Maritime Aviation, The Italian Front, among others.

These color illustrations give the paint scheme used by the combatants, unit insignia, and other touches that will aid modelers.  In addition to the first-rate illustrations, there are many relevant black and white period photographs and numerous tables full of information like production numbers for various types of aircraft and available aircraft assigned at the front.  Although this book isnt meant to be a combat primer or history, the text contains plenty of examples of this.The book isnt quite perfect.  Because the authors often give multiple illustrations of the same aircraft (showing different paint schemes and equipment variations), the descriptive text can be repetitive.  Also, there are (rare) errors in the aircraft specifications.  (These are usually very easy to spot, when a particular aircraft is listed as being able to go over 100 miles per hour faster than similar aircraft with similar (or the exact same) engine.  These are obviously typos, not errors by the author, and do not detract from the enjoyment of the book.)Overall, this is an outstanding work that covers virtually every relevant aircraft of World War I, while also comparing them against their contemporaries and placing them into proper historical context.

"""M10 Tank Destroyer vs StuG III Assault Gun: Germany 1944 (Duel)"", by Steven Zaloga and illustrated by Richard Chasemore, is a book in the Osprey Duel format that compares the American M10 Tank Destroyer to the German Stug III Assault Gun. The duel format is 80 pages long, and presents an analysis of the factors ... human, mechanical, and tactical ... of the two weapons systems being compared, describes how the weapons were developed and utilized, and includes maps, drawings, photographs, and illustrations.The first part of the book examines and analyses the design, development, and technical specifications of these two weapons, as well as a discussion of how they came to be.  The author then describes how the Germans and Americans were trained, how they were organized, and how they fought.  He finally describes the strategic situation on the Western Front in late 1944, covers fighting around Ubach-Palenberg, and analyzes the strengths/weaknesses of how the two vehicles were used and provides some good tabular information on unit strengths and losses over time.Note that this book really isnt a duel in the traditional sense.  The Stug III was originally designed as an assault gun and, due to the extremely pressing need of the Germans for viable tank destroyers, was converted to fit that role.  The M10 was designed as a tank destroyer, but by the time it arrived in theatre in appreciable numbers, the Germans were on the strategic defensive, severely limiting the opportunity for these weapons to be used against tanks, as intended.  So, the M10 was used more and more frequently as assault guns supporting infantry.  So while these two vehicles undoubtedly tangled from time to time, especially as the Stug III was occasionally forced to act as a poor-mans tank, their usage in 1944 were not as direct combatants.Once you understand that, youll discover that this is an excellent overview and analysis of these two vehicles.  As a World War II history buff, I have many books that cover the Stug III, but this is the first book I own that provides detailed information on the M10, particularly on why the American tank destroyer force was even created.  Unlike the Germans, who viewed a tank destroyer as a much cheaper alternative to a tank, and desperately needed to produce as many armored fighting vehicles as they could, the Americans had the industrial capacity to basically build whatever they needed in the quantities they wanted.  As it turned out, the decision to build tank destroyers was a doctrinal one, and was eventually discarded, as tanks were found to be the best defense against other tanks.As the author shows, neither vehicle was perfect.  The Stug IIIs largest fault in the tank destroyer role was its lack of a turret, and the M10s was that it was open-topped, leaving it vulnerable to bursting artillery and small arms, as well as comparatively think armor.  However, both weapons were used to good effect even if outside of their intended roles.Mr Zaloga superbly presents his material, displaying the ability to pack relevant information into the constrained Duel format in an entertaining and informative fashion.  The photos, illustrations, and drawings are also top notch.  I particularly liked the cut-out illustrations showing the fighting compartments of both vehicles.Overall, the author does an outstanding job of setting the stage and presenting relevant data, anecdotes, and analysis of these armored fighting vehicles, and provides interesting and well developed analysis and conclusions.

They are so sharp and hold their edge extremely well. They are light and well balanced. Makes cutting anything easier. I had other knives I loved but the wooden handles dried up and split and the plastic composite handles got sticky, melted, or cracked over time and exposure to heat and oils.

This one doesn't and it was a deal breaker for me to not have that extra compartment. I give the older version of the boxy backpack like this one 3 stars for the lack of the back pocket compartment. I give the newer versions 4 stars, deducting one star because I'm not a big fan of the flap. It doesn't do anything and you always have to move it aside to access the zippered compartment beneath.The best thing about the boxy backpack is that it can be worn on one shoulder using the shoulder strap or as a backpack freeing up both hands. This is really helpful when you have more than one kid. Another PPB bag that can be worn both on the shoulder and as a backpack is the Satchel. I would recommend the satchel model like the Petunia Pickle Bottom Embossed Satchel, Central Park North Stop Special Edition over the boxy backpack because it can be worn both ways, is sleeker, and it doesn't have the added flap that gets in your way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13S1BUGK1PQED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4B0Z52#wasThisHelpful","R13S1BUGK1PQED","A3RGN75LHYAG8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RGN75LHYAG8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far so good. Minimal assembly. You just have to open it, take out and install the handle, fill it with peppercorns, close it, and it's ready to go. It produces is a fine to medium grind. It feels heavy and sturdy in the hand. I like the solid metal construction. I had three other pepper mills that were made of acrylic with plastic/silicone pieces. Those all started to disintegrate and get sticky (the kind of sticky you can't clean) with time and exposure to heat and oils. And I had to throw them away.

"Sleek,  beautiful, and luxe. Lookwise, this is and impressive curling iron. Functionally, it heats up fast and evenly.  High temps allows for fast curling.  I have thick, naturally wavy, Asian hair.  Curls stay all day and the heats seals cuticles and leaves hair shiny.I gave this curler 4 stars instead of 5 because even though I got this curler free to test and review, I think it's pricey for a curler. For way less, you can get a Hot Tools curler (same brand that my stylist uses) and get the same results.  But of course the Hot Tools curler won't be as sexy/pretty looking.

"Good Radio Flyer trike thought I would recommend a different model over this one.Good thing is it is a quality trike and it was easy to assemble. It is almost exactly the same trike as the other one I would recommend over this one except for a few things. The one I would recommend is Radio Flyer Radio Flyer Deluxe Steer and Stroll Trike. For about $20 more, you get the removable pushing/steering rod and a bell that this model does not come with.1. Steering rod - It lets you push and steer your little one along without you having to bend over and break your back. Useful for teaching your little one how to ride his/her trike. I got my 2 year old the trike with steering rod. It was very useful before she got tall and strong enough to peddle herself. I could push her all the way to the neighborhood park and back. It was a nice change of pace from the stroller. My 2 year old is average in size. About 50 percentile in height and weight. Her feet reach the peddles but she is still not tall enough to actually peddle herself. Although both the Deluxe version and this version of the RF trike is rated for 3 years and up, the deluxe version I'm recommending can be purchased for younger tots and because you can push them around, it is more useful and you can use it longer. When your tot no longer needs you to push, the rod pulls right out and basically you have them same trike as this one.2. Trike Bell - This is not as important but the deluxe trike comes with a bell and this one doesn't. I'm pointing it out because this was the first thing my 2 year old learned to do on the trike and she really enjoyed it. Not a total deal breaker but I wished this trike came with a bell.Otherwise, the two trikes are basically the same in height and size and weight. Both were easy to assemble. You just need a couple of wrenches and screwdrivers (different sizes). The tires on both are made of hollow plastic and not rubber. No pumping required. But they are not as grippy or heavy as rubber either.This is a good trike if you're buying for a 3+ year old. If you are buying for a younger tot, I would definitely recommend the deluxe version because of the steering rod.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI3JVL9PFVM8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLFTEUC#wasThisHelpful","RI3JVL9PFVM8X","A3RGN75LHYAG8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RGN75LHYAG8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Little ones can engage with this toy in so many different ways and there are multiple modes of play that increase in complexity and grow with your child. As little one begins to stand, they can support themselves on this arch. Great toy with lots of music, talking, and lights made to Fisher Price's standard of quality. I'm pleased with this addition to the play room and would recommend to anyone who is looking for something interactive for their child that will last through the early growing stages.If you are interested but want to check it out in person, I saw one on display at Toys R Us as I believe this is a relatively new line for Fisher Price and they are promoting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JH4V0LI0S29D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT0QU#wasThisHelpful","R2JH4V0LI0S29D","A3RGN75LHYAG8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RGN75LHYAG8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Green eco-friendly claims? I'm not sure about that. Here are my observations from using them in my children's toys, TV remote controllers, and wireless keyboards and mice.1. Lots of batteries for the price. This is a good deal for the price.2. Claims to be lead, cadmium or mercury free. This is great but I have no way of verifying this.3. Doesn't last as long as my Duracell but lasts longer than my rechargeables. This is based on casual use and observation. I did not do experiments to prove this.4. Recyclable. But you cannot just throw them into your recycle bin. Recycling is free through their company but you'll need to have purchased a certain minimum amount. One pack of these does not qualify. You'll need to purchase at least two. I still just pack up these batteries with my other used ones and take them all to a local facility that collects batteries.In the end, I don't think I would go out of my way to buy these batteries.

"Fisher Price quality and design is some of the best. I never have any complaints with any of the Fisher Price products I get for my children. This gym has plenty of color and interesting toys to make tummy time fun for infants and parents. However, there are a few cons...because I actually prefer other gym designs better.1. Small. I found the mat size to be smaller than other baby gyms I own or have used before. This is not a complete deal breaker but depending on the size of your baby, you  may not be using this for too long. For most, I think this would work for infants.2. Mat is not attached to the arches. This is also not a deal breaker but it does make it a bit more of a hassle to move it from place to place.I prefer the larger criss-cross design of these gyms much better: Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym or Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy and because they are larger, you can use it longer. I would recommend these over this particular Link n' Play Musical Gym.

"Love the smell, love the texture, love how my baby's skins feels afterwards. It soaks in so quickly and  baby skin looks plump and dewy and fresh. Baby smells fresh, too. The lotion is yellow in color due to some of the natural ingredients used (calendula, I think).I was using the regular Cetaphil and the Mustela Hydra Bebe lotion on my child before. I tried this on a whim. She loves it and the fact it's yellow probably because all her other lotion was white and this new color is interesting to her.

I have so much control with this and don't feel like I'm wasting my produce anymore. Press down firmly if you want to remove a thicker layer of skin. Use lightly and it will remove the thinnest layer of skin.The handle is not always the easiest to hold for me. It's rugged/durable but not ergonomic.

"Very durable, sturdy, well-made, and ADORABLE umbrella.Yes this umbrella is $15. It cost more than any of my other umbrellas. but this has stood up to my two year old's rough play. We haven't actually used it for rain yet since it's summertime in Southern California right now. But my daughter really wanted her own umbrella after seeing it on TV one day. So I got her this one and she plays with her umbrella almost everyday. Opening and closing it. She hits and swats things with it. She swings it around. She twirls it. She steps on it even when open. She's sat in it. It's maintained it's shape and doesn't look any worse for the wear. I think it will be fine by the time wintertime and some rain comes around.It is very easy to open and close. There are no buttons or triggers. Just push up to open and pull down to close--I think it works by friction. You can easily teach your child to do it on his/her own. And little fingers won't get jammed or pinched. I'm very happy with this purchase.I'm also very happy with my shopping experience with Amazon on this particular product. The first umbrella arrived damaged. The postal carrier must have been rough with the box because it was dented and the umbrella was bent. I placed a replacement order and it arrived in 2 days.

I'm glad I was able to get it on Amazon and not have to make another trip to the aquarium. It was cheaper on Amazon, too. She loves both and will sometimes carry both around, one in each arm.Good purchase.

"This Fisher Price Calming Seas Projection Soother is just adorable.It has three sounds: White noise which sounds like a fan, music, and nature sounds which sounds like trickling water + ocean waves + underwater bubbles.It has two light view: Full room projection that makes the room look like it's under water. And there is the fish tank display where a seahorse and a fish swim around a clam that sits in the middle. So cute. Projection and fish tank display do not work at the same time. You pick one or the either.It has three modes of play: Music/sound with projection, music/sound only, music/sound with fish tank display. Again, based on the three modes of play, you'll notice that projection and fish tank display do not work at the same time.It has three volumes: Off, low, and highIt plays for up to 60 minutes which is plenty to sooth a baby to sleep.It is easy to operate. Doesn't require any set up other than to remove the tab in the battery compartment that keeps it on ""demo mode"".I deducted one star because it is fully battery operated and does not come with an AC adapter. Sure it is portable and you can move it and put it where ever you like because it is not plugged in to the wall, but I usually just use noise machines at home and I would like to have the option to plug it into the wall instead of having to change batteries all the time. Having the AC adapter would have made this a 5 start product for me. I've included some photos that I think will be helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPD7IX0LPZ10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETDR4#wasThisHelpful","RAPD7IX0LPZ10","A3RGN75LHYAG8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RGN75LHYAG8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to keep a heater in the baby's room during colder months even though I turn on the central heater for the house because sometimes the there are cold spots in the baby's room particularly near external walls and close to windows.PROs: This is a lovely heather. I love all the safety features and it circulates and warms the air gently without making a room overly hot or stuffy. I also like the way the heater looks and the colors go perfectly with my baby's room/nursery. It's also a lot more compact compared to the tower ceramic heater I was using before which is not specially designed/made for baby. And honestly I always worried if it was safe to leave the tower heater in the baby's room. Now that I have the Vornadobaby Sunny Nursery Heater, I don't have to worry anymore.CONs: Though it has an adjustable thermostat, you can only turn it from low to high and then adjust the fan setting. I prefer the digital climate control thermostats that actually display the current room temperature. That is available in the next model up: Vornadobaby Sunny CS Nursery Heater, Automatic Climate Control. Based on how great this model works, I think it's probably worth the extra $$$ to get the next model up, if you prefer having the ability to set automatic climate control. I just happened to have received this model without automatic climate control to test and review.Still if you need a baby safe space heater that works well and is reliable, the Vornadobaby Sunny Nursery Heater certainly met most of my expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1054V16UE80QT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PD6#wasThisHelpful","R1054V16UE80QT","A3RGN75LHYAG8U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RGN75LHYAG8U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a manufacturer sample from Vivisky claiming this was a new product they were planning to sell on Amazon.  Thinking it was a cool concept, I agreed to try it in exchange for a fair review.  If you're considering it, you've already gotten over the acid-trip zebra, so I'm not going to review design aesthetic.  But I knew I was in trouble when the package arrived and it didn't get better from there.The immediate thing I noticed is that on the package, the metallic silver Vivisky stickers seemed very out of place.  So removing one, sure enough the actual manufacturer, Homi, was below (see customer pictures).  Opening the box, the umbrella was sheathed in a black velvet sleeve which also had a Vivisky sticker on it, and on opening the umbrella there was a fourth sticker, awkwardly placed on the handle for no apparent reason.I'm an internet shopper, so a quick Bing search showed that Homi is a Chinese wholesale brand that peddles these umbrellas at wholesale for about a dollar a pop on Alibaba and other sites (minimum order 500 - sorry if that was your next go-to).  And that price is probably about right.  The umbrella itself is heavily plastic, even places like the control arm and spoke joinery where you would normally expect metal.  The handle is diminutive, sized perfectly for my 5yo, but notsomuch a grownup.  Kudos to the manufacturer for the zebra-printed Velcro closing strap, which is its one nice detail. Overall, though, it just exudes a feeling of dollar-store quality - branding stickers aside.Sure, but does it work as an umbrella, and does it change colors?  Sorta and yes.  It the strictest sense, it will keep water off of you.  But here in the mid-Atlantic, rain is a windful event (not Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day-level windy, but gusty for sure) and this umbrella has a low disk, the frame of which kept inverting in the wind.  I've seen umbrellas go fully inside-out, but this is the first I've seen do it part-way.  I guess if this were used in the shower it would probably work well enough, though I skeptical about the number of times the little plastic flanges will open before breaking.  But for all of its other quality issues, yes, it really does change color (and as vibrantly as shown).One last note, though, because I think it's important to understand who you're buying from (since Vivisky has created their own product page and are claiming this is their product).  Also included in the box is a paper which, in poor English, begs for a 5-star Amazon review and offers a 50% refund in exchange for doing so.  It's the latter part I have an issue with, as it's a direct Amazon policy violation.  This is, spelling and punctuation as-is, exactly what it says:Dear FriendThanks for your Purchase and Congratulations!

"This is one of those products that Amazon should really start a new page for, but for some reason hasn't.  There is an Xbox/PC controller that came out for Win8 that is not the same as the new Xbox One/Win10 controller now being sold.  So watch the dates, because most reviews prior to November 2015 are from previous versions of this item.The current item, which I'm reviewing, is the Xbox One controller + wireless adapter made specifically for Windows 10 and the Nov 12, 2015, Xbox One update (aka ""the new Xbox One experience"").  While it works similarly to the previous Xbox 360/Win7 and Xbox One/Win8 versions, it would be impossible to review the hardware without also reviewing the integration experience, so that's where there's some significant difference.  I am primarily a console guy (yeah, yeah, I know) so most of this review is for the Xbox One -> PC streaming, and I'll hit the direct-control option at the end.  If you're using this solely as a PC controller (non-streaming), the short version is that you'll like it, go ahead and buy it.  If you're an Xbox user considering streaming, read on (yes, that's my 38k Gamerscore in the pic; I'm not new at this).The controller itself is the same controller that comes with the current generation of Xbox One's.  That means that it *does* have a 3.5mm headphone jack (previous versions of this did not).  I was able to pair and use my other base controller (came with the Xbox), my Elite controller, and my Guardians controller, meaning that the wireless adapter will allow you to pair any Xbox One controller, not just the base one it comes with.  Before that gets my Elite brethren too exciting, I will say that I noticed significant lag streaming my Xbox to my Alienware.  If you're casual gaming, it's not the sort to bother you, but on games like Forza and Fallout where split-second timing matters it's definitely pronounced.  I also found that lag did not improve if I connected the PC and Xbox directly to the router, or by swapping routers, meaning that it's not a wireless lag, it's an interface lag (that's actually good news, because that means MS should be able to improve it).The out-of-box experience was simple enough.  The wireless adapter is surprisingly large, but plugs into the USB easily.  Give it a few seconds for Windows to recognize it and power it up while you pop the included AA batteries into the controller.  Then power on the controller, press the sync button on the adapter and controller, when they stop flashing and are solid, you're paired.  In the Windows 10 store, search ""Xbox Accessories"" and download that app.  When you launch the app with your controller connected, it will prompt you for a firmware update, do that, and close when done.  You're ready to go.  Launch the Xbox app on Windows 10 and click the ""Stream"" option.  Now you're doing exactly that, streaming your Xbox One.The description of this controller doesn't (currently, hopefully Ammy updates it) include the hardware specs necessary to stream.  You'll need at least a 1.5GHz multi-core processor, 4BG RAM, and an 802.11N wireless connection (if you're not hardlining your Xbox and PC into your router).  While almost any Win10 PC will pass those rec's with flying colors, some Win7 and Win8 PCs that upgraded to Win10 may need to be checked.  Personally I think that those rec's sound a little low, but that's what MS swears will work sooo...  ;-)If you're not streaming from your Xbox One, but are using this as a direct-controller for your PC games (and there are a few out there optimized for it), this is a great option.  Without the streaming lag, the precision of the Xbox One controller really comes through - especially if you have the aforementioned Elite.  I tried wireless and tethered and found that for direct-control there was no noticeable difference.  While I usually prefer a gaming keyboard for PC games, the Xbox controller works fine and is a little less fatiguing for less-than-real-time arcade games like Dragon Age.  That's just personal preference, though.  Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL072Z9Q5VCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IX3X3E#wasThisHelpful","R2SL072Z9Q5VCX","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls have love Beados, and since these looked similar I picked them up to try.  And they're really not dissimilar, like Legos and MegaBloks.  Beados are the brand advertising on *every* NickJr and Disney Channel commercial break, but kids will have fun with either.This particular AquaBeads studio has both regular beads and crystal beads, which is kinda cool (they're two separate things in Beados).  The construction tray is transparent so if you want to do an existing template you just slide it in the bottom and match the beads - sort of the bead equivalent of paint-by-number.  This is a great option for little ones (AquaBeads recommends 6 and up, Beados says 4 and up - I think 5 or 6 is probably right just for the requisite dexterity).  Once you have your design made the way you want, you mist with water, let dry, and it fuses together.Last year we let the girls Beado us some decorations for the Christmas tree and windows, which they absolutely loved.  The clever part about both brands is the use of the little pellet pen to place the beads, which makes it fun for the kids but also significantly increases the amount of time to make anything.  And the more time they spend playing, the less time they spend fighting - so that's a win!If you have Princess-obsessed girls like me, Aquabeads has both Frozen and Cinderella sets.  For the boys in the house who may find a rainbow-star filled with gems a little girly, Qixels are the boys' version and work exactly the same way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIPKNT6AONE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGLQ9AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3FIPKNT6AONE3","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Made famous by Tom Hanks in big, the original FAO Schwarz floor piano came in right at 70"" and my brother and I played the heck out of it in the 80's.  Fortunately technology has made a great toy even better.This new-generation version by ALEX has a crystal-clear speaker, sharp instrumentation, and a record-and-playback function.  With easy to adjust volume, this was a blast for my 5yo and her 5yo and 2yo cousins without driving the parents crazy.  My too-cool-for-school 9yo rolled her eyes when we first put it out, and dubbed it a ""baby toy"", but Saturday I caught her and her bestie laughing away while running up and down the keys trying to recreate some Megan Trainor song or another.And let's be real, there was no chance I had a giant floor piano and didn't play, too.  My brother and I resurrected routines from three decades ago, and laughed as we hadn't since we were boys.  And, in turn, every one of my 40-somthing friends that's spotted it has immediately thrust themselves on it, because it's not just a kids toy, it's an everybody toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VXGPRDPSRJLJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHGG3N8#wasThisHelpful","R3VXGPRDPSRJLJ","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always tricky to take a carefully-measured, sensual song and attempt to make a cardio-dance tune of it.  In essence you're sampling the original and re-working the entire melody.  So my hat's off to Liam Keegan (whoever he is) for a precise arrangement that pays homage to the original tune while pairing it back to mid-90's dancefloor stylings like Amber.

"This is a simple, single-propeller craft.  It works by using the lightest-weigh plastic and Styrofoam so that it requires little lift.  While the commercials (if your kids watch Nickelodeon like mine do, they're on every break) claim there's some sort of magical means that the craft adjusts its height, I'm pretty sure it's just good-ol'-fashioned push.We've actually had a couple of Air Hog toys in the house before and this one is very similar, so here's the up and down of it.  On thie up side this is a very cool toy that the kids will absolutely devour.  It's not an app or video game, but it has that techy feel.On the down side, it's really designed as a disposable toy.  If played with regularly, I give it tops a few weeks before the motor burns out or the Styrofoam irreparably breaks.  Like our Air Hog Zero Gravity Racers, the Vectron Wave has a noisy little engine that runs for about 10 minutes on a charge and takes around 30 minutes to recharge.So while it's got a huge ""wow"" factor for kids (and grown-ups), its play time is short and you should go into it knowing its a disposable toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROIYWYOM6GLQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFQLB38#wasThisHelpful","ROIYWYOM6GLQD","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just Dance Disney Party was one of my girls' favorite games on our Xbox 360, and probably the one we missed the most when we upgraded to Xbox One. Fortunately it was (mostly) worth the wait.The Kinect 2 for Xbox One is a much more responsive piece of hardware. While the old Kinect struggled to see kids (especially those under 8yo, for whom it was not rated), the new Kinect easily handles my 5yo and her 4yo cousin. It's both more responsive and more forgiving, which makes this a much more fun family game.Curiously, though, while the old game had an even mix of popular Disney Channel hits and movie classics, Disney Party 2 is exclusively Disney Channel faves (you can get ""Let it Go"" on Just Dance 2015).

"Beginning with Songs from the Big Chair, I've had each TFF album on release date (yup, even Saturnine and Raoul), so I've followed their pop singles, ""their"" post-breakup work, and their reunion piece.  This is a dynamic band that's so much bigger and more talented than jus their ""Shout"" fame, and since its release in 1992, this has been my go-to album to introduce people to Curt and Roland.That said, it's been 23 years since this album came out, and 14 years since the last remaster, meaning Tears Roll Down is still clinging to 256kb sound.  By contrast, the standard now is a 320kb sample.  For the average listener on an average system, there won't be much noticeable difference, but for audiophiles it's a little disappointing, especially for a band that built its entire reputation on brilliant instrumentals paired back to pitch-perfect vocals.For newcomers to TFF, there are several different ""greatest hits"" options.  Like I said, I think the breadth of this collection is the best sampler of their iconic years, but this is the album that uses the 2001 remasters, making it better sound quality than Best of... or Shout:The Very Best of....  There's an interesting compilation from 2010 called Mad World which has each of their singles AND the corresponding B-side, giving a snapshot of the band's growth and some collectible songs that are challenging to find elsewhere.  However Mad World also blends TFF's top-shelf songs with some less-amazing tracks (don't get me wrong, ""less-amazing"" for TFF is still better than most bands' very best), making it a roller coaster to listen to.By contrast, Tears Roll Down encompasses just The Hurting through Seeds of Love when the collaboration was at its peak and gives the proudest moments - on and off the charts - of this amazing band.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XS2FQJK586Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1MHBE4#wasThisHelpful","R25XS2FQJK586Y","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Like most little girls, they are fascinated by ponies and while the Ranch has a great assortment of corrals, burr brushes, and stables, this set adds another foal, wash basin, hay, and feed bottle.  For less than $5, it's a great little addition (or freestanding stocking stuffer), and the included instructions are very easy to follow (though some of the pieces are the one-pip bricks that can be challenging for the youngest builders).If your girls are more into caring for the ponies than ranching them, the Vet Clinic or Vet Ambulance are in the same series and each have a veterinarian to help take care of your new foal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8BIO6AIJWTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJ8G30C#wasThisHelpful","RN8BIO6AIJWTN","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5yo received the Lego Friends Animal Hospital and an Amazon Gift Card for her birthday, so this was a great inexpensive supplement.

The down side is about half of the 65 pieces are little one-pip bricks, so the number of actual building Legos this set contributes to a larger collection is pretty small.In sum, it's cute, inexpensive, and a great little gift or stocking stuffer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIMNV0KPXZ5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJ8F22M#wasThisHelpful","RAIMNV0KPXZ5G","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So your first impulse will be to think of this as little-kid Twister, and it kinda is with some significant differences.The biggest difference is that only one kiddo is on the mat at a time.  This is good in that there's no accidental butt-in-face positioning, but bad in that means only two kids are ever really playing - the one on the mat and the one making the calls.  I found this wasn't an issue with the 3-year-old crowd, who worked collaboratively on both fronts.  The five- and six-year-olds were far more interested in getting points and winning, so the time they were ""out"" was not really fun for them.  So definitely better toward the youngest end of the recommended age spectrum.The game is played similarly to Twister, with a stack of cards replacing the spinner.  This tells the player things like putting their left hand on Cubby or their right foot on Nellie.  Now I am not as up on my Doc, Sofia and Jake supporting characters and apparently I should be, but Wonder Forge was kind enough to print everybody's names on the mat so I can keep up.This is a fun game for the 3- to 5-year old crowd who are big enough to reach all the spaces but young enough to enjoy this game's simplicity.  Much older than that, though, and you're probably better off with traditional Twister.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAYXS4XRM1OB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQPOTPM#wasThisHelpful","R3GAYXS4XRM1OB","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With my first two kiddos we went through quite a few play sets finding what did and didn't work.  And while each child is unique in that regard, Fisher-Price has done a really nice job of making a playset that both my baby niece and nephew love.As a parent, let me start with the fact that the music is much more subdued and tolerable than many of this set's competitors (including others by Fisher-Price).  That alone is worth the cost of entry for me.  For the kids, the huge amount to see, do, and interact with almost overwhelms their little attention spans.  My niece was putting the ball in the right to watch it come down, then started playing with the roller on the left, then got into the light show, and by the time she got back to the ball-drop on the right it was brand new for her (don't worry, kiddo - at my age I have the same reaction sometimes).  As the kids get older, there is a fun little set of games for them to play along with, but for the 6-month to 18-month-old crowd this playset is probably best for, those activities are a little advanced.The build of the set is quite sturdy and it will not tip over, even with a toddler leaning against the bar.  The assembly instructions could be a little clearer, but it wasn't difficult to figure out or put together.  It does need four C batteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27EQWRGZXBBIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT0QU#wasThisHelpful","R27EQWRGZXBBIE","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, our Max came with two left feet.  Literally.  And since you cant attach one of the left feet to the right leg because it doesn't fit, our Max looks a little more ""special"" than fierce.Which is unfortunate because problem #2 is that Max doesn't fit back in the box.  So Max (or Special Max, if yours comes like ours) gets to ornament a shelf in your home.  I'm sure there's no chance little kids will lose all of his tiny little pieces since they're unboxed, right?So we pulled Special Max from his bookshelf home to play on Family Night, and did our best not to joke too much about his unfortunate condition.  To play, there is a ladybug-lever at Max's base that you pull, which causes him to spin around and land on a ""random"" spot (parents and astute children will quickly find the pattern).  If there is a game piece there, it is removed from the game.  Pull Max's arms back up to reset him and you're on your way.Things were going well for about 8 minutes, until my 5yo pulled the ladybug-lever back and it broke, rendering the game useless.  So in less than 10 minutes of fun, Special Max became Decoration Max, and his bunny rabbit game pieces became Barbie's new pets while we played at the Dreamhouse for the rest of Family Night.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NY6R4NYPXJMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYNAA08#wasThisHelpful","R2NY6R4NYPXJMD","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:27 Mins If you already have a LeapTV system and are looking to pick up a game, then I think you'll like Frozen quite a bit.  If you're like me, coming to LeapTV as a newbie thinking it's like Nintendo Wii or Xbox Kinect, boy are you in for a disappointment.The game is set up as a series of mini-games, from sledding with Olaf (which my 5yo is playing in the attached video) to ice skating with Elsa to jewelry-making.  I'm not sure ""educational"" is the word I would use, since the quest questions are either right or wrong (in the one in the video, she has to click on the numbers in order from 6 to 10), so it's more like a test than a lesson.So here's where it goes down for me: we have been using Leapster with the kids since the first LeapPad and have had every generation of Pad and Tablet since.  I am accustomed to their 10-years-out-of-date graphics and their cellphone-quality games for $30.  In fact I have come to expect it.  But I've also come to expect things that work, and the LeapTV - and parts of this game - just don't.  For example, in one game the Kinect-esque camera engages and the kids are supposed to wave their hand over the right answer.  Except no amount of adjusting the lighting, her clothes, the camera, or anything else seems to make it register well, so any time the answer is on the top of the screen my 5yo is out of luck.  Likewise the game itself crashed on us a couple times, kicking back to the LeapTV home screen without the cartridge option and requiring a reboot.  I haven't had these problems with the Pad/Tablet games in years, yet here we are with a decade of experience under their belt and LeapFrog seems content to push out products of diminishing quality.Which, in the end, is really too bad.  The idea is good, and the Frozen game gets three stars because (despite all the crashes and frustrations) my 5yo still loves it, but I really think a Wii or Kinect could be a better choice.  Both are more fun, more stable, and can grow with the kids, and if they're really into Frozen, both have ""Let it Go"" on Just Dance 2015.  But if you already have a LeapTV and you're already familiar with the challenges, then go for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26Y77Y84OSKF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1PPGM#wasThisHelpful","R26Y77Y84OSKF6","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big Grover Cleveland fan (most popular President in U.S. history - sad that he's relegated to the ""lesser-known"" category) and really hoped this would bring a little wit and wisdom from him and the other non-spotlight leaders.  Unfortunately these quotations are even less memorable than some of the presidencies to which they belonged.Often the ""memorable quote"" should be a sentence or snippet, but we're given a whole paragraph in which to find it.  This lack of editing at times seems intended to give context, but is most often just a treasure dive.  An example is this quote by Calvin Coolidge:""But there is another element, more important than all, without which there cannot be the slightest hope of a permanent peace.  That element lies in the heart of humanity.  Unless the desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree, all artificial efforts will be in vain.  Peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law, based on righteousness and supported  by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man, can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life.  Parchment will fail, the sword will fail; it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant.""The memorable quote therein is simply the last sentence and could have been edited thusly. Which isn't to say there aren't also one- and two-line quotes, but this sort of large-block quoting happens unnecessarily often, making it seem like either lazy editing or an effort to make the book longer.  In either case it renders the book less useful or fun to read.All of which would be a three-star ""it's okay""-rated book UNTIL the biggest crux of my issue: there is no citation or sourcing at all anywhere in the book.  Absolutely nothing with which you could verify the quote, or even put it in context (was it part of a State of the Union speech, a stump speech, a post-presidency memoir?  Nothing).  That's where this book really plummets from a three-star book to a one-star one.  While I appreciate Mr Dell for attempting to compile this historic reference, without citations I have to take at face value that it's not a partial or complete fiction.  Without citation it's not a history or a reference book (as it's currently categorized), it's just somebody's say-so.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFHFPS3GVTZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OO182GK#wasThisHelpful","R3JFHFPS3GVTZS","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually picked this up for my Triumph, since there are few things more important on a motorcycle than tire pressure (on a car, important - on a bike, life-saving).  The fact that I was able to get a multi-tool with a flashlight and a tire pressure gauge in the same pocket-sized unit is fantastic!First, and most importantly, it's a tire pressure gauge.  Like I said, I get that's not critical in your car and if you're off by a few pounds here or there you probably won't notice.  On a motorcycle, a few pounds off can be the difference in landing a corner or lagging in a pass - it's a huge deal.  So accuracy is paramount.  Before I trusted this gauge on its own, I brought along my old gauge, and I verified the reading with my professional gauge at home.  After several weeks and a dozen readings, I'm confident that DBPower's claim of ""within 1lb psi"" is true, since in every case but one it was exactly the same.  Note: it does not claim accuracy in sub-freezing temperatures, but I'm not riding when it's that cold anyway.Once I was confident with it fulfilling its primary purpose, I played with the gadgets.  The flashlight is great for inspecting the belt, as well as nighttime stops.  While the packaging doesn't indicate how strong the flashlight is, it's definitely more like a 200-lumen small LED flashlight than a full 2000-lumen torch.  Having the vice-grip and screwdrivers is definitely handy prying any rocks from the tire, while the window-smashing hammer and seatbelt cutter are probably good to have in a car, but not as useful for a bike.The whole tool is just over 6"" long and weighs about 3oz, so it's substantial but still small enough to tuck away easily.  I use mine pretty regularly now, so I just keep it in my jacket pocket, though it fits easily under my seat, too.  For a car driver this is a good little gift; for a motorcyclist like me it's a great one.I received a free manufacturer sample in exchange for an unbiased review.  Fortunately, I like it enough to have bought one for my brother, too.  Definitely earned its five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIQMG83UU6AP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H0QV00#wasThisHelpful","R2NIQMG83UU6AP","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sanderson is at his very best when weaving a tale of heroes-teetering-on-the-edge-of-chaos.  While The Well of Ascension droned on with character development for its first 42% (thanks, Kindle) and eventually found its footing, The Hero of Ages starts strong and stays that way.  It is a deliberate tour-de-force of an author passionate about the tale he's telling.Without giving anything away, The Hero of Ages picks up a breadcrumb trail of clues you read in the first two books and takes you on an unexpected journey.  While there are some awfully-repetitive internal monologues from Vin and Sazed, Sanderson's resolution to this trilogy is easily one of the best, most satisfying ends to a series I've ever read.

"I purchased the competing Electrohome EAAC470 USB dual-charging alarm clock last Christmas for my wife, but it has a couple of critical design flaws that I hoped this iHome would correct.  And it mostly does.First, and perhaps her biggest annoyance, is that the Electrohome is super-lightweight.  Which should be good for a travel alarm clock, but also means that any tug or nudge of a connected device causes it to easily slide off the dresser since it has absolutely no weight resistance.  The iHome is only slightly heavier, but with better-designed grips on the bottom it does a much better job of resisting movement.  This also means smacking the snooze button doesn't send it careening, although that was a clever way for the Electrohome to get my wife up in the mornings.Second, the Electrohome has a blindlingly-bright blue display.  Even on its lowest setting we usually end up flipping it face down to hide its omnipresent blue glow just so we can sleep.  The iHome has a MUCH smaller display which does a reasonable job of dimming to a sleepable level.  It supplements the smaller space with a large, front-facing speaker that offers a cleaner sound quality than the Electrohome.Which brings me to the only downside of the iHome: its much-smaller screen.  While most digital alarm clocks these days have gone for big, easy-to-read screens (the kind that prevent having to find my glasses first), the iHome screen is tiny my comparison.  And since part of the screen is used for notifications and icons, the actual time-telling part is pretty small compared to most competitors.  If you're like my wife and you go to sleep and stay that way, it won't matter to you.  If you're like me and you wake up regularly and want to know the time, this could be more problematic.The USB charging capability is not the fastest, but it's nice to be able to keep the phone on the nightstand without occupying another plug.  The 3.5mm input jack worked perfectly with my HTC and her Fire Phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF2RNZEJO0K1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNDES84#wasThisHelpful","RF2RNZEJO0K1N","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls are pretty wild over all things Barbie or horses, so put the two together and it's a no-brainer.  The new Barbie Saddle-and-Ride is Mattel continuing to up their ""wow"" factor, and it's accomplished in spades.  My 5yo's literally said ""wow!"" when Barbie mounted the horse and started riding, and even my usually-cynical 9yo wanted to play with it.So here's the down side: the staying power of Barbie has always been her universal appeal to imagination.  She goes to the beach, then gets in her VW bug and drives to her dream house/castle where she lounges at a table with friends before going parasailing.  Same doll, lots of things to do.  The ""problem"" (if you will) with this particular Barbie is that her joints don't move like other Barbies, her hand is permanently attached to her rein, and her legs are too far apart for most other Barbie vehicles.  So suddenly you have this (pardon the pun) one-trick-pony Barbie in your collection.  Don't get me wrong, it's 5-star amazing at what it's supposed to do, and it definitely won the girls.

"We live at the beach, so my girls (8yo and 5yo) have grown up on a steady stream of surf, Frisbee, and bean bag toss.  We bought the full-size version from Viva Sol a while back and on receiving this mini edition I'm glad to see the same attention to detail.This set is about 1/4 the size of the regular regulation-size boards (5""x10"" vs 24""x48"").  It is made from a richly-stained walnut veneer over a pine frame which is beautiful, durable, and lightweight enough to be easily portable.

"My 5yo and her friends have really been getting into Scholastic's new Branches series, which takes beginning chapter books and illustrates each page.  By creating a long story rather than a running theme, Branches are a little more advanced than something like Frog and Toad, while still using illustrations to engage early readers who aren't quite ready for pages of prose.That said, Sparkling Jewel is easily the least interesting of the dozen or so Branches books we have.  The girls absolutely love the fast pace plots and chapter-ending cliffhangers of Dragon Masters and Stardust Friends.  In fact, quick character introductions and a quick pace are the hallmarks of the Branches series.  Sparkling Jewel trades that away for far too much character development, which means sometimes pages go by without much actually happening - a real deal-killer for youngsters today.Beyond the pacing problems, Sparkling Jewel wanders constantly.  Storied from Tori's point-of-view, the narration wanders incessantly - in a three paragraph spread early on she talks in complete non-sequitur about having to spend the summer at the ranch, her favorite pony, her sister, her mother, her grandmother, the new pony, back to her favorite pony, a cat...  While that frantic topic-bouncing undoubtedly sounds like my 5yo's inner monologue, it makes following what the author is actually trying to convey very difficult.  I can't help but be reminded of Miss Piggy's classic line: ""Why are you telling me all this?""  ""It's plot exposition, it has to go somewhere.""Sparkling Jewel should've been a hit with my girls.  It has a great premise, a sisters-as-pro/antagonists, ponies, and pseudo-danger.  Unfortunately it gets so mired in its exposition that it fails to drive the plot.  Hopefully the author visits some of the other Branches books for an idea of how this can be better balanced.  Sparkling Jewel isn't a bad book per se, but it's not good - and there are definitely better early-reader choices even within the Branches family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9TT4AJYL65DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545797659#wasThisHelpful","R9TT4AJYL65DB","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This has the effect of keeping it highly-versatile and less expensive, which is really smart.The whole thing clips closed and has a handle for easy carrying, making this a near-perfect toy on-the-go (just have to keep track of all the little accessories).  It's part of the Cutie Mark Magic collection, so if you play with the CMM app this'll unlock more to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RULNWMFCE9L58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVIFZ3O#wasThisHelpful","RULNWMFCE9L58","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girls have pretty much all of the blind bag Ponies, so it's fantastic to have a playset scaled for them.If you're not familiar, the blind bags Ponies are tiny (think: those little prizes you got from the machine at the grocery store for a quarter when we were kids).  This barn is about 8"" tall and maybe 10"" wide with an open two-level back and is modeled in the cartoonish 2D style.  While I love that there's finally a playset to fit our collection, it's a little disappointing that the inside of the barn isn't detailed (really at all), so we ended up using stickers from a sticker book to give it some character.  It comes with Granny Smith and Crimson Gala (both rare Ponies to be found), and some tiny accessories.If you're looking for a playset that fits the ""normal""-sized Ponies, this is not it.  If you're like us and have quite a few of the minis, this set will be perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC68OTPA5F2KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4KAI#wasThisHelpful","RC68OTPA5F2KO","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5yo and her cousin are VERY into MLP, so I picked this up hoping it would be the Pony equivalent of the Barbie Dream House.The Ponies are (obviously) not as tall as Barbie and friends, and Canterlot is scaled accordingly.  Like the Dreamhouse, or our popular-with-the-girls Disney princess castle, Canterlot is a huge playset compared to the toys.  Sitting at 2 1/2 feet tall, it's about half a foot shorter than the castle and designed completely in the cartoonish 2D style.  It's not the most durable toy you'll own, but it's about what you've come to expect from Hasbro and is significantly sturdier than last year's Rainbow Kingdom Playset, so I'm glad to see Hasbro bringing some quality back, even if it still has some room to improve (our left door to the castle will not stay on for anything).This set plays well with the ""normal""-sized Ponies, and is thematically built for the Cutie Mark Magic Ponies.  It'll be a little big for the new Pop! Ponies.  It comes with Princess Celestia and Spike, and if you're gifting this I would recommend Rarity and Princess Luna as add-ons.  While it's still not quite the quality I would like to see, it's easily the best MLP playset currently on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHSYCNV6VYR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOG4Q6G#wasThisHelpful","RYHSYCNV6VYR4","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many parents, I've tried to introduce my kids to my old favorite toys.  While some, like Lego, haven't really changed much (having differing faces aside), K'Nex is really at a whole new level for my girls.My parents still have some of our K'Nex, so last month when we were visiting, my 8yo, 5yo, and I pulled them out to play.  What I noticed immediately on receiving these new ones is that they're not only much more vibrant, but the build quality is much better.  Even when they were new, my old clips would sometimes bend or snap, where the new ones seem designed to take much more abuse (and believe me, my girls can give it).The engineering is also excellent.  No matter what angle or idea we had, there seemed to be a perfect piece for it.  While the range of connections is why I always preferred K'Nex over Tinker Toys, the addition of strong female characters really helps inspire my girls.  It also seems to be K'Nex answer to GoldieBlox (which I can't get my girls interested in at all), and with sets like The Inventors' Clubhouse, which comes with a motor, and the Home Designers' set, which encourages engineering and architectural design, I really like where K'Nex is going and we will definitely be getting a few more sets from Santa this year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRCX32WW4CSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5Y9Y3E#wasThisHelpful","RSRCX32WW4CSQ","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2015 version of Mattel's My Password Journal has some significant improvements over the old version.For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an old-fashioned locking diary may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I5A4QFQKQYN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FDMRY#wasThisHelpful","R3I5A4QFQKQYN2","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Pridebit Kitchen Scissors attempt to be the Swiss army knife of kitchen cutlery, but it mostly stumbles over its own functionality.Foremost I needed a good kitchen scissor, and with the Pridebit coming in half for easy cleaning I hoped that attention to design and detail would convey throughout.  The problem is it's not very good at being kitchen scissors.  It's significantly duller out-of-the-box than any pair I've owned before, and its thick sheet made it difficult to sharpen.  Furthermore it can only open about wide enough to snip before running into the bone cutter divot.  So as a kitchen scissor that isn't good at its primary function, it already wasn't making my favorite tools list.  But I decided to try some other features for kicks.The curiously-included flat-head screwdriver is both a little thick for most kitchen screws (most pots and pans use phillips head anyway), and the ability to use it means carefully holding the bladed side of the knife.  The bottle opener is designed like an old can punch (remember those?) but is a little too shallow for modern caps.  The nutcracker fails to use any leverage, making it far less effective than a free-standing nutcracker.  The vegetable peeler sort of works, but it's actually easier to peel vegetables with the blade of the separated scissors once you sharpen them.Now I don't fault Fitbit for these design choices.  This seems to be an imported product that several manufacturers on Amazon have discovered, including Modern Utensils, Greentisory, and Iron Gadget.  And my experience with Pridebit as a company has been great communication and a strong desire to deliver on customer service.  I think they just need a better product.I received these scissors as a free manufacturer sample in exchange for an unbiased review.  While I'm sure they were hoping for more stars, I just want to reiterate that rating is solely for the scissors and not Pridebit itself.  Pridebit's Julienne peeler is fantastic; these scissors not-so-much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HKJ21XUPQ153/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNJQ0O4#wasThisHelpful","R1HKJ21XUPQ153","A1D1IDI5S9TN9D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1D1IDI5S9TN9D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This light is perfect for closets, pantries, or other places where you want a light but don't have access to an outlet.  It's also perfect for a kids room since you don't have to worry about kids pulling it out of the outlet.  To set it up you slide off the back piece, insert the batteries, then slide the back on to cover the batteries, slide the switch over to turn it on, and place it wherever you need it.  There are sticky pieces you can use to stick it to the wall or you can just set it down somewhere.  There are three settings:  on (the light stays on all the time), off (the light is off all the time), and automatic (there is a motion sensor that triggers the light to turn on then it automatically turns back off).

"These are really nice glue traps.  The glue is nice and strong and will easily hold mice or bugs in place.  While it's best to keep it out of reach of your pets it's nice knowing that even if they do get into it it's not going to kill them.  You can either lay the traps flat or fold them up into a tube.

No more arguing over the bug problem.  :)I received a free sample from the manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PC632HR8I7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YEEKGWK#wasThisHelpful","R2PC632HR8I7J","A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These crochet hooks are incredibly comfortable to use. The rubber handles are nice and soft with a little bit of give to them making them super easy to hold without putting any stress on your hands. The top section of the rubber handle is shaped to make it easy to get a good grip. They remind me somewhat of the special grips you can put on pens/pencils to make them easier for young children to hold. They are both easier to hold and more comfortable than traditional crochet hooks.The kit includes 9 different hooks. The sizes are as follows: 2.0mm, 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, 4.0 mm, 4.5 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.5 mm, and 6.0 mm.

With a textured thin case (the speck candyshell):  It was a little more difficult to get the phone in/out of the armband due to the texture on the case but it was a good fit once I got it in.  With a thick case (otterbox defender):  It was difficult to get the phone in/out of the armband.

It's a very interesting story and he decides to listen to it and ultimately checks the book out of the library.

"This belt has tons of different uses:  It works great for running, other forms of exercise, and yard work.  It's also a great way to carry your cash and identification while traveling or while out dancing or doing other activities where you don't want to carry a purse.  It's nice and thin so it's easy to hide under clothing as long as you are not trying to carry anything too bulky.  The pouch is a nice compact size that stretches to accommodate large items (such as a phone).  There's enough room to easily carry your keys, cash, identification, and a smaller phone.  The material is soft and comfortable to wear even while exercising.  The belt adjusts to fit a wide range of waist/hip sizes.  The pouch is waterproof so your items will stay dry even if you get caught in the rain BUT there is a very small opening at the top of the zipper track where water can get through if the pouch is submerged under water so this would not keep items completely dry if you tried to go swimming with it on or something like that.

"I cook some traditional Indian dishes but also cook a lot of traditional American dishes.  Chana Dal is easy to incorporate into all types of recipes.  It's a great source of protein making it a great choice for vegetarian dishes but it also works well in meat dishes or as a side dish.  Most recipes call for soaking the Dal overnight or using a pressure cooker but this isn't really necessary.  To cook:  Rinse the Dal under running water until the water runs clear.  Put Dal in pot, add about twice as much water as Dal and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon baking soda then bring to a boil, reduce to gentle boil and cook until soft but not mushy.

"This armband is made of nice soft fabric so it's comfortable to wear.  It stays in place well without slipping down my arm at all.  It fits the Iphone 6 (4.7 inch) either by itself or with a thin case.  If you have a thicker case such as the Otterbox Defender you will need to take the case off to fit it in this armband.  This is advertized as waterproof but it's really water resistant-there are two cut outs on the back plus the slit that you slide your phone through on the back.  There is no way to seal these and water can definitely get through them.  The front of the case is plastic and does provide a good amount of protection so you should be fine if you are jogging in the rain or something like that but you definitely can't submerge the case under water or anything like that.

"Chickpea flour is gluten and grain free and can easily be substituted for all purpose flour in many recipes to make them gluten and grain free.

"I am very happy with the look and feel of these pants.  The pants have an elastic waist and would be a good fit for a US size 6 to a US size 14.  They have two long tassels that hang down the back of the pants and are designed to be wrapped around the waist and tied (when they are not tied they are as long as the pants themselves and go all the way to the ground).  The pants are on the longer side and will likely need to be hemmed if you are on the shorter side.  I'm 5'8-the inner layer of the pants hits right at my ankles and the outer layer hits on the top of my feet.  They are very light weight and perfect for summer weather.  They are very comfortable but still look great.I received a sample of this product for testing and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J8IEUKH9SCRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9K3VF0#wasThisHelpful","R3J8IEUKH9SCRZ","A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I tested this using an iphone 6 (4.7 inch) with a Body Glove Tough Suit case on it (which is a relatively thick case).  The phone fit with room to spare and I was easily able to operate the phone while it was in the case.  The top has two locking clips to seal it shut.  I submerged the case under water in my bathroom sink and everything inside stayed completely dry.  The case also comes with a lanyard and an arm band to use to carry it both of which are removeable.

"We have the Camelbak Kid's Eddy bottles and the Contigo Kids Autospout bottle. They are pretty similar and we like them both but have found that the Contigo is more durable than the Camelbak. The major difference between the two is the bite valve. The bite valve on the Camelbak wears out pretty quickly-it either rips when I'm pulling it out to wash or my kids bite through it. You can buy replacement valves so you don't have to replace the whole bottle but it's still a hassle. The bite valve on the Contigo is more durable so it's harder to bite through and less likely to rip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352VLXJ62KQBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE354N2#wasThisHelpful","R352VLXJ62KQBW","A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HM8BRW0GC1ZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*ARC provided by author for honest review*  Broken Heart by Angel Rose is the first book in the Broken Heart series.  In this story Angel introduces us to Jenesis, the broken lead female character, Michael, then dominate lead male character, David, the father figure Jenesis always wanted but never had and a handful of other supporting characters. This is not your typical love story.  This story has so many different emotions; anger, sorrow, hate, hurt and love all intertwined with endless lies, deceits, and abuse.  Jenesis is a very broken untrusting young woman who comes from a childhood full of verbal abuse, physical abuse and domestic violence.  When her parents lives are tragically cut short she runs away to New York to start a new life for herself.  However tragedy follows her to New York where she is unable to escape her horrible violent nightmares. Jenesis meets David and their relationship blooms full of father daughter love but then she meets Michael and falls head over heals in love and borderline obsessed. It just so happens that David and Michael can't stand each other adding another layer of drama.  The author takes you on a roller coaster ride full of drama and despair, and tells a story of how everyone is intertwined and how their lies not only affects their own lives but everyone else's. Throughout the book the author constantly has you second guessing whether or not you actually like the characters and Michael is definitely not book boyfriend material.  This is a great debut novel and very well written.  There are some typos and grammatical errors but nothing severe enough to take away from the story. The story is very fast passed and told in the the first person through Jenesis' point of view.  There is very hot sex scenes and very graphic violence throughout the book. I recommend this book to everyone over 18 who is not sensitive to abusive situations. This story does end with a cliffhanger.  I give this book 4 stars and can not wait to see what the author has in store for the next novel. I hope that the supporting characters all get their own books as well because with some developing I really feel that a couple of the other characters can have great stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOJYQDI460FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EHL5NW#wasThisHelpful","R1SOJYQDI460FG","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*ARC provided by the author for an honest review*Something for the Pain by Victoria Ashley tells the story of Tripp and Alex, in their alternating POVs. Best friends for years, Alex and Tripp have a relationship that is unparalleled. They have been there for each other for tragic life events, happy times, and everything in between.Alex would drop everything for Tripp, his little firecracker, whenever she needed him. So when Tripp asks him to move in with her and her sort-of-boyfriend, Lucas, he is unable to say no. But what will it end up costing Alex? For years, he has been sleeping his way through the female clientele that flock to his tattoo shop, all the while harboring an intense attraction for his best friend. Hes not willing to sacrifice everything for a taste of Tripp...because certainly, he cant keep her as his own.For almost a year, Tripp has been happy with the arrangement she has with Lucas. Unwilling to commit to him, each are free to see other people- though only Lucas has taken advantage of it. At the one year mark, Lucas wants her to commit to being exclusive, but theres something holding her back...Alex. She cant deny her attraction to him, but she also cant risk his friendship. Certainly their emotional connection is more important than hormones, right?So when one night, Lucas suggests something that Alex has thought about constantly, he has a decision to make. Can one night with Tripp get her out of his system, or will he lose his heart in the process?This woman has always been my something for the pain, and losing her will feel like dying...Something for the Pain is sexy, a bit angsty, and has a male lead that any girl would find swoon-worthy. Theres no question in my mind that the reader will almost always be in Alex and Tripps corner, but will they come to their senses and give it a shot?I would rate this book 4 stars. There is minor violence, good writing, and some sexual content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9JWR174PGYVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015SF5RQ8#wasThisHelpful","R9JWR174PGYVX","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ARC provided by the author for an honest review.Love to Hate You by Isabelle Richards. The conclusion to the two book series. Simply put. AMAZING.Her style is near perfect, in that it draws you in, keeps you in and sweeps you away from your everyday life.

But fate is a fickle friend and when you think all is going well that is when fate throw you a curveball.

A lost girl, Ari, with a need to getaway and a stupid boyfriend, Chase, who lets her go. A hurt ex-boyfriend who turns her away and instead of seeking support from those she loves and that love her she parties with a former loser from her tennis days. Hurt, humiliation, lost in life. So many emotions run rampant through this book that it is hard to see how these two could ever end up together.Every move these two make leads to more pain, more hurt, more turmoil. But they will need to buck up and hope their love is enough to overcome all the obstacles that befall them.Isabelle Richards has become one of my favorite writers. After her Fates trilogy not this series it is hard not to see pure talent and amazing storytelling on the pages she scribes.This is a 5 star read for me! Thats right, 5 stars. This book, this series. It is MUST READ.

"ARC was provided by author for an honest review.Chasing Cassidy by D. Kelly. My 1st book read by the author. A true love, fight for romance novel. Beautifully written, with hot, steamy sex, told in alternating POVs by our two leads, Cassidy and Zach.Cassidy Pope has known Zachery Stafford since they were six years old. That is also the same time when her life changed at home. It is when they moved into her dead grandmothers home and her father beat her and mom did nothing to stop it.It is also the time when she made a best friend, Zachs twin sister, Rylee and her best friend and true love, Zach.After years of physical, verbal and mental abuse at the hands of her father and the abandonment of her mother. Cassidy is a mess. She has been taught that love doesnt exist. Though Zach and his family have loved and shown her love from the start, her upbringing negates that in her eyes.When Zachs mother, a pretentious privileged b*tch, does the unthinkable and runs Cassidy off on her wedding day to Zach, Zach is tired of her running and has plans to show and prove to her how much she is loved and that it does exist.Following her to Hawaii, he lays the ground work on proving to her that she is worthy of him, the Stafford name and all that goes with it. But with her childhood and his mothers relentless attacks, Zach has his work cut out for him. Luckily with the help of his sister Rylee, his dad and the unlocking and telling of secrets he hopes she can make her finally see and believe what he has tried to show and prove to her all her life.I loved this book. I was swept away in the love Zach had for her. I usually hate the lost woman character but Cassidy is written in a way that you cant help but feel for her and fall in love with her yourself.I highly recommend this to romance reader. To readers of good books in general. D. Kelly keeps up interested throughout and we root hard for Zach and Cassidy.5 stars is my rating and I cant wait to read more by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CYHDKFR04PXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MFM742#wasThisHelpful","R1CYHDKFR04PXY","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *Songbird is written by bestselling author Sydney Logan. Her writing style is amazing. This book is a contemporary romance bordering on the uber sweet fairy tale variety.Callie Franklin for the most part is a good girl. A hard working reporter who is looking for love and doesnt do one night stands. Ever.That is until her friends wedding weekend. Frustrated with her bridezilla best friend she heads to the piano bar the night before the wedding. There she runs into a hot sexy stranger and goes against everything she believes in and after the hottest night of sex she has ever had she is left humiliated when she awakens to the stranger gone. Without even a goodbye. Dejected. Humiliated. She heads to the wedding breakfast and there her humiliation intensifies when she sees her sexy stranger. He is the missing groomsman from the rehearsal dinner the night before. Devin McAllister.Devin doesnt do dating. He doesnt do relationships, they lead to strings and heartbreak. He likes uncomplicated and simple. Just sex. Just pleasure. Nothing more.At the wedding, Callie wont even look at him. When he finally gets a chance to dance with her sparks ignite again. This time he leaves a white rose and a goodbye note. Callie is once again pissed at herself for breaking her rules no matter how hot and sexy Devin is her eyes.When life throws Callie and Devin a curve ball, forcing them together once again, things get very interesting.I really liked this book. I prefer a more realistic love story. This was a little too fairy tale for me. That is only my opinion, which does not take away from the book whatsoever.I liked the dual POVs.

"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *INSIDER is book one in the Exodus End series by amazing author, Olivia Cunning. The series is a spin off from the Sinners series, as Dare the leader of the band is brothers with Trey of the Sinners series.Toni Nichols is a shy, virgin, homebody who took care of her special needs little sister and wrote articles for her mothers company from home. That is until she is given the prime job of following the band and writing an interactive book she had an idea for.Logan Schmidt is the bassist for Exodus End, a player and an adrenaline junkie. If he isnt feeling it on stage, then he is bed with a groupie or two and if he has time away from those he is enjoying risky activities like sky diving and motocross.This all changes when Toni shows up at the buses to start following the band. The band and security expected Tony, not Toni. Once they allow her on the bus the guys open and wild personas are nothing like what she is use too. It doesnt take long to feel out of place and it only takes slightly longer till she loses her V-card to mega-slut Logan. When he discovers he took her virginity he is shocked and doesnt know what to do. So he does what any moron man does he walks out.The story centers on Tonis inexperience and open thinking, her self-doubt, her insecurities and her crazy mother and boss. We also have Logans insane jealousy, he punches a bandmate, his fear of loving her and just keeping it casual and the lack of faith he has in Toni when it hits the fan.I really love most all of Cunnings rocker books. My only knocks on this book was the naivet of Toni and her forgiving those who wrong her so quickly.I am giving this a big 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38Y0OUSIEJFJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WYDIHLK#wasThisHelpful","R38Y0OUSIEJFJ0","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *Outside by Michelle Mankins is the first book in the Rock Stars, Surf and Second Chances series. This is the story of surf and rock God Lincoln ""Linc"" Savage and sweet tenderhearted Simone ""Mona"" Bianchi. This novel tells a story of love, hate, abuse, passion, tragedy, heartbreak and devastation.When Linc and Mona first meet Linc is on the path to becoming a top professional surfer and Mona is a talented college student whose only wish is to perform on Broadway and finally be free of her extremely controlling and possessive father. When Linc and Mona first see each other it is instant attraction and addiction to one another. Once their romance startes, even if they do not have the support of their families, they are determined that they will make the best out of the time they have together before she returns to college and he goes off to wow the world as a professional surfer. They plan to stay faithful to each other while apart and will eventually live happily ever after together. The only problem with their plan was after a horrible accident during an afternoon surfing Linc was left unable to to compete professionally, and after Linc lost surfing he lost himself. This started a fast spiral to end of the passionate romance that he and Mona had found during their summer together, but no matter the amount of heartbreak or heartache either went through their love for one another never died.Now fast forward 15 years and now you have a Rock God Lincoln and a surf shop owner Simone. Linc has not seen Mona since their horrific breakup all those years ago but now he's back and wants a second chance. Mona has to decide if she can risk her heart again on the man who has already smashed to pieces.The story is told in both Linc's and Mona's point of view and in the first person. The author does an amazing job switching the story back and forth from the past and the present while tell the story. There is so much pain in this book that you are taken on an emotional rollercoaster that really doesn't end until the end of the book. It honestly took a while for me to get into the story but once I got into it I was hooked. Although I am not a big fan of Lincoln and the story was frustrating at times I did enjoyed the book as a whole, with that being said I give Outside 3.5 stars. There were some grammatical errors throughout the book that did take away from the story some and I believe that if fixed would raise the rating for this novel. The author did leave the story open for not only more books in the series for all the supporting characters but for possibly more of Linc and Mona. This book does contain very hot sex scenes and physical, verbal and physiological child abuse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BIU0RHB8E4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLPMB8E#wasThisHelpful","R17BIU0RHB8E4X","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *Well Im giving my first 6 star rating to a book. It goes to Emma Chases Sustained, book #2 in the Legal Briefs series. It can be read as a standalone, as the main character was a secondary character in the first book. This is a beautiful HEA romance novel.Jake Becker is a rising star defense attorney. His is also a player, who hits it and quits it. He doesnt do complicated. Hell he doesnt even date but to bad his world is about to be turned upside down.After a health scare Jake decides to try the dating lifestyle, actually meeting, getting to know and like a girl before he bangs her. Nothing sparks his interest until a chance occurrence. He is pick pocketed by a witty 9 year old who he chases down and instead of handing him over to the cops brings him home. There he comes face to face with a stunningly beautiful woman, Chelsea, the boys aunt.Turns out she is the custodian to him and his 5 other brothers and sisters after their parents were killed in a car accident a month earlier. She is in WAY over her head but doing the best she can and for some unknown reason, to himself, Jake is eager to help out where he can.As we go through the book situations arise were Jake plays the hero and also the goat. The characters are strongly built so that you cant help but love them. The kids are cute and funny as hell. This story just hit a homerun for me. I couldnt put it down. Id try and then I would find myself gravitating over to my tablet and starting to read again.My only negative about the book, the parents were killed a month ago but the emotional grief is almost nonexistent, but honestly that is knit picking. I just happen to be finicky like that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOGKBOIODX3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WQF6#wasThisHelpful","R1TOGKBOIODX3M","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *Breaking Love by MJ Summers is book 2  in a series of stand- alones  called Full Hearts.There wasn't really that much given in book 1 about Luc so I had no urgent need to read more about him. However I am glad MJ wrote his story and I am glad I read it.What I loved most about this book is the character Megan. She's a single mom and she actually puts her son first! Megan tries to keep her relationship with Luc separate from her personal family life. It works for a little while because well life happens. Luc has a chance to be a knight in shining armor, tossing around his money and sweeping Megan off her feet but he doesn't do it in the traditional ways. Instead, once Luc realizes Megan is what he wants forever he helps her with her family which means more to Megan than flashing the  cash.As with any good story there has to be a villain. The only villain in Breaking Love is time and self preservation. Both Luc and Megan learn that while life might be tough, it's how you handle it, the choices you make that helps you become the person you are.I am looking forward to reading the other stories in this series as MJ Summers has me intrigued.3.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6R7NSWZQ238F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVJIZO4#wasThisHelpful","R6R7NSWZQ238F","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *I had the pleasure of reading PLAYING WITH FIRE by author Lexi Ryan. This is my first book by Ms. Ryan and certainly not my last. This novel came close to being my 1st 6 star rating for Summers Book Blog.The story begins with Dr Phoenix Nix Reed seeing a ghost of her past, a past she has been running from since her 17th birthday. Shaken, she almost had forgotten that Max Hallowell who has come over to fix her broken garage door. Once fixed, sparks ignite and they spend a hot, steamy, and passionate together.Trouble is Nix doesnt feel she is worth of a hot guys love. Her two previous loves marred her confidence in herself. So while Max tries to get closer, Nix is adamant of fighting her wants and running in the other direction.But when more incidents from the past start happening they are pushed together. Phone calls, a fire on her lawn, visits from her past friendly and unfriendly alike. This is an intense thriller/romance where Lexi Ryan hints to most being the antagonist.We even have a 2nd potential suitor in Cade, a cop from California. Who has interest in Nix. Much to the dismay of Max and her friends.When this book lost its 6th star was the ending. The climactic ending fell way short for me. It builds and builds till we are the point of the finally and then end chapter and its over. I think with a few more pages and action of the ending this would be one of the best books of the year.

"* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *Ruin and Rule is the first book in the Pure Corruption MC series.This book is  NOT a happily ever after...yet!

I was intrigued by Art aka Kill,  by what he could be hiding throughout the whole story. I also felt devastation and heart broken that two characters were so badly broken inside.

"**ARC provided for an honest review**Crossing the Line (Without a Trace Book 2) by Ally Bishop is the prequel to Inside the Lines (Book 1 in the Without a Trace Series). This is a story of finding love after great heartache with someone totally unexpected.I sometimes cringed when it comes to reading romance novels because of the ""insta-love"" factor. This isn't a problem in this book, which I greatly appreciated. There are plenty of hot, sexy scenes in this book like a certain bathroom adventure that takes place, but they do not take over the plot. There is plenty of non-sexy action taking place in between which I really enjoyed. This is not one of those books that rely solely on sex scenes.The main character, Ella is a young woman living in NYC with her brother Noah. Together they run a dinner mystery theater called Elementary. Ella is the mastermind behind the theater productions and her brother helps run the company along with being the star of the productions. A high profile attorney by the name of Ian Crane has booked an Elementary show for his birthday. Ian is handsome and totally not what Ella expected when she meets with him to discuss the details of the party. Ella and Ian spend a few hours together going over details of the party and during that time, they find that they have some things in common and things get ""steamy"". Down the line, they hit some bumps in the road and situations that were unknown come to light.Overall, this book was pretty good. The book is written well and although I felt some of Ella's inner thoughts were sometimes annoying I found her to be likable and real. The other characters, like Ian and Noah were also relate-able, although Noah is a bit on the promiscuous side, but what hot, young guy making it big in the city isn't? The one co-character, Lux (from book 1), seemed a little out there. She's a dominatrix in a relationship with a guy that's not really spoken about. She is however, a good friend to Ella and Noah and pops in every now and then throughout the book to offer a shoulder to lean on and/or advice. The romance is pretty believable and I found myself rooting for Ella and Ian throughout the story through their high points and more so during the low points.I give this book 3 stars, not because it is a bad read. It's a good read. The rating is mainly because of the time jump. I just felt that there was something to be desired in between that jump, like what happened with Ella and Ian during that time? What was Noah up to? What made Ella and Ian come to the decision they came to? Just a few things I want to know as a reader.I'm hoping there will be a book 3 and that it will be about Noah.  I'm curious to know more about him, what secrets he has and what the cause of his constant promiscuity was.Thank you Summer's Book Blog and author, Ally Bishop for giving me the opportunity to read Crossing the Line and offering my review.Written by Melissa for Summers Book Blog.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31OOT9J4BWFZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGC9T0E#wasThisHelpful","R31OOT9J4BWFZZ","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Writing (Poor, OK, Good, Great): GreatIs there violence (No, Some, Graphic): NoSexual content (None, Some, A lot): SomeNarration (first, second, third, alternating): Alternating* ARC provided by the author for an honest review *One Night With a Billionaire by Jessica Clare is the final novel in the Billionaire Boys Club Series and it is a perfect example of how Clares writing has only gotten better over time. Fans of the series have been waiting for this novel ever since the 3rd book in the series introduced Cade Archers life-long crush on Daphne Petty. Now that we have finally reached the point to hear Cades story, I am so incredibly happy to announce that his love interest is NOT spoiled, drama queen Daphne.One of the best things about this novel is how Clare forces Cade to recognize some harsh truths about who he truly is and the type of person he deserves to share his life with. Kylie is such a breath of fresh air and I honestly would have cried if Cade ended up staying in love with Daphne. Kylie is pleasant, witty, and entirely unaware of her own self-worthto the point that she allows Daphne to be openly cruel to her by sticking her with the nickname Fat Marilyn after claiming, You look like a fat Marilyn Monroe. Or Bettie Page. You know they dont like big butts here in L.A.  Despite Daphnes cruel behavior and selfish desires, Kylie truly considers Daphne a friend and tries to protect her from being hurt by Kylie and Cades blossoming relationship.Cade and Kylie both must overcome the challenges of their past in order to have a real opportunity to be together, but they are both stubborn enough to put up a good fight. I really love the dynamic between Cade and Kylie throughout the story. In the past, Cade has seemed a bit stuffy and almost nave when it comes to his judgement of others (namely Daphne). However, when he is with Kylie, Cade comes across as charming, fun, and attractive. He lets his guard down and is surprisingly down to earth.How much of this was the real Cade and how much was alcoholic silliness, she wondered? Either way, she loved it. She was having a blast. She usually wasnt ultra-playful in bed, being too self-conscious to really let her hair down. But how could she possibly be worried about how she looked when this drunk, heavenly man was pretending to strip for her, complete with burbled music?

"A Forever Kind of Love by Ellie Wade is the second and final book in the Choices series.  A Beautiful Kind of Love must be read prior to A Forever Kind of Love.A Forever Kind of Love is a continuation of Jax and Lilys story from A Beautiful Kind of Love, but is told from Jaxs perspective rather than Lilys.  You get Jaxs POV from when they were kids, teenagers, college students and to where we left off in A Beautiful Kind of Love.  So there is some repetition in events but with Jaxs thoughts and feelings.When Im with Lily, the cloud of stress that weighs on me like a heavy fog lifts, and I can finally breathe.  She makes everything okay, bringing me back to my center where the chaos sleeps and the peace lives.Excerpt from A Forever Kind of LoveLily and Jax have always been destined for each other.  As they both get older, they confirm that they are the one for each other.  They get torn apart, but their lifelong friendship means more to them than anything else.  They have both been there for each other when they have needed each other the most, regardless of how much they might have been hurt by the other.A true friend is one you can go extended periods without seeing or talking to, yet the moment you are back in touch, its like no time has passed at all.  I suppose that can be said for any real relationshipExcerpt from A Forever Kind of LoveI absolutely loved reading this book!  And after reading A Beautiful Kind of Love, I was dying to read the conclusion.  This book isnt just a love story; its a story of true, life-long friendship that only few people experience.  This book was amazing to read and so moving.  There were tears as I read parts and definitely a book hangover.Writing: AmazingIs there violence?

"Legacy by Stephanie Fournet is an amazing standalone novel. Legacy is the gripping story of Corinne who is deep in the midst of grief over the loss of her boyfriend.  Corinne isnt eating, interacting, working (shes an artist) or even sleeping well.  She is so grief-stricken that her family is deeply worried about her.Enter Wes, Corinnes boyfriends best friend.  Wes is everything that Corinne despises.  Hes a gym rat, constantly picking up women, lackadaisical, and just irresponsible, so she thinks.  Wes thinks Corinne is an uptight, stuck up snob who hates his guts, but he will honor his best friends request.Wes finally caught the desperate sadness he best friend felt about the prospect of losing his own life.But if I cant I need to know that you will look after her. Excerpt from LegacyWes ends up moving in to Corinnes and basically saves her from herself.  Wes imposes rules to help Corinne get through her grief basically.  She must eat, she must exercise, she must paint; tough loving her out of her grief coma.Of course, Corinne is resistant.  Wes is everything she doesnt want to like.  But she is able to accept his help over time and his guidance to making it through her grief.  Maybe its because he isnt her family and isnt willing to let her fail or say no or get buried by grief.  Either way, Wes is that friend all of us need in the darkest of hours and want to celebrate with on the highest of highs.This book is a HEA that is written from the third person POV.  There are so many heart-wrenching emotions in this book and it just gives you the feels!  Anyone who has experienced loss knows exactly how Corinne feels and can identify with her or unrequited love will identify with it also.  You can almost see Corinne go through the stages of grief as the book progresses.

"Everly by SM Shade is the first book of the Striking Back series ending on a cliffhanger that leaves you slack jawed and scratching your head.Writing (Good)Is there violence (Some)Sexual content (Some)Narration (first)Everly is sassy, outspoken, and nurturing. Due to her time in foster care she has learned to take care of herself and developed into the stubborn and independent woman that she is today. Her time in foster care definitely warped her outlook on herself and relationships. She knows she's not ugly, but she doesn't see herself as anything special. She knows people don't stick around, so she avoids relationships. That is until Mason Reed waltzes into her life at one of the most bizarre and terrifying moments of her life, seeing her beauty and proving that he wants to stay.Mason is possessive, demanding, and growly. Alpha to the max, charming as sin, and sometimes over the top. With his muscles and tats he's eye candy perfection. But he's more than what meets the eye. He's caring and sweet, protective and loving. He's everything Everly didn't know she was looking for, and Mason is out to prove he's all she needs.Can Everly move on from her broken past and trust Mason wholeheartedly? Can she allow him into her heart as well as her bed? Will Mason open up and break down his own barriers to reveal his past? Or will their pasts and unspoken truths rip them apart?Everly is witty and charming. It had me laughing out loud at times. It was also shocking and nerve wracking. Mason had me swooning and lusting like mad. Bossy and protective and possessive. Everly' stubbornness had me banging my head at times, but she won me over with her one liners and feisty attitude.The whole bank scene had me scratching my head. Because I should have been scared for them, but I couldn't help but giggle at the situation and swoon over Mason. All the while hoping everyone is okay. It was an odd mash up, but worked so well.SM Shade has a winner on their hands. Witty, sassy, shocking, sexy, and sinful. A perfect combination to keep me on the edge of my seat waiting for answers and for what was going to happen next. And that ending? Never in my wildest dreams did I think that's how Everly would end. I was left with my jaw on the floor, desperately swiping over, hoping ""The End"" wasn't really the end...but it was! I cannot wait for answers in Mason, which is the sequel.Written by Alycia for Summers Book Blog","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YYOXT00COHOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEVPO5G#wasThisHelpful","R2YYOXT00COHOR","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**ARC provided for an honest review**This book is a must read for 2015Clarissa has done it again with this book ""this book has a dark, twisted, disturbing and yet extremely captivating and engrossing tale about love, betrayal, hurt and sacrifice.""The Mind games these two play are of the highest caliber. Vanessa and Miles came from messed up backgrounds. Miles didnt have a chance, he was abandoned, didnt have good foster parents, and the children around him bullied him. Vanessas mother was evil and at every turn was trying to make Vanessa into the spitting image of herself or a doll. Vanessa is very naive and broken. She doesn't know how to stand up for herself and lets everyone walk all over her.Vanessa liked Miles from the beginning and she fell for him hard when he beat the crap out of a boy for bullying Vanessa. She was scared but thrilled at the same time.Miles became Phoenix when he became a hitman. He killed and he got a thrill out of it too. He had no remorse and thrived on killing people for a pay check.I love how Clarissa goes back and forth from past to present. We get glimpses of the past where Vanessa and Miles (Phoenix) didnt always hate each other, and we get to see what happens when their love turns to hatred.Does Phoenix (Miles) end up getting his revenge that he has been after for years? Will we see the demise of Vanessa? Or will Phoenix have a change of heart when he finds out some of the truths that will unfold.Phoenix wants to get revenge on Vanessa when he got out of jail and he wasn't going to hold anything back. He was going to mistreat her, and make her suffer before he killed her.Vanessa knows that the day will come when Phoenix would come looking for her and she was scared because she knew that he wanted revenge.You will just have to read the book to find out I highly recommend this bookWritten by Tracy for Summers Book Blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B46NK0P6097U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZDFRSS4#wasThisHelpful","R2B46NK0P6097U","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**ARC provided for an honest review**Whispered Truths is the first book in the (Truths) series.  It is slated as a contemporary romance, but after reading it, it is definitely YA, with a little bit more maturity.  This book is about love, loss and friendships that can withstand anything.I found myself so enthralled in this book from the first few paragraphs. Myah Wilks has had a crush on her longtime friend and hottie of her school since the third grade. She does not think that there would ever be a chance for them to be together, but when suddenly he starts showing up in her same classes, she thinks quite possibly, there might be a chance he feels the same way.Kyle Cooper has secretly been half in love with Myah for as long as he can remember, but something is a bit off with her. She is not the same spunky girl she used to be, something has happened to her and he does not know what it is. Seeing other people to mask their feelings seems to work until they are paired up with each other for a project that these feelings can no longer stay hidden. But with Myah' s less than desirable home life she has trust issues and has walls built around her that only her closest friends , Lisa, Sarah and Stewie know the reasons why.Well Kyle's finally had enough of waiting around for Myah to realize that they have something special he goes after her head on. While Myah is going through struggles with her evil mother, Kyle steps in, with the help of her friends to be her protector. Their love story is one that fairytales are made of. In addition, their first time together, OMG I was swooning over Kyle Cooper. The love and tenderness in that scene was so amazing.This book does have a bit of suspense, a little angst and the sexual encounters with Myah and Kyle were very tastefully done. These are a great group of friends and I am looking forward to the continuation of their stories in the series.This was a very enjoyable read and something the YA will definitely want to read. I have given this book a four star rating.Written by Laura for Summers Book Blog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXUZA2P1C5GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE2402I#wasThisHelpful","R3OXUZA2P1C5GH","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**ARC provided for an honest review**Wild Pitch by Sloan Johnson is the first book in the Homeruns series. What if dreams are meant to change?, the tag line for the book sums it up nicely. Both Sean Tucker and Mason Atley dreamed of being professional baseball players. Both working their way up through the ranks in the farm system into the majors. A friendship forged with trust, dedication and love. Even playing for opposing teams their friendship never dwindled.Both however have their secrets. For years Sean has only admitted his sexuality to Mason, the one thing he never told him was his true feelings towards Mason. Sean has never told his team mates he is gay, knowing some may not approve. He has kept his secret well hidden, until one night when Mason tells Sean his secret. He is bisexual. He married The Ice Queen to try to live a normal life. He wanted the wife, kids and everything else that came with it. Unfortunately, his long absences caused one too many problems.Mason, finally able to admit his true feelings to Sean opens up a whole new world of sexual tensions between the pair. Not wanting to ruin their friendship, Sean tries to convince Mason to take it slow. Refusing to go too far whilst he is still married, always making sure this is what Mason really wants. Neither want to risk their friendship on a one night stand.The pair try to keep their relationship secret, but secrets have a way of coming out (no pun intended). Some start to notice small things, which leads to finding other hiding similar secrets. The couple need to find a way to be together whilst playing on separate teams, leaving each other apart for potentially months at a time. Can a relationship withstand that?This is the first book I have read by Sloan Johnson and I must say I really enjoyed it. The characters where definitely loveable, right down to Masons parents and Seans sister. There are quite a few comical moments throughout the book, adding to the seriousness of the couples tense circumstances. It was a book that kept me wanting more right till the end, even then I wanted to know what happened next. I look forward to reading other books by this author.Written by Joanna for Summers Book Blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGK6FPQ27E36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZGYBGCQ#wasThisHelpful","RBGK6FPQ27E36","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**ARC provided for an honest review**Unforgettable (Beachwood Bay #8) by Melody Grace picks up where the novella Unmasked ended. This finishes Noelle Olsen and Ash Callahan story.Following her night with Ash, Noelle disappears into the night leaving a sleeping Ash with only her phone number. Neither had any expectations of going any further than this one special night they shared.Listen to your heart, believe in a brighter tomorrow, and always, always leave room for dessert, the final words from her beloved grandmother.Noelle, the normally level headed lawyer ups and leaves everything behind in the city to return to the bed and breakfast her grandmother loved so much. Her parents have much to say about this complete turn in her life, but she finally finds a peace that has always been missing from her hectic life. Always aiming to please everyone around her, Noelle has put what she really wants to one side. Following her night with Ash she decides to finally do what feels right to her, not everyone else. This means moving to the small coastal town of Beachwood Bay.Believing they would never cross paths again, Ash visits his family and friends for a much needed vacation from work. Never did he think he would run into the one woman he hasnt been able to get out of his mind. When his personal life and work collide Ash has to choose which one he needs the most.The pair definitely have chemistry crackling between them, it is there from the start. Neither of them really know anything about the other. Ash doesnt trust easily, he worked his whole life for his family, he has never done anything solely for himself. Can his siblings make him see that he now needs to take this opportunity do make himself happy and that his life should not evolve around his real-estate business?This seems to be the concluding part of the Beachwood Bay series. It is a sweet romance with a few bumps in the road causing the main characters a few problems along the way. I really liked how it allowed readers to catch up with all the other couples featured earlier in the series. It gave a nice yet finality to the series. This can be read as a standalone, but it would help to piece together how the other couples came together in previous books, but it is not necessary.Written by Joanna for Summers Book Blog.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN0TLLY2XM5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UG7VIF8#wasThisHelpful","RNN0TLLY2XM5S","A32EUN2MXY9FHT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32EUN2MXY9FHT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love history and I love science, so when I was offered a chance to try this bulb for an honest review, I jumped at the chance! See, waaaay back when electricity was Brand-New and only the Rich and Innovative People could afford it, lamps were designed to FEATURE the bare bulbs...they were NEVER hidden! It was only when we began to take electricity for granted and light bulbs became mundane, that we began to ""hide them"" under lamp shades. THIS bulb brings back the Magic and Excitement of the Dawn of the Electric Age by putting a bare bulb front and center again.I had a Candlestick lamp base that I use a Flickering Flame Bulb inside of during the holiday, so I had the absolutely perfect display base to display this bulb. And 'Oh!"", how gorgeous it is! Many other reviewers have mentioned the ""chandelier effect"" and that is the most accurate way to describe this marvel of science and technology: it simply glows like a bottle of captured fireflies! The bulb itself is larger than a regular light bulb but I figure that ""How Else?"" could you get all that beauty into a normal sized bulb?Unlike the original tungsten filament bulb, this is a Cool Touch LED bulb so it is miserly in consuming power yet brilliant in concept. The glow is gentle and enjoyable; you won't be getting ""sunspots"" in your eyes from enjoying it.I find it so wonderful that companies are marrying the coolest features of our technological past with the coolest features of our technological present. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IP7HTRMXOH1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01545WAFS#wasThisHelpful","R3IP7HTRMXOH1X","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hobby is cooking so my kitchen is my sanctuary. NOTHING goes into my Inner Sanctum that doesn't delight, entertain or tell a story about who I am. When I was offered the chance to order this clock and given the opportunity to choose my own colour (stainless), I instantly knew that I had another decorative chapter to the story of my life.I was a bit worried, before it arrived, that it would be TOO LARGE and take over the small wall that it's displayed upon. But, once I received it, the clock is the perfect size: not too big, not too small...it's absolutely ""Just Right!"" I delight in the true-to-life sized utensils and two things in particular make me smile: it has Serving Pieces along with regular Flatware...and...the hands of the clock are a wee knife and fork! THAT is the feature that blew me away the most...the extreme attention to detail is a sure sign of a company that cares deeply about their products.I took the photos of the clock outdoors, so that you could see the highly reflective surface and details of the utensils. It's well constructed, not flimsy in the least, and has a hook on the back for easy display. AA batteries are required to power it up.I've seen other Utensil clocks but have passed on them because they were so boring: just regular flatware and regular hands on the dial.

"This combination set of lenses from RIVBOS is such a great deal! I've already ordered another set for a present for a landscaping friend of mine and this set is going to be used by my outdoor-enthusiast son. If you are active outdoors, you quickly learn that one type of sunglasses does NOT work for an entire day outside! I personally have FIVE pairs of sunglasses cluttering up the dashboard of my truck, to be used in bright sunlight, bright fog, cloudy but bright days, and some just to look foxy. This kit could reduce all that mess into one sleek hard-shell case! I only wish that they made a more ""fashion-forward"" design for women that wasn't so sporty looking.The kit  comes with an beautiful hard case that has an easy to grab textured surface. Inside, it holds the glasses frame and the 4 spare shades, as well as a soft pouch wherein you can carry the glasses around. Theirs room inside for also also  a lanyard, microfiber cleaning cloth and a booklet which talks about under what conditions you would want to use the different lenses, the percentage of light they let in..etc.The lens change out is super easy: pull one off the frame, push the new one into the frame. You do get fingerprints on the lens while changing them out, so it is handy to have that cleaning cloth handy. I like the Half Moon design of the hard-shell case because it easily fits into a fanny pack on the back of your bike seat.  This is a GREAT DEAL and would make a wonderful gift for an outdoor enthusiast.

"I'm old. And I have a very physically demanding job that tuckers out ""kids"" half or more my age. I'm a landscape architect and in one day, I can help load, unload and spread 200 forty pound bags of mulch for a single job! And, that doesn't include the weeding, digging,  planting, and watering that is all part of a single installation! So, at the end of a normal work day, I am barely able to move and have a bottle of Advil stationed everywhere: work bag, glove box, medicine cabinet and by the kitchen sink. I know the health risks of not only over-dosing on pain relieving pills but also just the mere fact of taking the minimum per day wears out your organs.So, what to do regarding painful muscles and the desire to ease that pain? THIS massage unit! It came completely dissembled but I got it up and working (without reading a single direction) in 5 minutes flat. The plastic massage balls were a wee bit difficult to get started in the pre-formed holes but that's normal when you are screwing plastic into plastic; at least that's been my experience when I'm constructing plastic items that need to be screwed together. There is a rope on one end that you hold onto while holding the other end of the wand with your other hand; you position the massage balls over your hurting area and then gently pull the cord back and forth to create the massaging action.This is a very light weight wand and easy to hold for an extended length of time, but not ""light"" as in cheap. I mainly use it on my shoulders and lower back and the relief is fantastic...and drug free!  What I also appreciated is the four different hole positions on each side of the bendy wand so that you can truly customize where you place the massage balls.This is a nice unit that comes un-scewed so that you can easily travel with it in your carry on luggage. I'm very pleased with this pain relieving massager. :DI received a sample device for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZKNGGQIO348/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XYIZN2U#wasThisHelpful","R1QZKNGGQIO348","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of those rare women who HATE carrying around a purse all day long, with everything falling into a Black Hole Pit at the bottom. I'm a landscape architect by trade and maybe that's why I love my business and personal life to be exceptionally well organized. What I use as a ""purse"" during the day is a Coach Messenger bag with loads and loads of specific pockets to keep things instantly at my Beck and Call.This highly functional and exceptionally well designed Slim Credit card wallet fits right into my lifestyle! I ordered the colour listed as ""Orange"" but please note: IT IS NOT ORANGE as you and I think of the colour ""orange"". Do a google search for the colour ""Burnt Sienna"" and THAT is the true colour of this wallet.For the man or woman on the go who pays with debit or credit cards and only needs a *pinch* of Mad Money, this is perfect! The cards fit nice and securely in the slots and the interior can hold a couple of $20.00's for places that don't accept cards (lots of Mom and Pop cafes are Cash Only). This can slide into the tiniest of clutches and keep your cards safe. It's also just the right side to slide into one of those ultra-thin passport holders that goes around your neck.The stitching is superior; not a slipped stitch or nick, anywhere! It's true leather, in a pebbled finish and the little logo is an elephant with Dumbo-sized ears...very cute.If you are a Secret Santa and don't know what to get that guy or gal, or you need to supplement a Stocking Stuffer or slip a little ""something extra into a birthday card"", I can't think of a better way to impress your friends with a functional yet stylish gift.There are already such nice photos of the product that I chose to not take any more; I couldn't have added anything to the pictures. :D*I received this fine wallet for an honest review, good or bad.

"This is the second type of Moscow Mule Mug that I was selected to review by Livin' Well. The first set was the Hammered Pure Copper Mugs and we are absolutely in love with them! I did a considerable amount of online research to see what drinking out of pure copper would do to your body and with different drinks; if you restrict the amount of acid in your drink (no sodas or citrus-heavy drinks) than you're ""Good To Go.""However, there may be a lot of people that still feel concerned or squeamish about any possible negative reaction with an acidic drink, or they simply like the looks and ease of a Stainless Steel interior. Than for those folks, THIS is the mug for you!I put this version of the mug through the same rigid tests that I did the pure copper mug:(Side-note: I used to be the China/Crystal/Fine Bar Ware Buyer for Dayton's, back in it's heydays. As such, I know the EXCEEDINGLY STRICT guidelines that I had to put all future purchases through, before they made it onto our sales floor.)Two such tests that apply HERE are:1) The Balance Test: how does a knife/fork/mug/stemware hold up to being handled? Does it have GREAT balance or does the item want to immediately fall from your hands? If there is a handle, how is it joined to the main body of the item? Is the handle comfortable to hold?2) The Lip Test: how enjoyable...or not...is it to drink from that champagne glass? or mug? or other item designed for beverage delivery? Do you smack your nose each time you lift it up to your lips? Is there poor finishing involved on the lip of the beverage holder? How does it hold? Does it want to tip over when full? Do liquids dribble down the side?The mug arrived beautifully wrapped in bubble wrap, in it's own box.It is literally ""A Thing of Beauty."" It's very, very evident that Saint Jacques cares deeply about their product and wants YOUR business! The finishing on the pure copper mug was impeccable; not a scratch, dent or nick to mar their reflective beauty. The handle ""handled"" well, passing the Balance Test while empty and now it was time to pass ""The Lip Test"". (after washing it in warm-sudsy water and towel drying) In my photo, I took a side-by-side photo of the plain finish mug vs the hammered mug and you can see that the light dances off of and plays with the pattern of the hammering. If this is important to you or you are going to be serving your Mules outdoors where the light is brighter, this might be a consideration in which set to order.Perfection! I first drank water, simply because it's 'free'. No nose knocking. No dripping liquids slipping down the side. Handle was beautifully balanced with a Oh-So-Handy and comfortable spot for your thumb to rest on the lowered part of the handle, next to the mug. Now, it was time to ""Kick The Mule!"" and test it for what it was designed for.After mixing the ingredients, I let the mug get cold, and silver condensation soon cloaked the outside. I drank a sip and the *tingle* that I received must surely be through some Mad Science Alchemy of Copper being a super conductor of cold + acid. What.A.Pleasure.!!! It passed with FLYING COLOURS!!! I can only imagine how deliciously Satyr-like one must feel to have this drink, on a blisteringly hot day, and drift away into another realm. Sadly, I tested mine out on a blustery 42 degree day with drizzle. LOL I still enjoyed the ""Mule's Kick"", however.I received a matched set of the pure copper mugs for a fair and honest review, of which this is. It was an honour and pleasure to try out this well-crafted and heirloom worthy mug.Here lies the recipe: (please note: NOWHERE in my hamlet was alcoholic ginger beer sold, so I had to make do. It still was sublime!)As the traditional Moscow Mule recipe suggest the liquid ingredients are:1/2 ounce lime juice2 ounces vodka4 to 6 ounces ginger beerTotal amount will be 7-9 ounces plus 1/3-1/2 cup of ice cubes. A typical Moscow Mule is about 14 16 ounces. So any copper mug less than 12 ounces or too more than 20 ounces is not adequate for a Classic Moscow Mule recipe. I suggest anyone who wants it get a copper mug with a volume between 16-20 ounce.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KMKM0FC7YZL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FM73IE#wasThisHelpful","R1KMKM0FC7YZL2","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read most of the reviews before I wrote mine, just to judge how other kitty cats responded to this nice stand. It seems that older or adult cats are ambivalent but for my Norwegian Forest KITTENS, they went !Bonkers! over it!  If you've ever seen or known a Norwegian Forest Cat, they are STRONG CLIMBERS with specially adapted claws for fast and strong climbing. I watch the TV show with Jackson Galaxy, ""My Cat From Hell"", and one thing I learned is that there's 2 kinds of cats: 1) Hiders/Creepers and 2) Climbers. My kittens and Mama cat C.L.I.M.B.!!!  I also took a *tip* from a friend who is a cat breeder and I rubbed a small bag of dried catnip into the entire surface...what cat/kitten can resist THAT temptation?!I currently have four kittens almost ready for adoption and this stand has been a God Send. They climb, jump, and clamor over the entire surface and have become so aggressive with hanging from the dangling balls that they've actually ripped two of them from the rods! I'm cool with that as I simply made sturdier ""dangly bits"" and tied them to the end of the rods.Regarding the rotating scratching cylinder, they like to lay on their sides and kick it with their back feet, pulling themselves forward. And it's guaranteed hours of humourous kitten watching as each one of them tries to become ""King/Queen of the Hill"" by claiming the two perches and shoving their competition off of it.It was super fast to put together and I appreciated that they enclosed an Allen Wrench with the kit to make it easier to assemble. So far, they haven't tipped it over but they are young kittens, not heavy adult cats, so it is sturdy for it's current use. The Mama cat seems less interested in the stand but she keeps a watchful eye on them as they are enjoying it. Honestly, I think she's like any Mum who takes her tykes to a play park; using this time to relax and catch her breath from all that Kitten Care.For the price and the footprint, this is a VERY NICE and highly affordable stand what would work with most people's pocket books and would fit in even a small studio apartment. >^..^<","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQBGMI4HG66LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY2531M#wasThisHelpful","RQBGMI4HG66LO","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though our Jack Russell Terrier is young, I still ordered this to not only augment his regular Eukanuba kibble but also to ""Test The Waters"" and see if he'd even like a ""Senior Dog Food"", which our cat's turn their nose up at (senior cat food, that is).Happily, this blend also met with his instant gratification so we're happy that we can tick that worry off of our list with good doggy care in the future. We plan on just switching his kibble between regular and senior every other day to keep him fit, trim and also use to the taste. I like that the kibble is small for his tiny mouth and that it doesn't fly all over the floor as some brands of kibble seem to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BK6OCLXJRZ89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000633U58#wasThisHelpful","R1BK6OCLXJRZ89","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a handicapped neighbor who has great difficulty bringing her large pit bull to the vet for check ups, so I always volunteer to help her. The problem was, she only had super long and thin leashes so it was an exercise in futility to get ""Chico"" into the car as he wound around and around our legs, under the truck's carriage, or just reeling him in off of this long leash.I intentionally ordered THIS leash from other reviews that mentioned how handy it was to have a VERY STURDY and short lead to load dogs into the car, etc. We keep Chico on this leash during the entire vet visit because my friend has such bad R.A. in her hands; it helps her hold him and calm him down simultaneously. We also started to use it when we bring Chico to the groomers to get his ears cleaned and nails clipped. The groomer was very impressed with the quality and strength of this short lead leash.I'm happy that some dog lover invented this very necessary addition to standard leads and leashes. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VHVPT6MP08JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGU4MI#wasThisHelpful","R2VHVPT6MP08JM","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love my pets like most people who dote on them but I also love paying my mortgage and car payment on time. I already buy healthy and pricey cat and dog food for my Fur Babies and don't deny them special treats but at an astronomical price of at $4.60 cents a piece, these treats are utterly un-affordable for most people. I have a small Jack Russell Terrier and the package recommends that you can break the 3 part treat into 3 smaller pieces, I guess to save money. But, like many others have mentioned, the broken pieces are SO small and dogs are wont to ""inhale"" their food, that I was terrified of having him choke on the small hard piece.So, I gifted him an entire 3-point Nutri Dent, which he tossed around like a stuffed toy for a bit, and then consumed the entire thing in 5 minutes, flat!  All I could think of was how long it took my minimum wage friends to earn $4.60...literally a half hour of their life...gobbled down in 5 minutes! I love that my dog loved the treat but I can't justify the cost. Instead, I'd rather buy a whole fryer for that amount of money, put it into a pot for a couple of hours time, and come out with several natural ""treats"" and meals for my spunky pup, including the broth.Nice idea but this is a Rich Person's Indulgence for their pet. :(","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDPO5XWJIL3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH4LRK#wasThisHelpful","RKDPO5XWJIL3N","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I travel each week and stay at motels 3-4 days of each week. To save money and make my life a wee bit easier, I stay at budget motels and part of that ""budget"" paradigm is that there's ZERO FRILLS that come with the places I stay at. That means NO COFFEE MAKERS, among other niceties, so I just bring my ancient 12 year old Mr. Coffee Maker with me and *bingo-bango*... coffee brewed right in my room, first thing when I wake up.I bring ground coffee with me but there are times that I ache for FRESHLY ground coffee...there's just NO comparison between coffee that's been pre-ground and sitting around in a can vs. beans that you grind and within a minute, add to your coffee basket for a nice, hot brew.So, when I was offered the chance to try out this Off The Grid/Personal-Sized Hand Coffee Mill, I jumped at the chance to be able to enjoy freshly ground coffee while On The Road.When it arrived, it's in a nicely illustrated box that show & tells you about the product and how to set it up. Inside, the two main units: the handle and the coffee container, are each cocooned in plastic bubble wrap, preventing any and all scratches. (see my photos for size and components; soda can is for perspective) The main canister breaks down into 3 parts: the lid with the hole in it, that fits over the bean hopper; the bean hopper itself where you load up the beans; and the canister at the bottom with TWO handy ""see-through-windows"" on the sides, to gauge your ground bean progress. The handle makes up the 4th part, which is separate from the main body.I had NO problem taking the parts apart and getting them ready for a TEST GRIND, giving everything a nice wash in sudsy water and then wiping them down well so they were bone dry. Prior to grinding, I took the Scientific Route and measured out just ""how many ounces of ground coffee"" I normally put into my brew basket: it came to 4.5 dry ounces, so that was my identical target with the grind.I then measured out 4 dry ounces of French Roast beans into an empty paper filter, and used the filter as a ""funnel"" to fill the bean chamber: BRILLIANT...it worked like a charm with nary a bean spilled. Mind you, because of the grinding apparatus, the hopper only could hold TWO of the FOUR ounces of beans, so I had to do two grinds.I proceeded to begin turning the handle on the grinder, with it placed on the counter.Within seconds, I realized that I needed far more leverage than what the counter would provide so I sat on the couch, placed the main body of the grinder between my thighs, held the grinder body steady with my left hand and began to crank away, at a  rotation of 1 crank per second. It was a very leisurely crank, as I knew that would be my ""norm"".Soon, I could ~smell~ the beans!!!! Oh, what joy! I stopped grinding, opened up the bottom hopper and the most lovely of lovely coffee grounds were encased inside: smelling like Heaven on the best day! The grind that the mill was pre-set on was a very fine espresso grind and I just kept it there for the experiment.  It took 2.5 minutes of leisure grinding to complete the first of two 2 ounce fills of the bean hopper; after I dumped the filled grounds hopper into my paper filter, I refilled the top immediately with the remaining 2 dry ounces of beans and kept on doing ""the daily grind."" Within 2.5 more minutes, I was done.I then proceeded to brew up that coffee to see if it really differed from pre-ground to hand-ground. Oh, and did it deliver!!! I can FINALLY now have freshly ground and brewed coffee in my motel room any time that I want to commit 5 minutes to loading/grinding/re-loading and doing the final grind. Clean up was a snap as I only washed the ground hopper and used my blow dryer to blow out the bean hopper. The website suggest cleaning the entire thing weekly; I don't know if I'd go that far, as I think a Once A Month deep clean/wash/dry would suffice.The weight is very light but NOT cheap nor chintzy, so you can pack this in luggage or a brief case and not feel much added weight at all. It is VERY well constructed and aside from the noise associated with the ground beans, there is NO other squeak-squawk-or noise. The handle slips on very well to the cog that extends from the grinder and NEVER slipped off or even hesitated. This is one exceedingly well made coffee mill!Who would this be perfect for? College students. Coffee purists who want a GREAT cuppa, at work. Hunters.  like me. Back Packers. And the list goes on and on and on.I was offered this mill for free, to try it out and provide a fair and very honest review. It surpassed ALL expectations and if I had not received a sample, I would have bought it outright! A thoughtful gift for your Coffee Addict Friend, with a bag o' beans provided, of course!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FRMQB9KW49P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01566G0M4#wasThisHelpful","R18FRMQB9KW49P","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really surprised over the harsh reviews of this book! Wow, talk about a Buzz Kill, which is just the OPPOSITE of what you think when you hear the word ""Disney"". The #1 complaint that I've read is that it ""...doesn't have Anna or Elsa"". Oh, Boo-F'ing-Who!!!! Seriously, Folks??? If you are any kind of on-line shopper and can READ (thanks to a 3rd grade education), you can see from both the product's description and the photos ON THE COVER, that Anna/Elsa/Frozen is NOT part of this book! What ""is"" part of this book are the following: Aladdin, Disney Princesses, Toy Story, Mickey and Minnie, Monsters, Inc., Wreck-it Ralph, Planes, and Captain Hook. The ""Frozen"" franchise has it's own separate book; it would be interesting to read reviews of that one to see if anyone's complaining that Minnie or Aladdin aren't included?I knew EXACTLY what I was ordering when I read the product description and took advantage of the ""Look Inside"" option that amazon provides. A book that describes ""party suggestions"" is naturally going to be Craft-Conscious and also have loads of projects, of which this book does, in aces! You can choose from the simplest skill set of gluing a jewel onto a ribbon to look like Jasmine, to creating a GIANT pinata that looks like a building for a Wreck-It-Ralph party. Instructions are super simple; no, there are no step-by-step photos but again, if you can READ, you can clearly create each project.Recipes are pretty simple and straight forward: my two favourites are the Cut-Out Pita Animals and the Skull Watermelon. There are some that are more complicated and if you have both the time and skill set, you're sure to be pleased with the outcome.BUY THIS BOOK if you like Disney characters, Disney characters featured on the cover and have ANY kind of craft talent, at all. And for some of the simpler recipes, get your kids involved in making a Theme Day, which is what I'm using this book for: to entertain my wee ones when they come over for a visit. I'm NOT limiting this book to birthday parties; it's too cool for a Once A Year Event. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGOT0CEA0YLA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940787041#wasThisHelpful","RGOT0CEA0YLA8","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since the invention of the Smartphone/Tablet, many items that we used to use every.single.day. are now relegated to the ""dust bin"" of life. Items such as independent digital cameras, alarm clocks, analog phone, transistor radio....even a wrist watch....are now part and parcel of your average Tech Device. But, like many other people have discovered, having those ""independent items"" to use, divorced from your power hungry Smartphone and it's chronically drained battery is a Good Thing to re-embrace.I'm one of those people.I travel for a living as a landscape architect. Four days out of each week I live out of motels so that I can design/consult/and install landscapes around the Midwest. After years traveling and gleefully ""dumping"" all that stuff and weight of that stuff, I'm slowly adding back INTO my suitcase some items that just make far more sense to have around then constantly relying on my Smartphone.One of those things is a normal/regular/""plain ol' alarm clock"". I ordered mine in the zippy and fun Turquoise Colour; I suffer from ""Black-Tech Overload"" and was delighted that this clock came in so many colour options. Size-wise, it's about the size of a can of soda but weighs far less, making it easy to carry about in your luggage.There are SO many features of this clock that I LOVE:1) ""Just Right Size"": not too big/not too wee/ not too heavy...like Goldilock's and her bed, it was ""just right"".2) LARGE FRICKIN' NUMBERS!!! My eyes are old, so having large numbers that I can read without fumbling for my glasses at night is a bonus! There's the option to have either a 12 or 24 hour time display.3) It's NOT ""just"" a clock but also tells you the date/year/temperature (in F or C) and the posted alarm time, not just a silly ""bell"" icon like smartphones use.4) Set Up is brainless! A very detailed and thorough Instructions Manual comes with the clock but I didn't have to open it up to set the entire clock; I only read through the manual to write this review. As some people have mentioned, the clock doesn't allow you to ""go back"" if you're a heavy handed programmer; you WILL have to cycle through 60 minutes or 100 years if you blow past the number. I blasted past the minute set-up by not paying attention and had NO PROBLEM going through the minutes to find the one I needed. I sure don't fault the clock for my lack of attention span.5) I also REALLY LIKE that this clock takes normal batteries, meaning, ""NO CHARGING VIA A USB MICRO CABLE!"" I am already drowning in cables and devices that DEMAND to be charged via a port...I literally can't handle one.more.thing. that is tied to cables. I get around the Environmental Concern by only buying batteries that can be recharged to avoid filling up landfills; I'm guessing that the power drain from this clock is minimal and will only need recharging once a month.6) Alarm sound: It starts out with 1 beep, then builds up to 2 beeps and then it increases in pattern and intensity. I am a light sleeper so in the first couple of seconds, I'm awake and reach for the clock to flip UP the bar that shuts off the alarm. The SNOOZE cycle is every 5 minutes; I tested it out for 30 minutes and it was accurate in coming back up to cycle.7) I intentionally have the Low Light Sensor set up because I wake up several times a night from an ancient back injury and check the clock each time to see when I can take my next pill to counteract the pain I live with. When I used my smartphone, I was always fumbling for it's small/flat size, often dropping it under the bed, or ""compelled"" to check emails/alerts...breaking up my sleep cycle even more. I'm an Adult and I know better than to check emails at 2:30 am; now, this Low Tech Clock keeps me away from them and sends me right back to sleep.This clock is a Win/Win for so many reasons: light weight/does the job/very affordable/pretty colour range. In ""The Old Days"", you could walk into ANY retail store and pick one of these up; nowadays, merchants have forced us consumers to shop on line for what we need. I'm just glad that ZHPUAT listens to it's audience and provides us with a device still sorely needed in today's high tech world. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R329KH39YH2UKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7LFCRA#wasThisHelpful","R329KH39YH2UKC","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unless you travel around with a backpack or duffle bag, this is NOT going to work for you to carry around with you in your average bag/brief case. This is the kind of case that you either leave in your truck/car or at home, and make the right decisions at the start of the day as to ""which"" lens/accessory you need. However, if you are going camping/backpacking, there is a very sturdy clip on the side, whereby you can attach the case to the exterior of your pack.

Well, I don't know if I was being 'punked' or not, but I viewed the card through ALL of the lenses and saw NUTTIN'. Guess I flunked THAT test. LOLChanging them out is a piece of cake: simply slide down the lens in the sun-glass frame and slide up another lens. I used my fingers to get a better/solid grip and then used the lens cloth to remove any smudges. Each lens comes enclosed in a reusable plastic baggie.I work outdoors for a living so I rely on good lenses to keep my eyes healthy. But, in a 10 hour work day, weather conditions can change, A LOT, so having one pair of glasses to change with the hours never works out well. I love that I can finally wear the same frames all day long, and change from a yellow lens for rainy/foggy conditions, to a clear one for protecting my eyes from dust when using the leaf blower, to the polarized lens when the sun finally makes a roaring come-back later in the day. The frames are REALLY comfortable: the temple bars hold them nicely to your head (I have a very large head for a chick!) and the nose piece does NOT leave those ugly ""nose dents"" that cheaper glasses are wont to do.Price-wise: I don't know how they do it! The case alone should be the price of this entire ensemble; instead, you receive the case, the 5 lenses, the frame, a dust cloth, lanyard to attach to the frame and the motion headgear. If you need an IMPRESSIVE gift for a man or woman who spends a lot of time enjoying the outdoors, you can NOT go wrong with this set! RIVBOS really cares not only about their customer's well-being but also the well-being of their product: the case has actual slots in soft foam to make sure that they are stored safely.All my adult kids are Outdoor Nuts and I already know what I'm ordering them for their Stocking Stuffer: THESE glasses! I don't know what else you can buy for under $20 that provides so much *bang* for your hard-earned buck!I was offered the chance to receive these glasses in exchange for a fair and honest review.

"I'll gladly admit it: I LOVE DISCO! I was a young bride when it roared onto the scene in the late 70's with ""Saturday Night Fever"" bringing it to the national forefront. Living in Chicago, my husband and I danced the night away at the many discos on Rush, Oak and State Street...man, that was some kind of fun!So, I jumped at the chance to Bring Back The Magic with this incredibly affordable ""Pocket Sized Disco Light"", although it's branded as a Sunflower Light, which it does resemble, in a Tech Way.The light arrived like something 'naughty' used to: In a plain brown envelope in a plain brown box. No instructions. Nuttin'! However, if you read any reviews prior to ordering this, you'd already know that it's pretty Low Tech: plug it in, provide a music source and that's it. There is a channel under the light so that you can snake the power cord through it, so that it lays flat.So, that's what I did: plugged it into an outlet in a pitch dark room, queued up Pandora to my Disco Station and let the magic happen! When initially plugged in, prior to having music, it does it's thing of flashing lights, but really excels when tunes are provided. I had a lot of fun seeing what the light sequences were like to different types of music: Disco/Big Band/Ruth Brown/Michael Jackson, and then Classical Christmas! I must say: DON'T JUST USE THIS FOR DISCO PARTIES!!!! Try it out on any Christmas Station that you have and it will be guaranteed to ADD to the festive fun and festival of lights that we associate with the holidays. I actually found that the Christmas setting was my favourite because I wasn't expecting the lights to respond so well to slower tunes; you should see what it does to the Nutcracker Suite! I'm certainly going to be using this coloured light for our holiday parties!There is so little available to the consumer nowadays that you can afford and that provides so much fun. The  incredibly LOW PRICE of less than $10 bucks, you can not only delight yourself but also anyone else in your immediate vicinity who enjoys a bit of good, clean fun. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBEJGOODQ2VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011NTGIQG#wasThisHelpful","R2PBEJGOODQ2VP","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The World We Live In Now, is NOT the World We Grew Up In, if you are older tha's30 years old. WHAT in the World did we need to charge, DAILY,  when we were in our teens/20's/30's or even 40's? NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING! Phones were stuck onto the wall or needed to rest in a charging cradle, computers were GIANT behemoths that lived up to their names of being DESK TOP computers, and music came through a Boom Box or Walkman with speakers still locked and loaded to the power grid.Welcome to the year 2015!!!! Now, if you live ANY kind of normal life, you have at least TWO devices that need daily charging: a smartphone and an e-reader. But, if you're a Tech Head like me and you own your own company that takes advantage of EVERYTHING Tech out there, you need up to TEN rechargeable items, per day, to get through the day! Although I have two wicked cool multi-port chargers that I can plug all of my devices into each night, sometimes my power hungry devices need a boost during the day.Enter this Ultra-Slim, Ultra-Trim, and Uber-Chic Portable Power Charger. It's the same size as a standard charge card and a wee bit fatter: think 2-3 cards stuck together. I got the HOT PINK version, which feeds my Inner Barbie. It came nicely packaged in a sturdy box with a see-through window showing the charger. Inside, is the Itsy-Bitsy-Teeny-Tiny USB to Micro USB power cord that you charge the charger with. And attached to the actual charger, is a 1.5 inch Micro USB cord that you attach to the device you want to charge.There is an almost hidden ON/OFF switch at the top of the charger; click it ON and hook up your device to charge and a Blue Light indicates it's charging. The light does NOT *flash*; it's a constant blue until is discharged, whereby it turns yellow and needs to be recharged. I was able to power up a tablet and a portable lantern on ONE charge of the charger, but neither of the devices was dead.This is a very light weight and elegant solution to the problem that many people have of ""I had a DEAD battery!"", which is why they didn't return your calls. So, if YOU are Pro-Active and just want a boost, or you know someone who ALWAYS has a dead battery, you can buy one of these for yourself and one to gift away. Now, if you don't receive that phone call back, there's a bigger reason than a dead battery.

"Okay, I ordered this book because I am a VERY visual learner and after I abandoned the ""Windows 10 for Dummy's book"", I was desperate to learn this new system beyond the most rudimentary of knowledge. For people like ME, I absolutely NEED basic because I have to learn to crawl before I walk or run.See, I'm a landscape architect. I deal in ""absolutes"" my entire day: soil, sun, water, shovels, hoses, etc. There are HUGE landscape companies that are friends of mine that STILL have no computer in their office and do all their billing by hand and all of their appointments, etc. with paper and pen! So, I have a really good excuse for NOT KNOWING BASIC ANYTHING regarding computers and I am delighted with this book!First, IT'S IN COLOUR!!! I'm visual...me like colour! Second, if you know ANYTHING, when the book shows you what a ""mouse pointer"" looks like, you feel SMART, which encourages you to learn more. Third, for those of us that this book was designed for, you'll feel like a frickin' Whiz Kid, when you get done with even one chapter! I've flipped through the entire book beyond chapter one and I had NO IDEA that so many features were available.My 'down season' is Winter, so that's when I plan on going page by page each day. After that time, I'll come back and update my review, but for now, I'm beyond DELIGHTED with the concept and the chance to teach 'this old dog some very new tricks!'","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32R6IJB49N99U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119057159#wasThisHelpful","R32R6IJB49N99U","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, you will NOT see a ""Verified Purchase"" because I buy mine at Walmart, where a 3-pack in Black sells for $8.44!!! So, head to Walmart if you want to save serious money! I do NOT know if they come in other colours at the store as I'm only interested in Black.Now, on to the review. I am one of those women who inherited from her Mom, who inherited from her Mom, who inherited from HER Mom (Great-Grandmother!) the infamous and much sneered at ""cankles""...legs that never had true ankles but just a 'fence-post' of a leg from thigh to foot. ~sigh~ Photos from the early part of the century show my Great Granny, holding milk pails, standing in sturdy shoes with some serious Scandinavian Cankles. It is What It Is, gang. At least they get me to where I'm going. LOLThe major problem with cankles is that ""normal"" socks and shoes aren't built for us folks, hitting us in fleshy areas that ultimately cut into and reduce the blood flow to our legs and feet, resulting in VERY swollen legs/feet at the end of the day.So, for all of my life, I've had to literally cut into socks to open them up, allowing for the normal swelling that legs are prone to do, especially if you are on your feet for 8-10 hours per day! And of course, cutting into the cuffs of normal socks drastically reduces their lifespan, so I'm chronically buying new 'normal' socks every couple of months.I discovered THESE socks when a diabetic friend of mine asked me to pick up some pairs for her...""...if you're going to Walmart."" I had never heard of ""diabetic socks"" and asked her to explain them to me. She said, ""They allow for your feet and legs to swell and don't cut into your flesh.""""SIGN ME UP!"", I wanted to scream! I bought Sheila her pairs, picked up a 3-pack for myself, and I've never bought another type of sock, since! They are NOT those super-thick extra cushioned socks that squeeze your feet to death; they are nice and plush but thin enough to not press against any shoe I wear with them. The ""Low Cut"" is wonderful for a person with already thick ankles that doesn't need to draw even more attention to them. The cuffs are very soft, NOT TIGHT IN THE LEAST, and at the end of wearing them for 12 hours, you do NOT see ugly welts on your skin from tighter socks cutting off your circulation!  I used to be in SUCH EXTREME PAIN from wearing normal socks, that half of the time I'd go sockless in my work boots, resulting in the stinkiest of feet, blisters galore and black feet from the soil that gets into my boots each day, being a landscaper. Now, I don't have ANY of those problems!I wish to bits& pieces that I had Betty Grable legs but I don't. So, for anyone else that suffers from healthy but unpopular shaped legs, THIS is the way to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQ1JNAPA52AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SPJ400#wasThisHelpful","RPQ1JNAPA52AH","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own waaay too many re-chargeable devices that sadly (or not), I must have for my business every single day. Flip phone, digital camera, Galaxy Tablet, keyboard for tablet, emergency lantern (just in case!), Kindle, and a couple of Bluetooth speakers that I drag with me to the job sites and motels I stay at during the work week. Hence, I need an EXTREME amount of USB to Micro USB power cords to attach to my two multi-port chargers that allow me to charge up to 10 devices at once. I also have a 3-port car charger in my truck so that I am NEVER one of ""those people"" that chronically have a dead battery on their phone or tablet. (we ALL know who you are!) LOLSome of the USB cables I own, I can't stand. They are either waaaay to stiff and unweildy, having a demonic life and mind of their own or the Micro USB connect is very poorly constructed so it's a constant battle to slide them into their charging base on your device. My favourites, so far, are six very nice 6"" length cables that I use at night to charge my devices and one particular 6' cable that came with my tablet, which is soft and pliable, allowing me to use my tablet for hours of streaming music and videos without draining the battery.THIS cable, by Le Touch, falls into the VERY NICE category. The 4' length allows you to use your device whilst charging and the specs for the USB micro connect are well done, so there is NO fighting with getting it inserted into the port. It also has the MOST INTERESTING of cable constructs, being Flat vs. Round, and exceedingly compliant! This is one cable that you will NOT do battle with, in using it while connected or even storing it in your work bag.It comes in two colours, I received the Black one,  for a fair and honest review. I do love coloured cables because it makes it easy to identify just WHICH device you need to retrieve, or if you live in a multi-charging family, so that each family member gets a different coloured cable to charge. Perhaps Le Touch can additional colour options in the future?With so many cables being offered for sale, THIS one stands at the Top O' The Heap in usefulness and well-thought out design, plus, it's affordable, too. :D","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I2LFY759RY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010F0FG6W#wasThisHelpful","R12I2LFY759RY","A27DDHWHE540I5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27DDHWHE540I5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On her way home from a visit with her elderly father, Ella Fitzwilliam is feeling stressed and troubled, as her only son Harry is struggling to make choices for his future, and his exacting, perfectionist father Felix is not making things easier. Harry is brilliant, so Felix sees an Ivy League college in his future; however, Harrys Tourettes syndrome and other neurological challenges render him uncontrollable at times. Stress makes everything harder for him, too.Suddenly Ella is racked with gripping pain and an inability to breathe, and when the plane lands, she is whisked off to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with a severe heart attack.In the weeks that follow, Ella will struggle to recover, and needs a transplant, while Felix struggles to be the father he has never beendue to his own fear of becoming like his abusive father. He begins to look at his own flaws, and realizes that his obsessiveness is likely part of a larger disorder, like Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.Alternating narratives carry The Perfect Son, and while both Felix and Harry are deeply flawed, I rooted for them as they tried to connect with one another. Felixs need for order is in direct opposition to what Harry brings to the tableHarrys tics make him a walking disaster area. But as they each try to adapt, they find a way to cohabitand even bond.There were some very difficult moments in this father/son journey, and I found myself tearing up as each one had to find a way to move past his fears.What would happen to Ella? Would she recover? If not, how would Felix and Harry manage? And would they finally discover that elusive bond that should have happened years before?I loved how each characters narrative told us a little more about them individually, back to how they began, and how the secrets they kept from one another would gradually come to light and shed hope on their future.Other interesting characters: Eudora, the 75-year-old woman next door who is supportive and wise; and Katherine, Ellas friend, who begins to see something good in Felix, and he in her, too.Set in Durham, NC, the author showed the reader the beauty of the world around the characters, even as she drew us so deeply into that world until the characters felt like people we could care about. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397JGBGJYXTKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ1V5XK#wasThisHelpful","R397JGBGJYXTKQ","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The description of the apartment as sparse and bare were understatements. It sounded grim.Joannas ideas about love and relationships might have been born of her childhood experiences with divorced parents. But must the children of divorce be so afraid, so cynical?Malcolm Martin is the friend of Ted, Lauras fianc, whom Laura marries shortly after the book begins.

"After eleven years together, Ryan and Lauren have reached the breaking point. The slightest little habit or action of the other person is so irritating that they each say that they are no longer in love. And in frustration, they make a startling decision. They will take a year apart, with no contact: no phone calls, no texts, and no e-mails. Then they will get together and reassess.After I Do: A Novel is a heart-rending story of what happens after the love and romance have died. Is there a way to ignite the passion? Can they discover what to do in the absence of these feelings? How will they find the special ingredient that has been missing?In a somewhat underhanded attempt to rediscover who her husband is, Lauren takes drastic action. But she does find answersand she arrives at some realizations.It helps that she has close friends and a great family. I loved how each family member felt real, and the ways in which they communicated and supported each other were so loving: from Grandma Lois, who pointed Lauren in an interesting direction, to younger brother Charlie, who inspires Lauren with the surprising choices he makes. Sister Rachel, who offers support, but who also calls Lauren on her mistakes, feels just like the kind of sibling one needs.A book I recommend for all who enjoy stories about relationships and family. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9DT781W691AQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB8UC#wasThisHelpful","R9DT781W691AQ","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The three girls met in 1993, at Silver Beach, Massachusetts. Lizzie Linwood, as the only child of an only child, was improbably now related to these two girls because of her mothers marriage to Jim when she was seven years old.They formed a unique connection, these three unexpected cousins, all born during the same month and year. Elyse and Isobel were full of questions for Lizzie, about her life and her dad. But Lizzie, who had lived only with her mother and grandmother in her Grandmother Mellies house in Memphis, had no knowledge of her father. Not his name, who he was, or what had happened to him. This fact of her life would haunt her.Fast forward to November 2011, in Los Angeles, where Lizzie and Isobel have been living in their adulthood, and to a phone call that will take the two of them, joined also by Elyse, back to Memphis and a crumbling, condemned house. The three story house that had been home to Lizzie, and which needed major repairs, rested on a hill overlooking the Mississippi River, and would take them out of their real lives during its restoration. During the process, the house would come to symbolize all of their own failings. Struggling to overcome the challenges they will each discover truths about themselves and what they must do next.Isobel had starred in a TV show in childhood, and now seeks to find her place in the industry via a reality show during the restoration. Elyse is trying to overcome her obsession with her old lover who is now going to marry her sister. And Lizzie, an athlete, is recovering from her third knee surgery, and wondering if she can ever play soccer again.Three Story House: A Novel took place mostly in Memphis during the restoration, but also flipped back and forth in time, revealing significant moments in the lives of the women, now almost thirty.Divided into three sections, the story focused on each young woman, and I found parts of it fascinating. Within the walls of the old house were clues that could be sorted and assembled to point to some of the answers.Strange and somewhat disconnected characters filled out the canvas, all having something to do with the past, or with the restoration. While the story dragged for me at times, in the end, there was a satisfactory resolution for each of them, in a sense; however, the revelations felt a little like a balloon that has gone flat. A lot of furor over nothing much. 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MIMI1N7BM1QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB30MWE#wasThisHelpful","R1MIMI1N7BM1QW","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was a time I remember well. The thirteen days when the Cuban Missile Crisis loomed over all of our lives, it would be even more traumatic for those living so close to Cuba, like the characters in A Place We Knew Well: A Novel. Florida, where these characters lived, would seem like the place most affected by events as they unfolded.Wes Avery, the owner of a Texaco service station, is the primary narrator. His wife Sarah seems to be going through a major crisis, and as the count-down to possible disaster continues, a number of events sharpen the emotional components in her world.Daughter Charlotte has been nominated for Homecoming Queen, and her date is a young Cuban named Emilio. What does this signify to Sarah, who protests loudly?Why does Sarah then curl up in their bomb shelter with the lights out? Is the past crushing her with the loss of hope and the death of dreams? Why does someone from their past suddenly appear, and how does this event change the landscape of their world?The story moved very slowly in the beginning, but as the count-down continued, I felt more engaged. I was mostly bored by Wes and his thoughts and feelings, but eventually I started to connect with him.Sarah felt like the typical bored housewife until some moments from her past are magnified.Memorable times drove the story for me, and the characters became more likable later on. I read it mostly for the historic events, and how people struggled during those thirteen days. 3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRC1T236TIRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417654X#wasThisHelpful","RNRC1T236TIRU","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Set in Manhattan during the late 1990s, My Salinger Year is a memoir of a time and place that can evoke nostalgia for those who lived there and during those times.It takes a very unique style to draw me into a memoir, and the author had that, as I was engaged from the very first page.What reader isn't fascinated with publishing and literary agencies?  And who doesn't want to know more about the mysterious J. D. Salinger?Well, we don't actually ""meet"" him in this book, but our narrator keeps us interested by her thoughts and the various fan letters to Salinger which she must read and respond to...but the rules are clear.  The responses must be in a ""form letter"" style.  So what happens when our narrator decides to go out on her own and take a personal interest in some of them?  Does she do so because she has, in fact, spoken to Salinger (Jerry) on the phone and feels a connection?In an era before computers were everywhere, Joanna typed on a Selectric and used a Dictaphone.  I felt catapulted backwards in time to my own ""secretarial"" days when those machines were the norm.  And then, once computers were available, who could even imagine the antiquated office equipment of those times?The Boss is not given a name, and, except for Salinger, we know nothing of other clients of this agency.  We learn a little more about The Boss as the book draws to a close, and I felt a personal connection to her then.  Also the story shows the author's dilemma as she tries to sort out her unsatisfying relationship with her live-in boyfriend Don.  Years later, she looks back at this time in her life and shares her thoughts.Themes of nostalgia, loss, and what resonates for readers who are fans of Salinger and other beloved writers, this was a captivating memoir that earned 4.5 stars for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98EPN121J97Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6J7PP6#wasThisHelpful","R98EPN121J97Q","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roz Toovey had been struggling financially ever since her husband Winston ran up their debts and then left her. Finding herself responsible to care for their nine-year-old son George, as well as for paying off the debts, Roz is barely scraping by. And then she receives an eviction notice.Could it get any worse?But then, after an impromptu gathering at her sister Petra's home, where Roz meets Scott and Nadine Elias, wealthy friends, she is stunned when Scott shows up at her physiotherapy office with an unexpected proposition. An ""indecent proposal"" kind of arrangement that could be just the way out of Roz's financial mess.But as they say, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Complications arise that Roz never expected. A strange encounter with Wayne Geddes, the manager at work, and a threatening exchange.Just when she thought things wouldn't get any worse, DC Joanne Aspinal and DC Ron Quigley show up at work, asking questions. Wayne is missing.The Mistake I Made: A Novel was one of those thrillers that kept me guessing, and even when I thought I knew how things would play out, I was stunned by what unfolded.Set in Hawkshead, in England's Lake District, I felt familiar with the surroundings due to previous books I have read from this author. The characters, including the cops, were fleshed out and enjoyable, and even the unlikeable characters, like Scott Elias, felt like people one might meet in real life.Narrated in Roz's first person voice, I naturally felt empathy for her situation, even though her errors in judgment were numerous. One can almost excuse some of her actions, as she felt backed into a corner. In the end, I was pleased at how everything fell into place, just when it all seemed impossible.

"The three of them had met at the Philadelphia Friends School years before, and their friendship bonds had cemented during the summers spent at the Avalon Beach house.  They were very different from one another, yet their connections came from a common bond developed in the school:  Katherine (Kate) Harrington, whose twin brother Colin often joined them; Vanessa Dale, whose hippie parents were a constant reminder of how different her life was from her friends' lives; and Dani Lowenstein, whose father owned the house on Avalon Beach and provided the backdrop to the fabulous summers.Now, years later, they come together for one more summer, hoping to heal from the secrets of the past and a tragic event that left them all reeling, and the problems in their present.  Kate's fianc Peter has just broken up with her only weeks before their wedding; Vanessa is still reeling from her husband Drew's betrayal with another woman; and Dani is suffering from her own guilt and unable to maintain any kind of life out in San Francisco.Will their secrets break them apart, or will they find enough strength in their friendship to help them heal?  All the Summer Girls: A Novel (P.S.) is alternately narrated by the three friends, and the reader can jog along with them as they agonize over the past and try to carve out a future.An enjoyable and somewhat predictable read, it was also very satisfying and the perfect ending to a summer.  4.0 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GGCGK6ABSA08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NF6XEK#wasThisHelpful","R1GGCGK6ABSA08","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hannah Linden and Will Shepard are two damaged souls, brought together by circumstances and bound by the legacies of their broken lives.Will, a best-selling author, has left Manhattan to go to North Carolina to deal with his aging father Jacob, who is being evicted from his assisted living home, while Hannah, a holistic veterinarian, is coping with her suicidal son Galen.Will is also carrying the burden of a deep dark secret, the loss of his five-year-old son Freddie.Hannah rents a cottage to Will and his father, on the recommendation of Hannah's friend Poppy, who was an art teacher at the facility where Jacob lived, so the connections begin to form between them.The In-Between Hour is a character-driven story of people dealing with their tragedies and their losses.  Set in rural North Carolina, I could smell the scents of the wooded area and see the beautiful colors of the ""gloaming,"" described in this passage:""As they crossed the gravel, a thrush--nature's flautist--announced the gloaming.  Another thirty minutes and darkness would fall, but right now the house and the cottage were suspended between day and night, caught in that moment when nothing was defined and everything seemed possible.""The author's characters were flawed human beings learning to deal with the effects of the past, with the tragedy of mental illness in their loved ones, and with terrible losses.  At the same time, they are struggling to find ways to connect with others, even when their first instincts are to pull away and isolate themselves.  A story I recommend for those who enjoy books about relationships, family dynamics, and dealing with loss.  4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HQLBAAJ61NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778314758#wasThisHelpful","R8HQLBAAJ61NB","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The novel begins with a peek into an eccentric, dysfunctional family headed by matriarch Maisie, who, at eighty, is very much in charge.  Her quirkiness and her current love, a man named Skipper, who raises llamas, are on full display during her birthday party event attended by many, but especially spotlighting her own family:  her daughter Liz and husband, Clayton Waters; their daughter Ashley, a budding artist who lives in the family cottage on Sullivan's Island; and their son Ivy, nicknamed thus because he is Clayton Waters IV.  His new partner, James, captures attention from them all.The Hurricane Sisters: A Novel is set in South Carolina, in Charleston and on Sullivan's Island, with a little visit now and then to Clayton's New York apartment, where some unsavory happenings are taking place.Narrated alternately by Maisie, Liz, Ashley, and Clayton, we get an insider's view of each family member, and before the tale has ended, we are rooting for the fun to be back in ""dysfunctional.""  Hurricanes are like another character in the story, and Liz's work for domestic violence victims helps bring out some old secrets...and protects another potential victim.The author does a great job of showing us what this family's world looks like through great descriptions and internal monologues that made me feel that I was right there with them.Cocky characters like a senator named Porter Galloway helped flesh out the issue of domestic violence, and the threat of an impending hurricane reminded us that bonding can occur at the most unlikely times.

"When Josh and Sarah Simon decide to pack up and leave Brooklyn and their Manhattan jobs, Sarah feels a slight tinge of anxiety.  After all, what does she know about life in the country?  They are moving to Farmwood, Virginia, where Josh will be a professor in a small college.  And Sarah will be at loose ends, not even sure what her future holds.Additionally, Sarah hasn't driven a car in many years.  There really wasn't a need for it in Manhattan.  Her anxiety increases as she ponders the possibility of it, and how it will be necessary in her new life.She is also anxious because she and Josh are contemplating having a child.Are Sarah's fears about driving, about her future, and about parenthood all part of the same thing?  Is it all a huge fear of the chasm that has opened up, making her life a quandary?Right off the bat, though, Sarah signs up for driving lessons...and then, she also takes a job as a salesperson in a kitschy store.  What is that all about?But before Sarah can truly analyze these events, she gets a call from her best friend Mona in NY...and everything turns upside down.  Soon she is off to NY to help her best friend through a medical crisis.  And while she is at it, perhaps she can sort through some of her own anxieties.Driving Lessons: A Novel (P.S.) is a delightful book about a woman on the cusp of major life changes, and while she is anxious, she also has the opportunity to sort things out.  I enjoyed the dialogue, the characters, and the ""feel good"" aura about it all.

"Laurel and Jamie fell in love serendipitously, almost as if the events that brought them together were fated.  An accident between her car and his motorcycle, but with no injuries.  But they both knew right away that they were destined to be together.When Laurel got pregnant, they got married, and everything was perfect.  Until after their daughter Maggie was born.  Laurel's depression and how she felt nothing for the baby might have started when she and the baby were separated shortly after the birth due to her hemorrhaging...but what continued afterwards could only have been an undiagnosed case of Postpartum Depression.  Soon Laurel and Jamie were living separate lives, with Jamie and Maggie staying with their friends Steve and Sara.Meanwhile, Laurel slept and drank a lot, and turned for comfort from Jamie's brother Marcus, who lived next door.  What was set in motion soon escalated, and then an unexpected pregnancy catapulted them all into a storm of emotions, secrets, and lies.Before the Storm was set on Topsail Island in North Carolina, and the Lockwood family, to which Jamie and Marcus belonged, was wealthy and privileged, but their family dynamics left much to be desired.  Jamie was the ""perfect"" son and Marcus, the bad boy.What subsequent events would forever change the landscape of their lives?  How did Laurel's drinking during her pregnancy result in her son Andy's disabilities?  And how would those very problems turn into tragedy during one summer when he was just fifteen years old?  A church fire, pointed fingers, and a series of misunderstandings would lead to more complications.  Would the truth ever come out?Multiple narrators told the story:  Laurel, Marcus, Maggie, and Andy, and each character's voice was distinctive.  The story flashed back to the past and then forward to the present; the mystery of what happened during that summer night would keep this reader guessing until almost the end...and then the reveal would be stunning.  4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3II9X1L7IHJ79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9V2440#wasThisHelpful","R3II9X1L7IHJ79","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The opening lines of In the Unlikely Event take place in 1987, with an unnamed character experiencing great anxiety as she ponders whether or not to board a flight to Newark, NJ.  She is suffering the angst of belonging to a very special secret club of members joined by a tragic winter long ago.Flash back to December 1951, to a small New Jersey town called Elizabeth.  Christmas lights are out and there is gaiety in the air.  It won't be long, though, before everything changes for the residents of this picturesque town.The first plane crash comes only days later, with everyone aboard dead.  It landed in a riverbed, so the damage below was negligible.The residents of the town haven't even recovered when, in January 1952, the second crash occurs.  And a month later, another one.Henry Ammerman is a journalist covering the story for the local newspaper, and he finds a measure of fame through his provocative columns, as he probes the questions that plague them all.  What is happening?  Are the crashes coincidental, or is there some kind of sabotage behind them?  Some blame ""the Communists,"" while the teenagers mention aliens.As the story unfolds, we meet numerous characters, some seemingly random and their presence in the tale becomes readily apparent, as they connect in some way to the plane crashes.  Like Ruby Granik, a young dancer and a victim; or Kathy Stein, who has been dating Steve Osner, a resident of Elizabeth, also dead in one of the crashes.Miri Ammerman, the daughter of single mom Rusty and niece of Henry, is fifteen, and her life is shaken by these happenings, just as the life of her best friend Natalie Osner takes a strange turn.  Has Natalie been ""taken over"" by the deceased spirit of one of the victims?Even as I loved certain aspects of this novel, the numerous characters, most mentioned only once or twice, were confusing and distracting.  I would have loved to dig more deeply into the lives of the primary characters, like what has Rusty been feeling all these years, raising Miri alone, with no help from the father?  And when he does appear, why is she so reluctant to let him help?  How do the core characters deal with the aftermath of these events?Then, almost abruptly, we flash forward to 1987, with Miri returning to Elizabeth for a memorial of that strange year.  And in a quick summarizing of events, we are caught up on what has transpired in the lives of those residents, another reminder of how much I would have enjoyed the story with more depth and a focus on the core characters.  An engaging novel, however.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R142HTKG7OHE8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04MDYA#wasThisHelpful","R142HTKG7OHE8M","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was an ordinary Monday morning on the 7:44 commuter train to London.  Passengers were engaged in a variety of activities.  A young woman named Lou, a people watcher, observes the intricate details of one young woman applying her makeup, while she notices that another is leafing through a glossy magazine.  One couple, seemingly having a nice conversation, catches Lou's eye:  they seem nice and compatible.The train has pulled into the station; it is raining hard outside.And then, suddenly, the man across the aisle has vomited unexpectedly, and after saying ""I'm sorry,"" he clutches his chest and his head falls to the table.Pandemonium ensues; and, while some try to call for help, others simply stare.Within minutes, it is apparent that the man has died...and everything about that morning is no longer ordinary.One Moment, One Morning: A Novel is the story of how, in a brief spot of time, everything changes.  We follow the characters from the train, see how some of their lives intertwine, and before the ending, others will have connected.Lou, a counsellor for troubled youth (and the people-watcher on the train) has been keeping a secret from her mother.  Anna, a well put-together young woman has a troubled home life.  And Karen, the wife of the now deceased man, Simon, is stunned by events and will be struggling as she tries to deal with the aftermath.  Her two small children, Luke and Molly, will have to learn about the death of their father and deal with that loss.I liked the characters and how the author showed us what their lives looked like, before and after.  Little flashbacks reveal much about each of them, and I felt sad for Karen, as she recalled happier times and realizes that her dreams are now gone.New friendships develop, however, and a support network surrounds each of the characters.

"In the opening pages of X (Kinsey Millhone Book 24), we meet Teddy Xanakis, who is determined to somehow steal a valuable painting from the home she once shared with her ex-husband. She believes it is hidden in the basement, and hopes to develop the perfect plan. If she can get her hands on it, she can have its value assessed.Fast-forward to Santa Teresa, CA, where Kinsey Millhone is plugging away as a private investigator, working, as usual, on a few cases. We get to see old familiar faces, like Henry, from whom she rents her studio garage apartment; the staff at Rosie's diner, a favorite watering hole down the street; and Ruthie, a friend from the past, whose husband Pete Wolinsky, now deceased, once worked with Kinsey while she was training at the Byrd-Shine Detective agency.Assorted detectives and probation officers fill the canvas, and soon we see Kinsey meeting up with a woman who needs help finding out about her birth son, who has been in prison. The woman invites her to her spacious home and pays her cash for the job. She says her name is Hallie Bettancourt, and that her son is Christian Satterfield, imprisoned for several bank robberies and now released.Soon we learn that Hallie's tale is fake, that the home was not hers, and nothing at all is what it seems.Set in the eighties, the novel reflects the absence of current technology, but also mirrors some of our current issues in California, like the ongoing drought.To what lengths will Kinsey go to find out what is happening? What will she do about some notes that Pete left behind that somehow connect to an old lawsuit? Why does the name Ned Lowe keep popping up? And who is breaking into Kinsey's office and Ruthie's home, just to mess things up and flaunt his or her activities?As with all my previous favorites from this author, this novel takes the reader on a roller coaster ride, and along the way, we watch Kinsey following people of interest, and sit with her while she takes part in stakeouts. Nothing is boring about her activities, as we are gifted with her internal monologue; we capture a glimpse of how her mind works. We learn a little more about her every time we turn a page. I enjoyed the traits that make her interesting, like her dogged persistence when working a case, her friends and their quirky traits, and her fondness for peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. She shares bits and pieces about her various love interests as some of them show up in the present.Just as life does not offer a gift-wrapped resolution to all loose ends, this novel does not either, but it leaves us with the possibility that justice will prevail. I enjoyed everything about this book and loved how Kinsey left us with some philosophical conclusions of her own. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPCPK5WTJYSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZKJA#wasThisHelpful","RLPCPK5WTJYSW","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Margaret Riley has enjoyed a long life, and at ninety is sometimes annoyed with the people around her, eschewing contact with most people while lost in her own memories.So when she notices a new neighbor across the pond, she is caught off guard. The home had been empty for a while, and Margaret had come to count on that.But she is curious about the younger woman, who has a small child, and finds out who she is in a rather surreptitious way. And arranges for them to meet when the librarian in the village points out the younger woman's ""work wanted"" ad.Jennifer Young and four-year-old Milo have left a past behind them, and hiding the secrets of that past now informs Jennifer's life. Another mother, Megan, whose son Ben is in Milo's preschool class, is reaching out to Jennifer. Worried about how much she can share, Jennifer is sometimes tense and often short in her responses.Set in mountainous Sewanee, in Tennessee, the isolation could be just what each of these characters needs. But will their slowly building connection force their secrets into the open? Will each of them lose the protection of those secrets? Or will something unexpected come to them?The New Neighbor: A Novel is told alternately with multiple narrators, primarily from the first person voice of Margaret, and Jennifer's third person perspective. Slowly we learn about each character, the lives they have lived, and what led them to keeping the secrets they now hope to keep hidden. As the secrets slowly come out, layer by layer, they seem less devastating, in some ways. Less startling.But then, when Margaret starts to stir the pot, stepping into what is not her business, she unleashes a whole new drama that will impact all the characters.I enjoyed Margaret and felt for her loneliness, but soon I was disgusted with her meddling. Jennifer was trying to move past the pain of her life with an addict and the betrayal of her daughter Zoe. And Zoe was probably just a typical teen, reacting without thinking.They all had to accept the consequences of their actions.A story that I could not put down, this one earned 5 stars from me.

"Callie McBride is restless and unhappy with her marriage.  Despite their many years together, she and her husband, Thomas Bennett, are living parallel lives in their Seattle home.When Callie discovers a woman's phone number in her husband's trash, she concludes that he is cheating on her.  She takes this opportunity to take off for Nevada, to her Aunt Nash's old ""divorce ranch""; the phone call from her mother Gloria, reporting that Nash is doing strange things, according to a caretaker at the ranch, is just the impetus she needs.Her sister Shaye joins her at the Tamarosa Ranch, a place they both recalled from their younger years with fondness, so they are dismayed at the shambles it has become.Not only is Nash behaving strangely--yelling and throwing boots at the agent from Land Management--but she has a whole room filled with boxes and detritus from 1951...and she doesn't want them to see.  At one point she starts burning things.What is Nash hiding?  Is she hoarding things from the past because they are treasures, or because there are dark secrets involved?Alternately narrated by Callie in the present, and Nash in the past, we begin to uncover something that happened a long time ago; something that will affect the present.  And as we follow these journeys, we learn a lot about these interesting characters.  The Secrets She Keeps: A Novel also shows us an insider's view of how Callie and Shaye view marriage, and what makes it possible to survive all the bumps in the road.The lovely settings, from Seattle to Nevada and Lake Tahoe, are familiar to me, and I felt as though I was right there with the characters.

"The three sisters were bound together by the cruelty of the life they lived, with an alcoholic father who turned violent and often went missing, and without their mother who had died years before.  They were often lonely on the remote farm in Western Canada, but they found comfort in each other.One night, their father turned on them while drunk and things got out of hand.  They ran, knowing that they would face even more trouble if they stayed.On the way to Vancouver, their destination, their truck broke down outside a small town called Cash Creek, and when two young men offered help, they were reluctant.  But went along, to their great remorse afterwards.  What happened to them in those five days would inform the rest of their lives.They escaped, they took on new identities with the help of a kind man who ran the pub, and made new lives in Vancouver.  But eighteen years later, everything goes wrong, and they are face-to-face with their past again.Dani, Courtney, and Jess Campbell--who became Dallas, Crystal, and Jamie Caldwell--were characters that grabbed hold of my heart and made me want to root for them.  Their vulnerability, mixed with the strength of their fierce protectiveness of one another, kept me glued to the pages, wondering how they would be forced to confront their past and how they would come out the other end...or if they would.Jamie's daughter Skylar is an interesting addition to the cast of original characters, and her story is equally compelling.  Those Girls was narrated by each in turn, with the first part in Jess/Jamie's voice, followed by Skylar's voice.  At the end, we finally hear Dani/Dallas's voice, and feel, along with her, the anger, frustration, and helplessness...and then the peace that comes with some kind of resolution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CJEVAQHA0D24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1AWE1A#wasThisHelpful","R2CJEVAQHA0D24","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A wild child, Georgina has always had all the money she wanted and no responsibilities.  She is loud, gregarious, and pushes her way into every situation, with her sense of entitlement showing.It was easy to dislike the character of Georgina, and even though Sloane is trying to figure out what she wants and where she will end up, I found myself rooting for her.  And I was also eager to see good things happen for Hillary.  Before the summer ends, however, we will discover the big secret she has been keeping from her husband.Those Secrets We Keep was a somewhat predictable novel about friendships, secrets, and trying to find new beginnings during a summer getaway, and while there were some unexpected situations, like the huge secret Georgina has been keeping, there was nothing particularly unique about the story or the characters.However, it was interesting to see how everything played out, watching what the women would do and what choices they would make.  4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEZ0VGNIO09H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451471873#wasThisHelpful","R1CEZ0VGNIO09H","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Mundy's Landing, on the banks of the Hudson River, a gruesome heritage lurks.  The Sleeping Beauty murders of 1916 are memorialized by the Historical Society, and have become legendary.Rowan Mundy is married to Jake, descendant to some of the more famous (or infamous) Mundys, but Jake and Rowan are upstanding citizens.  Parents, professionals, and contributing members of the community.Their three children, Blake, Katie, and Mitch, are their pride and joy, even though Mitch is sometimes as troubled as Rowan recalls herself to be as a teenager.  But nowadays, Rowan is a fourth-grade teacher in the school that she herself attended.Rowan's red hair has become the focus of an unknown person, a stalker, and possibly the man murdering young red-haired women throughout the Tri-State area.Blood Red: Mundy's Landing Book One has multiple narrators, including Rowan, her sister Noreen, her youngest son Mick, and a stalker called ""Casey,"" although it isn't long before we suspect that there is much more to ""Casey"" than we can tell from his narrative.Fourteen years ago, Rowan had a brief encounter with Rick Walker, the next door neighbor, and while their interaction was mostly kissing, she is still troubled by what happened.When she starts receiving anonymous packages, beginning with a box of burnt cookies, symbolic of that afternoon encounter, she begins to suspect Rick.  But as more and more time passes, along with some very strange incidents, we realize that Rowan is in danger...and the mysterious narrator is somehow involved.Who is Casey?  And what, if anything, does Rick have to do with these events?Numerous characters suddenly look suspicious, and before long, we begin to think that the killer could be someone very close to Rowan.  But who?  And as more bodies pile up, NYPD detectives also become involved, and they are zeroing in on Mundy's Landing.  I enjoyed this page-turning mystery with characters that felt so real they might have been neighbors or friends, and can easily award 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LRVFCUIT5BQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062349732#wasThisHelpful","R3LRVFCUIT5BQL","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For almost ten years, Ana Cortez had been at the mercy of the foster care system. In and out of homes, mostly in East LA, she is now at a crossroads. Next stop: a group home. Unless her social worker, Lupe Saucedo, can come up with a creative solution.As she meets with Ms. Saucedo, Ana learns that, indeed, a new possibility is available to her. She can be placed in Northern California, in redwood country, where she can intern on a farm for the summer. And perhaps longer. The ultimate goal: emancipation.From the first moments after her arrival in Hadley and to the home of Emmett Garber and his sister Abbie, Ana feels on trial. Every word, every glance, every misunderstanding...they all point to failure, even though she is trying hard. But nobody seems to give her a chance, especially Emmett Garber, who has his own issues and little understanding of Ana's.Abbie is impressed by Ana's creativity, however, and the efforts she has made to do what is required. Small mistakes make it harder, but there are a few moments of connection developing between them.Naturally, there is a boy, Cole Brannan, who is drawn to Ana, and she to him. But his parents have issues with the Garbers, making Cole a forbidden love. And the attraction between them evokes all of Abbie's worst memories about her own past errors in judgment.How do the past mistakes of all the characters play into the events of that summer and fall? Why are so many people unable to give Ana the benefit of the doubt? And, finally, what frightening event will change how everyone sees her? Will Ana finally achieve her dreams of belonging?Throughout Ana of California: A Novel, I felt myself rooting for Ana, wishing that I could somehow make others understand her and give her the chance she so sorely needs. She was an appealing character, and I could understand why she connected to the girl named Rye Moon. But I found Rye unlikeable.Rye, with her somewhat Bohemian style, resonated with Ana. But she seemed to create situations that would evolve into trouble. Lashing out seemed to be Rye's MO, and this behavior made it hard for this reader to connect to her.Small town life might have appeared to be a good idea for Ana, but the smallness of the town contributed to many of the problems, too, with residents jumping to conclusions, reacting out of their own preconceptions about Ana and her life. Misunderstandings and miscommunication ran rampant. In the end, this mix added to my fascination with the story, and with my inability to put this book down. 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNAEM2OJQ8KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4D2S#wasThisHelpful","R1PNAEM2OJQ8KG","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a small English village, a young girl has gone missing. Rosie Anderson's eighteen years flash before her eyes, as she looks down upon the life she lost; she describes this ""movie of her life"" as she sees it, in freeze frame images, starting in her childhood. Her voice is the first one we hear, and we will see her alternately reveal much as the story continues.Our story then picks up with our narrator, Kate McKay, a friend of the Anderson family. Neal and Jo are Rosie's parents, and Kate has just learned from Jo that Rosie has gone missing. Kate's daughter Grace is distraught at the news of Rosie's disappearance, and in the early days of August, there is still hope that she will be found. Or that they will all discover that Rosie has just gone off with a friend and no harm has come to her. After all, Rosie is not known for rebellious streaks.Neal Anderson is a renowned journalist, charming, and many are in awe of him. His wife Jo is gorgeous and their home is perfect. Everything seems perfect. As we know in life, nothing is perfect.And as The Bones of You unfolds, we learn that nothing is as it seems, and darkness lies beneath the surface. Abuse, dangerous passions, and perhaps even murderous impulses. Who can know what such people are capable of...what secrets might hide beneath the polished veneer? And why is Delphine, the youngest daughter, seemingly ignored? What secrets might she be hiding?We see the layers of this dark, psychological suspense unpeeling slowly, and meet others in the village, like Rachael, a friend of Kate's, and Angus, Kate's husband. Laura is a journalist friend of Kate's who appears after Rosie's body is found and the determination has been made that she was murdered.Kate was close to Rosie, who enjoyed coming over to spend time with the horses. Kate is an earthy character, a gardener, while Jo is distant, seemingly superficial, and unpredictable in her moods. She is often aloof, and then needy. Who can tell what is really going on in her perfect world, now destroyed by her daughter's death?There is a slow build of suspense and gradual revelations, both from Rosie's perspective, and then through bits and pieces from others. What happened to Rosie? Could her boyfriend Alex, whom the parents disapproved of, be responsible? Or could her murderer be someone even closer?A chilling story that kept me rapidly turning pages, figuring out some of it fairly early, but then stunned by what is finally revealed. And we see how a moral compass was lost, a brain short-circuited, and someone slipped into madness. How what we see in others often hides the truth and we may never know what that is. Until someone finds the courage to step forward. 4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6H57RFVFNN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONTS43O#wasThisHelpful","R1M6H57RFVFNN8","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sandy and Ben Tremont are living an idyllic life in the Adirondacks in a hilltop mansion, with their 15-year-old daughter Ivy.  And yes, having a teenaged daughter is a challenge for Sandy, since they seem to be at odds more often than not.But not everything is as wonderful as it appears.  Sandy is keeping a big secret about her past, one that is about to resurrect itself and bring havoc upon them all.Miles away, two convicts have just escaped from prison, and they have a destination in mind.  They are headed for that hilltop with evil in mind.  And a plan.Will it be a plan for vengeance?  Or is something more going on?  Nick Muncey sees himself as a winner, and for most of his life, he got everything he wanted.  He had to learn new games in prison, but now, for his escape partner, he has chosen big and simple Harlan, who listens and does what Nick wants.When the two of them arrive at the Tremont home, it is not immediately apparent why Nick has chosen this place, but soon we are able to put together the connections.As Night Falls: A Novel is a suspenseful and frightening tale of one night that turns disastrous, and a past that formed the man who would bring danger into all their lives.The story flows back and forth between the present and the 1970s and 1980s, when Barbara Muncey was raising her son Nick...and a daughter she ignored.  Nick was allowed to create havoc over and over until the day that he finally ended up in prison.  But his days of plotting and scheming are not over, and terror grips the Tremont family.The characters were three-dimensional and felt very real, especially the frightening ones. Ben was the least formed character, and Ivy was somewhat stereotypical with her teenage sulkiness and whining...and then, suddenly, she became a daughter to be proud of.To avoid spoilers, I will only say that the intensity does not slacken throughout, although there were some slow and lagging parts in the middle; perhaps the lagging was a way of intensifying the danger, but it didn't really work that way for me.  Overall, however, the story was gripping, and one that I would recommend for those who love suspense thrillers.  4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9IWPMITMZVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6V45UK#wasThisHelpful","RX9IWPMITMZVJ","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew (Drew) Morrison has finally escaped.  Driving away from the home where he and his mother lived together after his father left years before, he feels the wings of freedom lifting him up and away.  For years, he has been his agoraphobic/alcoholic mother's lifeline, her link to the outside world she cannot face.He feels guilty leaving her, but he has no choice, he tells himself.  He heads across the small town of Creekside, Kansas, to Magnolia Lane and the room at his old friend Mickey's house.  Disappointed at the filth of his friend's home, Andrew scours and redecorates his own space.  And then, as if he has stepped into a fairytale, he is drawn into the world of Harlow Ward, the gorgeous woman living next door in the cute fairytale cottage, from which come plates of cookies and home cooked dinners.  He is soon addicted to the attention and the charm, but as he finds himself hooked on Harlow's world, and sees the rage of the now resentful husband Red, Drew begins to sense that all is not right in the Land of Oz.Behind the faade lie deep, dark secrets, and the dark inner world of the people next door will bring terror and horrifying events.  Who, if anyone, will live to tell about it?The Neighbors was a heart-clutching horror tale that kept me turning pages, even as I wanted to run away and hide.  Why did Harlow do what she did?  What events in her past created her, and what would she continue to do to escape the pain?  An intriguing tale for those who love horror...which I do not.  For me, 3 stars.

"Friendships that go on for years can sustain a person, and when there is a break in the regular get-togethers and an absence of contact, feelings are hurt. People feel abandoned.Emma Michaels grew up among Hollywood royalty, and was a child actor. She famously divorced her parents at a young age and lived with her grandmother. The cottage at the lake was a special gathering place for Emma's friends, the ones she bonded with in their Manhattan days: Mackenzie Hayes and Serena Stockton.Now, after a five-year absence, Emma has invited her old friends to the lake house for a week in the summer.But when they arrive in Manhattan, before heading up to the Adirondacks cottage, they are stunned by the news that Emma is in the hospital, after sustaining major injuries.

Sinai.While Emma is in her coma, we see flashbacks of the friends over the years, learning about what kept them together...and pondering what might have separated them.Mackenzie is going through her own angst, as her husband Adam is in LA, meeting with production companies about his screenplay. For the past twenty years, they have been living in Indiana, running a small theater.

But the loss of her long-ago love, Brooks Anderson, has left her bereft and making poor choices.Why did Emma call her friends together? What does she have in mind? Explanations, or is there a deep, dark secret that will change everything between them?Finally they are all at the lake, and as Emma heals, with the moments and days ticking away like a time bomb, we learn bits and pieces. I guessed the secret long before it was revealed. And it was a doozy. Despite that fact, I enjoyed seeing how the ramifications would all play out.Will the friendships survive? Will Mac's marriage go on after the decisions Adam made in LA? And what will Serena do when an unexpected brush with the past puts her in another quandary? A Week at the Lake was another novel from a favorite author that I enjoyed all the way to the end. 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRKOD9RGUAU3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425274470#wasThisHelpful","RRKOD9RGUAU3T","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the very first page of Crash & Burn (Tessa Leoni series), we are drawn into the mind of a woman, tortured by the confused thoughts in her head, as well as bits and pieces of memories.  After she catapults over a ravine in her SUV, she manages to climb out of it.  She keeps calling out for someone named Vero, as she crawls up the ravine from the crashed car.Investigators believe she is referring to a missing child and spend hours searching.Wyatt Foster, a Sheriff's deputy from the small county in New Hampshire, is on the case, along with Todd Reynes, who had been the nighttime duty officer.  When they finally realize that the woman was alone in the car, they are even more stymied, as there is obviously a lot to unravel.  About the woman, about her husband, and about why the woman is so confused.Apparently she has sustained three concussions within a short period of time, resulting in Traumatic Brain Injury.  They immediately focus suspicion on her husband, identified now as Thomas Frank, while she is Nicole Frank.Tessa Leoni, who works for a private investigative company, and who we have met in previous novels, is also on the case, but she cannot share what she knows.  At least not in the beginning.As the story continues, a whole series of events begin to create even more havoc, adding further trails that are challenging to follow.  Who is Vero?  And what is Nicole's connection to her?  Who are Thomas and Nicole Frank, since they didn't exist before the past twenty-two years, at least not with those names?  Do Vero and Nicole have something to do with a missing child case from thirty years before?  How do two burned houses figure into the mix?As the threads of the mystery begin to come together, and just before they really start to make sense, we are thrust hither and yon, with various and sundry possibilities until we are also pretty confused.  In the end, the questions are answered...but what now?  Physical evidence and proof are lacking, leaving the investigators with little more than theories and a few facts.  Definitely a compelling story that kept this reader turning pages...and giving this one 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1UT5QGE6XMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9AXW7S#wasThisHelpful","RH1UT5QGE6XMX","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is the nature of love?  What would an individual do for her art?  And what betrayal could transform a person into someone no longer invisible?  Someone who could finally and truly live?In the opening lines of The Woman Upstairs (Vintage Contemporaries), our protagonist and first person narrator, Nora Eldridge, is expressing her rage.  And as she lashes out, she lists all of the traits that make her a good person:  she is a good teacher, a daughter who held her dying mother's hand, a daughter who speaks to her father every day.She is now a woman looking back at a time in her life.  A time that consumed more of her than imaginable, and almost turned her permanently into the woman outside the main action.  Someone who is looking on while others succeed; someone who draws her primary sustenance from the crumbs of another family's table.The Year of the Shahids was that time for Nora, when she became obsessed with each of them, starting with the son, Reza, a student in her third grade class in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  His mother, an artist, and someone Nora would like to emulate, is Sirena:  beautiful, talented, and with the ability to draw Nora into her web.  Yes, to me, looking on, it feels like a web.  But maybe that is just my perception.  It does not seem to be Nora's view.  She falls a little bit in love with the husband/father, too:  Skandara, a charming intellectual.She ends up sharing an artist's studio with Sirena, and becoming a part of the family.  Almost.  There are times when she sinks into her invisibility again, dependent on the crumbs from their table.A fascinating tale, one in which we see what happens to Nora during that obsessive year; we watch her afterwards, how she keeps tabs on them after they have returned to Paris, via Google alerts; and then there are the following years when she goes to Paris and sees the famous installation of Wonderland...and is stunned by a finding that will finally unleash her rage.A truly captivating read that reveals several unlikeable and self-absorbed characters, and even the protagonist is someone you might want to warn about how things will truly play out in the end.  But, like most people, she had to learn her own lessons and come to her own realizations.  4.5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZC4EDJQ23DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A1O4L50#wasThisHelpful","RBZC4EDJQ23DN","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anthony and Rachel Brinkley are enjoying their empty nest in Suffolk, especially since their three grown sons, Edward, Ralph, and Luke, stay in close touch.  Edward is married to Sigrid, and they have a daughter Mariella.  Ralph, who is often a challenge, now seems settled in nicely with Petra and their two boys, Kit and Barney.But with Luke marrying Charlotte, Rachel is a little nervous.  She suspects that Charlotte will not ""fall into line"" as nicely as the other two daughters-in-law.She is right.  Charlotte is used to getting what she wants, and she has some very definite ideas about how her new relationship with the in-laws will proceed.But what Rachel could not have predicted would be the intense chaos that rises up during that summer, and how Sigrid and Petra seemingly step out of line, just as Charlotte is asserting herself.Daughters-in-Law was a delightful family tale that reveals much of what often goes on behind the scenes in families, and shows the reader how one new addition to the mix can stir things up in unexpected ways.I enjoyed this story, narrated from multiple perspectives, and at some point or another, found each character annoying, but in ways that made them seem real.

"Ellen O'Farrell enjoyed her professional life as a hypnotherapist, and she loved her house which was left to her by her grandparents.  Even its retro charm made her happy, and she didn't want to update it because it reminded her of her grandparents.  With the beach right outside her door, one could say she had it all.She even had the perfect home office with great windows where she met with her clients.But Ellen's love life has left much to be desired.  She thinks sadly of all the past relationships and what went wrong.  So when she meets Patrick Scott, a handsome man with an eight-year-old son named Jack, she is sure that it will just be a matter of time before everything goes wrong.So when Patrick says ""I have to tell you something,"" and then disappears from their table for what seems like forever, she knows that it's all over.What she learns, however, is that Patrick's ex-girlfriend Saskia has been stalking him for the past three years.From this point, The Hypnotist's Love Story: A Novel becomes a fascinating journey, in which we alternately see the perspectives of Ellen and Saskia, and watch their lives descend into a train wreck of madness.  But at the end of the journey, will there be an epiphany for Ellen?  For Patrick?  And what will Saskia take away from these events?  Set in Sydney, Australia, the story brought a great sense of place with it, making me feel as if I were there with them all.I literally could not stop reading this story.  I have loved everything I've read by this author, and to pick favorites seems unfair, but I felt so connected to the characters.  I was frustrated by the actions of each character at one point or another.  Patrick seemed clueless.  Why had he allowed everything to go on so long?  And he seemingly failed to see Ellen's frustration at how he destroyed her orderly life when he moved in with her and left packing boxes in her hallway for weeks and seemed to ignore her feelings.  I wanted to yell at him.Saskia was the least likeable of the characters, and while there seemed to be no redemption for her, the drastic events of that one night made change possible.  I liked seeing how that could happen, but I mostly enjoyed the thought of Ellen and Patrick being free of her.  I will think of these events and these characters for a long time.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPVAJ79D5T9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074VTH2U#wasThisHelpful","R3DPVAJ79D5T9W","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Shelby Pomeroy Foxworth is unexpectedly widowed, she is not just grief-stricken.  She is stunned to learn the numerous secrets her husband had been keeping.  Richard had maintained control over everything, so learning that she is now in debt for millions is almost unbelievable.She has to sell the house and most of her belongings, and in the weeks leading up to her plan to return home to her family home in Rendezvous Ridge, Tennessee, she finds a mysterious safety deposit box at a local bank with startling contents.  She now is beginning to realize that her husband was not at all who she thought he was.She and her three-year-old daughter Callie finally leave Philadelphia, and embraced in the warmth and comfort of her family, she begins to start over.But suddenly she is being followed by a PI...and a woman approaches her one day with more unexpected news.

Would she realize her dreams of a home and a career of her own?The story is filled with colorful and intriguing characters who felt like friends and neighbors, people I would want to sit with to enjoy a glass of sweet tea.  And even the snarky characters, like Melody, would get a satisfying comeuppance of the kind that readers can enjoy.

"In the synopsis, we learn that The Shore is a group of small islands in the Chesapeake Bay, just off the coast of Virginia, with...clumps of evergreens, wild ponies, oyster-shell roads, tumble-down houses, unwanted pregnancies, murder, and dark magic in the marshes. Sanctuary to some but nightmare to others, it's a place that generations of families both wealthy and destitute have inhabited, fled, and returned to for hundreds of years.So the story begins, and we are first introduced to two young girls, Chloe and Renee, and watch Chloe in the store, trying to get bait so she and her sister can catch crabs for dinner.  The descriptions of Chloe and her life were awesome, and I settled in for a great tale.But then we meet some other characters, and then more characters...and as each vignette took us into other worlds, with some appealing and others, not so much, I started to lose focus.Sweeping across time and back again, the author shows many such characters, but none quite so appealing to me as Chloe.Then we meet Medora, in the 1800s...and I was hooked again.  A half-Shawnee woman, with special medicinal talents and a determination to rise above her childhood abuse...she really grabbed my attention, and then I kept waiting for her story to reappear.The author did a great job of showing us the setting and making the reader feel a part of it.  And the darkness of the characters' lives didn't bother me, but the numerous cast of characters and the veering back and forth through time did....I was lost.  And then decided to forget about taking notes and just try to enjoy each ""story,"" which worked out better.The Shore: A Novel was not an enjoyable book for me, but the themes and issues were definitely important ones.  3.5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1W62FZDAQ1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553417738#wasThisHelpful","RV1W62FZDAQ1W","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Eric realizes that she has a new boyfriend, and this probably explains a lot about her new attitude.Then Eric is abruptly brought into the case of a seventeen-year-old boy named Max, who is suffering from depression and possibly other issues due to his grandmother's impending death.In treating Max, Eric soon learns of the boy's obsessions, part of his OCD, which center on a young girl named Renee.Suddenly everything is seemingly out of control for Eric, as Max goes missing after his grandmother's death, and the young woman Renee has been found murdered.  And at the hospital, a young medical student named Kristine has filed sexual harassment charges against him, which stuns Eric, since she has been coming on to him...and he has shut her down.  Are these events random, or is someone pulling the strings?  What is the end game?Every Fifteen Minutes was a fast-paced suspense story narrated in Eric's first person voice, and alternately narrated by an unidentified sociopath.  The sociopath also uses the first person voice, and calls himself/herself a ""sociopath"" and outlines a vague plan to take Eric down.  Who is this unidentified sociopath and why is he or she fixated on Eric?I could not read this book fast enough, eager to find out who had done what.  I had suspicions that the ""puppeteer"" had to be a colleague.  But at the very end, a stunning reveal left me reeling.  5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29M3X751ZYKIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKBEG6U#wasThisHelpful","R29M3X751ZYKIP","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Mabel Dagmar, an ordinary girl, first met the privileged blue blood Genevra Winslow, the most relevant thing about her was how little she noticed Mabel.  As if she were simply an annoyance to bear.  Or an item of furniture, something she could overlook.  Since Ev was her college roommate, Mabel tried to find a way to coexist with the strange girl.So when Genevra (Ev) made an overture, offering an invitation to a special event, Mabel didn't know what to make of it; she did notice, however, how Ev's moods changed from dark to light, and that her occasional invitations afterwards were unpredictable.  But the ""intermittent reinforcement"" had definitely hooked Mabel.The invitation to the Winslow family summer retreat at their Vermont estate seemed almost like a gift that could then be quickly withheld.  And what Ev did in the subsequent weeks, as Mabel found herself in the middle of a privileged world, was true to form.  She alternately snarled, scowled, and withheld her attention, and then drew Mabel back to her with one kind gesture.  To say she was spoiled and entitled would be an understatement.  I did not like anything about this character, even though I realized that her parents had had a role in creating this behavior.Because Ev was often unavailable, both physically and emotionally, Mabel found her own way among the family members, and developed a unique relationship with Ev's aunt, Indo, an eccentric woman who made an unusual request.Narrated in Mabel's first person voice, the reader is drawn into the story, seeing the privileged world through Mabel's eyes...and wanting to warn her as she becomes more and more hooked on the feelings this world engenders.  Our narrator tells the story as if looking back on this time and these events.  There is a sense of loss about her tale.  And all the while, she, too, has a dark secret.What did Mabel discover about the Winslows?  How did what she learned change everything about her summer and her life?  Did she rise above the evil she had inadvertently become a part of?  And who would be an unexpected ally in the end?Bittersweet: A Novel was a story about a family so dysfunctional that one would have to look very hard to find anything good about it.  How Mabel turned things around in the end brought a satisfying conclusion to the dark and twisted history of this family.  5.0 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UOVECXEK03SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138567#wasThisHelpful","R3UOVECXEK03SQ","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After finishing medical school at Yale, along with her internship, Zoe Goldman has returned to her hometown of Buffalo for her psychiatry residency.  But coming home has brought some baggage with it.Years ago, Zoe lost her birth mother in a fire, and has some physical and emotional scarring from the traumatic episode.  In addition, Zoe has ADHD and some issues with compulsivity.  She struggles with these issues, along with how coming home has caused old feelings to resurface.  And now the nightmares have begun again.How will Zoe manage her patient load while dealing with her own issues?  Why is her adoptive mother, now suffering from dementia, hiding things from her?  Was everything she was told a lie, or has her mother ""forgotten"" the facts due to her memory issues?Little Black Lies is a page-turner that I couldn't put down.  I loved the mix of Zoe's personal life with the issues of her patients.  Why has one particular patient, Sofia Vallano, who incidentally killed her own mother when she was fourteen, started showing up in Zoe's nightmares?  Can Zoe find the answers to her own nebulous past?  Will she discover the truth behind the lies?  And when, in one horrifying moment, she does learn it all, will she survive it?Finding the answers can be life-changing.  There are still too many unanswered questions, Zoe realizes, and what is the truth?  What are the lies?  I liked this summation Zoe made:  ""Maybe the truth is this:  There is no truth.""A great story for those who enjoy suspense, mixed in with family issues.  5.0 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30HPQ7HPQDB6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVK36AU#wasThisHelpful","R30HPQ7HPQDB6T","A3OL1AX1IODBYL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OL1AX1IODBYL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a woodsy / somewhat sweet scent, with a heavy tobacco flower and violet scent. It is a pretty vigorous scent, and wakes one up in the morning. Like every body wash I have ever used, the odor is gone 5 minutes after I leave the shower, so I would not rely on this to last for the day or even for several hours. It smells nice in the shower, and then goes bye-bye. The comments about smelling this for the rest of the day (whether that is good or bad depends on the reviewer) strike me as being pretty inexplicable, as my wife has a very keen nose and did not smell this on me after my shower at all. Is this residual psychological or are these other reviewers possessed of bloodhound level olfactory sensors? In any case, I like the smell, but if you want something mild and / or very floral, you will not like this too much.As a body wash, 63 is a decent performer. A center of palm full on a loofah will do the trick; they say most body wash users use about 2 to 3 times more product than they should, which is why the manufacturers would rather you buy washes over bar soap, which is both cheaper and harder to squander. Try to use only a teaspoonful or less of 63, and I think it will be enough. The wash did not irritate any area of my body, even when left on for a few minutes. and it did not leave any film or tackiness on the skin once rinsed. The shea butter and glycerin did a fine job of moisturizing my skin, so I felt clean without any drying side effects.As a shampoo, 63 was somewhat less impressive, as it seemed to need more product to cover my scalp than dedicated shampoos would. I liked the smell a lot, but I feel American Crew smells as good or better, felt like it got my hair cleaner, and did so more efficiently. Plus if you use this as a shampoo and body wash both, you will blow through this teeny 8 oz bottle in a flash.Which brings me to my only complaint about 63: the cost per ounce. If you used this as a body wash only, and efficiently measured one teaspoonful each day of product, you would get about 48 days of use out of this. Most of us will use more by accident or intent (some days the loofah does not lather up too well!) and if you use this without a loofah, and / or use it as a shampoo, you could easily blow through this small bottle in a couple of weeks. If $2 an ounce for 2-3 weeks of use sounds distressing, you can either get something cheaper or carefully ration out the dose, use a loofah, and get a separate shampoo.I am not quite sure why 63 costs so much; the smell is great, so I presume the fragrance is the main price factor, but the allure of a luxury French product probably also adds some inflation. Ultimately, I think this is a good body wash, but unless you are ultra frugal with it, you will not get your money's worth. The dollar conscious may want to get some luxury bar soap instead, which can do just as good a job at cleaning without drying out if you get the right brand, and which last a lot longer. If the bang for the buck ratio does not trouble you though, 63 body wash is excellent.I should also mention the 63 shave soap and cream which are excellent products as well, and also proportionately better deals, as both last longer for the price. The smell is just as good, and the technical performance as shaving products is very high quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17VFVTAE38QO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCXS80S#wasThisHelpful","R17VFVTAE38QO5","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sturdy well made cord that charges an Apple device quickly. It works with all Apple chargers as well as other socket charges and computer ports. (As could be predicted, it charges most quickly from a 2A or higher wall charger and charges more slowly from a computer USB port.)The cable resists tangling well. No charging device is included, this is only a cable, and of course, it is USB to Lightning only.I was favorably impressed with the thick durable connector cable here, and thought the color was lively but tasteful. There are cheaper options, but for a top quality connector at a fair price, I think the Belkin is a very good choice.

"The answer to that question will determine how well you will like Dreft. The heavy synthetically simulated earthy floral smell imparted by laundry musks dominates this product and makes it smell unique and (to my nose) excellent. If you hate the smell, you will not like this. To me, this smells much more interesting than Tide or All, but it is a strong polarizing smell.Even if you love the smell, there are other issues. The ingredients here are not at all natural, and are really about as mild as Tide Free and Clear, or other similar hypoallergenic mainstream commercial detergents. However, the price is bout 20-30% more than Tide, which to me is egregious. Dreft Stage 2 removes stains well, but no better than Tide, and Dreft is just as synthetic and mild as Tide F&C, so a buyer in essence is paying a surcharge for some nebulous claims and a strong vibrant smell. If Dreft were a few cents more than Tide, no biggie, but a few dollars more, which is the case, creates great reluctance on the part of this reviewer to say that the price is justified.Finally, Dreft seems to need more product used per load than other detergents, seemingly about 20% more liquid per load. Again, no problem with the cleaning results, but the added product utilization rate combined  with the higher base cost makes Dreft unnecessarily pricey. If you got some benefit from the added cost - efficiency, natural ingredients, better cleaning - I could see the logic here, but all you get is... the smell of laundry musks in heavy volume.Laundry musks are very cheap, so adding a lot of them to a detergent should not add a price premium in and of itself. Not sure why Dreft costs so much, but even if you are a big floral musk fan, you will probably want to get something for less that is just as effective, or pay more and get something that offers more unique and costly ingredients, like Seventh Generation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANZK78H462QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB7422U#wasThisHelpful","R3ANZK78H462QW","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**WARNING, SPOILERS BELOW!!**Anihilation is a fun creepy read with lots of strong imagery, a sense of brooding mystery, and a very strong lead character. Lots of intriguing possibilities are raised, and I was interested to see them solved. I should have realized this was not likely...Authority is also pretty neat, but an utter change of pace, a tale of spies and bureacratic infighting, that only gradually comes to reflect the themes of dark nature striking back raised in Anihilation. Control is a flawed though interestihg character, the relationships between him and Grace and between him and Ghost Bird are subtly portrayed and psychologically astute. The growing sense of menace and disorder against dysfunctional corporate / governmental setting reminded me of some work by Thomas Ligotti, and the sequence leading up to the border expansion and its aftermath is gripping. I liked the utter change of direction and tone from Book I, and appreciated the fact that VanderMeer seemed to be working towards unifying characters and theme by the end of Authority. I found this to be the most interesting book of the trilogy, and even though some tones rang false (the high level bureaucrat dueling seemed portrayed a bit abstractly and vaguely) and other tones seemed cliched (Control's field operation mishap flashback: ""she trusted me, I made a mistake, and she DIED!!! Boo hoo hoo..."" Yes. we've heard that one before!) but overall this and Anihilation made a really strong start to the series.And then Acceptance. Where not much is explained, where some characters we expected / hoped to see again are never seen, where others meet mysterious, indeed inexplicable fates, and where Area X turns out to be not so much malignant as it is simply incomprehensible. After the whole Blair Witch / Cthulhu type buildup in the earlier books, I wanted Area X to turn out to be a world destroying Fury of nature, but instead it turns out to be a puzzle box, mainly indifferent to humanity altogether. It was nice to meet the lighthouse keeper and the Director again, and there is some nice writing here, but the unrealized potential of Acceptance troubles me more than the limited appeal of what is here. The ending is really jumbled (why does Ghost Bird get shot by Grace? Why doesn't it matter?) and the hugely diminished role of Control in the plot and his ultimate fate are big disappointments to a character that seemed central to the story.Ultimately, I think VanderMeer aimed for post-modern style over good storytelling. He is a phenomenal critic and editor, and I've loved some of his short fiction, but ultimately in longer form work, I feel an author should aim for resolution and fulfillment of the reader's expectations rather than simple elegant style and some clever set pieces. If you read Mark Danielewsky's ""House of Leaves"" and loved it, you might like this, but if you expect a satisfying end to a 600 page book, you may want to skip this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLMD6VQWFFC8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374261172#wasThisHelpful","RLMD6VQWFFC8E","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was impressed with the quality of this bed in most ways. The Pearce is a memory foam mattress that avoids most of the mishaps traditionally linked to memory foam. It does not smell awful, and really had a very faint ""new material"" smell when unboxed that quickly faded and was not olfactorily noticeable once sheets were placed on the mattress.The bed also does not feel like one is sinking into mush. The top most part of the mattress feels like a very conventional mattress, and you do not feel like you are lying on foam. The mattress is firmest in the middle, and slightly less firm on the edges, but no more so than with any coil design.More impressively, the mattress does not heat up when you are lying on it, a pitfall of memory foam designs for many years. Whether it is the pillow top or some more granular design of the foam cells, the Pearce does not accumulate or retain heat in a way noticeably different from a conventional design.I was quite impressed with all the above, as I have followed memory foam mattress tech for a few years, and often considered buying one, but was always hesitant because of the smell, texture, and heat issues mentioned above. Be reassured from a skeptic, the Pearce will soon allay all these concerns and at a highly competitive price.Issues? Well, one major one and three minor. When unboxed, the Pearce had numerous loose small threads sticking out of the top of it. None of these appeared to be snags or unraveling threads, so we trimmed them gingerly with scissors and all was well. Inspection of the areas after a months use shows no further loose threads in the stitching, so we assume this was a minor build quality issue.Other minor quibbles: the bed can only be used from the top side, so if you like to rotate and flip your mattresses periodically, you can only perform the first function on these. Also, the box used to deliver the Pearce is huge, and the delivery service used by Amazon was unhelpful and just kinda dumped the box in our lobby. It was a bit of a challenge to get the huge heavy box in the elevator, upstairs, and unpacked, but not impossible. A nicer delivery experience where the dudes take the old mattress out and set the new one up would have been welcome, but I guess the lack of such amenities accounts for the lower price. Finally, no documentation on materials, use, or maintenance, but this absence is also not a deal breaker for such a competitively priced mattress of good quality.On a very subjective note, this is a firm mattress, much firmer than our old queen sized Simmons that was being replaced. I like firm, my wife does not, but she adjusted quickly, and most experts agree firm is better for most backs. Whatever the truth of this, we like this firmness level, but if you like a mushy sleeping surface that resembles a big feather pillow, this is not for you.End of the day: like firm, worried about memory foam issues, want a good price? Get this mattress, check the stitching, be prepared for a bit of moderate exercise in setup, and all will be well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V45RUW5ZB3LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0S5EM#wasThisHelpful","R1V45RUW5ZB3LS","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Curtain is a fairly elegant pattern and color that is a bit sheer. This is good in a way as you can vary the opacity of the shower covering based on what sort of liner you put in; a clear liner will let a lot of light in, a darker liner will give a more shadowed interior.This curtain more or less conforms to what you might find at a major big box store for the price point in terms of construction. That is, there are pretty sturdy well delineated holes to put the hooks, but no metal reinforcing rings. Over time, my experience is that non-reinforced holes tend to tear over time, and are prone to catastrophic failure, i.e. if some klutzy family member yanks on em by accident.Another long term issue is repeated washing. Though these are said to be machine washable, the ""holey"" pattern does not make me feel confident that these will survive multiple washings. Usually only solid materials prove sturdy enough for many washes, and lacier materials start to pill and develop loose threads. I've washed these once, and they came through OK, no snags, look fine, but the difference between top quality materials and average is whether they'll survive 6-12 washes.All in all, you get what you pay for with shower curtains, and these do not feel too cheap, at least if we accept the frilly lacy design as an aesthetic choice and not merely a cheap way to save on material.  These are at least as good as comparably priced items at Talmart or Warget, but don't expect to pass them on to the grandkids and only buy if you don't want or expect a solid piece of material as a curtain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FSAGTMOPRHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDHLM#wasThisHelpful","R30FSAGTMOPRHW","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The core test of a power pack is whether it reliably charges and delivers its stated power rating. I am pleased to report that the 6000 mAh Sneaker Bank (SB) does this well. 6000 mAh will recharge most cell phones more than 200% and will give an Ipad a big chunk of its power back. The SB charges quickly and fully and reloads up to devices at once, fairly rapidly and with a minimum of fuss.Why only three stars? Though documentation is not exactly a strong point for most battery packs, SB sets a new low basement. The included charging cable includes micro and mini USB connections on the same plug, a clever not unwelcome feature, but one explained only on the flimsy cardboard packaging that I threw away within minutes of receiving this. This feature also is not mentioned on the product's corporate web page, but was only discovered in my case when I read other reviews on Amazon. Come on dudes, you can't put $0.75 worth of cheap manual in the box to point this out?Similarly, I have no idea if power status can be checked without plugging in the SB to a (non-included) wall charger. Most devices like this have a button on them that you can press to illuminate status lights that will tell you how much power is left in the bank. This is kind of useful, and so I looked on SB expecting to find such a button. Could not find it. Maybe it's buried away in that uselessly decorative sneaker tread pattern somewhere, but as there is no manual available, I cannot verify the presence or absence of this feature.What else is not included at this price point? Well, no manual, no wall charger, no Lightning cable for Apple devices. Apparently no power status button. No carrying pouch.Maybe it's me, but this price point seems like it ought to include more product amenities and add-ons than are found in the SB. If all you want is a reliable 6000 mAh power bank, here you go, but many competitors offer as much or more at comparable or lower prices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29JZ8AIAIUO4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDF70N6#wasThisHelpful","R29JZ8AIAIUO4Q","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It used to be the case that commercial soaps were inevitably loaded with drying detergents and no moisturizers, so one could either use stuff like Dial or Irish Spring and dry your skin out, or you could seek out obscure artisanal soaps that were gentler and costlier. Well, the world has changed.SMSC's Iceland smelled nice enough, a blend of ""fresh"" vetiver and citrus, but it is not very complex or interesting, and really Irish Spring is more engaging and strong as a scent. If you're a guy and like a strong smelling soap, Iceland barely passes muster. More problematic, Iceland irritated my face and other sensitive parts of the body when lather was left in place for more than a minute or so, making it a race to wash the lather off before Bad Things started to happen.This saponified aversion therapy is about as bad as the effect achieved by Ye Olde Irish Spring Classic, which costs about 10% of what SMS costs, so I wonder why an expensive organic soap could not be less sensitizing.More annoyingly still, Iceland lasted about 2 weeks only, and was thin enough to bust in half on day 12, leaving me to use mini-soap bars for a few more days. I use the bar itself to soap up in the shower and do not use a loofah, so I suspect those who are getting a month of use out of these bars are not using them to lather up directly.What do you like in your soap? Want to save money? Iceland costs a lot and lasts for about 2 weeks of use, as it is not triple milled. Do you just want something cheap that smells nice and won't dry your skin out? Dove Men Plus care has one excellent option:Dove Men+Care Body and Face Bar, Aqua Impact 4 oz, 8 Bar Moisturizing cream built in, no detergent, smells great. And it's $11 for 8 bars, $1.38 per bar, not $7. The Dove product lasts about as long as Iceland soap does per bar, that is 7-10 uses. Iceland may last a bit longer, maybe another 2-4 days, but that hardly offsets the price difference. Irish Spring also now offers a moisturizing bar soap that has the same moisturizer onboard features: Irish Spring Signature Hydrating Bar Soap, 6oz, 3 Count also for $1 per bar, and these are big bars that last 3 weeks plus.Both Irish Spring and Dove Men Plus are not organic soaps by any stretch, so if you think the soapy lather from these commercial products will slowly kill you, you might want organic soap. Surely you can't get good cheap organic soap can you? Well actually, River Soap has great organic soap that has more scent options than SMSC and is triple milled, and so lasts longer in use. And River Soap costs only $4 and change per bar, less than SMS and lasts for about a week longer. You can find River Soap here on Amazon, River Soap Company - Bar Soap Exotic Patchouli - 4.5 oz. but unfortunately the company charges more for shipping than it does for the soap, so you may want to find River Soap locally if you can. Many Whole Foods offer this brand at their $4.40 list price.My own personal favorite men's organic soap is Mistral men's line, which list at $10.50 in stores for a 9 oz bar. This costs more than SMS, but lasts for roughly twice as long or more (4-5 weeks) because of triple milling and the bar size. So given those terms, Mistral Men's is still cheaper than SMSC. Mistral is tougher to find in stores than River Soap, so you may want to order from Amazon, even at price premium, if you want to try the brand. Great powerful scents too!  Mistral Men's Soap, Sandalwood Bamboo, 250 GramsAll in all, I think SMSC soaps are at best an average choice. If money is an issue, there are cheaper options that are just as moisturizing and that last longer and smell stronger. If you want organic soap, there are also cheaper options and more expensive options that match or exceed SMSC due to longer service lives. $7 soap should give one $7 worth of performance, and I don't see that here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PE4123EOXKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKTVCES#wasThisHelpful","R7PE4123EOXKX","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 92R is well made, and my particular model had symmetric blade exposure on both sides. Well and good. However, the 92R is recommended by some websites as a good starter or general purpose razor, and I can assure you it is not. A lot of blade is showing here, far more than on a Merkur 34C or Jagger DE89, which are good starter razors, and indeed good for most shavers. The 92 R by comparison is far too aggressive for regular beards shaved daily. If you use this even with a mild blade (like a Derby) you will scrape too much skin off your face even with good technique as the blade gap and weight combine to make this a very harsh shaver. Using this razor with a Derby produced razor burn roughly 2 out of 3 times even in my relatively experienced hands (18 months of wet shaving, own 11 razors). Using a sharper blade like say a Persona Blue or Feather is truly a nightmare and I would not suggest doing so unless you have a really voluminous and / or tough beard.As the saying goes, your experience may vary. If you have a tough beard and tough face, this may be a great daily shaver. If you shave like 2 or 3 times per week, this may be ideal for you. But for me, and for other guys who shave daily and have faces sensitive to razor burn, this is a bad idea. I am giving this 2 stars because Parker does not advertise this properly as an aggressive razor for experienced users but instead claims it is Everyman's Razor. Quality is not the problem here, but rather the core design elements.Daily shavers, get a Merkur 34C or Jagger 89, or maybe a Merkur Progress if you want to be fancy. The 34C and DE87 cost a bit more (and the Progress a lot more!) but the more pleasant shaves for most users are worth the money I believe.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATTIM0E18D16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067PSOO6#wasThisHelpful","R2ATTIM0E18D16","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My primary vacuum is a Miele Polaris, and suffice to say, comparing that to the Samsung VU3000 is not especially fair, given the Polaris is a bagged canister model costing about twice as much as the upright design Samsung. I will consider the VU3000 on its own merits, and I feel that even with such terms, the Samsung still comes up short.The main problem is one intrinsic to the bagless design. I've owned a few of these, and the appeal of not having to buy and stock replacement bags is rapidly offset by the nasty chore of having to empty the canisters. This produces lots of dust (essentially entirely offsetting whatever filtration system is in place, unless one person vacuums and another empties the canister) and is especially irritating for the Samsung as the canister is far too small.Completely vacuuming a smallish two bedroom apartment that has mainly hardwood floor surfaces created 3 canister loads of dirt, meaning I would frequently have to stop vacuuming to empty. I feel the canister here is excessively small, and I can only imagine how many times one would have to empty the canister if one was cleaning a full size carpeted suburban house.Adding insult to injury, the canister also allows stuff like hair and long fibers to get into the top part of the canister, where the air intake port is, and you have to stop immediately at that point and either empty the canister or shove the hair / fibers back into the lower storage area. If you don't like poking and prodding around inside a filthy vacuum,(and who would enjoy doing that really?, this is not much fun, and it happens a lot especially if one has pets. (We have a single cat.) Indeed, even emptying the canister rarely went smoothly, as the canister has all too many nooks and crannies that dirt and hair gets caught in, meaning in order to clean it fully, you, once again, need to reach inside and pull stuff out into the trash manually. Wait, what's wrong with a bag based system again?By comparison, my Miele needs its high efficiency bag changed once a month or so, meaning you get about 4-6 full house vacuums out of 1 bag, versus 3 canister empties per cleaning with the Samsung. I guess if you think the recycled materials used in the 10 Polaris dust bags or so I use per year are really hurting the planet that much, the added inconvenience and inefficiency of rummaging through the full or jammed canister every few minutes of vacuuming with the Samsung will not trouble you.Besides the annoyingly small and immensely needy canister, the other main issue with the Samsung is its lack of a proximity effect when vacuuming. With a decent vacuum, you can come _near_ the dirt on the floor and the suction zooms it into the head. With the Samsung, there is an annoying need to be _exactly_ on top of the dirt to get it to be sucked up. I would often have to reposition and sometimes even lift the vacuum head directly on top of dirt to get the Samsung to do its job. I think the motor is powerful enough, but I think the plastic head is just not designed efficiently or well, so undue precision is needed to achieve the same effect that most other vacuums get done with simple proximity.Other than these two fairly important issues, the Samsung is well designed. It is very maneuverable and light weight, and can rapidly change positions during use. (Necessary, due to the poor proximity effect mentioned.) The detachable canister and hose means you can convert the Samsung into a very portable semi-canister type device. The attachments all work well, and the unit is attractive in color and styling. Build quality is very good, and the unit feels sturdy and tough. The agitator head works very well on rugs and carpet, and the turbo agitator attachment works even better.Other minor annoyances: no cord winder, meaning you have to manage the cord yourself. The unit is very loud and has no quiet mode. And the turbo carpet agitator has no onboard storage rack or clip, meaning you have to keep track of it yourself. They already have storage clips for the other attachments, so it seems weird and dumb not to put a clip on the frame for the turbo head attachment as well.In conclusion, the difference between 3 and 4 stars here comes to marketing and price point. If Samsung called this a light duty vacuum, or sold it for about a third less than they do, I would give this four stars. Unless you use this to clean a very small and intrinsically clean area, the deficiencies in the small finicky canister and lack of a ""sweet spot"" in head suction make this device a chore to use for most ordinary cleaning tasks. If Samsung gave one a bigger more robust dirt canister, or just used a bag instead, and if they redesigned the head a bit so one could vacuum up dirt from a couple inches away, this would be a much better design, maybe worthy of five stars. But at this level of price and somewhat mediocre performance, I cannot justify more than a three star rating.Maybe if we didn't have a nicer vacuum to compare this to, or maybe if we didn't have a pet and so many female household members (all that hair!) I would have liked this better. But I do have both a nicer vacuum and lots of longish hair producing household members, so I must rate the Samsung in light of the actual usage environment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NTTCYFW0G0QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDRI#wasThisHelpful","R1NTTCYFW0G0QW","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately I've had mine for 6 months, and have used it many times and it still stinks. When I realized the odor was not going away through regular use, I used shampoo, body wash, overnight lather holding, etc and the smell would go away for a bit and then creep back in. I have another Omega boar (the 10049) and a Semogue 830 and both of those were just fine, but the Omega Pro is resolute in its stinkiness. Maybe I just got a smelly dud of a 10048, but I am not happy.I suggest trying the 10049 as it is roughly the same price as the 10048 and is slightly smaller and so easier to maneuver. The 10048 is massive because Italian barbers use it to later _other people's_ faces, not their own, and the 10048 (assuming a non stinky one) would be perfect for that. But for using on your own face, the length and bulk of the 10048 are more of a hindrance than a help. If you face lather, a brush this big is definitely a PITA, and something like the Semogue 830 would be better for that purposes. Even if you bowl lather, the 10049 or Semogue 1800 or 2000 would be more than long enough for that purpose.The 10048 has its strengths. It softens up nicely over use as the hairs split, and is really just fine out of the box unless your face is a delicate balloon that will pop easily. The 10048 holds a lot of lather. And its knot is firm, so the brush is not as floppy as some of the big Semogues, so you get some precision for the firm knot, but lose some for the immense bulk of the Pro.If you absolutely cannot spend more than $10 on a shave brush, this is a better deal than the cheapo badgers, but just hope you get a non-perpetual smelly one. Or... get the 10049 for less money.Red handled Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush Given the pricing of the 10049, I really don't know why the 10048 is so popular. Unless you are an actual barber shaving customers at arm's length, there is no need to choose the 10048.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XGJIJZBZEM2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BWNR9A#wasThisHelpful","R1XGJIJZBZEM2Y","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1) This is an aftershave splash. For most users, the fragrance will last well less than an hour. If you have very oily skin and / or you douse yourself, you may get two hours. If you want to smell like something 4 or 8 hours after you use a product, get an EDT, not aftershave. Similarly, this does not project well, maybe a couple inches from your skin. Even if you douse yourself, you will not do much to increase the range. Again, if you want the folks at the club to smell you from 5 feet away, get an EDT.2) These scents, as honestly described by the maker on the website, are meant to emulate well known male fragrances. The models (and related Fibe scents) are: YSL Rive Gauche PH (American Blend),Terre D'Hermes (Orange Noir), Guerlain Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), Tom Ford Grey Vetiver (Clean Vetiver), and Creed's Aventus (Platinum). Snake Bite is unscented menthol, and Italian Citrus is no longer mentioned on the website, so no idea what that's supposed to be.3) So, related to the points above, if you already own one or more of the model fragrances, don't buy the related Fine aftershave. Even if you love the scent of Terre D'Hermes, Fine's variant does nothing to improve on the original, and lasts for like 45 minutes or so. If you own TDH, put something else on your face after you shave, and then squirt the TDH on after that. No need to duplicate the $50 EDT with a separate $15 aftershave!4) So to put # 3 another way, the main market for Fine splashes are guys who say ""heck no, I would never spend $X amount on smelling like sumptin"". For every dude, the X variable will be different. For those whose $X is $45, you can get anything in the line and get the smell of the higher price (briefly) for far less money. For me, my $X is higher, so I own TDH, Guerlain Vetiver, and Rive Gauche, but I would not pay Tom Ford $90 or Olivier Creed $250 for their products, so I own Fresh Vetiver and Platinum. This way, I can smell like smoky pineapple (briefly) for a fraction of the cost of the original.The chosen models are carefully selected to be tasteful unique classics (no Acqua Di Gio or Burberry here), and the scent design work here is pretty good. Fine duplicates the fragrance notes pretty well, but the scent pyramid is pretty highly condensed, as it would need to be for something with a 5% fragrance concentration.If you don't want to spend even $15 to smell like sumptin, well, there's always Pinaud and Old Spice, which are decent enough, but which lack menthol and smell comparatively ordinary.5) These products are not ideal for dry / sensitive skin. Alcohol and menthol do nothing to make skin better. They may not make it worse if you are tough skinned or use a moisturizer after the splash, but these definitely will not ""soothe"" or ""moisturize"" your skin. Even the menthol cooling effect is really just skin irritation that many find pleasant. If you want healthier and / or moister skin, you need to use a balm or supplement your splash with a moisturizer. Pro Raso White and Nivea Sensitive and Cooling balms are quite good, and they are all cheaper than Fine, but they do not smell like anything famous.6) How to apply: use a teaspoonful. Or cup the palm of a hand, fill the little hollow space in the middle with liquid. Rub your hands together for 3 seconds, and then turn your palms up for 4 seconds to air the alcohol. Then apply. If it stings a lot, you have given yourself a bad shave. The sting should be mild and brief followed by a cooling and tightening sensation. You should not be howling like Macaulay Culkin upon application.So given all the above, I like Fine. I know not everyone wants to spend money on male fragrances, and I like the fact that a guy can smell like Rive Gauche or Aventus for less than $20. Fine makes good stuff, and while ideally I'd like to see them stick some botanicals and / or moisturizing additives in here, I know that's unlikely to happen at this price point. (For those interested in the latter concept, try Barrister and Mann, artisan product not sold on Amazon (yet!) as he does complex splashes with useful additives, though admittedly at a higher price point than Fine.Fine accomplishes their mission, and they do it honestly and effectively. I'd like to see them try something more original, but what they have available now is just... Fine!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DVTUKCXZ4XLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4CR2MG#wasThisHelpful","R2DVTUKCXZ4XLZ","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AMENDED: Orijen charges $30 for 5 pounds of kibble; Wellness is trying to charge that same price for 2 pounds. Orijen looks like an even better bargain, but I will leave the star rating as is.My dad always used to say that when offered something that was unusual to his taste: sushi, curried chicken, turkey burgers... Our cat is like my Dad, except she doesn't offer the faint praise first, she just declines to eat. Hard for me to evaluate the food positively if kitty won't eat it. I nibbled a bite myself, and it was OK, not exactly enough to make me want to pour out a bowl for myself, but not loathsome either. Our cat eats EVO & Orijen dry foods, a few flavors of each, and she also likes somewhat less healthy ""junk food"" like Purina Pro Plan ""True Nature"". She is not especially picky about grain versus meat, or protein versus carbs, but she does not like this stuff.Kind of sad; the food is soft and seems moisturized, and the nutritional info makes the food look decent, though not great. Here is the content info from the mfgrs site:Deboned Chicken, Deboned Turkey, Peas, Gelatin, Natural Flavor, Tomato Pomace, Vegetable Glycerin, Pea Fiber, Salt, Dried Cultured Skim Milk, Sunflower Lecithin, Ground Flaxseed, Chicory Root Extract, Zinc Propoinate, Potassium Citrate, Choline Chloride, Calcium Chloride, Mixed Tocopherols added to preserve freshness, Cranberries, Cranberry Extract Powder, Cranberry Fiber, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Taurine, Ferrous Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, L-Carnitine, Calcium Carbonate, Niacin, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Chondroitin Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Thiamine Mononitrate, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Biotin, Calcium Iodate, Dried Kelp, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract, Spearmint Extract.Of the top 10 ingredients (which are the largest percentages of substances in the food) only 2 of 10 are meat, and there's also stuff like peas, gelatin, and tomato, which cats don't have much use for. If you compare this to Orijen Cat & Kitten food, you will see that Wellness is skimping a bit on ingredients. Orijen: Orijen: Boneless chicken, chicken meal, chicken liver, whole herring, boneless turkey, turkey meal, turkey liver, whole eggs, boneless walleye, whole salmon. No glycerin or pea fiber in that list!Here is the guaranteed analysis for Wellness Core Air Dried, also from their site:GUARANTEED ANALYSISCrude Protein (Min)32.00%Crude Fat (Min)22.00%Crude Fiber (Max)4.00%Moisture (Max)20.00%Calcium (Min)1.80%Phosphorus (Min)1.40%Magnesium (Min)0.060%Magnesium (Max)0.100%Vitamin E (Min)200 IU/kgTaurine* (Min) 0.10%L-Carnitine* (Min)100mg/kgOmega-6 Fatty Acids* (Min)5.00%Omega-3 Fatty Acids* (Min)0.50%Glucosamine* (Min)300 mg/kgNot too bad, about 16% carbs, assuming 8% ash, roughly comparable to Orijen.So how does the kibble crumble? Even if we discount my cat voting with her feet, this stuff is the same price as Orijen and uses much cheaper ingredients. The low carb content is good, and the food _looks_ and _smells_ attractive enough to me, but I ain't the one who has to eat it. If kitty liked it, I would have given it 4 stars, and if kitty liked it and there was less gelatin and peas in it, a fifth star would have been there for the taking. But as formulated and priced, and with kitty not thinking much of it, three stars seems generous. Most buyers would be better off with Orijen at this price point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUVY8O0WRBSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ03O0E#wasThisHelpful","ROUVY8O0WRBSM","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regular Aveeno Daily Moisturizer is my go to moisturizer for most uses. I use it after shaving, use it on dry skin in the winter, and on occasional mild eczema spots on myself and my daughter. The oatmeal does a great job of soothing redness and irritation, and the relatively simple and comedogenic ingredient list makes Aveeno one of the few moisturizers I can use on my overly sensitive face without sting or irritation.The one problem with Aveeno Daily is that it tends to be relatively thick and greasy. Not as greasy as CeraVe or Aquaphor, but a little bit so. Fortunately, this minor deficiency is addressed in the Sheer Hydration variant being reviewed here. Sheer Hydration (hereafter SH) goes on much drier than Daily Moisturizer standard, and is easier to work into the skin quickly. Rather than spending 5 minutes of working 4 squirts of Aveeno standard into my face, SH can be applied in less than 2 minutes. It seems to offer the same soothing and moisturizing benefit of the standard formula, but leaves a smoother ""crisper"" skin feel and can be applied more quickly.Sounds like a win, right? Pretty much it is; the scent is slightly different from standard, but both are pretty much ""unscented"" for most noses. The only issue is that SH costs more than daily standard and although SH is claimed to offer more benefits, in my short term comparison of both, I don't see a big difference other than the quicker application and smoother post-use feel. These are not insubstantial benefits, especially for those who want to use Aveeno on their face but don't like its (admittedly minor) greasiness. I would think people with oily skin would prefer SH.Both SH and daily standard have a hard time remediating really dry skin or moderate to severe eczema, and folks suffering from those ailments probably want to invest in something more powerful. (I like CeraVe and Gold Bond Replenishing CoQ10 for those issues.) But assuming you need a pretty mild moisturizer / cheap post shave balm, this is a great product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4UQGZGI5DHV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFR14ZU#wasThisHelpful","R4UQGZGI5DHV6","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As compared to Cool Water, (the role model for most male fresh aquatics) I found Eternity Aqua (hereafter EA) to be more interesting and less artificially pungent. EA begins with a great cucumber lotus accord that smells pretty unique, but sadly these notes are gone in less than 15 minutes. One is left with the all too common aquatic drydown of calone and cedar, with hints of lavender. Still, the calone (artificial melon) notes are underplayed here versus Cool Water or Nautica Voyage, and so this fragrance was less unpleasant for the intermediate term. (Both Voyage and Cool Water make me want to wash them off after about an hour or so, but EA was less annoying by far.)Biggest problem with EA is longevity and projection. The longevity issue is a common one with male aquatics, and EA is very representative of that deficiency. The whole show is over in less than four hours, and the fragrance is close to being a skin scent in less than two hours. This is basically a cologne lifespan at an EDT price, but this longevity issue is pretty much par the course for this school of fragrances. If you want a long lasting aquatic, try Bulgari's ""Aqua"", but that is a darker more complex scent that is not as ""fresh"" as EA or its comparable short lifespan brethren.The projection is also quite weak, which makes this good for the workplace, bad for clubs and other social settings where one might want to be smelled. Both Cool Water and Voyage project better, so if you want to reach out and touch someone's scent receptors from more than an arm's length away, EA is not the best choice.This to me is between three and four stars. The sweeter opening and somewhat less artificial drydown are pluses compared to other fresh aquatics, and I like the cucumber and lotus notes, but they are all too brief. The fragrance as a whole could last longer, and the quickly departing top notes only add to the disappointment. If you like aquatics and want something a bit less strident, this is a good choice. I'm rounding up to four stars because I'm a sucker for cucumber smells.Of course, I would also suggest not wearing aquatics at all. These are mainly weak, dull, and simple scents. I suggest trying something with more oomph and interest, like Dior Homme, Aramis 900, or Polo, but then of course you won't smell like every other male aged 16-30 out there. Whether that is a good or bad thing, I will leave up to you to decide!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KASJ8XQD0LSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JVRIM0#wasThisHelpful","R2KASJ8XQD0LSL","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had seen this compared to GRR Martin and Bacigalupi science fantasy stuff, so I entered this with unrealistic expectations, which were soon cruelly dashed. More mysteriously, I read some of Liu's short fiction and liked it, and this novel reads almost as if it was written by a different author, one with a worse ear for dialogue and a less keen sense for plotting.Grace of Kings reads rather like an attempt at crossbreeding Homer with Chinese legends, and to my ears at least, it generally fails. To me it seems almost as though Liu had some pre-conceived notions as to the mono-dimensional nature of his characters, and makes efforts to conform their portrayals throughout so that they seem either larger than life, or similar to cardboard cutouts, depending on how kind-hearted the interpreter is. After Ice and Fire, epic fantasy has been transformed into something more realistic (for better or worse) and having the hero always be brave or wily or kind, and / or the villains always be wicked and vicious wears on one quickly.There seem to be few real living breathing characters in here; even the minor characters seem like automatons and plot points. Example: kind hearted crown prince gets forged note from dying Emperor's evil adviser telling the Prince to kill himself by order of the Emperor. ""Oh, Ok"", says crown prince and kills himself within 2 minutes of getting the note. I don't care what culture you are portraying or what legend you are referencing, that's just bad writing and plotting!I am reminded of the stuff I used to read in high school when I was a kid, like Terry Brooks and the Belgariad series by David Eddings, etc. If that sort of unidimensional black vs white stuff still holds interest for you, you might enjoy this. There's lots of action, the quasi-Asian setting is interesting, and the detailed world building is nice, especially in terms of the pantheon of gods and their various interests, influences, and schemes. There is no real science fantasy element here despite the airships mentioned, so this is more in the realm of (workmanlike) high fantasy.I found Grace of Kings disappointing, but admit this is mainly because I like my fantasy darker, grittier, and more complex. Liu is aiming to simulate both Chinese historical epic and a gentler, kinder (and dumber) sort of fantasy novel, of the sort that was more popular 20-30 years ago. This is like a G or PG rated epic, as compared to the R rated Ice and Fire epic that modern tastes are more accustomed to.

"Compared this to a Vornado 733 air circulator that sells for more than twice the price, and the ILG8F12 (hereafter F12) is semi-competitive. The 733 is very ugly and loud, but produces a good amount of air. However the plastic blade guard fell off during the first year of ownership and now rests over the blades without any locks holding it it place, so it falls off whenever the fan is moved. The Vornado impressed in technical performance but not in build quality, and it is dreadfully ugly. The worse thing is the noise though as the 733 drowns out a TV on normal volume at its high or medium setting.The F12 in comparison looks a lot nicer, and the all steel cage design is charmingly retro. The fan speed is comparable to the 733, but the absence of any air channeling framework means the F12 cannot match the Vornado in terms of absolute volume of air moved. However, the F12 is decent, certainly better than the cheapest small Vornado, and it is also much quieter even at high speed. Build quality is kind of ""meh"" on the F12 though, as the rubber feet meant to mount on the frame's bottom for added stability and reduced vibration didn't fit, and the fan sometimes moves its angle of elevation in the stand if you tap it or even walk near it.So ultimately, the F12 design is attractive, build quality mediocre, performance respectable (about what you would expect for this price range) and the quiet motor is a big selling point. For the same price as a Vornado 733, you could get 2.3 of these F12 fans, which would move more air, would create less noise, would look less ugly, and could be separated into different areas as needed.

"Saw this in TJ Maxx for twenty clams and thought ""hmm, this was compared to the discontinued ""Gucci Pour Homme"" that everyone on Basenotes raves about, and it has synthetic oud in it, the scent element du jour of a few years ago which is now quite rare in mens colognes. I have nothing with oud in it and would love to see what Gucci PH smelled like. What a bargain!"". Yep, bad thinking there, self.When a company known for its fragrances notes that product XYZ is not selling well, they just kill it, because they figure if they turn it into utter s***e by reformulating it down to the less than a dollar ingredient cost per bottle, they will embarrass the company name. When a company not really known for its fragrances notes declining sales, they reach a different conclusion... Hence, the current version of Dirty English. Juicy Couture could care less what you think about their parfums as long as you buy their tight pants, so they don't mind ripping off money from fools. The reformulation of this already cheap product has been farmed out to cynical mercenaries who seem to have produced a product that is mostly carrier oil and alcohol, with some immensely uninspired fragrance elements stuck in to appease the undemanding.Not sure what appeal this had when it was fresh, new to the market, and selling well. Maybe back then it smelled exactly like Gucci PH, maybe back then you could smell the oud, the leather, the booze, the vetiver, the breath of angels, whatever. Now, you smell mostly alcohol, cheap cedar, and cheaper musk. These are not pleasant smells in the least. The current version of Dirty English is a vile brew, redeemed only by the fact that it fades quickly and does not project. Axe smells nicer and costs less.Even the bottle is cheaper now, no cute little chain and charm, just fake plastic chain twining around the cap and no charm at all. This is a badge of shame for the proud owner of this overpriced junk to gaze upon and despair over. This is not worth the $20 I paid for it at TJ Maxx, and is certainly not worth more than that. You would get a better bargain for your money by buying bottles of Old Spice and Brut, which have about the same sillage and longevity, but at least smell like they cost $2 or $3 per bottle to make instead of $0.79.I will try to reign in my bright ideas the next time I walk through TJ Maxx and will focus instead on the bath and body section which has products that at least do not smell like industrial accidents in distilleries.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM39FO6TT1OX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FWXIC4#wasThisHelpful","R2BM39FO6TT1OX","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ungaro III was designed by two heavy hitting perfume designers in the mid-point of their career. Besides this, the internet fragrance community is full of reviews about the ""unique vodka note"" and ""dark Gothic rose"" to be smelled here, etc. etc.Well, not sure how U3 used to smell, but it is a waste of money these days, except possibly for cheapskate fans of Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme, who will find a fairly inexpensive echo of the more expensive fragrance here. Unfortunately D&G PH does nothing for me, so U3 is not even of use to me even as a clone.  I'm not sure how or when this was reformulated from whatever more interesting original has been cited on the internet, but what's left will be of little interest to anyone.U3 opens with a blast of cheap pungent alcohol; not ""vodka"" but rather cheap rubbing alcohol. This lasts for a few unpleasant minutes and then settles into the heart notes of lavender, sage, and geranium. The lavender and sage are emphasized, which is where the DGPH resemblance comes in. The dry down is also similar in that both have sandalwood and cedar notes featured prominently, but unfortunately for both U3 & DGPH, it's the rather cheap synthetic cedar tone which permeates.Rose, vetiver, musk, and lily of the valley exist only in the scent pyramid text of U3, not anywhere olfactorially  in the fragrance. Lavender and sage transitioning into cedar and sandalwood is done all too frequently in men's perfume, and none of the exotic tones raved about on Basenotes etc. is to be found here. Moreover, the fragrance loses its projection quickly and becomes a skin scent in well less than 4 hours.DGPH though about twice the price of U3 has a little bit more to offer. It projects like a lighthouse for 6-8 hours (which can be a good or bad thing) and offers a richer drydown (some tobacco and tonka bean in there) and better top notes (citrus notes rather than isopropyl). The heart notes are most similar, and as stated, I don't like either, but if you like DGPH and don't want to pay full price for it, U3 may be a cheaper alternative.For the rest of the market, move along, there's nothing to see here. If you want to get something decent for this same price range, Grey Flannel, Havana, Aramis 900 etc all give you far more complex and pleasant smells for the same price or less. No gothic rose, no vodka, just rubbing alcohol, sage, and cedar. Ungaro should pull the plug on this dull disappointment, but apparently a few fish are still biting, in search of complexity and subtlety that no longer exist in this iteration of the product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5LR2C7N56B3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C1W6P4#wasThisHelpful","R5LR2C7N56B3Y","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Neil Gaiman, but his ""American Gods"" was vastly disappointing to me. Intriguing premise, good writing, dark tone --- but very erratic, devolving into travelogue, nostalgia, low comedy -- the concept of earth bound gods warring and interacting with each other and the world of mortals was poorly developed and not fully utilized, and the small intimate tone and slow turgid pace convinced me that American Gods could and should have been better.Well ""Library at Mount Char"" (hereafter ""LAMC"") is what American Gods should have been, Equally intriguing, lots of twists and turns in the plot, consistent tone, and a roller coaster of a plot with tons of action and a vast scope. You will not be bored reading this, and you will feel that the premise was so good and execution so well done that a extra couple of hundred pages in the volume would have been welcome. (Imagine that! A fantasy novel that is too short.. a rare thing!)The idea of scholar apprentices of a dark arbitrary god figure is a pretty neat one. The mystery at the core of the plot is a good one, and the characters are mostly well done. We don't get to know or care about all of the apprentices, but the ones central to the plot are well portrayed and we care about / hate them as intended. The humans we meet are also well done, and the interactions between ""gods"" and men are logically done and unpredictable.There are also plot points that are thoroughly unpredictable and yet also stunningly well done set pieces. Unlike ""American Gods"", where the comings and goings of the immortals are barely witnessed by humans, the mortal world is intimately and viscerally connected with the doings of the inhabitants of Mount Char, and the cataclysmic events inherent in a war / death of the gods scenario are not avoided in the intricate plot. If you like broad scopes and lots of stuff getting messed up in your fantasy, this one will serve the bill. It makes the average Godzilla movie seem like random street crime in comparison!More importantly, this book, unlike all too many modern fantasy novels, is self contained and is not merely volume one of an infinite series of 1,000 page tomes. (Martin and Jordan, I'm looking at y'all...). The plot fits in one volume, though as stated, it could have nee twice as long and still would not seem stale, and yet the world created and plot revealed are so interesting that further volumes would not be overly derivative and would be most welcome to me, another rare thing in modern fantasy, where the snail's pace and hordes of picayune details make wading through each new dootstop as much a chore as a pleasure even to fans.Best of all (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!) I like how the love story of Carolyn and Steve does not end happily. Hawkins must have been quite tempted to pave the road to happiness for our star crossed (literally, heh!) lovers, but admirably, he realizes that sub-plot would not work and so he doesn't force it to. This alone shows more maturity and skill than most new writers, genre or otherwise! What does happen instead to Steve and Carolyn in their different quests and arcs is ever more interesting and satisfying than the usual ""amor vincit omnia"" efforts that most fantasy writers succumb to.Hawkins has talent to burn, and does not make a single misstep here. What deficiencies that exist are almost certainly the result of limits set by the publisher / editor. There are too many apprentices floating around, few of whom matter, The abilities of the apprentices could have used more development and logical explanation, as sometimes the powers we see are kind of deus ex machina plot devices, but considering the subject matter, this is not inappropriate! Still, it seems as if there are too many ""godlings"" wandering about and the ""rules"" that they operate under are a bit sketchy.Also, the scope of events portrayed does exceed the stage a bit. (The ""Henry V Syndrome"" as noted by Shakespeare...) Hawkins does have a pretty capable muse of fire, but still multiple nuclear strikes, reality plagues, rising eldritch forces, solar eclipses... all seem a bit too crammed in less than 400 pages when GRR Martin can take 50 pages to tell you what Tyrion had to eat at the feast... I presume the page limit was set by the publisher, as new authors rarely get 750 page allowances for stand alones. If your bloated 750 pager is volume one of a trilogy, hey that's (usually) ok, new guiy, but a standalone first time novel would not he allocated such a high page count.If anything, it's amazing that LAMC works as well as it does considering its page count, and again, I commend Hawkins for not taking the Lazy Fantasy Author approach and say ""well, I'll wrap things up in the next two volumes. Or maybe three volumes. Or maybe 7 volumes. Or maybe..."":Anyway, 5 stars easily. If you are sensitive to violence or abuse of various types in books or if you like your fantasy gentle and light, stay away, and if you want a completely logical fantasy world, you may also have complaints, but all other fantasy fans will enjoy this, especially those who wished ""American Gods"" had a bit more of a superhero movie feel to it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH4JPBOY9PEZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418602#wasThisHelpful","RH4JPBOY9PEZ4","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Apparently Z14 used to be a very complex and interesting masculine scent. It did not do well in the market, and oak moss, one of its key foundation ingredients, was basically banned by the fragrance regulatory authority, so these two facts have led to a very cheap reformulation that is not especially complex or interesting.

"Nivea Sensitive Shaving balm (non-cooling) has always been an example of good bang for the buck in shaving balms. At around $5 a bottle online, the Nivea standard Sensitive balm works about as well at calming the skin as much more expensive balms (e.g. ProRaso, three times the price and Jack Black, 4 times the price). It also works much better than costly all organic formulas, such as Pacific Shaving Company's Caffeinated after shave (close to 80% more) and Body Shop's Razor Relief (close to 3 times the price.) Nivea standard Sensitive formula had only two drawbacks: it used witch hazel, an astringent, that some don't care for because it stings a little bit for a short while, and it also was not much of a moisturizer. Note that if you have dry skin, no post shave balm can really replace use of a second moisturizer, but even so, the standard Nivea Sensitive worked very poorly in terms of keeping your face moist after use for the intermediate term.The new Sensitive Cooling formula costs a little more, but fixes the small issues that existed in the original. Specifically, no witch hazel, and it also moisturizes significantly better, but note if you are a dry skinned dude, you will need to apply moisturizer after the balm unless you want your complexion to to look like Clint Eastwood's in an hour or two after shaving. Sensitive Cooling also has a neat trick, mainly it creates a cooling sensation on the face which lasts for a half hour or so after application. More interestingly, it creates this cooling without menthol. Menthol cools, but also hurts the skin at the same time, so if you have really delicate skin, the menthol may irritate even as it cools. The Nivea Sensitive Cooling at least tn theory gives you all the cool and none of the irritation. (I don't know what ingredient in the Cooling balm does the cooling work, so I am not 100% sure that whatever is cooling is not also an irritant to some degree, but on my face at least all is well!)Highly recommended as a cheap effective and pleasant way to calm and cool your sensitive skinned face after a shave. I am one of those masochistic double edged blade guys who make three passes over their face every morning to get a clean shave, so if this works for me, it will be more than enough for all you single pass fusion dudes. Use this with some tallow based shaving soap (Tabac is great here on Amazon, or try Barrister and Mann for a non-Amazon artisanal product) and then put on some Aveeno for a moisturizer, and you will have a smooth, comfortable, and cheap shave!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M3RFRPMY0CDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2MYU1U#wasThisHelpful","R3M3RFRPMY0CDO","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't have rosacea, just occasional post shave irritation and redness. Sad to say, this product is utterly useless for alleviating that problem. It is a watery, unscented fluid that left my face as red after application as it was before use. There are much cheaper alternatives for men who need to fix shaving related redness - try Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Cooling balm, which is about half the price of this, or Proraso Sensitive Skin Aftershave balm, the white stripe bottle, which is about 30% cheaper than the PC option.I do like Paula's choice shave cream, but that product is both cheaper and more effective at its purpose.

"Ellena is an immensely talented creative artist, and his work in perfume is fascinating, but this book is dreadful and useless. Ellena does little to explain the technical side of perfumery, and his discussion of both his own and other perfumes is cursory and banal. This is a brief, dull, vague read, and is not even worth a library rental. Perfumes and their culture are explored with great depth on the internet by some really talented bloggers - check out Now Smell This, Bois de Jasmin, and Perfume Shrine to name just several sites. These blogs give you several dozen times more info on materials, manufacture, history and typology than this book does, contain incisive detailed analyses of fragrances, and are also better written. They are also completely free and have many nice pictures to look at... No contest!If you must have a book on perfume, the two books on the subject by Chandler Burr are notable, as is the Perfume Encyclopedia by Turin and Sanchez. Again, a lot more info, and better writing. I think this book was cynically marketed by Ellena and his publisher on the theory that readers would assume an interesting parfumeur would create the assumption that his book would also be interesting.

"The Futur on its lowest setting exposes more blade than the Progess does on its highest setting. For classic Gillette adjustable owners, setting 9 of 9 on the Fatboy or Slim is roughly the same as setting 2 of 6 on the Futur. Plus the Futur is immensely heavy, about 25% heavier than a Progess or a Fatboy. This adds up to a mighty aggressive shaver!In my particular case, I can only use the least sharp blades in the Futur (aka Derby & Merkur) at the lowest possible setting (1 of 6). If I use some sharper blade (Personna Blue, Gillette 7 O'Clock Yellows, or even an Astra SP) or dare to crank the dial up to 2 of 6, aaargggh! Lobster face, razor burn for hours, even without any blood. So I can use 1 or 2 types of blades in this, and on only 1 of 6 settings. (There are half point settings as well, but even 1.5 is gap too far for me...) To me, this is not really an adjustable, as I always have to use the same setting and only certain types of blades, unless I want to rip my face off.Lest you think me unmanly or inexpert, I will say I have used razors that are heavy (Maggard MR8) and some that are known for having aggressive heads (Parker 92R, Weber PH) and I can get smooth skin and a non-lobster face using those razors with all sorts of blades. It's only the Futur that causes me red-faced grief. Of course, in the wet shaving world, we have our flint-bearded Vikings, who have metallic stubble and shave once every several days. If you are one of these types, this may be your razor and maybe you can enjoy different blades and settings.I like the adjustable concept as it gives users a lot of customization options and the ability to mix exposure up during different shave passes. Most users who want this feature set and do not want a deply abraded face would be better off with the Merkur Progress, or a vintage Gillette adjustable if you can get one at a reasonable price (think Super or Slim, not Fatboy!) but for most, the Progress will be the most affordable solution and that model is well made and offers a usable range of adjustment at a cheaper price than the Futur.I feel bad rating the Futur poorly. It is well made, and I have none of the usual complaints. The head does indeed fit into the nooks and crannies of my face well enough, and I find blade replacement to be both simple and safe.

"I have another comparably sized battery pack made by Amazon Basic, which I liked, but the Amazon unit was 10% less powerful and also costs close to 10% more. The Luggage Box (hereafter LB) is a little bit less luxurious than the Amazon product, which comes in a soft velvet bag with drawstrings, but the LB includes a nice small LED flashlight integrated into the unit that can run off the internal charge to give you illumination in emergencies. I like this feature more than some silly bag, so thumbs up to Luggage Box for a unique and useful extra feature!I ran the LB down several times with various devices, and it seems to reliably charge and distribute the power amount that is claimed. You can also charge two devices at once from the power pack, as there are two USB outlets. The unit is tough and sturdy, and did not get hot or smell bad during power charging / discharging.My only complaints? LB does not include any Apple compatible cabling or any sort of wall charger, so you have to provide those devices yourself. LB also only gives you a single USB cable to use, despite the two USB outputs. Amazon Basic's unit has these exact same shortcomings, though at a higher price and with less of a power reserve, so I did not take off any stars for these deficiencies as they seem to be the industry standard set or rather non-standards!The only remaining issue is that of style. The Amazon unit looks rather like a cell phone, while the LB unit does indeed look like a suitcase, and is bulkier and somewhat heavier. The ribbed texture is interesting to look at and makes LB grippier if you do need to use it as a flashlight. I like the looks of the Amazon unit more, but this is pretty subjective. I would suggest getting the LB in black though, as the white color is a tad too industrial looking to be charming.**FREE SAMPLE PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER FOR EVALUATION**","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTTV4FLMDTM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OROKPDW#wasThisHelpful","RVTTV4FLMDTM5","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tide Colorguard does an impressive job of getting stains out even with a very small volume of product dispensed. It is also a very effective pre-wash, and I've gotten better results with rubbing Tide into a stained garment than I have had by using OxyClean and other specifically designated stain removers. Tide HE also works well with cold water washing (even though the product's instructions do not specifically state this) so environmentally conscious launderers can feel good about the ability to use less power and also get clean clothing.I've tried many different detergents over my life, and I've always been reluctant to use Tide because it costs so much more than other brands. Through many misadventures, I've come to see the virtue of using Tide even though it does cost more. Having to rewash inadequately cleaned loads or write off stained clothing with stains that have set permanently more than offsets the lower costs of using other brands or generics. I spend the extra money on Tide and feel there's a real benefit from doing so. (The ability to use the basic detergent as a spot treatment / stain remover is more value added.)I can't speak as to how well ColorGuard preserves colors in washed clothing (which is one of the major selling points of this formula) as this is my first bottle of this particular Tide mix. I normally use a different variant of Tide for reasons to be discussed below.Why not four stars? The color of the liquid is a weird pinkish orange that looks nasty if spilled, but that is not a real detriment. Issue number one for me is the rather sharp and cloying scent. I prefer my detergents unscented, but I know many folks think ""that smell = clean"". Even if you are in this positivist camp, the odor of Colorguard is a bit too bright and artificial for most. One gets accustomed to it, but I would still prefer no scent at all or a more mild one.Biggest issue with Colorguard is the measuring cup / cap. The dark cap has a virtually invisible set of measuring lines in it, so even with the highly visible Colorguard liquid being poured into it, I can rarely tell if I am at the appropriate level of mix for my load of wash. The lines are not clearly marked at all, and the black interior cap compounds this issue. With HE formula, it's easy to get too much detergent in the load, leading to sudsy and greasy residues, so clear measuring lines are essential. I haven't had any mishaps so far with my basic eyeballing of volume, (err on the side of caution and you should be OK, especially if you've used HE type formulas before) but it is a silly oversight for Tide not to give one a clearly marked and useful measuring cup for premium brand detergent. If you're using your own measuring cup, this won't be an issue, but I found it annoying.So all in all, premium cleaning power, and high efficiency are the main selling points. If you are concerned about your colors fading and don't mind a slightly overpowering scent, you should be well pleased with Tide Colorguard HE. (Though you may want to use your own measuring cup!)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ZMZ50CE79XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGZCGA2#wasThisHelpful","R24ZMZ50CE79XV","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My experience with battery powered grooming devices is that they never have enough ""oomph"" to get the job done, at least not for male users like myself. I've used a variety of those little weed wacker gadgets to trim nose hair that never do the trick, or at least not as well as scissors. Electric shavers need to be run forever over my thick stubble to work, and a Fusion manual does a better job in half the time. So when I ordered this electric pedicure device to use on my callused feet, I did not expect much and thought a pumice stone would easily best the Amope gadget.To my surprise, the Amope proved really effective at getting rid of thick calluses, quickly and painlessly. The tougher areas of my feet needed a bit of extra going over, but certainly not more than 10 or 20 seconds for even the ridgiest of areas. This is more than the 3 or 4 seconds the Amope manual suggests you spend on each area, but I did not feel any pain or friction even with 10 or 15 seconds of application. I wouldn't grind away for a minute, but I think 3 or 4 seconds is probably a tad conservative. Be sure to use the PP on dry feet though; wet skin might change the effectiveness for the worse and could also lead to possible injury from over-sloughing.The smoothing effect seems to last for a while, so I could not give an estimate as to battery life. The Pedi Perfect is quiet, and has a pretty simple learning curve. I was impressed at how easy the PP was to clean, and cleaning was really quick also.The PP is a lot more effective and easy to use than a pumice stone or a PediEgg. What took 15 minutes to do to a mostly smooth surface with a pumice stone could be done to a smoother level in a third of the time with the Amope gadget. This is a clear case of better living through electricity!Downside? The PP produces a cloud of skin dust as you use it, so be sure to be in a well ventilated area and be aware you will need to clean some callus dust up after the fact. Not sure how they could have fixed this, so I am not taking any point off for it. Plus of course you have to use a lot of batteries over the life of the product to keep it running. Alternate A/C power mode and / or an internal rechargeable battery would have made this a better product.The Pedi Perfect lost a star for me due to price, as I think the current price point is a tad too dear for what you get. Though the PP works well, I think it is overpriced given its relatively low tech level and ongoing need for batteries as the only method for power. But if you don't mind the price, this works great even for those with nasty calluses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N1NE4EIRI4PJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LE99PA2#wasThisHelpful","R3N1NE4EIRI4PJ","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used this keyboard for a few weeks now.  Before this I've been using a non-keyboard case with my iPad Air, a Devicewear Slim iPad Air Case.  I also have and use on occasion a Logitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad when I want a BT keyboard to pair with my iPads.Here are some of my thoughts on this Belkin Thin Type keyboard case.DESIGN/BUILDI do not love all aspects of the design of this case.Yes, I agree the aluminum build of this keyboard gives this keyboard a nice substantial feel to it (personally preferable to the feel of a plastic case) yet without making it feel heavy (the case is lighter than the iPad Air).  Plus.Also the design and styling seem to nicely complement that of the iPad Air when being used in ""keyboard"" mode.  We have the Gray version of the case and a Space Gray iPad Air and while the aluminum of our iPad seems slightly darker than the aluminum of the keyboard case, they do go nicely, if not perfectly, together and look like they were made to go together.  Another plus.However, (note the qualifier in the previous paragraph), I am not a fan of the look of the keyboard case when it is being used in ""case"" mode as a cover for the iPad.  Specifically, I do not like the look of the bottom of the keyboard, which serves as the outside of the cover when the item is being used as an iPad case.The back of the iPad itself is of course minimalist with the Apple logo in the middle and a black strip at the top, which, while not ideal, I don't find too distracting.  However, the outside face of the Thin Type Keyboard case has a big black plastic strip (about 1.5"" wide on a case that is only 6.5"" wide) running along the long side of the cover right along the entire length of the hinge.  Further, there is also a raised aluminum ridge that runs right next to that from top to bottom of the case.  (Note, this ridge on cover is the under side of the slot that holds the iPad when the case is being used in ""keyboard"" mode.  So there is a reason for this ridge.  The keyboard is so thin it does not have the necessary depth for the slot without this.)I understand that the black plastic strip probably helps add to the stability of the unit when the iPad is inserted in keyboard mode and that it probably also helps to provide a comfortable elevated angle to the keyboard so that it does not completely lie flat on the table when in keyboard mode.  However, honestly, I find it a bit ugly.  For some reason I find it a bit aesthetically offensive, as if all the design effort went into the keyboard side but then they forgot they had to do something with the other side too.  It seems as if the look of the product when being used as a case was a bit of an after thought.Yes, the black and aluminum colors match those of the iPad, but the same design aesthetic is not there.  I don't know how they would have solved the issues of being able to support the iPad in keyboard mode or maintaining a comfortable keyboard elevation without these elements, but I think the cover side would have looked more consistent with the Apple aesthetic if it were more elegant.  Perhaps they could have made the unit a wedge shape.  Yes, it would have been heavier and not as thin, but it may have looked nicer overall.  The way it is, whenever I look at the front cover of this Belkin case, I think I'm looking at, well, . . . the bottom of a keyboard.Not to put too fine a point on it, but it is interesting to note that there is not a single full on picture of the ""case"" side of the item on the product page either on Amazon's or even on Belkin's own site.  You don't even get a glimpse of it on the video on the Amazon product page.  Neither is the case side shown on Belkin's own site in their inspirational product teaser video, which gives you lots of artsy views of the sleekness of the keyboard side, even a close up of the Belkin label and microphone button, but nary a glimpse of the other side.  I guess when Belkin ends by saying that ""Typing has never looked this good,"" they chose not to mention that carrying the iPad around in their keyboard case will not look very good at all!I also don't like the look of the magnetic hinge.However, some people may not really care what the product looks like on the outside.  Believe it or not, I'm actually more of a function guy myself, so let's move on to some functional observations.KEYBOARDSizeIt's very nice that Belkin fit the keyboard within the footprint of the iPad Air.  And it works as a full keyboard.  It is, of course, smaller than a standard sized keyboard and, no, I don't feel like I'm typing on a laptop keyboard.  But, being realistic and keeping in mind the size constraints necessary to make the cover fit the footprint of the iPad Air, the size feels alright.So as long as you have reasonable sized expectations (and fingers) you should be OK.  If you have big, meaty paws, this may not be for you.  I do have to bring my fingers closer together on the Thin Type compared to when using a standard Apple Bluetooth keyboard so that they are almost, but not quite, touching each other when in typing home position.  When I transfer my hands from home position on the Apple BT keyboard to the Thin Type keeping the same position and not adjusting my finger spacing, my pinkies end up on the Caps Lock and Enter keys on the Thin Type keyboard.For reference, the edge to edge width of the outermost keys is 8.74"" on the Belkin Thin type and almost 10.75"" on a standard Apple Bluetooth keyboard (and almost 11"" on a Logitech Tablet Keyboard for iPad).The action on the keyboard is fine.LayoutHowever, as some others have mentioned, to get somewhat reasonable sizing of and spacing between the keys, they have taken some liberties with the layout of the keyboard.  The alt/option and command buttons are now only found on the left side of the space bar, not on both sides as they normally are.  I'm not sure if the control button still exists on the keyboard anymore (unless the key to the right of the space bar with the globe icon is the control button).Eliminating duplicate function type keys is reasonable (and I hope the control button wasn't eliminated and is that button with the globe icon), but what I was less forgiving of was the relocation of one of the standard character keys.As others have pointed out, the semi-colon/colon (;/:) button has been moved.  It has been moved from its rightful place between the (L) and (`/"") buttons two whole rows down to the right of the space bar.  In fact, it now shares the key with the icon of the globe, which was mentioned earlier.Any hunt-and-peckers or non-PC folk (non-punctuationally-correct) out there may not see what all the fuss is about, but for those touch typists who are accustomed to keys being where they thought they would be, trust me, this can be a bit of an annoyance.The (\/|) key has also been eliminated and relegated to ""Fn"" status on the ([/{) and (]/}) keys, respectively.  But no one really cares about that key.Special Keys: The Good, The Bad, and The ?Other than the changes to the layout of the more standard character keys, there are also an array of 15 special keys at the top where various function keys are normally found.Some of these are standard, things like volume/mute buttons (buttons 12-14) and play/pause/fwd/rev buttons (buttons 9-11).Others are nice additions (The Good) customized for a tablet, even specifically an iPad, keyboard.  They add nice functionality tailored for use with the iPad.For example:*The 1st button (looks like a square), functions as the home button on an iPad.  When you push it when you are in an app, it takes you back to the home screen.  It's nice to not have to reach up to push real home button on the iPad.*The next button (looks like a lock) locks your iPad instantly when you push it, the equivalent of closing a smart cover.  I guess that's nice if you want to quickly lock your iPad without having to reassemble the Belkin case and you don't want to wait around for it to go to the lock screen on its own.  The other nice thing is that you can wake a sleeping iPad by pressing almost any key on the keyboard (except from some reason the Fn key) AND you can enter your pass code on the lock screen using the keyboard.  It seems to go straight to the ""Enter Passcode"" screen without requiring the initial swipe.*The 3rd button (looks like a film strip) is the equivalent of double pressing the home button and gives you a strip view of recently used apps so you can quickly switch between them.*The 5th button (looks like a dashed line rectangle with a cross hair in one corner) essentially takes a picture for you.  If you are in the camera app, it will snap a pic from whichever camera is active.  If you are not in camera mode, it will take a screenshot of whatever is on your screen.  (Cool tip: you can even use it while you are playing a video (from YouTube, the web, a streaming app like Vudu, or your iTunes video library) and it will take a screen shot of your video!)  All pics are saved in your camera roll.*The last (15th) button is a Pair button that makes pairing your iPad and keyboard a snap.Then, there are some other buttons whose utility is a bit more questionable (The Bad):-The 4th button (looks like the keyboard icon that pulls up the touch keyboard on your iPad screen) . . . pulls up the touch keypad on your iPad screen.  Huh?  Why you would want to pull up the touch keypad on your iPad, using a dedicated button no less, from your external keyboard, which you presumably got to not have to use said touch keypad, I don't know.  Maybe you really want to use the currency symbols for the British pound, the euro, or the Japanese yen, the only characters that I can see that are available on the touch keypad (2 layers deep) but not on the Belkin keyboard.And, finally, there are some keys which I still don't know what they do (The ?).  (Buttons 6-8 that look like old TV sets with a star, X, and + symbols in them, I'm looking at you!)  I'm also not sure how the button with the microphone icon down in the lower right works.  Yes, I'm assuming it operates a microphone, but I'm not sure how to use it.  (See the ""INSTRUCTIONS"" section below).ON/OFF SWITCHBelkin likes to point out that the Thin Type Keyboard Case has an automatic on/off switch.  The keyboard is automatically activated from its off mode when you insert the iPad into its slot in the keyboard.  No switch to fumble with, no forgetting to shut keyboard off and so accidentally drain all your battery life unnecessarily, what's not to like?The switch itself is a little rubber enclosed pressure trigger that sits in the middle of the iPad slot.  When you place your iPad in the slot, the weight of the iPad depresses the trigger and activates the keyboard.  When you remove the iPad, the trigger is released and the keyboard automatically shuts off.  This seems very convenient, and it is.However, I would personally prefer the ability to force the keyboard to stay on, even if there is no iPad inserted into the slot.  The reason is that I could see myself using this keyboard without the iPad inserted in the slot (see below).  However, there is no easy way to do this.  You can force the keyboard to stay on by depressing the on/off button with something else.  Anything that can hold down the button will do.  For example, you could use your finger, but that doesn't work well for typing.  Standard sized pens and pencils won't do it.  As I said, there is no easy way to do this.I would have preferred if they added one small switch that had OFF/AUTO/ON settings.  That way, if you wanted to use it in the automatic on/off mode the way they designed it, you could.  But if you wanted to force it on (see below under VIEWING ANGLE) or off (in case you wanted to make sure it didn't accidentally get turned on somehow), you could also select those options as well.PAIRINGThe process of pairing the keyboard to the iPad is very easy in the initial pairing (just follow the included instructions).Subsequent connections after the initial pairing are automatic.  You don't have to do anything except put the iPad into the slot.Now, I don't know what would happen if you paired the keyboard to multiple iPads and they were both nearby.  And I did have one bit of trouble when I tried to turn off the Bluetooth on the iPad (so that I could pair different keyboard and iPad combos), and when I turned the BT back on, it didn't re-establish the connection automatically.  However, when I just made the iPad forget the device and redid the initial pairing it worked fine again.VIEWING ANGLENote the singular.There is only 1 fixed viewing angle, it is not adjustable.  I measure about a 55 degree angle from the table surface to the back of the iPad.  I'm not sure where Belkin gets their 35 degree angle measurement - maybe that's the angle from your head to the iPad screen.  The inability to adjust the viewing angle limits the range of contexts in which you can comfortably use this keyboard combo.The viewing angle is comfortable when using this iPad keyboard combo while sitting in a chair at a table, at least for me.  That's where this does well.However, if you are using this in other contexts, it may not fare so well.  This unit really needs to be used on a hard flat surface.  I do not find this as comfortable to use, for example, when trying to balance the combo on my lap.  If you are sitting back on a sofa and can position the keyboard further up your lap where it is wider, it feels more stable and works OK.  But if you are sitting somewhere where you have to sit up straighter (like on a subway seat or a hard chair) and have to position the keyboard further out, closer to your knees, it feels much less stable and can feel like it may topple over.Since you do not have the ability to adjust the viewing angle this greatly limits the positions from which you can comfortably view the screen.  Again, the viewing angle is great when you are sitting in a chair with the combo on the table in front of you, but if you are sitting straight up and balancing it on your lap near your knees, or if you are reclining far back, almost lying down on a sofa or bed, the viewing angles are not optimal.One thing that might have helped alleviate this viewing angle limitation is if the unit had that OFF/AUTO/ON switch I mentioned earlier.  With this option, you could force the keyboard to stay on and use it with the iPad when the two are separated.  This way you could position the iPad separately from the keyboard in a more suitable position.STABILITYThen there is the stability issue.The iPad is held in the keyboard only by its own weight in the angled slot.  There is no mechanism, mechanical or magnetic, to hold the iPad securely in the keyboard slot.  Again, when you use the iPad and keyboard on a hard, flat, stable surface (like a table) the iPad feels secure in the slot and the keyboard works great.  But similar to the situation with regard to viewing angles, the design of this keyboard unit limits its ability to be used as easily in other contexts.If you try to hold the combo in your lap or if you are trying to pass the unit around to friends to share what is on the screen there is nothing to prevent the iPad from being accidentally knocked out or from falling out if the unit were tilted.  I would have preferred if there were some kind of mechanism to hold the iPad in the slot a little more securely.  Perhaps a magnetic strip inside the slot similar to the one they have in the hinge might have added a bit of security.PROTECTIONI don't think this cover really offers much protective function at all.  There is no protection at all of the back or sides of the iPad.  I suppose the keyboard can protect the screen somewhat but this unit was primarily designed with the keyboard functionality in mind and not as a protective cover.Some keyboard covers are designed more as a case with an integrated keyboard and offer both the keyboard functionality and also some greater level of protection.  This one is not.  However, there is usually a trade off between the size and protective ability of cases and this one is no exception.  If you are looking for this style of case that does not cover the back at all, you probably are willing to sacrifice some level of protection for a smaller and lighter form factor.  It's really a matter of preference on which type of case you prefer, but know that this one is really not primarily designed to protect your iPad.COVERI already mentioned something about the look of this as an iPad cover and that it isn't really designed to protect the iPad, but there is another aspect of the use of this product as an iPad cover that I would like to point out.The cover is held onto the iPad by a magnetic hinge.  That's nice and all, but to use the keyboard you have to detach the magnetic hinge in order to put the iPad into the slot.  And then you have to remove the iPad from the slot and reattach it to the hinge when you are ready to go.I find this whole process cumbersome.  For keyboard cases, I prefer those that can simply be flipped open or closed and remain attached to the iPad at all times. It's true that those designs are often bulkier because they usually incorporate some kind of protective case along with the keyboard, but I think I would rather sacrifice a smaller form factor and the aluminum look for a (what I consider) more convenient access and also the ability to fold back the cover against the back of the iPad.The design of this unit with a rigid unibody aluminum case and a magnetic hinge does not allow you to fold the cover back all the way against the back of the iPad.  You can open the case, but you have to hold it in ""open book"" form, which usually requires 2 hands and is inconvenient and cumbersome in most cases.  For example, even the simple task of browsing the web with the cover on and open becomes more tricky.BATTERY LIFEI know this is an important issue, but I have not really tested this.  I charged the unit fully once when I got it a few weeks ago and have not had to recharge it since.  I have only put it through moderate use, but even so, battery life looks like it is OK from what I can tell.INSTRUCTIONSThere are some instructions included on how to pair the keyboard over BT with your iPad.  Those are fine and spell out the process very clearly.But after that, you're on your own.  Granted, it's a keyboard, you just type.  I supposed there isn't really too much to explain.  However, as mentioned above, a little bit of information as to what some of the keys did would have been helpful.  I figured out what a bunch of those short cut function keys did, but the use of some of the others still eludes me.I even looked up the support pages for this product on the Belkin site and couldn't find any more info there either!COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER iPAD COVERSFrom what I can tell, this is not designed to work with other iPad Covers.I was using a Devicewear Slim iPad Air Case when I got this Belkin Thin Type.  The Devicewear case has a fairly thin plastic backing and when I tried to insert my iPad Air, with the back of the case still on (and the front part folded away), it was not able to fit inside the slot.  I haven't tried any other cases, but it seems that the slot in the keyboard will not be able to accommodate the iPad Air with any kind of a case still on.So, that means you either have to keep switching between the case and the keyboard (a pain) if you want to use the keyboard and still have some protection when you are carrying the iPad around, or just not use a protective case at all.I do like to have some protection for my devices, especially the backs (which is why I never really used Apple's smart covers, even though I thought they were cool when they first came out with their magnetic hinges and all).  So I would have preferred if you could have inserted an iPad with some thin case on into the slot of the keyboard without have to remove the iPad from the case.COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER iPADSI also have an older iPad 3 (I think that's the model).  Obviously this keyboard case won't fit as a cover, but I was curious to see if it would work with other iPad models in keyboard mode.  In theory it should probably work with any BT enabled iPad.  However, it didn't really in practice because the bigger iPad 3 couldn't properly seat itself fully inside the slot to maintain the keyboard in the activated state.Well, it sort of worked, in landscape mode, but not well.  Not enough to be used reliably.  It's possible it might work as a BT keyboard with a smaller iPad that could fit in the slot, like maybe the iPad mini(?).  Again, an OFF/AUTO/ON button which allows you to force the keyboard on would have made this keyboard potentially usable with other models (for example, I use this primarily with my iPad Air but might occasionally want to use it with my iPad 3 also).SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONOverall, this could be a decent BT keyboard for your iPad Air depending on how you want to use your iPad with this keyboard cover.If you don't really mind the look of this as a cover, don't have large hands and fingers, and plan to use this mostly sitting in a chair at a table to type and want a better experience than using the touch pad keyboard on the screen, then this would certain provide that.  Perhaps you want to just keep this at your desk and only use it like a keyboard dock for your iPad while sitting at your desk.  That would work.However, if you want a more versatile keyboard cover combo that can do everything well (protect your iPad, have a functional keyboard, be usable in many different contexts, and look good while doing it), or at least be a jack-of-all trades type of unit, then this may not be for you. The Belkin Thin Type seems to be designed with one strength, sitting down at a table and typing, and it seems like it might do that well.  However, the trade off is that it seems to be really limited in many other contexts and uses.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G7WS96U0E7JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUOCLEA#wasThisHelpful","R3G7WS96U0E7JB","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For many years, we used generic dishwashing fluid, and were amazed at how quickly supplies diminished. (We had the same issue with store brand paper towels.) By spending a bit more and using brands like Dawn & Palmolive, we found we used less fluid over time, which lowered use more than offset the purchase price difference.Dawn Ultra has brought this tendency to a new and higher level, as the Ultra concentrated formula means you can get a lot of cleaning done with very little liquid. The biggest challenge with using Ultra is to not put too much on the dishes as we have had a sink filled with suds on many occasions.Ultra cuts through grease very effectively, and letting a grease encrusted pan soak for 15 minutes in Dawn and warm water will give you a really easy clean up at the end of the wait. My one cautionary note is to avoid soaking non-stick coated pans in Ultra for a lengthy period, as the concentrated cleanser agent may cut down on the life of the coating, but this is not really a Dawn problem.Finally, as compared to Palmolive, I find Dawn's scent to be cleaner and more neutral, not quite as cloying or artificial. This to me is the biggest difference between the brands, as I feel cleansing power is roughly comparable, and both are pretty easy on hands. If you like strong artificial scent, Palmolive may be your preference, but I like the more subtle Dawn Ultra.I gave Ultra 4 stars on the logic that it is a premium price product that performs at a premium level. If it were bargain priced and did a great job, five stars would be my rating, but as it is, I feel Dawn is an excellent dishwashing agent, and is worth its price vis a vis competitors. Highly recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLF1REN6O4PU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SC9NCC#wasThisHelpful","R2SLF1REN6O4PU","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HP50 is the finest sounding portable headphone I have heard, and comes close to being a portable Sennheiser HD600, which is high praise indeed. The HP 50 give amazing levels of clarity, resolution, and dynamic impact, and is also reasonably neutral, with maybe a slight boost in the mid-bass area. You are definitely getting highly accurate sound reproduction here at the core level, though the ""RoomFeel"" technology modifies things a bit, especially in terms of transient response (esp. drums). The Room Feel acoustical theory apparently mutes transient response a bit to avoid listener fatigue. This works for me - when I listen to metal for lengthy sessions, the HP50 works a lot better than say the Yamaha Pro 500 or ATH M50, but the accuracy of the response is somewhat compromised, which may alienate purists.However, there is an issue with poorly recorded / mastered albums with significant drum presence; these will sound very lifeless on the HP50s - e.g. Pantera, Down both sounded very mediocre on the HP50s, even though both groups sounded just fine on other headphones. Classical and jazz bring out the best in the HP50s and the transient response feels more natural and full there, which is probably due to the mastering quality. I don't want to get rock and metal fans worried for the most part - well mastered stuff like Muse and Tool sound excellent, but it's the sludgier / lo-fi side of rock that sounds a bit washed out on the HP50s. (This was an issue with the HD600s also, so I think the comparison is very accurate!)Besides the Room Feel response modification issue that may affect some recordings, the HP50s have two other issues. First, the headband design assumes the listener has a square head, and there is a inward sloping section right in the middle part of the headband that causes me significant pain right in the middle of the band. I have no idea why they designed the phones that way, maybe to maintain constant tension on the earcups to maintain a good seal, but whatever the design intent was, these are among the least comfortable designs I own, being outdone only by the Yamaha Pro 500s in long term discomfort capability. The pressure on the ears is fine, but that wedge in the middle of your scalp starts to hurt after about an hour. You can move the band around a bit on your head, and / or take a 5 minute rest and you can then keep on listening for another 45-60 minutes. I have indeed listened to the HP50s for hours without needing to go to the ER or take Tylenol, but I needed a lot of micro-adjustments and a few rest periods of several minutes in order to get through the marathon. The HP50s sound good and unique enough to endure a bit of pain, and depending on your head shape and size (I wear a size L hat) you may be just fine.Second issue, and the biggest liability, is build quality / warranty. In my first month of ownership, the Ipod 3 button cable shorted and needed to be replaced. (No trauma involved, just a few days of crackling, and then no sound from it at all.) The company took about a month to get the replacement cable to me, and it involved a lot of emails and use of the rather non-intuitive customer service interface on the NAD site. I had to hunt around to find a way to contact NAD on their site, then had to establish a user ID and account to contact them, and then had to submit a question through the website to get service. Then the company required me to provide proof of purchase from an authorized dealer before they would send me the $5 cable for free, and then they forgot to send it out for a few weeks, and claimed I had failed to provide my address, though I did that in the initial contact. I re-provided my address and eventually got the cable.Though this is not anywhere near as bad as say AKG customer service (think 3 or 4 months of waiting...) it also does not compare well with B&W, at the same price point. My P5s had the same issue shortly after purchase, and B&W sent me a replacement cable overnight after a single 2 minute phone call to a number on their website and with no proof of purchase needed. If you're selling a $300 pair of headphones, you ought to maybe be a tad friendlier to your customers IMO.Then things got worse. After 5 months of ownership, the wiring between the two drivers failed, and now I only get sound from one side or the other of the phones. (You can plug the cable into either side; whichever side I have the cable plugged into works and the other side is silent.) I contacted NAD and was told the company does not do its own warranty service but instead I must return the phones to the original point of purchase, and the authorized dealer will replace them. (Note this replacement will only be done by an authorized dealer; if you buy from an unauthorized dealer, even at list price, I would think you might have a problem...)The dealer was great and provided quick and efficient service, but I had to pay to ship the HP50s to them, which will cost maybe $20 or so, and will of course involve me standing in line at the UPS store or Post Office. Again, though this is not the worst problem ever in life, it is irritating to have to pay for warranty service for a $300 pair of headphones. Also, the point of failure here is one that I have never seen happen on anything other than a $25 pair of Philips cheapies I had owned 10 years ago. If this was some exotic technology that failed, like a new type of planar driver or some such, I might be more accepting of the issue, but wiring from one driver to another? Come on guys, get the simple stuff right for three hundred bills!It seems frankly, that NAD is a tiny company that does not have its act together in terms of manufacturing high quality headphones or supporting them. Not sure how they are in terms of their other electronic devices, but Sennheiser produces higher quality headphones and supports them better. If only the HP50 did not sound as good as it does, I would just write NAD off. But the impressive sound quality of the HP50s, along with their unique and enjoyable Room Feel signature gives me the patience to reluctantly jump through a few more hoops here than I would for lesser sounding headphones. But you may not be as patient as me, especially if you think a luxury headphone price point should also give you world class build quality and customer service.So takeaway points:1) Buy from an authorized dealer; be 100% certain the dealer is authorized, check the NAD website.2) Be prepared for some discomfort during use, especially if you have a big head.3) Expect the worse in terms of build quality, and be prepared for a somewhat onerous customer service experience if problems do develop.As I said, I think the HP50s are worth all this trouble, but if they break again, that's all for me, and I will update the review if and when that happens.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVNT3X2B99LO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9FYC06#wasThisHelpful","REVNT3X2B99LO","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The HP50 is the finest sounding portable headphone I have heard, and comes close to being a portable Sennheiser HD600, which is high praise indeed. The HP 50 give amazing levels of clarity, resolution, and dynamic impact, and is also reasonably neutral, with maybe a slight boost in the mid-bass area. You are definitely getting highly accurate sound reproduction here at the core level, though the ""RoomFeel"" technology modifies things a bit, especially in terms of transient response (esp. drums). The Room Feel acoustical theory apparently mutes transient response a bit to avoid listener fatigue. This works for me - when I listen to metal for lengthy sessions, the HP50 works a lot better than say the Yamaha Pro 500 or ATH M50, but the accuracy of the response is somewhat compromised, which may alienate purists.However, there is an issue with poorly recorded / mastered albums with significant drum presence; these will sound very lifeless on the HP50s - e.g. Pantera, Down both sounded very mediocre on the HP50s, even though both groups sounded just fine on other headphones. Classical and jazz bring out the best in the HP50s and the transient response feels more natural and full there, which is probably due to the mastering quality. I don't want to get rock and metal fans worried for the most part - well mastered stuff like Muse and Tool sound excellent, but it's the sludgier / lo-fi side of rock that sounds a bit washed out on the HP50s. (This was an issue with the HD600s also, so I think the comparison is very accurate!)Besides the Room Feel response modification issue that may affect some recordings, the HP50s have two other issues. First, the headband design assumes the listener has a square head, and there is a inward sloping section right in the middle part of the headband that causes me significant pain right in the middle of the band. I have no idea why they designed the phones that way, maybe to maintain constant tension on the earcups to maintain a good seal, but whatever the design intent was, these are among the least comfortable designs I own, being outdone only by the Yamaha Pro 500s in long term discomfort capability. The pressure on the ears is fine, but that wedge in the middle of your scalp starts to hurt after about an hour. You can move the band around a bit on your head, and / or take a 5 minute rest and you can then keep on listening for another 45-60 minutes. I have indeed listened to the HP50s for hours without needing to go to the ER or take Tylenol, but I needed a lot of micro-adjustments and a few rest periods of several minutes in order to get through the marathon. The HP50s sound good and unique enough to endure a bit of pain, and depending on your head shape and size (I wear a size L hat) you may be just fine.Second issue, and the biggest liability, is build quality / warranty. In my first month of ownership, the Ipod 3 button cable shorted and needed to be replaced. (No trauma involved, just a few days of crackling, and then no sound from it at all.) The company took about a month to get the replacement cable to me, and it involved a lot of emails and use of the rather non-intuitive customer service interface on the NAD site. I had to hunt around to find a way to contact NAD on their site, then had to establish a user ID and account to contact them, and then had to submit a question through the website to get service. Then the company required me to provide proof of purchase from an authorized dealer before they would send me the $5 cable for free, and then they forgot to send it out for a few weeks, and claimed I had failed to provide my address, though I did that in the initial contact.

"I am unimpressed with the whole concept of the ""moderate protection"" cell phone case. If you really want to protect your phone, put it in something bulky, ugly, and costly (e.g. Otterbox Defender). Yes, the sleek gadget now no longer looks sleek or thin or attractive, but that's the price you pay for sturdiness. I put my S4 in a ""moderate protection"" case from Otterbox (not the Defender) and the screen got cracked in a relatively low impact trauma moment, which cost me $150 to fix. Even the best of the moderate protection cases (IMO the Thule Atmos) will only protect against a really limited range of damage, and all the companies only warranty the case, not the phone inside of it. I suggest two options: leave your phone out of a case altogether and enjoy it's sleekness and aesthetic splendor, or put it in the ugly clunky Defender or comparable standard and actually get some useful protection out of it.If you're still convinced you want a moderate protection case, I would not recommend the Case Logic Extreme 2 model for the Galaxy S4. The EXTREME (apparently the mfgr chooses to spell it this way)has a two piece design, thin rubber inner coat that fits into a harder plastic outer frame with your phone under both layers. Despite the two sections of alleged protection, this case has considerably more flex to it than the single piece Thule Atmos does, due to the cheaper thinner plastic used by Case Logic, and the corners of the EXTREME do not have those theoretically useful crush zones that Thule and Otterbox put in their light protection cases. Indeed, the EXTREME has nothing special on the corners at all, as the hard outer frame ends about halfway through the angle of each corner, leaving only the soft thin rubber inner coating to protect the half of the corner angles on the top and bottom of the device. In other words, the hard outer frame does not completely wrap around your phone, but only protects the central portion. This is much worse protection than is standard even for the world of moderate protection!Case Logic indeed tells you nothing about the case, so no details as to why it is good, what design features it uses to protect from hazards, or even how to install it. (Put the two case pieces together first and then fit the phone in, no need to thank me Case Logic...) You get the impression from the packaging and the website that the company's attitude is ""here's a cheap cell phone case, what more info do you need, go use it"".Besides the flexibility of the frame and the bare bones feature set, there are other issues. The rocker button for volume and the on/off button are encased in thin rubber, not a hard plastic overlay as is seen on more expensive cases. The buttons work just fine, but the thin rubber will not keep them from snapping off if exposed to local trauma in the same way that a plastic overlay would.Also, the headphone port gains special demerits. The problem with most of these cases for most phones is that they give you a small round hole to fit your hp plug in, which will not accommodate exposed metal of less than 1mm length. This means many bulky / stubby hp designs including many popular and common models like the ATH M50, Senn HD25, or Shure 215 will not fit most headphone ports on most cases.  The EXTREME seems to offer a larger shaped port so I was hoping I could use my M50s with it, but the extra cutout space is only in the rubber inner shell so after a few seconds of reluctant compression, the rubber inner lining expands again and unseats the headphone plug that you barely managed to fit in the port in the first place, meaning you lose sound.This decompression pop only happens with plugs of less than 1mm exposed metal, hp plugs with longer lengths of exposed metal are fine. However, the Badge of Dishonor goes to the EXTREME for appearing to be able to accommodate all sorts of plugs and then not being able to actually do so due to poor design that could have been fixed with an extra 8 seconds of design thought / testing and another 2 cents of manufacturing cost.Besides the flex, the vanilla design, and the deceptive headphone compatibility issue, my final complaint is that of aesthetics. The bright candy colored red of my model of the case looks cheap and ugly, especially in comparison the darker more subdued red of my S4 case. I thought a red case and red phone would go well together, but the low rent color scheme of the EXTREME just made my phone look cheaper instead.So bottom line:1) ""Moderate Protection"" for cell phones is a generally flawed concept;2) Getting a cheap example of a flawed concept only exacerbates the faults in the concept;3) The Case Logic EXTREME appears to have no useful design elements, or at least none that the manufacturer cares to share with us. Plus the case feels cheap, looks cheap, and makes the phones it contains look worse than if they were not in it.I would suggest spending more on a moderate protection case if you feel you want that design at all. The Thule Atmos is more than twice the price of the EXTREME, but feels sturdier, protects buttons and switches better, and looks nicer. Get that model if you want to walk along the risky path of moderate protection for your cell device.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMM8FTEFNIBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JMPXHPO#wasThisHelpful","R2LMM8FTEFNIBD","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My mom and grandma were wizards with plastic wrap. They would take a plate heaped with bulky irregularly shaped leftovers, get exactly the right amount of wrap on it, wrap the food tightly and completely so that there were no loose ends, and would then tuck the plate in the fridge where it would last for many days pristine and inviolate.My wife and I? No such skills. When we use plastic wrap, we end up having to grab extra pieces to make sure the plate is covered, and then we have to wrap multiple segments together in different areas of the plate. Then nothing is ever tight enough, meaning the ends of the wrap start coming loose in the fridge, meaning either food spilling hazard or the need for a rewrap, consuming even more plastic wrap.To dolts such as us, Press N Seal Wrap is like a gift from the food gods. The ends tuck away neatly and stay sealed around the container even when upsets happen. The PNS stretches out to exactly the right contour and elasticity. And the containers stay wrapped for a really long time. In short, I feel like I am 125% more competent at wrapping food when I use PNS.However, this competence comes at a price. PNS is roughly 4 times as much per inch as regular Glad plastic wrap, and about 6 to 8 times as much as generic plastic wrap. If you are a really competent user of regular plastic wrap, like my Mom and Grandma were, you may just want to save money and get the regular stuff. The rolls will last longer and cost much less.Also, PNS does not handle re-wraps well: e.g. you want to unwrap the food, get something out and then re-wrap the container. In general, I have found PNS loses its stickiness after the initial wrap, and you need to use more PNS to wrap the container again. If you do this a lot, the cost of use of PNS rises. We don't do this much, as most of our leftovers are single use portions.Like most plastic wrap, PNS does not microwave very well, arguably even worse that regular wrap as the PNS is tighter and leaves less room for steam to escape. If you microwave with plastic wrap a lot (which is really not that good of an idea anyway) you may want to use regular plastic wrap. (Or better yet, a paper towel!)Most users will delight in the ease of use of PNS, and I personally view it as a kitchen essential. If you are a master user of the regular style plastic wrap, you can save your money, but I view purchase of PNS as money well spent for our home, as it minimizes food spills in the fridge, ensures freshness, and minimizes frustration.If this were only say twice as much as conventional wrap, and / or if it could be reused more effectively, I'd give this product five stars, but at current price level, PNS is a solid 4 stars, 5 stars if cost is no issue to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P7C404RTZ4MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKC6C2I#wasThisHelpful","R3P7C404RTZ4MP","A2TCHXH4SIN2OF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TCHXH4SIN2OF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll just start this review with my bias: I didn't particularly enjoy Jeff Shinabarger' book Yes or No.  It has more to do with my expectations rather than the book itself, but my expectations were shaped by the title and promotional material.  First of all, look at the full title: Yes or No: How Your Everyday Decisions Will Forever Shape Your Life.  This isn't a book about everyday decisions.  The book description says it will help you ""develop your personal philosophy of choice"" and show a ""practical process for making good choices.""None of the above, in my view, really fits the content of Yes or No.  Shinabarger writes a lot about his own life, and the development of his organization, Cardboard People.  I am interested in this organization, which helps ""social entrepreneurs"" get started.  They are the real target of this book: people who are starting an organization and need help with their vision and focus.  If this is you, great.  You are probably the type-A, motivated individual that Shinabarger is writing for.For the rest of us, the non-entrepreneurial, low-profile types who would like some guidance in seeking God and making wise and productive decisions as we look for jobs, serve in our churches and communities, and lead our families, Yes or No misses the mark.  It simply didn't deliver as advertised.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1JXC0AZTP2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQ6QU5W#wasThisHelpful","R1P1JXC0AZTP2S","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At the height of the Cold War, a serial killer is on the loose in Soviet Russia.  An unlikely hero, Leo Demidov, has to use stealth and misdirection to solve the heinous crimes.  The problem is, investigating crime in the Soviet regime means admitting that there is crime.  In the workers' paradise, crime, of course, should not exist.  Child 44, Tom Rob Smith's first novel, traces Leo's pursuit of truth in spite of state dogma, while describing a political and social system that we can be thankful no longer exists (at least in that form).Leo, a war hero and patriot, serves in the secret police, whose primary objective is to uphold the State.  Suspects are guilty until proven innocent, but they are never proven innocent because only the guilty are arrested.  To release someone who had been arrested would be to admit that the State made a mistake, and the State never makes mistakes.Leo convinces the family of a murdered child to accept the murder as a mere accident, but when he learns of murders that resemble that child's murder, he doggedly pursues the truth about the killer.  Of course he must do so covertly and at the risk of his life because of the treasonous thought that there is a murderer on the lose and that the State had not ""solved"" the crimes correctly.On one level, Leo's chase is good crime drama.  Putting the pieces together, while constantly looking over his shoulder, he never imagines where the path is taking him.  (The reader, however, has a pretty good idea before Leo does. . . .)  Leo's crisis of integrity and determination to do what he knows is right makes the story interesting, as does the setting of Soviet Russia and the bureaucratic, oppressive, hypocritical, deadly, unjust, and downright evil mess that it was.If parts of the story, especially the climactic reveal, seem a bit stilted or contrived, that's OK.  It's crime fiction, not academic history.  Child 44 is a fun read.

"This year I have been reading the Bible in chronological order.  I admit, it's been a while since I have read through the Old Testament.  As I read the history of the Patriarchs, and especially the history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, I get so frustrated with the stories.  There are times when the people of the Bible make ISIS look reasonable and the God of the Old Testament seems far distant from the character of Jesus.  I have to come to grips with the fact that I would rather cut some of those passages right out of the Bible instead of dealing with them as a part of my heritage of faith.Brian Cosby, a pastor in the Presbyterian Church in America denomination, addresses this very struggle in his new book, Uncensored: Daring to Embrace the Entire Bible.  He writes that ""many self-professing Christians cherry pick the Scriptures for a feel-good faith.""  We like the scriptures that make a good bumper sticker or t-shirt slogan, but spend a little time reading the Bible and you'll find plenty that you don't want to see on your next youth retreat t-shirt.Cosby leaves no doubt that he holds a high view of scripture.  He affirms that ""God's Word is inspired, inerrant, and authoritative.""  When there's something troubling in the Bible, ""it beckons my trust in a God who is using His Word to take me to His intended destination.""  Cosby shares R.C. Sproul's view: ""When there's something in the Word of God that I don't like, the problem is not with the Word of God, it's with me.""After affirming the reliability and authority of scripture, Cosby addresses some specific areas in which Christians tend to be selective in their reading and use of scripture.  He discusses creation, God's justice, God's role in restraining evil while not being the source of evil, his intolerance for sin, and the reality of hell.  Cosby also delves into some expressions of cherry-picking faith: churches that emphasize entertainment as worship, and parents who outsource the development and teaching of their children to third parties.Uncensored has helped me to reflect on ways in which I tend to gloss over or ignore passages that I don't like as I read.  It's a great reminder that ""all scripture is God-breathed and is useful . . .""  His advice is perfect: ""When we come to a Scripture passage that is offensive, we should pray and ask, 'God, why have You inspired this text?  What are You trying to teach Your church?  How does this humble me and glorify Christ?'""Cosby addresses some of the ""hard passages"" that may come to your mind as you read, although not to an extent that will satisfy everyone.  He gives some good examples, but the strength of Uncensored lies in the encouragement to embrace all of the Bible with the attitude that God included even the embarrassing, unsettling, and downright offensive portions of scripture for a good reason.  That reason may not be evident to me, but, like Sproul said, my presumption must be that the problem lies with me, not with God.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S31Q0T9J0W39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434709094#wasThisHelpful","R1S31Q0T9J0W39","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the father of a high school junior, I have a front-row seat for the pursuit of the college dream.  Like many kids near the top of their high school class, my son is a shoo-in for acceptance to the vast majority of colleges in the U.S.  But when it comes to competitive scholarships and acceptance to that small percentage of elite schools, the odds are not in his favor.  Truth be told, the odds are against anyone getting into some of the elite colleges, with acceptance rates in the single digits.Into that fray enters Aayush Upadhyay, a recent Yale grad who has crunched some numbers and has valuable insights for high school students whose sights are set on the Ivy League. In Behind the Ivy Curtain: A Data-Driven Guide to College Admissions, Upadhyay breaks down admissions data culled from collegeconfidential.com to give applicants some insight into what matters for those seeking to join the ranks of the Ivy League.None of Upadhyay's conclusions will shock the reader.  The higher the rank, the higher the test scores, the better the chances for admission.  He sheds some light on some of the more subjective elements, like extracurriculars (multiple years in one activity tends to beat short tenures in multiple activities), but, again, nothing too surprising.Upadhyay's analysis and conclusions are worth reading for applicants to Ivy League schools.  I was left with the feeling that unless GPA, class rank, and test scores aren't top-notch, the rest of the application will never matter.  Behind the Ivy Curtain feeds into the growing perception of ambitious high school students that admission to an Ivy League school is the only route to success in academics and life.  I hope my son and others like him will realize that while Ivy League schools may provide a great academic experience, there are plenty of other schools around the country where excellent academics, excellent professional development and networking, excellent character building, and excellent life experiences can be found.Thanks to the author for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJWFSGQ05E1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517293146#wasThisHelpful","R1OJWFSGQ05E1","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way back in the early 80s, after he and his wife split up, Sting, lead singer of The Police, wrote a song called ""King of Pain.""  His poetic expression of grief, pain, and loneliness became one of his band's biggest hits.When his son was struggling with a serious illness, illustrator Sven Volker heard ""King of Pain"" and thought it captured the struggles he and his son were experiencing.  Thus was born his book There's a Little Black Spot on the Sun Today, which brings to life Sting's lyrics with minimalistic pictures, using simple arrangements of geometric shapes, perhaps inspired by the cover of the single.There's Little Black Spot is simple and cute, while at the same time emphasizing the poetic power of Sting's lyrics.  It's worth a look for a general audience, and could be a helpful tool for children dealing with grief or pain.  How is your pain like a black spot on the sun?  How is your grief like a hat caught in a treetop?  More than just a cool song and neat graphics, there's an opportunity for reflection and healing in the lyrics and pictures.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HETTNDJ5JYUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0735842388#wasThisHelpful","R3HETTNDJ5JYUE","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Are you experiencing discord, disagreement, unhappiness, or discontent in your marriage?  Whether it's just a little, every now and then, or a permanent state, the reason your marriage is less than it could be is likely because you are believing a lie about yourself, your spouse, or marriage itself.  In Lies Couples Believe: How Living the Truth Transforms Your Marriage, Dr. Chris Thurman breaks down ten common lies that can diminish or even destroy a marriage.Drawing on decades of counseling married couples, Dr. Thurman identifies ten lies that he has seen impact marriages.  No marriage is exempt.  He writes, ""every one of us who are married believes all ten of the lies covered in this book.  We believe some of these lies more strongly than others, but we believe all of them to some degree.""  I will leave it to you to conclude whether he is correct.  I will say that if you have never believed any of them at any time, you are a better spouse than I!Here are the lies:1. The purpose of marriage is to be happy.2. My spouse can completely meet all my needs.3. My spouse is a bigger mess of a human being than I am.4. I am entitled to my spouse's love.5. Our marital problems are all my spouse's fault.6. My spouse should accept me just the way I am.7. My spouse should be just like me.8. I see my spouse for who my spouse really is.9. My spouse has to earn my forgiveness.10. We can reconcile without repenting.Do you see yourself in some of those?  All of those?  Maybe depending on the day or month, you have bought into some of these lies.  Dr. Thurman's emphasis throughout Lies Couples Believe is fixing your own attitudes.  As tempting as it might be to blame marital unhappiness on your partner, you can see by the lies he lists that step one is acknowledging the lie and changing one's own beliefs and actions.Each chapter (lie) concludes with practical steps to reflect, to apply biblical truth, and to take action.  Like I suspect many readers will do, I initially scanned the list of lies and thought I was exempt.  Surely this book isn't for me. . . . But I have to admit (as will, I suspect, will most readers), most of these hit home.  Newlyweds or old couples, blissfully happy or on the ropes, just about any couple can benefit from reading Lies Couples Believe.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM93JLKMJ1AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434709051#wasThisHelpful","R3NM93JLKMJ1AD","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fran Krause sees peril all around him, real, potential, or purely fantastical.  Based on some of his own fears, as well as some solicited from readers of his blog, he has created a collection of comics encouraging just a little bit more fear.  Deep Dark Fears will ring true with many readers.  Reactions will range from, ""I am scared of the same thing!"" to ""That's ridiculous!"" to ""I never thought of that--but now I will!""I don't worry so much about ghosts or a parallel world in the mirror or my loved ones being reincarnated as pets, who then see me going to the bathroom.  But I can see how some might!  More compelling are the fears that pretty much all of us can relate to, like being caught publicly doing something on social media, like ""Facebook stalking"" your old girlfriend.  And who can't relate to being afraid of becoming ""an old person who makes kids afraid of getting old""?Krause's humor is on the dark side, funny and thoughtful.  His drawings are the sort that makes you feel like anyone could draw them.  I mean that in the best sense--the art conveys a sense of shared experience.  Deep Dark Fears reminds me of my friend who always seemed to imagine the worst that could happen.  Maybe you've never been afraid of being cut in half by the elevator.

"Like many churches, my church has a men's ministry.  Starting with Promise Keepers and influenced by John Eldredge's books, men's ministries seem to have flourished, emphasizing shooting guns, eating wild game, growing beards, and thumping chests.  OK, I'm being a bit facetious; I know much good has come from these ministries.  But, as Nate Pyle writes in Man Enough: How Jesus Redefines Manhood, it may be that men's ministries are missing the mark when they characterize manliness by hunting and fishing, sports, cars, and cooking on the grill.These men movements have been built in reaction to what is viewed as a feminization of the church.  Pyle argues that the emphasis on the ""wild man"" has ""encouraged some men while emasculating and alienating others.""  Not all men are into hunting and sports.  In fact, the image many men's ministries promote is more an American ideal than a biblical ideal, the self-made man, the independent hero, the star athlete.Taking Jesus as our model, we see he was not a warrior, a fighter, or a football player.  He was humble, a servant.  We want to emulate him by exhibiting the fruit of the spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self-control, traits that are typically viewed as more feminine.  Further, Paul writes that there is no longer male and female in Christ; both men and women are called to become more like Christ.Pyle in no way diminishes gender differences.  Clearly men and women are different and have different roles.  His task is to remind us that ""Jesus showed us that to be fully human is to embrace the masculine and feminine qualities that exist within all of us.""  He concludes, ""the world doesn't need a manlier man; the world needs a more human man.""Pyle writes with compassion while challenging the reader to be more like Christ and not aim to be more like a modern, American image of a ""real man."" There's nothing wrong with such an image, but it's not the primary ideal to which Christians should aim.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEHZJCSOW6GV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310343372#wasThisHelpful","R2BEHZJCSOW6GV","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"iRules: What Every Tech-Healthy Family Needs to Know about Selfies, Sexting, Gaming, and Growing Up isn't really a book about technology; it's a book about parenting.  Jannell Burley Hofmann wants parents to recognize that, yes, there's lots of new technology out there, but that parents have a responsibility to keep up with their children, no matter the media.Hofmann encourages parents not only to be aware of what social media and other communications their children have online, but to follow their Facebook, Instragram, Twitter, or other feeds, so they can see what their children and peers are posting.  Further, she asserts that parents' demanding to have access to password-protected sites is acceptable.  Just as we might allow our children to have a lock on their bedroom door, to allow for privacy when needed or wanted, we would insist that we have a key (and that they not lock themselves in with friends of the opposite sex!).A good parent will have a good idea of who their child is hanging out with, what kinds of activities they participate in, and what their hobbies and interests are.  Electronic communications should not change that.  Even as social media, video gaming, and electronic-based relationships become more complex, parents have a responsibility to provide guidance and oversight.  Hofmann's suggestions are reasonable, knowledgable, and welcome.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EBYBBOS77GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623363527#wasThisHelpful","R25EBYBBOS77GK","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For more than twenty years, through ten novels, fans of Jan Karon have followed the lives of Father Tim and his friends and family.  In her eleventh Mitford novel, Come Rain or Come Shine, Karon brings the whole gang together to celebrate Dooley and Lace's wedding.I don't know whether Karon intends to close the book on Mitford--she has threatened to before--but Come Rain or Come Shine reads like the end of a series.  Characters from earlier books come together from around the country.  Relationships are healed and restored.  Nostalgic stories are told.  It reminded me of a TV series finale.On the other hand, Dooley and Lace are celebrating all kinds of new beginnings.  Not only are they getting married, Dooley has graduated from veterinary school and opened his clinic.  They have brought a bull to Meadowgate to assist in adding to the herd.  They get a new puppy.  Last but not least, they adopt a little boy, who joins the family on the eve of the wedding.  So even though she seems wrapping up the Mitford series, maybe she's kicking off a new Meadowgate series.Readers who have read some or all of the Mitford books will love Come Rain or Come Shine.  The reunions are sweet and the characters are their usual colorful self.  Those who are not familiar with all the characters may feel a bit lost.  Karon jumps between characters' perspectives frequently.  It was easy for me to get confused about who Karon was talking about.  (This is partly a result of my little bitty brain, but mostly because of the Kindle version, which did not give a visual cue when shifting to a new storyline.  The print versions of Karon's books have a design at each break.)Come Rain or Come Shine has all the elements that Karon's fans love.  She writes with good humor, encouraging wisdom, and genuine faith.  The wedding plans, the wedding, and the potluck reception and dance afterwards offer lots of opportunities for grins and laugh out loud moments.  The reunions and intimate chats offer lots of opportunities for tears and ""awww"" moments.  Time, and Jan Karon's will, will tell whether we hear more stories from Mitford or Meadowgate.  In the meantime, Karon's fans will love catching up with their old Mitford friends in Come Rain of Come Shine.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIALJVU7CU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167455#wasThisHelpful","R3RIALJVU7CU9","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every now and then I'll read a novel that worms its way into my consciousness, quietly asserting itself immediately into my long-term memory, bypassing the spots taken up by more forgettable fiction.  A Free State is one of those memorable novels.  Tom Piazza masterfully captures life in the mid-nineteenth century, bringing to life a southern plantation, the filthy streets of Philadelphia, and a personal, unforgettable portrait of slavery.As the son of a plantation owner and a slave woman, Henry Sims was never a typical field slave.  He learned to read, and played the banjo and sang for the master and his guests.  As he grew up and the life and abuse of the plantation became untenable, he made his escape.  He found his way to the minstrel shows of Philadelphia, at first passing himself as Spanish, but on stage wearing blackface over his lighter, mixed-race skin.In spite of his incognito appearance, his banjo playing renown catches up with him when a slave hunter tracks him down.  In the hunt, the real ugliness and evil of slavery manifests, especially as personified in Tull, the slave hunter.  The stories of Tull's exploits, surely based on actual practices, will turn the stomach of any reader.I thoroughly enjoyed A Free State.  Piazza doesn't make the slave owner out to be pure evil.  (Well, he's pretty evil.)  More notably, he doesn't present Henry as some pure, noble character.  He is very human, and not necessarily a great moral figure, but he is one with whom the reader can have compassion.  Perhaps the most moral figure is the abolitionist senator, but he was also a product of his times, even if more enlightened than most.Piazza captured the views of slavery and slaves from several perspectives.  Even those helping him out wanted him to fit a certain mold: ""To the abolitionists, Henry was a representative of a subjugated people, nothing less, and nothing more.""  His friend in the minstrel show reflected on the idyllic plantation scene they used as a backdrop on stage: ""I knew that Negroes we depicted so fancifully were, in real life, subject to harsh treatment and compulsory labor.""  Getting know Henry, he realizes that ""I had let myself be deceived, though I should have known better.  And now, from behind that beautiful, pernicious illusion, reality had come snarling.""  As mentioned, Tull's attitude of Henry as property or contraband contrasts with the senator's beginning to see Henry as, if not an equal, at least as a peer and companion.Through all of this, Piazza never seems to impose 21st century moral standards on 19th century characters.  I thought Piazza artfully captured the tone of the times.  In fact, I found myself wondering if A Free State was actually written in the 19th century.  Black slavery in the United States seems like ancient history, but the attitudes and history are still relevant today.  This is a novel I highly recommend.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W8LCNK956RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062284126#wasThisHelpful","R3W8LCNK956RB","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tis the season for football, so how about an inspirational football movie?  In a few weeks Woodlawn will be released, bringing to the big screen the story of an Alabama high school football team in the 1970s.  In case the place and date don't click with you, this is at the time of school desegregation in one of the most racially divided parts of the country.  Woodlawn follows the desegregation of Woodlawn High School and the response of the football team.The Woodlawn football coach, Tandy Gerelds, didn't set out to be a trailblazer or revolutionary.  He was just a guy who wanted to be a football coach.  In the book Woodlawn: One Hope. One Dream. One Way, Gerelds's son Todd Gerelds, with the help of veteran sports writer Mark Schlabach, writes about his father's life and legacy as an Alabama coaching legend.Two things make the story of Woodlawn worth telling.  First of all, this team managed to come together and build camaraderie on and off the football field across the deep racial divides of Birmingham.  The white players and coaches, including Gerelds, had plenty of hesitation and resistance to playing with the black kids.  The black kids suffered not only the racism of the white kids and teachers at Woodlawn, but also rejection from blacks in their neighborhood.The second part of the story is what makes the first part work.  Against Gerelds's better judgment, at the time, he allowed an evangelist to preach the gospel to the football team.  Virtually every one of them gave their lives to Christ.  From that point on, a new sense of unity emerged on the team.  And for many of the boys, it stuck!  Several became pastors and continued to walk with Jesus into adulthood.The story of this football team is really inspiring.  It does feel a bit like those fictional stories, where once someone becomes a Christian or starts taking their Christian faith seriously, everything works out great (see Facing the Giants).  But Woodlawn is a true story, and, in fact, once the football players and coaches became Christians and committed to ""playing for the Lord,"" they really started winning more games.I am looking forward to seeing this movie.  The book is nicely told, but it felt a bit emotionally detached.  I wanted a bit more drama!  The book hints at the drama, and touches on the powerful changes in the kids' and coaches' lives, but maintains a feeling of viewing it all from a distance.  Once the stories from Woodlawn make it to film, I have a feeling the emotional impact will be stronger than the book.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R213M5HEJLZH5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118064#wasThisHelpful","R213M5HEJLZH5C","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If your parents ever told you (or you have ever told your kids!) what a tough time you had getting to school, uphill both ways, ten miles in waist-deep snow, etc., even your exaggerations probably won't match up to the journeys to school taken by the children in The Way to School.  Rosemary McCarney, who works for Plan International Canada, has gathered images from around the world showing children on their way to school.If these kids ever have kids, they will have stories to tell about getting to school.  ""We had to crawl across a damaged bridge, in danger of falling into a river.""  ""I rode a water buffalo to school.""  ""We climbed a high ladder to crawl over a cliff.""  ""We climbed over mountain and went through a tunnel in the mountain.""  ""We walked across a glacier on the way to school.""  ""We had to carry our own desks to school.""  Or, ""You're lucky to go to school.  We were too poor for school."" Or, ""I couldn't go to school because our school was destroyed by an earthquake/typhoon/tsunami.""  You get the idea.The photographs are beautiful in the various settings.  The joy the children share in going to school is evident.  I love this kind of book, that makes the world seem bigger, by showing people from around the world, and smaller, by showing universal shared experiences.

"Given the vastness of the universe, I have always thought that either humans were destined to expand to other planets, or there is life on other planets.

Mary Doria Russell explored the question of Christian missions to other planets the in The Sparrow.In Mike Resnick and Tina Gower's novel INCI, they get into both questions.  Rev. Joshua Barker joins a scientific mission to Kaus, a newly discovered world.  He tells Bible stories to the natives, who have a rudimentary understanding of his language.  Soon he befriends on he calls ""Click"" and begins to send more time among the Kausians.  As he tells the story of Jesus, the Kausians respond with stories of ""the steam."" As Baker looks into the steam stories, he learns stories that strangely parallel Christ's crucifixion, not only on Kaus but on other planets as well.INCI is a strange little book.  I enjoyed the depiction of evangelization among the Kausians.  But INCI didn't go deep enough to satisfy my theological interest, and the story wasn't compelling enough to satisfy my sci-fi interest.  It was just OK on both counts.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19M6BON2A7UOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612422667#wasThisHelpful","R19M6BON2A7UOP","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa Pennington has nine children.  How's that for a resume?  I know there is more to being a good mother than quantity, but when someone has chosen to have a large family and is able to write about parenthood in a positive, entertaining, and helpful way, she's worth listening to.  Mama Needs a Do-Over: Simple Steps to Turning a Hard Day Around is a fun book that moms will enjoy reading.Mama Needs a Do-Over isn't really a parenting book, although most of the stories she tells revolve around her life as a mother and home-maker.  Pennington home schools her children, but she doesn't talk about home school very much.  Mostly she offers encouragement for all of us that when life doesn't quite work out the way we plan it, we can endure much better with joy and fun.  She tells silly stories on her family and encourages the reader to think of creative ways to ""add joy and humor to an unplanned sidestep that are uniquely you.""  She writes, ""Going through life with a purpose to enjoy yourself right where you are is a beautiful gift.""Nobody's perfect.  Pennington doesn't mind getting a laugh out of her imperfections and even writing about them.  Mothers (and fathers) will appreciate her transparency, but more than that will appreciate her willingness to share her foibles as a reminder to all of us to relax, take it easy, and laugh a little.Pennington maintains a website that you might enjoy: http://thepenningtonpoint.com/Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN3Y7UNN2WW73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781412927#wasThisHelpful","RN3Y7UNN2WW73","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"``Pope Francis has broken new ground, as the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere, but has also brought a new feeling of openness, inclusiveness, and relatebility to the papacy.  He has found admirers and popularity within the Roman Catholic Church as well as among secular and Protestant groups.  Count Paul Rock, pastor of Kansas City, Missouri's Second Presbyterian Church, among Pope Francis's fans.In his new book Jesus, Pope Francis, and a Protestant Walk into a Bar: Lessons for the Christian Church, which springs from a sermon series Rock and two of his fellow pastors preached at Second Presbyterian, Rock sings the praises of Francis.  I'm not sure Rock has a negative word for the new pope. . . .  The heart of Rock's message is Christian unity, and Francis has certainly reached out to many groups as well.  However, Francis gives no indication that he is ready to acknowledge that Protestant churches are part of the The Church.I find it interesting that so many Protestants and unbelievers have embraced Pope Francis.  I also find it interesting that Rock and other mainline Christians sound so much more willing to reach out in fellowship to Pope Francis than they are to reach out to their ""dumbed down"" or ""shallow"" brethren in more conservative, less stately congregations.The real subject here is Francis and the Catholics.  I don't disagree that Francis seems like a great guy.  But I don't see that he's bringing Catholics and Protestants together any more than his two most recent predecessors.  Time will tell on that count.  In the meantime, we can learn from Francis as he models the character of Christ and the love of God for all of us.  I love this assessment: ""The beauty of what Francis reminds me is that not only does God die for me but God delights in me.""  Amen to that.

"Like many Christians of my generation (I'm in my mid 40s), my teen and college years were shaped in part by the worship music of John Michael Talbot.  I wore out his albums (vinyl, of course!) from the 1980s both for general listening and for times of worship.  At some point I heard that he had become Catholic and I didn't really follow his career after that.  (This wasn't out of anti-Catholicism; it was mostly because the 1990s saw such a huge revival in worship music that there were tons of new bands and worship leaders to listen to.)So I was interested in Talbot's new book, The Ancient Path: Old Lessons from the Church Fathers for a New Life Today.  Talbot writes about how the Desert Fathers and Mothers ""deeply influenced his spiritual, professional, and personal life.""  For those unfamiliar with Talbot's story, as I was, for the most part, The Ancient Path serves as a nice autobiography.  I was interested to read about his life and the formation of the Brothers and Sisters of Charity, the neo-monastic community he founded.I was not as impressed with the selections and readings from the Church Fathers.  As I read I had to keep in mind that the book is lessons that Talbot has gleaned from the Church Fathers for his life.  That is, of course, the subject of the book.  The goal of any spiritual biography is for the author to impart lessons he or she has learned to the readers.  That is what Talbot does here, and he does it well.  I guess I was looking for something a bit more systematic or generalized.So, bottom line, read as a spiritual autobiography, written by someone who has studied and been influenced by the writings of the Church Fathers, The Ancient Path delivers.  For many readers, it will serve as a springboard to inspire further exploration of the Church Fathers to see what lessons they have  for us.Thanks to Blogging for Books and Image for the complimentary review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17OHKT4Z6CHYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139954#wasThisHelpful","R17OHKT4Z6CHYT","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes bravery is simply insisting that what is right, is right.  Rebecca Langston-George, with the help of Janna Brock's illustrations, tells a modern tale of bravery in For the Right to Learn: Malala Yousafzai's Story.  When the Taliban took over the Swat Valley region of Pakistan, they insisted that girls should not be allowed to attend school.  Malala Yousafzai, whose father was a teacher passionate about education for boys and girls, was not about to give up her right to learn.  She turned her opposition to the Taliban's restrictions into a blog and came to  be known around the world for her outspoken advocacy.As her fame grew, so did the Taliban's desire to shut her up.  But she fearlessly continued.  Soon they tracked her down and shot her.  Miraculously, she survived.  She ended up becoming the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.  Langston-George tells Malala's story well.

"I don't think I'll ever get tired of reading true stories of heroism during WW2, especially concerning resistance to the Nazi menace.  Jennifer Roy's Jars of Hope: How One Woman Helped Save 2,500 Children from the Holocaust adds a new title to inspire us.  Irena Sendler's father passed along a legacy to her.  He taught her that people's race, religion, or wealth don't matter, but whether they are good or bad.  He taught her, ""When someone is drowning, give him your hand.""Irena became a social worker, and when she say the Nazis force the Jews into the ghetto, she smuggled medicine and food in to the needy Jews.  Soon she began smuggling babies and children out, hoping to save them from death in the concentration camps.  When parents asked for guarantees that their children would survive if they sent them with Irena, she replied, ""I can only guarantee that if your child stays here, he will die.""Irena kept careful lists of the children, in hopes of reunited them with their parents.  She put the lists in jars, which she buried until after the war.  She was arrested, and lived for a time as a fugitive from the Nazi occupiers.Meg Owenson's illustrations beautifully capture the dreary bleakness of occupied Poland, while spotlighting the hope that Irena brought to these children.  Irena is truly a hero who deserves to be remembered.  The strength and character she displayed inspire me not to ignore injustice and to risk my own comfort to meet the needs of others.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GK2AF1BY8ZZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623704251#wasThisHelpful","R1GK2AF1BY8ZZ8","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A group of scientists obtains permission to examine the Shroud of Turin.  Several features lead the team to be convinced that it's an authentic burial shroud, but there is some question as to whether it could possibly be Jesus' image.  During his examination of samples taken from the shroud, one geneticist discovers some cells--living skin cells.  He speculates that they could be skin cells left by the buried person, after his resurrection.  He secretly uses the cells to clone the person, successfully cloning Jesus himself.That cloning sets the stage for book one James BeauSeigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy, In His Image.  The clone, Christopher, is really a secondary character in the action of the book, but as world events swirl around him, it becomes clear that there's something special about this young man.  The Middle East is in turmoil, the Dome of the Rock has been destroyed and the Jewish people are rebuilding the temple.  Christopher has become a leader in the U.N. just as the U.N. has risen to a more prominent role in world affairs.BeauSeigneur draws heavily on biblical prophecy (as you might expect).  Whether he does so in a way that is faithful to the message of scripture, well, who can say?  At times I wondered whether BeauSeigneur is writing as a Christian, or whether he's simply writing speculative fiction with biblical themes.  Christopher seems to embody the character of Christ in many ways, yet BeauSeigneur also draws on New Age elements as well.  (As a side note, while the language is fairly mild, I think his use of four-letter words would keep his books off the shelves of Christian bookstores.)  I will be interested to see how Christopher continues to develop throughout the trilogy.  Is he the reincarnation of Christ?  Or the Antichrist?

"Harry Turtledove, ""the Master of Alternate History"" (according to Publisher's Weekly) writes prolifically about what might have been.  He holds a Ph.D. in history from UCLA, so his historiographical eye is keen.  In Bombs Away: The Hot War, Turtledove imagines a world in which the US, mired in a conflict with the Chinese and Koreans, hopes to end that war by dropping a few atomic bombs on some Chinese cities.In avenging their fellow communists, the Russians respond by bombing a few European cities.  Since the NATO treaty states that an attack on US allies is viewed as an attack on the US, Americans drop some bombs on Russia, then Russians drop some bombs on US cities.  The Hot War gets very hot indeed.Turtledove tells the story from a wide variety of perspectives, in Asia, the US, and Europe.  Characters include the president and his advisors, civilians dealing with the impact of losing their homes or living near the blast sites, and, especially, soldiers and pilots on the front lines.The novel is best described as a series of vignettes.  His descriptions are evocative and personal.  The emphasis is not so much on the global picture of war, although the big picture comes together, but on how the war touches people around the world.  Those personal glimpses, however, don't congeal into a story as much as a simple timeline.I got a kick out of one character who said, ""There ought to be stories where some little thing happens differently and everything that comes afterwards gets changed from the way it really was. . . . It might be fun, make you think a little while you're reading,"" like if the Nazis won World War II.  In a bit of self-effacing humor, Turtledove has the character add, ""Nobody's every gonna want to read about that, not in a million years.""Bombs Away does make me think about what the world might look like if, in those early years of the Cold War, it did turn hot.  I don't know how close the US and other countries have come to ""pressing the button.""  I'm sure there were plenty of close calls.  Bombs Away reminds us how lucky we are that a nuclear hot war has--so far--been avoided.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UPP6II9WL94W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553390708#wasThisHelpful","R3UPP6II9WL94W","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book.  I'm always eager to read anything Neal Stepheson writes, and Seveneves did not disappoint me.  The book opens with: ""The moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason.""  How's that for an image?  Soon, astronomers and mathematicians predict that while some of the moon parts will remain in lunar orbit, as the pieces collide and break apart, the surface of the earth will be subject to a hail of moon rocks that will render the surface of the earth uninhabitable for millennia.  All of the resources of the earth begin to focus on one thing: the survival of the human race.A small crew has been working on the International Space Station, which becomes the focal point of man's space-ward expansion.  The first two-thirds or so of Seveneves focuses on the trials of this first generation of off-world humans as they attempt to establish a livable, sustainable community in space.Some things I love about Seveneves: Many books, sci-fi and otherwise, have been written about the end (or decimation) of human life on earth.  Many put the cause in the hands of humans, either through nuclear war or environmental abuse leading to an unlivable ecosystem.  Others write of an alien invasion.  Stephenson chooses neither the man-made catastrophe or alien invasion scenario.  Neither does he dwell on the cause of the moon's explosion.  No definitive answer is ever found for the cause.  The point is not the cause, but the response.While surely he took some liberties with the science involved, and projected technology forward a bit, Stephenson's characters primarily rely on today's technology, or a very believable next-step expression of today's technology.  At times, Seveneves read like a non-fiction account of actual events.  (I mean that in the best sense of non-fiction.)  He focuses on orbital mechanics, on space habitat design, and on what day-to-day life would look like on an expanded International Space Station.  It's all very believable and realistic.The last third of Seveneves takes place 5000 years after the moon is destroyed.  In these chapters, Stephenson's imagination runs wild.  He still keeps a solid grounding in the realities of physics and orbital mechanics, but his future world-building is pretty ""out there.""  The descendants of the earth-born humans have mined asteroids and mastered large-scale building in space.  I would love to see some renderings of the structures he describes!  My imagination reached its limits. . . .  They also continued to develop bioengineering so that they have reseeded the cooling earth, making it habitable again.While his science and world-building are fascinating, I should not neglect to mention that he does tell a great, sweeping epic throughout.  Seveneves is full of relatable characters who draw the reader into the reality of seeing their home planet destroyed and figuring out what life will be like going forward.  It's the kind of book I didn't want to put down (although at nearly 900 pages, it's not a book you'll likely finish in one sitting).  Seveneves is not a book to read, it's a book to savor and experience.  I must say, I was a bit sad when the experience was over.  Like many of Stephenson's books, Seveneves deserves more than one reading.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19VVA05EOKKDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062190377#wasThisHelpful","R19VVA05EOKKDI","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes real life is more entertaining than fiction.  You could be forgiven for thinking that Barton Swaim's The Speechwriter: A Brief Education in Politics must be a novel.  But it is, in fact, Swaim's account of his experiences as speechwriter for South Carolina governor Mark Sanford.  With a freshly minted Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, Swaim was looking for a place to put his education to work.  He read an op-ed by Sanford, and thought, ""This guy needs a writer.""A letter and resume, a perfunctory interview, and before he knows it he's got a job at the state house.  Quickly he learned that his job was not to write great prose and insightful commentary, but to write Sanford's ideas in Sanford's voice, however poorly it might sound to Swaim's ears.  Eventually it got to the point that, at times, neither Swaim nor Sanford could remember who wrote what.Sanford himself, in Swaim's description, is so much the stereotype of an egotistical, power-dealing, erratic politician that he seems like he could only be the product of an active imagination.  As you may recall, he got caught up in a minor scandal (misuse of funds designated for a National Governor's Association meeting) and a major scandal.  The major scandal came to light in the midst of Sanford's rise on the national radar, when he was being talked about as a potential V.P. candidate on the next presidential ticket.  Sanford was at the top of his game, and he took off to South America for a tryst with his mistress.  The national press got wind of his trip, and his prospects with the national party were through.Swaim, the everyman guiding the reader through the world of modern politics, doesn't pull punches.  In spite of his cynicism, he holds a grudging admiration for Sanford and his political acumen.  His account is funny, but of course he has a great deal of source material, from his clown of a boss.  As a bit of history, Sanford's administration may not end up as much more than a footnote (or punchline).  Swaim's story may not be about a crucial epoch in American political history, but as an archetypal account of political life, The Speechwriter is an entertaining, enlightening read.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YVYPDSGPMRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42X38K#wasThisHelpful","R23YVYPDSGPMRY","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With rising tuition costs and college debt spiraling out of control (the next financial bubble?), it just makes sense to find ways to finish college in less time and with less money.  In her new, helpful how-to book, Kate Stephens gives some tools and tips for high school and college students who want the most out of college but want to save some money and finish faster.  College Quicker: 24 Practical Ways to Save Money and Get Your Degree Faster is not for everyone.  If your college student has a guaranteed full scholarship to college, or if your family can afford to simply write a check for all college expenses, then you might not feel the need College Quicker.For the vast majority of us, though, Stephens's ideas are welcome and, as promised, quite practical.  Some are very familiar: AP exams, credit by examination, IB exams, dual credit courses.  These ways to earn college credits while still in high school seem like the simplest, most effective way to get a leg up on college.  It's really not that hard, especially for a driven student, to graduate from high school with a year or more of credit under his belt.Some of my favorite ideas involve getting credit from colleges other than the one in which you are currently enrolled.  For summer sessions, study abroad programs, service programs, on-line classes, etc., it may be possible to earn credits which will transfer to the college from which you will be earning your degree.  In some cases the tuition savings will be significant.  One specific example described a study abroad program that included travel, lodging, entertainment, all meals, and credit hours, and ended up costing barely more than the tuition for those same credit hours if earned on campus.  That sort of program would be worth looking up!To make it very practical, Stephens illustrates the potential savings, comparing the savings to what a student might pay in loans (and interest), or, if the savings were put into a retirement account, what they gains would be, given growth over time.  Breaking down the numbers like this puts a relatively small cost difference into perspective!There are certainly pitfalls.  For each of these ideas, Stephens encourages readers to do their research.  Students need to be aware of what credits will transfer, and what will apply to their chosen major, before they jump in.  Some courses will count for credit, others might simply satisfy a prerequisite with no credit given.  Some courses won't transfer at all.As my oldest son is entering his junior year in high school, the crunch will be coming soon for us.  I would love to see him get a full-ride scholarship to the school of his dreams.  In the meantime, we'll be working on some of these, making plans for options to keep him (and me!) out of a lifetime of debt while achieving his academic goals.

"Ernest Cline made a big splash with his first novel, Ready Player One, which Spielberg is bringing to film.  Cline returns with the same spirit--and a just-as-cinematic-worthy story--in Armada.  Zack Lightman is just trying to survive his senior year in high school.  He's a top-rated player on the popular game Armada, which consumes much of his time outside of school and his part-time job at the video game store.  When not playing Armada, he enjoys the treasure trove left by his father, who died when Zack was a baby.  The boxes of his father's old things contain music, movies, and, especially, video games he enjoyed.At the bottom of one of those boxes of nerd culture artifacts, Zack discovered a journal, in which his father speculates that there is some connection between the video game industry, sci-fi movies, the government, and the military.  When a spaceship that looks exactly like a ship on the Armada video game picks Zack up in front of his high school, he learns that his father's seemingly paranoid ravings were right on the money.Those popular video games were not just video games.  They were training simulations, preparing humans to fight the coming alien invasion.  As one of the top gamers, Zack is a key recruit for the Earth Defense Alliance.  He joins in the fight against an invasion that has been building for years, a desperate fight for the future of the human race.Like Ready Player One, Armada draws on the world of video games and movies, especially sci-fi, and 80s pop culture.  There were plenty of times when I paused my reading to Google a phrase or quote that I didn't recognize.  Safe to say Cline is more immersed in nerd pop culture than I am.  (There's also a character who quotes Shakespeare.  I had to Google those lines, too.)Armada feels brief and breezy.  The story moves along at break-neck speed.  Of course it does: Zack's going to school one day, and with hours he's fighting an alien attack at a secret military base.  Armada draws explicitly from Ender's Game, Iron Eagle, The Last Starfighter, and other stories and movies.  It does not, however, feel like Cline is recycling material.  He writes with an original voice, capturing the teenage mind and nerd culture (I hope that phrase does not sound demeaning.

"My son said he would like to be an architect and build skyscrapers, so when I saw Hilary Koll and Steve Mills's book Design a Skyscraper: You Do the Math, I thought it would be perfect!  Well, he's about 5-10 years too old for this book.  But for the target audience, early elementary, it would definitely fit the bill.Design a Skyscraper is hybrid: a math book, and a book about building skyscrapers.  Koll and Mills introduce facts about skyscrapers, then present a series of math problems related to skyscrapers.  For example, readers learn about calculating the amount of fencing for a building site, the height of a staircase given the rise height and number of stairs, or how long it would take to clean the windows on a glass skyscraper.I like the real-world application of math concepts, and the engaging way they introduce the world of skyscrapers.  My son may never build a skyscraper, but Design a Skyscraper is bound to inspire some kids to build one.  And even if they don't, they will have worked on some important math skills.(One note: don't bother with the Kindle edition. . .

"Dr. Chauntelle Tibbals, a sociologist with a PhD from the University of Texas, sees herself as a ""sociologist at large. . . a public scholar out exploring the world--an embedded public sociologist.""  For a large part of her career, she has been embedded ""in stigmatized yet legal industries operating in the United States.""  In other words, she has made the focus of her academic sociological studies the world of adult entertainment--porn.There aren't too many people in the world who would (openly) defend and accept porn in culture.  But the numbers are there--it's widely consumed and has irrevocably established itself in popular entertainment.  So it seems only right that academics would study it and evaluate different aspects of its influence and trends, whether positive or negative.  Dr. Tibbals, one of the very few who has chosen to do so, has been shunned in the academic community.  Between conservatives who believe porn to be anti-family values, and liberals who believe it to be anti-women, there's little room for someone who defends and celebrates it from an academic, feminist perspective.Tibbals leaves no doubt that she is a friend and defender of the industry.  Based on her telling, she has many friends in the industry, hangs out with producers and performers, and believes porn to be entertaining, liberating, and uplifting.  She writes about films being ""empowering"" to women performers, who sometimes ""clearly, obviously, totally"" enjoy their work.  Speaking of one film in particular, ""the dudes appear to be super happy.  The women are into it, as well.  It's uplifting.""She doesn't have a lot of patience for critics of the industry.  She had heard about a major annual porn expo, and, upon attending, found that ""everything I'd ever heard about [the expo] seemed to be either a gross embellishment or an out-and-out fabrication.""  That has been her experience in studying the industry.  There's no shortage of critics of porn, but they tend to ignore performers, producers, and consumers who are happy about their role in the production and consumption of porn.But speaking of ignoring. . . . Tibbals comes down hard as an apologist for porn.  Academics who study an industry should take an objective, analytical approach.  If she really wanted to write a sociological study of the world of pornography, shouldn't she have at least mentioned the role of international sex trafficking? (never mentioned)  The pervasive use of drugs? (briefly mentioned, glossed over)  The abuse of the women performers?  (mentioned in the famous case of Linda Lovelace, but she claims the abuse was not because of porn, it was because of her terrible husband)  The occurrence of STDs?  (briefly mentioned, only in passing)  The links between rape and use of porn? (not mentioned)  The consequences of addiction to porn? (not covered at all) The role of porn in destroying marriages? (not covered)  The impact of porn on sexualizing culture and transforming the way sex is viewed in media? (nope)  The effect of children's exposure to porn on their perceptions of sexuality and sexual behavior? (not mentioned)  The bottom line is that there are major, legitimate concerns about the proliferation of pornography.  In my opinion, a sociologist, whether tied to a university or a 'sociologist at large,' has a responsibility to her chosen field and her readership not to ignore these obvious problems with the adult entertainment industry.Critics of porn should be careful not to resort to ""gross embellishment"" or ""out-and-out fabrication"" when discussing porn.  Tibbals shines a positive light on the industry that makes such critics look like unreliable reactionaries.  But in Exposure, Tibbals goes the other direction, falling far short of her task as a sociologist.  Until she's willing to take a good, hard look at the dark side of porn, the negative effects it can have on individual performers, consumers, and society at large, her study is at best incomplete, at worst, irresponsibly deceptive.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYFF4FGTGEE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLSXH0S#wasThisHelpful","R1XYFF4FGTGEE4","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lexi Dunne cruelly ended her first novel, Superheroes Anonymous, with a cliffhanger worthy of the old Batman TV shows.  I forgive her though.  She delivered a worthy sequel (or part 2) in Supervillains Anonymous.  Hostage Girl, having been framed for her friend and trainer Angelica's death, finds herself sentenced to the notorious Detmer prison for supervillains.  It turns out not to be so bad--fine dining, masseuses on call, outstanding workout facilities--except that her roommate is the sadistic supervillain Rita Davenport.Hostage Girl unwillingly enters Rita's training program, then unwittingly gets sprung from prison by Rita, and is caught up in a whirlwind of double-dealing superheroes and supervillains.  She is still discovering and developing her own powers, cultivating a romance with her superhero boyfriend, and trying to decide who's really on her side.Dunne writes some great action and fighting scenes.  Of course they're not believable; we're talking about people with superhuman powers, after all.  She keeps the surprises coming as Hostage Girl and her friends get to the bottom of the supervillains' plot to take down the superheroes and establish themselves as the dominant super-people.  That's a pretty bad nutshell description of the plot, actually.  Dunne does a better job of pulling it off, but the plot does tend to get drowned out a little by the action sequences.I do look forward to Dunne's next book.  (We know she has one in mind by the way she ends this one. It's not quite as bad a cliffhanger, but it's still hanging there. . . .)  One thing I'd like to see more of is interaction with the ""real world.""  There are a couple of references in Supervillains Anonymous to the superheroes actually doing things superheroes do, but mostly they are saving each other rather than civilians, giving the impression of an insular community of supers who don't have much purpose in the larger world.  Nevertheless, it's a fun read, a nice followup to Superheroes Anonymous.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BVFGPM869123/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7XOM3W#wasThisHelpful","R3BVFGPM869123","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taylor Stevens is back with another Vanessa Michael Munroe story, The Mask.  After fighting pirates in Djibouti, Munroe takes off for Japan, for a rendezvous with her old lover Miles Bradford.  He's working a corporate security job there, and she comes to hang out and recover.  Soon she asks Miles to put her to work, wanting to help him with his assignment at the biotech company where he's employed.  He demurs, until he's framed for murder.  Frustrated with his lack of communication before his arrest, Munroe finds a trail he left for her, enabling her to step into his old job, track down who framed Miles, and uncover layers of corruption, theft, and betrayal in the company.The Mask is certainly a stand-alone novel.  The back story of Miles and Munroe, her inner demons, her upbringing and abusive ""training,"" her language ability, and her knife fetish are all there and familiar to Stevens's readers, but they take a back seat to the plot.  Stevens very effectively piques interest in Munroe's past, enough that readers will want to revisit prior novels, without retelling her story or distracting the reader with lots of flashback scenes.As usual, Stevens immerses the reader in Munroe's world.  I found her observations of Japanese corporate culture to be very interesting, as well as her descriptions of Japanese street life, home life, and domestic culture.  In terms of the story, the reader is kept as much in the dark as Munroe is.  Slowly Munroe pulls the pieces together, leaving us with a powerful, bloody, justice-serving climax.This is one of Stevens's best efforts yet, due, in part, to the foundation she has built with the prior novels.  Munroe is well-developed and powerfully written.  I don't know where she will go from here, but I have a feeling I'll enjoy the ride.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JB704USCWI7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348967#wasThisHelpful","R2JB704USCWI7U","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family loves adoption.  My church loves adoption.  One of my three children is adopted, and as I look around our church, I see children adopted domestically, through private agencies and state foster care, adopted as babies and adopted as older children, adopted from Africa and Europe.  Any my church isn't very big!  I love that it's a part of our church's culture.Russell Moore wants that to be the case for every church, and I'm with him.  In Adoption: What Joseph of Nazareth Can Teach Us about This Countercultural Choice, he writes, ""Imagine if Christian churches were known as the places where unwanted babies become beloved children.""  Amen, brother.  Joseph is our model.  His teenage fiance had become pregnant from someone else.  He modeled the love God has for us as Jesus grew up.I applaud Moore's commitment to adoption and his extensive writing promoting it.  He emphasizes the spiritual importance of adoption.  It ""isn't charity.  It isn't part of a political program. . . . It's spiritual warfare.""  Adoption not only makes a difference in the life of a child, it makes a difference in the spiritual realm as well.  I hope many more churches take up the mantle of adoption, not only to meet the needs of the many children without a family, but to demonstrate to the world that there is enough love in the kingdom of God for every child, and that no child is worthless or unwanted.(One note about the book: This is actually a chapter taken from his earlier book Adopted for Life.  I presume the idea is that in this booklet form, Moore can get the message to more people and more people would be likely to read it.  I received it as an advance electronic review copy [for which I'm grateful].  If I were buying it, I think I would spend the extra couple of bucks to get Adopted for Life.)Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ROSEMIH3YKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433549913#wasThisHelpful","R38ROSEMIH3YKU","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the individuals profiled in The Road to Character, David Brooks's book is flawed, but not without its redeeming qualities.  Brooks wants to recover the ""eulogy virtues,"" noting that the ""resume virtues,"" while they tend to be more highly valued in modern culture, tend not to produce ""deep satisfaction.""  To this end, he profiles a wide variety of individuals.  It's a varied group; I wonder if there's ever been a book to feature St. Augustine, civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph, and Joe Namath?  As you might expect, if you've read Brooks's other books or New York Times editorials, he is a colorful story teller and brings the subjects to life.The variety and quality of the individuals about whom Brooks writes is the first problem I have with The Road to Character.  As individual pieces, the biographical essays are okay, but they didn't adhere to one another the way I think Brooks wanted them to.  The result is a loosely assembled structure, not a finely honed argument.  Further, while his subjects demonstrated admirable character traits, too many of them had an overall character that I would not want to emulate (and some that I definitely would reject as an example).  That's part of his point, too.  As he says, ""The good news of this book is that it is okay to be flawed, since everyone is.""There are plenty of bright spots, worthy of reflection, in The Road to Character.  One of my favorites, since it reminded me of something my parents always told me, the third of four children, was ""The more you love, the more you can love.  A person who has one child does not love that child less when the second and third child come along. . . . Love expands with use.""So in spite of writing about some people I didn't end up liking, Brooks's overall project comes through.  Dignity, love, self-control, and, most of all, selflessness are character traits anyone can agree are worthy of pursuing, no matter your cultural or religious preferences.  By focusing on the eulogy virtues--kindess, bravery, honesty, faithfulness--we can build the kind of character that might be written about in a book about character.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M86NKL0UARX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYXV61Y#wasThisHelpful","R1M86NKL0UARX","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a fan of Duck Dynasty, then you know Jep, the youngest Robertson son, and his wife Jessica. In The Good, the Bad, and the Grace of God, Jep and Jessica bare their hearts and souls, showing a depth and complexity in their relationship that may not come through on the popular TV show.  Both of them had struggles of different kinds before--and after--they got together.  By telling their stories, they give encouragement to people who have struggled (and I think that includes all of us!).Jess and Jep tell their stories separately, alternating between overlapping chapters.  They never met until they were out of high school, but when they did, it was love at first sight.  Jep went home and told his roommate that he had just met his future wife!  They were both in need of stability and healing.  Jessica had recently divorced her husband of less than a year.  Jep was coming out of a brief period of drug abuse and rebellion.  Eventually they found each other and, as they write, ""a girl from town met a boy from the woods.  And you know what?  They lived happily ever after.""Like the whole Robertson clan, Jep and Jessica are, unsurprisingly, down to earth and honest.  They have learned to deal honestly with each other and figured out how to move on in their mistakes and weaknesses.  They will admit that while they haven't always dealt with their issues the right way in the moment, they have come around to rely on their commitment to each other, and, most importantly, their shared commitment to God.  ""We finally put God at the center of our marriage, and He not only restored our love for each other, but he made that love deeper and stronger than ever.""  Good words for any married couple, no matter what stage of life they are in!One thing to note about The Good, the Bad, and the Grace of God.  Don't expect too much.  They do write openly and honestly about their struggles, and they do provide encouragement for couples.  However, you won't find here great wisdom, nor will you find exceptional stories or character.  I don't say that to slight them, but the fact is the only reason their story is worth telling is that they are on a popular TV show.  And that's OK.  It's just a reminder of the power of TV.I know and have met couples who stories are much more dramatic, compelling, and inspiring, but who are unknown people in the pews or the neighborhood.  Their stories will never get in print.  I'm happy for Jep and Jessica that they are in a position to share inspiration with others, but I am reminded to look around my circles and see the good, the bad, and the grace of God in the lives of others I bump into every day.Fans of Duck Dynasty will definitely want to read The Good, the Bad, and the Grace of God.

"I have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.  I've seen the movies.  I thought I knew all I needed Orc Warfare.  Pramas acknowledges J.R.R. Tolkein, author of the aforementioned classics, as the one who ""set the template of the orc in modern fantasy.""  But since Tolkein, role-playing games, video games, fantasy novels, and movies, have expanded the view of the orc.to know about orcs.  Chris Pramas revealed my ignorance in his bookPramas covers the different types of orcs, their characteristics, and their strategies and tactics.  He then relates the tales of some important orc battle victories.  As you might expect, he describes their lifestyles as nomadic, reliant on raiding (and occasionally trading with other orcs) for supplies.  They do have limited skills, like tanning hides, but have not developed metal working, due to their nomadic lifestyle.  They are meat eaters exclusively, so they must move around to hunt or raid settlements.I would have liked for Pramas to provide some sources for his stories and data.  I'm not Tolkein expert, but much of this material seems to be outside the scope of Tolkein's Middle-Earth.  I wonder if he drew on specific novels or other materials, or if this is original material?  I suspect there is some of both.Orc Warfare is a fun read that may not satisfy the purist, but Pramas provides enough information here to entertain and expand the reader's view of the orc.  Orc Warfare is not a picture book, but it is generously illustrated, adding to the value of the descriptions.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7A7THRIE7HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472810503#wasThisHelpful","R1T7A7THRIE7HQ","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The recruitment of Isaiah Austin to Baylor was a milestone for the Bears: the highest-ever rated recruit for Baylor basketball.  As a top player out of high school, and a solid performer at Baylor, he was looking at being drafted in the first round of the NBA draft.  Then, days before he was to travel to New York for draft day, he got a positive diagnosis for Marfan syndrome.  He would never play competitive basketball again.Austin writes of his love of basketball, or, better said, his life of basketball, in Dream Again: A Story of Faith, Courage, and the Tenacity to Overcome.  I was aware of his story in broad strokes, as a Baylor fan.  A friend at work whose son played with Isaiah in high school told me what a great kid he was.  He was of course a big story at Baylor, and won the hearts of Baylor fans with his play (and distinctive glasses).  We loved hearing him tell his story of learning to play while blind in one eye, and not letting the opposition know it!Dream Again is deeply personal.  He writes with a sense of opening up his heart and letting the reader into his private thoughts.  I especially enjoyed reading about his parents' faith.  Their faith in God and their faith in their son worked together to give Isaiah a solid foundation.  When he was losing his vision, and ultimately his sight in one eye, Isaiah's mother encouraged him.  ""She told me that I had two choices with my vision impairment: I could quit basketball or I could work to overcome my limited vision. 'Isaiah,' she said, 'you only have two choices here: you can make this your excuse . . . or you can make it your story.'""Make it his story he did.  ESPN did a feature on him, raising his exposure and giving him a platform to inspire many.  Then with the Marfan diagnosis, his mother's advice was even more relevant.  Now it wasn't about learning to play the game he loves differently, it was about learning to live without playing the game at all.  He has remained positive, and says he ""learned that God's plan is always about helping people find ways to dream again.""Isaiah is young.  He's got a lot of life to live.  But his story is worth telling now.  I have been impressed with him watching him on the court and in the press.  I was impressed with his kindness when I ran into him with my kids at the mall (I was trying not to be obnoxious. . . . It must be tough being recognized to easily. . . .).  Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin, who wrote the book's forward, was impressed: ""I tried to encourage him through that time [after the Marfan diagnosis], but in true Isaiah form, we found that he was too busy encouraging us.  Even with his lifelong dream crashing down around him, Isaiah was focused on others.""  Austin's coauthor, seasoned writer Matt Litton, was impressed: ""his heart is full of more joy, passion, and genuine faith than any young person I've ever met.""  You'll be impressed.

"Brad Meltzer has a love of arcane historical information and events.  The President's Shadow, book three of his ""The Culper Ring Series,"" picks up with archivist Beecher White looking for answers about his father's mysterious military career.  Part of the answer seems to be gripped in the hand of a severed arm, dug up by the First Lady in her garden, only steps from the Oval Office. . . .Meltzer somehow makes the bizarre and improbable sound sort of believable.

"Everyone leaves a legacy.  James Dobson challenges us to think about what kind of legacy we're going to leave.  In his book Your Legacy: The Greatest Gift, Dobson introduces the reader to his forebears.  Several generations back, Dr. Dobson's great-grandfather began praying for his children and their children to come.  Decades later, we see Dr. Dobson's reach as a Christian teacher and author, his father's work as a pastor and evangelist, and his children's work as authors and speakers.  That legacy has reached millions with the gospel.Your Legacy is not only about Dobson's family, but also inspires us to look at the legacy our ancestors have left us and act to leave our own legacy.  It's never too early or too late to teach our children about God's love for them and salvation through Jesus.  Your Legacy is full of stories from Dobson's life, other families' lives, and practical, helpful guidelines for interactive with and loving our families.I was especially reminded to seek every opportunity to talk about Jesus and my own experiences as a Christian, and to pray frequently and specifically for and with my kids.  If you've read any of Dobson's books, or listened to him on the radio, you've heard much of this before in one form or another.

Diffee writes that he has found that people who don't like his work ""are, without exception, ugly and dumb,"" whereas the people who enjoy his work are just the opposite.  In fact, ""the more beautiful and intelligent a person is, the more they tend to enjoy my stuff.""I don't know how smart or attractive I am, but I definitely enjoyed Diffee's take on life.

So he comes up with other flattering names, like ""cheerleader's lip"" (herpes), ""poet laureate throat"" (goiter), and ""billionaire's sphincter"" (hemorrhoids).Some of the cartoons are quick and silly, like the sloppy looking guy sitting in front of a sign reading, ""Face Painting Five Bucks.""

"Sci-fi poetry?  Seriously?  Yes.  It sounds crazy, but Yann Rousselot pulls it off.  Remember when Jodie Foster's character in the movie Contact said, ""They should have sent a poet""?  Well, here he is.  Dawn of the Algorithm is an odd, entertaining, poetic collection of Rousellot's poetry, illustrated eclectically by others.As with any poetry collection, I liked some more than others.  I think my favorites were the first-person narratives.  ""T-Rex is Sad,"" he writes, about becoming ""the laughing stock of the Internet: a meme with tiny arms, a mockery.""  KITT, from Knight Rider, misses his driver, but can ""still feel his imprint on my leather.""  And in the titular poem, Algorithm, the artificial intelligence that has risen to dominance over humans, gets to know his subjects (in between stock trades, which is interesting in light of the recent rise of ""robo-advisors"" and ""robo-brokers"" in the financial services industry).Rousselot was influenced by and pays homage to classic and contemporary sci-fi, monster movies, and the present and future human condition.  By bridging these two genres, sci-fi and poetry, that typically have so little in common, he forces both to look harder at the other.  Sci-fi fans can see poetry as a window of speculation and wonder; poetry fans can see sci-fi as a vehicle for meaningful and profound reflection.I wonder how autobiographical this line is: ""I do not own a smartphone, but sport a pager and write poetry, mostly about the fact that no one ever pages me.""  If you're looking for a sci-fi poet, page Rousselot.  Even if you don't love his work, you'll be intrigued, amused, and maybe enlightened.More from Rousselot: yesrousselot.wordpress.comThanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B7FZ1ANL2GJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941758061#wasThisHelpful","R3B7FZ1ANL2GJ9","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Courtney Reissig is not a feminist, at least not in the sense that the word is usually used.  In The Accidental Feminist: Restoring Our Delight in God's Good Design, she writes as a ""feminist in need of recovery.""  What is she recovering?  God's design for women.Reissig holds to the complimentarian view of gender roles, ""believing that God created men and women equal, yet different.""  She contrasts this view with the ""bill of goods"" that mainstream feminism sold women, ""telling women they can have it all, by giving women endless choices"" and promising ""freedom to have what you want when you want it.""Women are life-givers and nurturers.  We primarily picture these roles as being played out in the home and family, but Reissig demonstrates that women can fulfill these functions in many ways, not exclusively as wives and mothers.  She is careful throughout the book to include single woman and childless women in her exposition.Feminism is one of those terms that can mean a variety of things to different people.  To the extent that mainstream, secular teaches ""feminism equals sameness"" I agree with Reissig that they are wrong.  She goes as far as to say ""the seeds of feminism are actually an affront to the gospel.""  Most importantly, while ""feminism claims to be the answer for the oppression of women,"" Reissig writes that ""nothing frees women like the gospel of Jesus Christ.""Feminists (as commonly understood) won't like Reissig's perspective.  Many Christian feminists will take issue as well.  Her arguments about the role of women in the church are thoughtful, but ultimately reflect a patriarchy that many Christians are not comfortable with: ""From the birth of the church after Christ's resurrection until now, God's intention for the local church has been for godly, qualified men to lead his people through the preaching and teaching of his Word.""  Some women, as well as men who would like to see women in more leadership roles, won't be satisfied with her consolation that women can serve in other important ways in the church.Ultimately, the important point is that ""men and women are equally created in the image of God.""  They are different, with different roles and functions, but both are valuable and unique.  Reissig affirms and encourages women to fulfill their role and express their gifts.  I, for one, want to be a man who supports my wife, daughter, and other women in doing so.  Isn't that the most basic, most elemental expression of feminism?Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBP5M7OLFU2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJYL77C#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBP5M7OLFU2M","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a young teenager, I remember being entranced by Devo, so delightfully different from the pop-rock garbage on the radio.  I joined Club Devo and eagerly awaited every new release.  Alas, I never saw them live.  Looking back after three decades, I am realizing how much I missed in Devo's music.  Evie Nagy has filled in a lot of gaps for Devo fans in Devo's Freedom of Choice.Focusing on Devo's third album, Freedom of Choice, Nagy tells Devo's story.  She draws extensively on interviews with band members, who lend insight into the creative process behind the album and tell great stories about the life of Devo.  Perhaps more importantly, Nagy places the album in context.  She quotes contemporary reviews and other musicians who were influenced by Devo, and discusses Devo's place in and influence on the general state of rock music.I enjoyed reading some of the backstory of the songs.  On ""Whip It"": it wasn't meant to be sexual.  They say ""We wrote it as a 'you can do it, Dale Carnegie' pep talk for President Carter."" After so many fans assumed a sexual theme, for the music video, ""Devo ran with the S&M theme to the absurd extreme.""Devo famously had a dysfunctional relationship with record labels.  They also continuously satirized commercial culture.  So it's interesting to read their thoughts on the subject of money and success.  Nagy writes, ""While Devo objected to the excessive corporate greed that led to unacceptable levels of inequality, they of course were not opposed to making money. . . .""  They also had a contentious relationship with MTV.  When the network started, Devo was one of a very few bands that had been making videos of their songs, so Devo got heavy rotation.  Soon, all the bands were doing it, and MTV shifted from ""playing all the art stuff that was out there, to concentrating on music videos that record companies were basically making as commercials for the albums they were trying to sell."" Since Devo didn't get the radio airplay that many other bands got, the found themselves excluded from MTV's rotations.Now that I'm well into middle age, I have to admit Devo's music doesn't move me like it did when I was kid.  But I do still love it!  As a conservative Christian I probably shouldn't embrace them; I certainly don't embrace their liberal politics and atheism.  As a conservative Christian 13 year old, I know I didn't get some of that subtext.  As I've looked back at some of Devo's videos, I am also reminded that Mark Mothersbaugh is to blame for giving me the idea that it would be cool to wear my racquetball eye guards to a party.  I was a dork.Spuds will love the nostalgia and the insiders' information in Devo's Freedom of Choice.  You may or may not agree with Mark that Freedom of Choice marked ""the end of Devo.""  But a good case is made here that, while their later work is enjoyable, this album did mark their pinnacle.  Non-spuds who think of Devo as a one-hit wonder will be surprised to read of Devo's impact and musical influence.  Spuds and non-spuds alike will want to dust off their old LPs or cassettes, or pull up some songs on YouTube, and relive the early days of Devo, a great band ahead of its time.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3PQUH23TBCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5JON4S#wasThisHelpful","R3E3PQUH23TBCT","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Earl Smith has spent a good deal of his life behind bars--but not in the sense that he could have!  During his formative years (actually, into his adult years), Earl Smith lived his life is such a way that he could have become a permanent guest of the California Department of Corrections at the notorious San Quentin State Prison.  In Death Row Chaplain: Unbelievable True Stories from America's Most Notorious Prison, he and co-author Mark Schlabach tell his story and the stories of the inmates he met during his twenty-three years as San Quentin's Protestant chaplain.It takes a while to get to San Quentin.  The first 1/3 or so of Death Row Chaplain dwells on Smith's story.  He was a pretty bad guy, making some terrible choices.  Drugs, dealing, crime, stereotypical street thug behavior marked his life.  Finally, when he was nearly shot to death and somewhat miraculously survived, he turned to Jesus.  Then he went to college to become a preacher and, well, drank, did drugs, and slept around.  Like many, OK most, OK pretty much all of us, Smith didn't become perfect once he became a Christian.He did have a passion for reaching prisoners with the gospel, though.  Early on, he heard the voice of God tell him that he would become chaplain at San Quentin.  Years later, he got the job.  Few would be as well-suited for the job.  He could relate the population.  In fact, he ran into plenty of his old street buddies from Stockton, including the man who shot him.The theme of forgiveness runs through Death Row Chaplain.  When he first happens upon his would-be murderer, thoughts of revenge ran through his mind.  Smith could easily have had him killed.  But God gave him grace to forgive.  That forgiveness set the tone for his ministry among the hardened criminals and death-row inmates he met every day.Rev. Smith had a much more forgiving spirit toward his charges than I would be able to have.  At times he seems almost flippant, with stories like, Oh, he raped some young ladies and killed some folks, but now he's a Christian, sings in the choir, and man, you should seem him hit the baseball!  But really what he's saying is, Jesus met this criminal in the depth of his depravity, and now, in prison, he is learning to be a disciple of Jesus.  Smith certainly does not condone crimes or rule out the need for prison.  He writes, ""A prison has to exist for certain people.  Some are lawless to their core, and, even if given an opportunity to change into law-abiding citizens, they would turn down the offer.""  But he approaches every prisoner as someone needing the love and grace and forgiveness Jesus has to offer.  As much as that may go against my human inclinations, I certainly can't argue against it from a spiritual perspective!I admire Rev. Smith's work with the San Quentin prisoners. He has impacted not only the prisoners' lives, but their families' lives, and even the lives of the victims and their families.  When the sheep and the goats are separated, there's no question that Smith will be counted among those who visited Jesus in prison.

"From time to time, writes Andrew Burt, ""America's sense of self-identity routinely comes under pressure, with the result that certain groups confront a loss in status.""  In American Hysteria: The Untold Story of Mass Political Extremism in the United States, Burt looks at several episodes in American history of ""hysteria,"" which he describes as ""the way America's 'doomed classes' confront their loss of prestige.""  Covering the anti-Illuminati movement, the anti-Masons, the Red Scare, McCarthyism, and the anti-Sharia law movement, he demonstrates how a seed of facts, watered by exaggerations, half-truths, and sometimes lies, can grow a flowering plant of full-blown hysteria.The key to the movements described in American Hysteria is that they are not based on fiction, like Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds"" scare, but are grounded in reality (with the possible exception of the anti-Illuminati movement, in which an excitable preacher took every word of one European writer as gospel).  There really were Masons at many levels of power, some of whom got carried away with themselves.  There really were Communists infiltrating the labor movement, and, later, at many levels of government.  I am surprised how little time Burt, an accomplished journalist, spent on recent revelations that McCarthy was right, in spite of himself.  He was a showman, very undiplomatic, and made lots of poorly substantiated accusations.  The fact is, however, files have been opened in recent years showing that there were Communists in the state department after all.  Maybe McCarthy wasn't so hysterical after all. . . .Similarly, Burt focuses his post 9/11 chapter on the anti-Sharia law movement.  He's never really clear about the basis for the accusations.  It's a stretch to say that Sharia law is taking precedent over U.S. law, but is it really a stretch to object to the increasing influence of Islam in U.S. culture?  Is it unreasonable to evaluate ways in which the values of Islam might contradict the American way of life? Do the growing threat and explicit goals of ISIS not have any relevance?  Burt gives examples of overblown reactions, but I'm not ready to call it hysteria.Burt has some good insights on the movements covered in American Hysteria.  His left-leaning views probably colored his choice of movements to cover, however.  Surely he could have found some historical examples of the left having an overblown reaction to a real state of affairs.  The example that comes to mind is one he could treat in his next book: the police War on Blacks.  After Ferguson, we are assailed with reports of white cops killing blacks.  It's a crisis, a new hysteria!  We can all watch and wait to see if reason finally reigns, if facts and hard statistics trump emotions and anecdotes.  With a press and politicians willing to fan the flames, however, I'm not counting on it.  It will be up to the next generation of journalists to look with an historical eye.Well-written, thoroughly documented, readable and interesting, American Hysteria is worth your time.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33M2C16IBH57R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493003348#wasThisHelpful","R33M2C16IBH57R","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our kids.  There was a time, if you listen to certain people among your parents' and grandparents' generations, when everyone viewed all kids as our kids.  As Robert Putnam documents in Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis, American kids are becoming more and more separated by class.  Whereas in the past children of white collar and blue collar workers lived in the same neighborhoods, and their families were not widely separated socially or economically, children today are less likely to live near and go to school with children of other classes.The growing separation of classes has led to increasing divergence in a variety of educational measures, civic involvement, health measures and other areas.  Interestingly, this phenomenon was formerly tied to race, but now is a measure of class.  (Putnam chiefly uses parents' education as shorthand for class.)Putnam does a nice job of laying out the trends.  His series of ""scissors graphs"" demonstrate the diverging prospects and outcomes for upper and lower class children.  His conclusions aren't terribly hopeful, and his solutions won't satisfy many.  With decreasing social mobility and shrinking equality of opportunity, Putnam calls for additional cash credits to families of young children.  He acknowledges that school quality is chiefly determined by the backgrounds of the children who attend those schools, yet calls for more money for poorer schools.Putnam concludes with a challenge for ""religious communities . . .  to become seized of the immorality of the opportunity gap"" and aggressively mentor children from lower class backgrounds.  Ideally, this would be a tremendous boost for those kids.  But based on the statistics he provides about mentoring, the impact has little potential to be very strong.The scenario Putnam outlines in Our Kids is discouraging (and a little frightening).  I was not left with much hope for turning around the trends he describes.  Residential segregation is at the core, and that's not going anywhere.  Any parents who are financially able will insure that their children go to the best schools, exacerbating school segregation.  I hate to sound pessimistic.  I guess I am.  They are all our kids.  But it takes every parent looking out for their own kids to provide the best opportunities for their kids.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZH7S1GJ9T1IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476769893#wasThisHelpful","R1ZH7S1GJ9T1IO","A346Q7G40L4LNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A346Q7G40L4LNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Is it just me, or is Charles Murray getting angrier and more frustrated as he gets older?  Murray's new book, By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission reveals Murray at the end of his rope.  This stuff he's been writing about for decades--limiting government, declining societal norms, the welfare class, racial divides--is coming to a head.  In By the People, he addresses the out-of-control federal bureaucratic state, offering solutions but with reservations about success.The U.S. federal government has grown beyond anything the founders would ever recognize.  ""Under Republicans and Democrats alike, the federal government went from nearly invisible in the daily life of ordinary Americans in the 1950s to an omnipresent backdrop today.""  He paints a bleak picture of the administrative state, and finds that ""solutions are beyond the reach of the electoral process and legislative process.""In the first several chapters, Murray describes how we got here, a nation of rules, whose rule makers are unaccountable and who frequently impose ""arbitrary or capricious"" rulings.  He compares our system of rules to a Third World kleptocracy, where lobbyists have pay the bribes and legislators shake down donors.  It leads to effectual lawlessness and inevitable corruption.Given the corruption of the legislative process, what does that leave?  The judicial process, of course.  The most substantial section of By the People has Murray calling for civil disobedience, in which people refuse to follow certain types of regulations.  He primarily has in mind businesses whose operation is constrained by those ""arbitrary and capricious"" rules.  In order to protect these righteous scofflaws Murray proposes legal defense funds, similar to the Institute for Justice (only on a larger scale) and industry-specific trade associations.  When a company or work site is targeted by OSHA or other government agency, they will have a means to defend themselves.  Given the number of work sites across the country and the limitations of the regulatory agencies, Murray foresees an eventual concession to a ""no harm, no foul,"" hands-off regulatory atmosphere.  He sees these concessions as potentially changing overall attitudes toward the regulatory state.  ""Once it becomes normal for liberals as well as conservatives to react to stupid regulations with 'This is ridiculous,' the way will have been opened for larger changes.""Murray can be simultaneously bleak and wildly optimistic.  On the one hand, ""The federal government was created with one overriding duty: to allow us to live freely as we see fit. . . . It has betrayed that duty."" Yet, he writes, over the next two centuries, ""America will do a better job of leaving people free to live their lives as they see fit. . . . There will be too much money and too many technological resources to make today's leviathan government necessary.""  In the meantime, I really like his proposal for the Madison Fund, the legal defense fund he outlines.  If he can get the funding and recruit some good lawyers for it, I think it can have the impact he describes.  If he gets busy on this, maybe he will have a role in reining in the bureaucratic state and relieve some of his frustration!

"This is a sweet book for children that points to God as the creator of all things as a child's questions about where things come from are answered by his mother. It is written in rhyme with colorful illustrations.Here's an example:Mama, look!There! Shining bright!Who makes the sparkles in the night?Always near,never far,only Godcan make a star.As with most children's books, this is not deep but I wouldn't expect it to be. It does, however, introduce to young children that all things, including themselves, have been created by God. This is an important first lesson.I liked the simple rhymes that include flowers, the ocean, trees, fruit, the stars, rocks, birds, and humans. The illustrations are delightful as the reader is taken through a day of discovery with a young boy, his mother, and baby sister.

"I was happy to receive this book for review because I have personally participated in this campaign to write letters to people I will never meet after a friend introduced me to The World Needs More Love Letters a few years ago. Since that time I have left letters in random places, for people I will not meet, not knowing where they ended up but knowing that the messages of encouragement transcend gender, age, and circumstance. I have also sent letters to specific people whose stories were posted at the website. I knew a little about the author through her website but it was a treat to read her whole story and discover the details of  how and why More Love Letters started.Hannah's story chronicles the struggle many of us have either gone through at some stage in our lives - or are going through at present - as we've dealt with self-doubt, wanting to know what we are doing matters, finding faith, and realizing that helping others often goes a long way in taking the focus off of our own struggles. For her, writing letters to strangers was not only a way to cope with her own loneliness and doubt, it created the epiphany she needed to grow in her faith and find purpose in her life.It isn't a riveting memoir full of adventure in exotic locations, but it is still captivating. I read it in one day because I was caught up in Hannah's story and how that first letter to a stranger became her life's mission.If I sent a letter to Hannah, this is what I would say:Dear Hannah,Thank you for sharing your journey with me. I was hesitant at first to read a memoir by someone in their 20's because I doubted someone so young would have much wisdom to pass on to me, a 58-year-old married mom to four grown kids and grandma to one. But you proved me wrong. In the pages of your book I saw honesty, grace, and perseverance that I haven't seen in very many people, young or old. Most of all I saw a heart tender to the need of others to just be seen and affirmed as worthy and loved  - something we all can use more of. As I got to the end of your book, I was happy to see that you not only found a way to extend that kind of grace to others, you learned to extend it to yourself as well. Some books challenge us to become our best selves and yours is one of those. And in your journey, God was there all along. If He always made the path easy, the lessons learned would too soon be forgotten. Never doubt His love for you or His presence even if it isn't always obvious, and never fear tomorrow because He is already there.""We look for visions from heaven and for earth-shaking events to see Gods power. ...Yet we never realize that all the time God is at work in our everyday events and in the people around us. If we will only obey, and do the task that He has placed closest to us, we will see Him. One of the most amazing revelations of God comes to us when we learn that it is in the everyday things of life that we realize the magnificent deity of Jesus Christ."" - Oswald Chambersp.s.

"The New Apostolic Reformation is a movement that seeks to return the offices of apostles and prophets, not only to the church in general, but as leadership that the church must submit to. They claim these offices have been long neglected and need to be returned to ""their rightful place of rule.""If you have been exposed to the teachings of Bill Johnson and Kris Vallatton of Bethel Church (Redding, CA), Randy Clark, C. Peter Wagner, Rick Joyner, Cindy Jacobs, Mike Bickle, and Che Ahn, or follow organizations such as Charisma magazine, Bethel Church, The International House of Prayer (IHOP), Healing Rooms Ministry, GOD TV, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), and the Passion Bible paraphrase by Brian Simmons, then you have been introduced to the NAR. Its teachings include dominionism (taking control of the world in order to restore the Kingdom of God in advance of Christ's return), generational curses, prayer walking (specifically to engage in spiritual warfare in neighborhoods or cities), soaking (often a form of meditation that encourages out of body experiences), spiritual transference of power from a NAR leader to someone else, and spiritual mapping (identifying territories or regions that specific demons have been given to rule, and then driving them out).NAR doctrine is also taught under names such as Third Wave, Manifest Sons of God, Kingdom Now, Latter Rain, Word Faith, and Fresh Fire, among others.This book outlines what the NAR is, how it began, what their mission is as stated by its own leadership, and scrutinizes their claims to having authority over the church. The authors then show through scripture which components of it are false teaching and why.Technically speaking, it is written in a clear format that states the facts of what the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) movement is as defined by its own leaders, who those leaders are and what they say about the mission of the NAR, and what scripture they use to defend their (self) appointment as an apostle or prophet and the authority it gives them.  Then, the authors simply take the scriptures the group uses to make their claims, and the actual words of said leaders, and show why this movement is based more on  false teaching and wrong interpretation of scripture than truth. Each chapter addresses a specific component of the movement's teaching. This format appealed to me because I felt it simply presented the facts based on the NAR leadership's own words, then compared that to what the Bible says; focusing more on the facts than opinion.For me, this book also was a great resource for understanding what the biblical roles of apostles and prophets really were and clarified how those roles might manifest in the modern church, if at all. I found that some of my own understanding was challenged, which I always welcome. They do not ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and deny the possibility of any apostleship or prophetic ministry or exercising certain spiritual gifts in the church; they simply take an overview approach to defining the often subjective teachings of this movement - depending on which leader you listen to or what latest ""sign and wonder"" is being touted - and compare them to what the Bible really says. If it doesn't pass the test of scripture then it must be considered false teaching.The book is not anti-charismatic; in fact, many charismatics, including The Assemblies of God leadership, have denounced the NAR. My answer to the critics of this book would also be, if the NAR really is a valid movement based on biblical truth, then there should be no hesitation to have it scrutinized in light of scripture but many of the leadership become very defensive when that happens. That's what we are supposed to do and I feel the authors took a true ""Berean"" approach in looking at the teaching with an open mind while testing it against scripture in order to validate it as either truth or false.The chapter contents include:1. What Is the New Apostolic Reformation?2. NAR Apostles: The Generals3. Apostles in the Bible: A Close Look4. NAR Apostles vs. Apostles in the Bible5. NAR Prophets: The Secret Intelligence Agents6. Prophets in the Bible: A Close Look7. NAR Prophets vs. Prophets in the Bible8. Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare9. What the Bible Really Teaches About Spiritual Warfare10. Unifying the Forces through Apostolic Unity11. A Miracle-Working Army12. What the Bible Really Teaches About MiraclesAs an overview of the NAR and their objectives, this as a great resource for anyone who wants the basic facts about the movement. I found it very informative as it answered questions I had about the movement, confirmed why I felt uneasy about some of the teaching, and actually corrected some misconceptions I had as well.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and a positive review was not required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21G844JLXWWAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941337082#wasThisHelpful","R21G844JLXWWAI","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holly Cramer has made mistakes in the past, including a one-night stand with Creed Kershaw that resulted in the birth of her daughter Lily, whom she adores. She has worked hard to keep the identity of her daughter's father a secret and has avoided all contact with him due to his criminal past.  But when the police come to her home searching for Creed in connection to a drug-related murder, she realizes her secret is no longer hidden.Holly's worst fears come true when Creed shows up and kidnaps her and Lily as he tries to avoid the police, but she soon sees a tenderness in him toward his daughter and begins to question whether he could be guilty of murder. She also discovers his connection to Leonard Miller, the man who killed her sister's fiance and her brother-in-law, and who has eluded all attempts to bring him to justice.Holly has to decide whether to trust Creed to lead authorities to Miller and thereby prove his own innocence, or if it is all a lie that will put her, her daughter, and her family in danger.I enjoyed this latest book in the series, and always appreciate the underlying story of God's redemption for the characters in Blackstock's books, and her ability to create good suspense in the storyline.  Even when the ending isn't always happy, I am never disappointed.Twisted Innocence is the third book in the series and it could stand alone for someone who hasn't read the previous books as enough background is given, but it would be helpful to read the others first.I received a copy of this book for review through the BookLook blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KOPMCB16NKAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310332362#wasThisHelpful","R1KOPMCB16NKAX","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, the best books are those that make me think outside my own box and encourage conversation about things that aren't always comfortable. This is one of those books.I confess I began reading it with some hesitancy because often, and even within the church, to disagree with someone or to not take the politically correct stance is automatically labeled as intolerant, judgmental, or being un-Christlike. Unfortunately, there are a growing number of Christian books that take that approach but I was glad to discover this author didn't. Instead, his focus is that not every issue needs to become a battle or a reason to take sides; that we can hold to our convictions while not attacking those who do not agree with us. He prefers to label disagreements as critiques in which we ask questions and critique opposing views in light of scripture rather than see the person as the enemy or the idea as an argument to be won at all cost so we can be the one who was the most right. As he advises, ""Critique when you must - affirm when you can"" (p. 98). It's a good filter to use.The chapters include the topics of politics, moral and lifestyle choices, wealth vs. poverty, and several other issues that can cause division even though not all are specifically biblical issues (being a Republican vs. a Democrat or how we spend or make our money, for example). The chapter that spoke the most to me was Self-Esteem or God-Esteem that dealt with the issue of pride and caring too much about how others see us instead of who we are in Christ. Often it is pride that drives the need to be right and it's a message I needed to hear as I try to keep the grace filter in place when encountering those I don't agree with.Striving for a way to disagree without offending or being judgmental is a good message but just as one can become a doctrinal bully on the one hand, there is the concern that this kind of message can have us can swing too far the other way and be so concerned that we not offend that we hesitate to take a stand on issues that are truly biblical ones or that are blatant sin. I felt what was missing in this conversation was how to handle those kinds of issues lovingly with other believers without compromising truth when a confrontation is needed - not to win the argument but because the other person's very eternity may be at stake if they continue down a certain path of false teaching or something the Bible clearly says is sin, yet are not open to being questioned. I understand the ""eat the fish, spit out the bones"" approach to those we don't completely agree with, but sometimes the whole fish (the opinion or teaching, not the person) is rotten and needs to be confronted. Maybe it is too big of a topic that needs its own book.That said, over all I do recommend this book because the message of disagreeing without offending and not needing to make everything a battle is a good one and the author encourages us to examine why we are taking sides. Is it for ourselves or for Christ? And if for Christ, are we representing Him well and responding as He would?I received a copy of this book for review through the Tyndale Blog Network book review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9YIXM17R63M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1496400933#wasThisHelpful","R2I9YIXM17R63M","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried some gluten-free recipes that turned out ok but probably won't be used again because they lacked the taste and texture of the original versions I was used to. Another deterrent for me is that the ingredients are either not easy to find or are unappealing. That's why I like Against the Grain. The recipes use simple, real food ingredients while remaining gluten-free for those who need to avoid wheat and other gluten-containing foods.The primary flour ingredients for baking in this cookbook include tapioca starch, rice flour, coconut flour, light buckwheat flour, and potato starch. These are all-natural foods and seem to be easily found in larger grocery stores as well as specialty stores.I tried one recipe so far, Buckwheat Waffles, with good results. In reading through the book, there really wasn't any recipe that I wouldn't be willing to try and all had ingredients that I know I can find at my local grocery store. There are plenty of baked goods included but also main dishes such as pizzas, sandwiches, soups, and casseroles. But the next recipe I will try is the applesauce cake with brown sugar caramel glaze that uses a combination of brown rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca starch. The photo alone convinced me that it will be worth it. Some of the recipes require a food processor to prepare certain ingredients (like making nut butters) and I don't have one so I will probably not attempt those unless I can find the ingredient ready made.The photos in the book are beautiful and inspire me to want to try more of the recipes. My only complaint is that the book doesn't lay open very well when trying to use it in the kitchen. It isn't a reason to not purchase the book, but I do wish publishers would consider that a functional cookbook - perhaps with spiral binding - is more likely to get used.Over all I think this is an excellent choice for anyone needing tasty gluten-free alternatives, either for themselves or a family member.I received a copy of this book for review through the Blogging For Books review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16SPE0HXZ1S4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385345550#wasThisHelpful","R16SPE0HXZ1S4C","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a parent of now adult children, I've been through the toddler years four times. There were things in this book that I wish I had understood better back then such as the message that it is not the parents' job to make their toddler happy; their job is to help the toddler find appropriate ways to cope with unhappiness. I also didn't realize how much toddlers resist change and the anxiety it can cause which explains why something as seemingly benign as putting stuffed animals away in a different order than usual can send a three-year-old into a meltdown. To us as adults, it seems no big deal but to a toddler something major has happened and it can be upsetting. I would have been more patient with things like that had I known better how important structure and routine are to toddlers.I also like that this book is not about permissiveness and lack of discipline. The author stresses that the parent is in control and that being present and consistent are important in raising a toddler. The book has many examples of situations parents of toddlers face with helpful suggestions for handling them. There are several pieces of advice that I agree with such as approaching raising toddlers with a sense of humor intact (good for parenting in general, actually), slow down and understand that a toddler's development takes time, and remember how little your child really is. As a toddler, they have only been in this world a short time, barely past their baby years.The book topics include understanding the mind of a toddler and how to crack the code of their emotions, how they learn, why they do the things they do, and the importance of routines. It is a good source of common-sense information that is practical and easily implemented, and is a book that would not only benefit parents of toddlers but also grandparents and teachers and anyone else who interacts with this age group.I received a copy of this book (paperback version, 2015) for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XFRPFF31I721/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476735131#wasThisHelpful","R1XFRPFF31I721","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the Precious Moments art and enjoyed seeing it combined with poems and scripture in this children's book. Each page features pictures of children doing everyday things and includes a rhyme or poem from various authors including Jean Fischer, Edgar A. Guest, and Robert Louis Stevenson, followed by an appropriate Bible verse.  Some of the themes include ""God Watches Over Me"" when I play, when I think I can't, when I'm hungry, when I get hurt, and several more. It is not deep theology. It's a kid's book, after all. But it does open the dialogue about how God is present and watching over them throughout their everyday activities.This is a beautiful book and the board pages seem durable enough for toddlers. Therecommended age is 1-4 but I would extend that through early readers who would enjoy the rhyming text and colorful pictures.I think this would be a sweet gift to give to young children at Easter.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher through the BookLook Bloggers book review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XE39E877AQAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718011082#wasThisHelpful","R2XE39E877AQAS","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I confess knitting is a challenge for me and I'm most intimidated by the time needed to complete a project, having to remember where I left off, and wondering if I will actually finish what I start. This book is for people like me who don't have the patience or desire to do lengthy projects so the idea of completing something one block at a time is appealing.I have not actually attempted any of the projects but in reading through the book, the instructions and illustrations seem clear and there seems to be something for everyone - from a novice like me to the more experienced knitters who like a challenge. I confess some of the blocks, though beautiful, are beyond my ability or desire to figure out but others are manageable.The projects include afghans, scarves, clothing, bags, toys, and hats. The designs range from simple to intricate; traditional to eclectic. Two of my favorite blocks in the book are the wildflower vine (p.43) and floral fantasy (p.99).The photos are beautiful and show how stunning the individual blocks final projects are. There are 150 block patterns with 10 project designs. A unique feature I found especially appealing is the ""mix and match"" block section at the end of the book where you can cut out thumbnail photos of the blocks and play with them to arrange your own design. Because this is such a beautiful book, though, I would prefer to make color copies of the pages for cutting and leave the book intact.I think this book would be a great addition to any knitter's library as an inspiration for smaller projects.I received a copy of this book for review through the Blogging For Books book review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LT4SQO37ZL36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307586529#wasThisHelpful","R1LT4SQO37ZL36","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We all desire healing or deliverance from suffering. But what if those things do not come in the way or timing we want...or not at all? Is it because we didn't have enough faith? Does it mean God has not answered our prayers or that our circumstances are more than He can handle?Joni Eareckson Tada knows well the questioning that comes the midst of pain and suffering and through this book she gives witness from her own forty-seven years as a quadriplegic that God is indeed in the healing business, always answers our prayers, is the source of our peace and joy in any circumstance, and is never absent through our suffering. But her main message is that the real healing we should seek, and the one God promises through faith in Jesus Christ, is the healing of our hearts from sin to salvation - a far more deep and eternal healing than the physical which scriputre tells us is temporary and fleeting by comparison.This devotional of 31 daily readings encourages the reader to seek this deeper healing. Each reading begins with a personal story from Joni about God's faithfulness in her own life in the midst of struggle, followed by an applicable scripture and closing prayer or thought. The title, Beside Bethesda, is in reference to the Biblical account in John 5 in which Jesus healed a paralyzed man who who was laying by the pool of Bethesda, hoping someone would help him into the water so he could be healed. Jesus passed by, had compassion on him, and healed him.The devotional on God's perspective of time and eternity was especially meaningful to me. In it she writes, ""From where you sit today, what things in your life seem to be taking ""a long time""? Ask the Lord to kneel with you as He knelt with the man at the pool of Bethesda, to feel your frustration and fading hope, and to sustain you with His perspective, gift you with His incomparable peace, and empower you with His patience, so much richer and deeper than your own.""I was also blessed by this thought: ""...the Lord is so supremely in charge of the world that everything touching our lives as Christians is ordered in such a way that it serves our good. This is true whether we face cancer, broken relationships, job loss, bankruptcy...or even a broken neck at age seventeen. The strong hope of the believer is not that we will escape ""bad things"" in the course of our lives, but that God will transform every one of our hardships into an instrument of His mercy to do us good. That assurance goes way beyond the promise that ""everything will be okay."" Romans 8:29 reveals a far more stunning, mind-boggling purpose than that: Through our sufferings, we are being shaped into the very image of God's Son, Jesus Christ.""Beside Bethesda is one of those books I wish I could afford to buy for everyone I know. I especially appreciate the message of joy and hope it brings and am humbled by Joni's honesty about her own times of discouragement and how the Lord sustains her each day. It is a much needed Biblical perspective that focuses on the deeper healing the Lord wants to do in our hearts so that we can be more like Him.With Christmas approaching, this would be a wonderful gift idea.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher as part of their blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TGIVR3XLFGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612917127#wasThisHelpful","R33TGIVR3XLFGV","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his bestselling book, Grain Brain, Dr. David Perlmutter presented evidence of a correlation between high blood sugar and inflamation in the body - caused in part by a high-carb, low-fat diet - and diseases that affect the brain such as Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's Disease, depression, migraines, and ADHD, as well as increased risk for heart disease.  A change in diet that eliminates gluten (found in most grains, flours, and baked goods), sugar, and processed carbohydrates is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of these debilitating conditions now and for years to come and this companion cookbook will make those changes easier.This is a lifestyle change that is of special interest to me as I am dealing with insulin resistance, also known as metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes. Having this cookbook to help with meal choices gives me hope of succeeding in reversing this health issue.I've been impressed with the recipes in my first reading of the cookbook. They use ingredients that are easily found in most grocery stores, are easy to prepare, and are family-friendly. Dr. Perlmutter has done a good job of helping the reader eliminate potentially harmful ingredients while still being able to enjoy favorites such as burgers (check out the Best Beef 'n Cheese Burger), roasted chicken, soups and stews (including chili), and desserts. I also appreciate that some color photos are included for the recipes; always a plus for a cookbook.Two recipes I enjoyed were the Baked Chicken Parcels and the French Fried Almonds (could become my new favorite savory snack!). I have several more tagged to make in the days ahead including Texas-Style Chili; Broccoli, Mushrooms and Feta; Coconut Chicken Soup, Cauliflower Hummus, Spicy Chicken Burgers with Guacamole, Greek Salad, and some of the salad dressings.The cookbook includes an overview of the information discussed in the original book, a helpful list of foods to include in the pantry, foods to avoid, and those to use in moderation. The list of foods that are allowed is a good one that will help me find alternatives to the ones I need to give up as I modify my own recipes so I don't feel deprived or feel I am giving up taste for health.For those who want more information and details of Dr. Perlmutter's program and the science behind it I do recommend reading Grain Brain but for me, this cookbook is a vital tool for success with this lifestyle change.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.Cindy, Books and Chocolate","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD0HVKVADXF9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316334251#wasThisHelpful","RD0HVKVADXF9D","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is much confusion and misunderstanding in the church about who the Holy Spirit is and what His ministry is to believers. Some barely give His presence a passing thought once they become a Christian. Others take it to the opposite extreme of attributing to Him all kinds of strange signs, wonders, manifestations, and requirements to tap into His power for personal gain that are totally unbiblical.Dr. Stanley cuts through the confusion and reveals what the Bible says about this third person of the Trinity, why He was sent to us, what His real ministry is, and what a Spirit-filled life looks like. He explains things such as baptism of the Holy Spirit versus being filled with the Spirit, and what the gifts of the Spirit are. We learn what scripture says is evidence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, mainly by the ""fruit of the Spirit"" (Galatians 5:22). It is the presence of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control in even the most difficult situations that is evidence of His power in the Christian's life. We also see the Holy Spirit at work through the gifts He empowers each believer with to confirm Christ as Savior and the truth of scripture, to edify one another, and to accomplish God's will in the church.Stanley also warns about seeking false manifestations of the Holy Spirit as he writes, ""stay clear of any teacher, preacher, or anyone else who encourages you to do something, read something, or say something to harness the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's power cannot be harnessed. His power cannot be used to accomplish anything other than the Father's will. He is not a candy dispenser. He is not a vending machine. He is not a genie waiting for someone to make wishes. He is Holy God."" (p. 130) He briefly mentions some of the counterfeit practices attributed to the Holy Spirit and why they are not biblical. (For detailed reading about the false teaching and practices some wrongly attribute to the Holy Spirit I recommend John MacArthur's book, Strange Fire.)I appreciated the balanced teaching and focus on scripture in this book as well as Stanley's personal accounts of how the Holy Spirit became real to him. It is a book I can gladly recommend to anyone seeking to know more about who the Holy Spirit is and it is one I am going to read again so I can continue to apply the teaching to my own life as I learn to surrender areas of struggle to the Lord and live a victorious life of faith with the power to do all Christ asks of me.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher's blogger book review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRIRVRVGPBUA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400206154#wasThisHelpful","RRIRVRVGPBUA2","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family teases me about my enjoyment of cheesy disaster movies. They feel a need to remind me that such things are fiction and I (mostly) agree. But on the other hand, wouldn't it be better to be prepared for any scenario than to write it off as impossible? I mean, who would have thought in our lifetime that we would see a winter storm turn into a ""snowmageddon"" or ""snowpocalypse"" or ""polar vortex"". That's what they called recent winter weather on CBS This Morning and other national news programs, and the media would never exaggerate anything so serious. So if a snowstorm or even a blizzard can escalate into something as cataclysmic as a snowpocalypse, then anything can happen, right? Just last summer my local news warned of a stink bug invasion and the summer before that it was gypsy moths and ash tree borers that were threatening to take over mankind. So in light of such things, isn't it better to be prepared than sorry?In any case, my family won't be laughing at me now that I'm armed with all the information I need to protect them from not only sharknados but also polar storms, swamp volcanoes, ice or fire twisters, a beeclipse, bataclysm or the dreaded boaricane. And I'm more prepared than ever to fight off attacks by piranhacondas, gatoroids, and of course, Big Foot. Spoiler alert: a chainsaw should be part of every survival kit and one should also consider including a laser pointer and Axe body spray.In all seriousness, I laughed my way through this book. It is a well-written satire on the real life drama the news media (and weather people in particular) create with their doomsday, end-of-life-as-we-know-it reporting.

"Fried chicken is the ultimate American comfort food and one of my personal favorites so I am happy to see a whole cookbook devoted to it. Most of the recipes are from chefs and restaurants reknown for their fried chicken and offer variations of the classic most of us think of. Others offer something different such as a Spanish version that includes anchovies, Provolone cheese, garlic, and red pepper flakes; and one that is brined in sweet tea. The side dish recipes are likewise a nice mix of classic and trendy, from cole slaw and biscuits to a watermelon Greek salad.The recipes themselves are easy enough for cooks of any level and use ingredients that are mostly basic. Especially helpful is the first chapter entitled Fried Chicken 101 which discusses what oils are best, what kinds of pans to use for best results, and how to choose a chicken, and how to cut one into pieces for frying.Most of the recipes are actual fried chicken using whole pieces with bone and skin intact but there are a few that use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and at least one that is oven-fried, eliminating the need for oil. That is the one I tried and it was great. It uses corn flakes for the breading which maintained the crispy texture one wants with fried chicken. But I also intend to try a classic buttermilk fried chicken recipe to see if I can come close to duplicating what I remember my grandma making.This book has nice photos scattered throughout as well as some personal stories about the cooks featured.

"Kendra Michaels is an agent for hire by both the CIA and the FBI because of her amazing senses and the ability to see what others miss. Once blind and now with sight restored due to an experimental surgery, Kendra uses the heightened senses she developed as a blind person along with sight to catch clues that most other agents overlook.It was this extraordinary talent of observation that led her to determine that a traffic accident was in fact murder. It turns out she was right but more disturbing is that this crime scene was just the beginning of several to follow as a disturbing pattern emerges. Someone is recreating the murders from Kendra's most notorious cases. She has a fan - a stalker - who is now targeting her loved ones and then her as the final victim in his gruesome game.I'm a fan of Iris Johansen. This collaboration with her son Roy featuring one of her characters from previous novels is well done. I enjoyed the suspense and the fact that just when I thought it was over and Kendra was now safe, the authors threw in a surprise ending. I'm looking forward to the next novel featuring this character and recommend this book for a good summer read.I received a copy of this book from the publisher for review but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PG24LYYRQO6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250020522#wasThisHelpful","R2PG24LYYRQO6L","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's easier to achieve a heart-healthy lifestyle when you can cook at home with ingredients you've chosen yourself. The American Heart Association has compiled a collection of more than 250 recipes that helps the home cook do just that. The recipes are not only healthy but the editors have also compiled those that are quick and easy to fix, making this a good cookbook for beginners as well as experienced cooks. They are also great for everyone, with or without heart health concerns.The book begins with a section offering tips for the best times to shop for fresh foods and how to store them, how to cultivate healthy eating habits, and suggestions for leading a healthy lifestyle. The recipe section includes chapters for appetizers, snacks, beverages, salads and dressings, seafood, poultry, meats, vegetarian entrees, vegetables and side dishes, sauces and condiments, breads and breakfasts, and desserts.I was able to try two recipes from this cookbook that I liked - Lemon-Tarragon Chicken and Turkey Pasta Salad with Feta. The recipes seem family-friendly and use regular ingredients I would be able to find at any local grocery store, with a focus on fresh vegetables and fruit, whole grains, and lean meats. That's a plus when you live in a rural area as I do, and don't have easy access to specialty stores. There are a a few photos of some of the recipes in a center section of the book but I would like to see more. I always prefer the kinds of cookbooks that have a photo for nearly every recipe.Overall I do like this collection of recipes and would recommend it to anyone wanting healthier meals.I received a copy of this book through the publisher's blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ2G56AAL868X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307888061#wasThisHelpful","RJ2G56AAL868X","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book challenges readers to not take lightly the holiness and all-powerful nature of God as we also embrace him as our loving savior and father. At times it seems the two are incompatible but as the author points out in scripture, God himself says he is both.I appreciated how this book helped me acknowledge the fearful, holy side of who God is. I've lately been bothered by the trend in the church to make Jesus just like one of us - a good ole' boy we can hang out with and who overlooks our faults under grace. Yes, he is loving and his grace covers ""a multitude of sins"" but we must not lose sight of God's power, holiness, sovereignty, and transcendence. Just as we would have a healthy fear of a tiger or lion - especially if encountered outside of a cage - so we must have a respectful fear of God and not confine him to a cage of our own making that makes us comfortable.Because he is holy, sin and disobedience cannot be tolerated yet he still reaches out to us. One attribute of God (his holiness) doesn't diminish the other (his grace).  Instead of these views being incompatible, they actually work together to give us a true picture of who God is and helps us appreciate his love all the more. As Dyck writes, ""Don't lose sight of God's holiness and power. Those very qualities make his love significant. Without a healthy respect for God's greatness, his affection loses value. ...The affection of a familiar, buddy deity is one thing; the love of the Lord of heaven and earth, the one who dwells in unapproachable light, is something else entirely."" (pp.101-102)This message is needed in the body of Christ. We need to embrace the grace of salvation while at the same time acknowledging the holiness and majesty of God with respectful fear, seeing him as both lion (or in the author's words, tiger) and lamb.I received a copy of this book through the BookLook blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBEB7MS62U35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140020545X#wasThisHelpful","R2LBEB7MS62U35","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The kitchen table is a place where memories are made and cherished for years to come. It's a place to connect with those we love - to encourage and support one another and to celebrate the many blessings in our lives. Gathering around the table provides the opportunity to share life with those we hold dear.""So writes the author LeAnn Rice in the introduction, setting the tone for the cookbook which encourages readers to not make food that is complicated but rather to prepare meals that extends love to family and friends.The recipes themselves are simple enough for any home cook to prepare and are both family and company friendly. It is a complete collection of recipes that includes breakfast dishes, breads, salads, soups, sandwiches, main entrees, side dishes, and desserts. The recipes I was able to try so far with good results included the Italian Meatloaf and Split-Pea Soup. I have several others bookmarked such as the Southern-Style Beef Tips Over Rice, Cheese Overload Macaroni and Cheese, and Caramel Apple Crisp. The recipes have common ingredients that can be found at any grocery store, which I appreciate. If I have to hunt for ingredients that aren't easily found locally, I'm not likely to make the recipe.There are plenty of photos included which is always a plus, although some of the photography is amateurish and makes the food look less appealing than if a professional did the photos. But that said, including some photos is better than none and the good recipes make it worth having. The personal notes by the author about the stories behind some of the recipes, or her suggestions are good and lend themselves to the homey feel of the book.Overall I did like this cookbook. It is one I can see myself using on a regular basis as well as giving it as a gift.I received a copy of this book from the publisher as part of their blogger book review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1MRF0OS8QV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401605265#wasThisHelpful","R2J1MRF0OS8QV9","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John Luther is among the most popular mega-church pastors and televangelists of his day, able to influence thousands every time he speaks. What he wants most is to simply preach the gospel and enjoy life with is wife and daughter but when he refuses to support a sweeping religious equality bill that would ultimately restrict religious freedom and speech, he is targeted by some of the most powerful people in Washington who will stop at nothing to see the bill passed.Luther is framed for the murder of a teenage girl and in a single day goes from beloved pastor to fugitive. He is on the run while trying to gather evidence to prove his innocence and expose the truth behind the religious equality bill and those supporting it. As he uncovers who is behind framing him and why, he also discovers the heartbreaking truth of who his true friends are while finding help from unexpected sources. The trail leads him all the way to the White House and the plan of a powerful Senator to simply ruin Luther's reputation as punishment escalates to sending an assassin to silence him permanently and puts everyone he cares about in danger.This was one of the best political/suspense thrillers I've read, as good as any Tom Clancy novel. It is actually based on a Daniel Lusko movie by the same name, due to be released in July 2014.The topic of limiting freedom of speech as it relates to religion is timely as political correctness in Washington more and more means religious censorship. This story entertains the idea of how far some legislators might go to limit religious freedom in the name of equality and political correctness, and makes the case that it is not a matter of if but when such legislation will be passed and persecution will follow for those who refuse to comply with silence.Although the story itself is a well-written fiction thriller, the theme of censorship and persecution for holding to one's religious and personal convictions is a real topic that should concern everyone, which is why I recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians alike.I received a copy of this book for review as part of the publisher's book review blog program, but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TGLB6VFYVGXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764212664#wasThisHelpful","R3TGLB6VFYVGXH","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fan of real pen and paper letter writing, I found this book to be a great resource for writing memorable letters to anyone, for any occasion.  It takes letter writing beyond pen pal status to writing letters to express gratitude to those who have impacted our lives, commemorating special occasions for children such as the first day of school, and letting loved ones know just how much they mean to us, to name a few suggestions.The book is divided into three sections: The Basics of Writing a Treasured Letter, Writing for Special Occasions, and Writing for Occasions Made Special.  There are also helpful sections that include age-appropriate word lists to use in letters, inspirational quotes, and suggested sentence ""jump starts"" to help one get started.This book inspired me to think beyond writing thank you notes or letters about daily life to pen friends (and those are good things to continue) to sending more personal, thoughtful letters to my kids, husband, and friends that they will want to keep.Something has been lost with email, texting, and tweeting.  Real, meaningful letter writing will reconnect us and keep us connected when we take the time and effort to express heartfelt thoughts in this way.I received a copy of this book from the author for review but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicted, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTIVO6EG72RUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0985800801#wasThisHelpful","RTIVO6EG72RUY","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the core message of this book: Difficult people will always be with us and we can't fix them.  However, we can change our perspective about them and make better choices for ourselves that don't make us victims to their dysfunction.I found some helpful advice early on in the book in the chapter entitled How Relationships Work.  In it the author addresses five myths of relationships, including thinking that we can make someone respond differently if we can just make them understand the facts.  This doesn't always work because logic and emotions don't mix.  Another myth is that if the other person will just get right with God, everything will be ok.  It can help but it's an unrealistic expectation that all problems will be automatically be resolved because no one is perfect and some issues will continue to surface in the relationship.With all the great advice throughout the book, the chapter that helped me the most personally was the one on prioritizing relationships.  I felt it gave me permission to focus on the relationships most important to me without feeling guilty for not getting drawn into the drama of the dysfunctional ones.  It's true we sometimes can't avoid those kinds of relationships altogether when they involve family, co-workers, etc., so there are helpful tips given for dealing with those people without letting them drain our time and emotions so we can spend that ""currency"" on the relationships we value most.Book sections include Stuck in a Crazy World, Changing Someone Else, Changing Yourself, Changing Your Environment, and Putting It Into Practice.  Within those sections are chapters on how relationships work, the impact of influence, the energy of emotions, seeing ourselves and others realistically, living through the lens of kindness, knowing when to leave, and giving up on getting straight A's, to name a few.I enjoyed the author's conversational style and found many helpful and practical techniques for dealing with ""crazy"" people.  This is a book that would be helpful to anyone, whether they are dealing with family members, co-workers, neighbors, or any other relationship.I received a copy of this book for review from Revell as part of their blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PAT40HRKDBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080072111X#wasThisHelpful","R23PAT40HRKDBW","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to sum up this cookbook in one word: fun!  From the colorful graphics to the personal style of the author, this collection of 650 recipes makes menu planning and cooking an enjoyable experience.  (One caveat: if you detest pink, you won't like this book because every page is pink.  I happen to like the color so for me it wasn't an issue.)A lot of the recipes are for one serving which is good news for singles who enjoy cooking, and any recipe can be doubled, tripled, etc., to meet the needs of a family or larger gathering.  It is unexpectedly versatile because everyone can use it from single college students to newlyweds cooking for two to larger families.If food doesn't taste good, we won't bother and that's the point of this cookbook.  It offers tasty and satisfying low-calorie recipes that fill us up without the guilt. Many of them rely on artificial sweeteners, fat-free foods, and processed foods such as liquid egg substitute like Egg Beaters, Splenda, fat-free sour cream and salad dressings, bottled sauces, canned fruit and vegetables, etc. but they can be easily modified using the whole or fresh food versions for people who aren't counting calories or don't like the low-calorie or processed ingredients. Overall I found the recipes to be healthy alternatives to most restaurant or fast-food choices and portion sizes are large enough to be satisfying while not encouraging overeating.  Mostly I like that the recipes use ingredients easily found in any grocery store and can be easily modified to personal taste.Each recipe includes icons to indicate serving size, amount of preparation time, meatless dishes, and those that use five ingredients or less.  There is no icon for freezer-friendly dishes but it seems that many of them would be suitable for making ahead and freezing for future meals.There are 16 chapters that include Egg Mugs and Egg Bakes, Oatmeal Bowls, Parfaits, Faux-Frys: Poppers, Onion Rings, Chicken Nuggets and More; Pasta, Pizza, Mexican, Crock-Pot, Party Foods, Burgers and Fries, Sweet Stuff, and Foil Packs, plus more.  I tried the Mexi-Licious Egg Mug and was pleasantly surprised at how easy and tasty it was.  Mix the ingredients in a mug, microwave it, stir, and enjoy.  There are lots of egg mug recipes with variations and they are easy enough that even my teenage son can fix his own breakfast this way.Other recipes include Chili Cheese Egg Mug (195 calories), Cinna-Raisin Oatmeal (301 calories), Over the Rainbow Pancakes (267 calories), Onion Rings Parm (176 calories), Garlic-Bread White Pizza (289 calories), Southwestern Meatloaf (232 calories), Cheesed-Up Taco Turkey Burgers (219 calories), Veggie-Loaded Cashew Chicken (318 calories), Gooey-Good Fuji Apple Pie (159 calories),  and Chocolate PB Pretzel Cupcakes (135 calories), to name just a few from this generous collection.There aren't photos on every page or for every recipe but there are two photo sections with dozens of pictures, and photos of all the recipes in the cookbook can be seen at the Hungry Girl website (hungry-girl.com/books).  While not included in the book itself, Weight Watchers point values for recipes can also be found at the website.  However, the book does include nutritional values for calories, fat, carbs, sodium, fiber, and protein.I like the variety, versatility, and fun approach to low-calorie cooking offered in this cookbook and would recommend it as a great gift for anyone no matter the level of cooking experience or family size.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF7XQ24SN938/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312676786#wasThisHelpful","RBF7XQ24SN938","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my kind of cookbook, filled with real recipes that my family will eat, using real whole food ingredients that I can find at my local grocery store.  The author takes the best of the Mennonite comfort foods that she grew up with and shares them with a down-home style that cooks of any level of expertise will enjoy.Chapters include appetizers, dips, beverages, breakfast and breads, salads and dressings, summer sandwiches and winter soups, garden fresh veggies, comfort food, sides, main dishes, desserts, cookies, cakes, bars, and a chapter on do-it-yourself recipes that include baking and seasoning mixes, homemade chocolate syrup, a recipe for homemade laundry soap, and more.I tried one recipe, Layered Meatless Mexican Casserole (except I cheated and added some chicken), and enjoyed the results.  Other recipes I have tagged to try include Swiss Cheese Quiche, Old Fashioned Beef Stew, Baked Rosemary Chicken, Grape Salad, and Pumpkin Caramel Cheesecake.Overall I like this cookbook.  However, there are no photos except for the front and back cover.  A cookbook is always more enjoyable when pictures of the recipes are included.Another issue for me was at the end of most recipes there are suggested modifications that begin with ""And Another Thing..."" except that phrase is oddly repeated twice every time so as an example it reads like this: ""And Another Thing...And Another Thing...If you do not have a zester, you can use a vegetable peeler.""  Or, ""And Another Thing...And Another Thing...For variety, add 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 3 tablespoons fresh chives.""

"Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan is contacted by her mother, Sandra, for help in finding a missing friend, Beth Avery, who has escaped from a mental hospital after years of confinement, most of that time spent sedated by drugs.  Parts of Sandra's story don't quite add up and as Eve discovers more details about Beth and the circumstances leading up to her being admitted to the hospital, Eve also discovers secrets in her mother's past involving Beth that connects Eve to this woman she has never met.Eve is joined by her boyfriend, detective Joe Quinn, and profiler Kendra Michaels to piece together the puzzle that is Beth Avery's life.  It soon becomes apparent that certain members of the powerful Avery family have a reason to want Beth silenced for good.  Eve, Joe, and Kendra have to outwit the particularly ruthless assassin hired to find and kill Beth and soon become his targets as well.I'm a fan of Iris Johansen and especially the Eve Duncan series.  Although it helps to have read the previous books for Eve's backstory, enough is explained in this one that it can stand alone for a newcomer to the series.  I did enjoy the storyline and having the character of Kendra Michaels (introduced in Close Your Eyes) brought back. For me, this was another great page-turner from Johansen and I'm already looking forward to the next one in the series.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/REMT4FWRF7Y4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312651244#wasThisHelpful","REMT4FWRF7Y4J","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading about chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi, her family, and the team of people who were intrumental in helping her see the potential for a life beyond the slum that is the only home she has ever known has been nothing short of a humbling experience. Although parts of Phiona's story are heartbreaking and some of the challenges seem insurmountable, her resolve to pursue her passion of becoming a chess Grandmaster despite the odds is inspiring.In a society where reality t.v. stars (and some athletes) are given non-deserved celebrity status for doing nothing more than behaving badly, it is refreshing to read about someone who can teach all of us something about faith in God in the worst of circumstances, humbleness, perseverance, and daring to dream for what seems impossible.  For most people the motivation to be the best at something is fame and fortune; for Phiona, being a chess champion is a matter of survival emotionally, physically, and economically.  It helps provide food for her family for another day or two, and shelter for another week or maybe even a month.  It has the potential to open doors for education that she might not have otherwise.Once I started reading Phiona's story, I couldn't stop.  When I reached the end I wanted more because her story is not finished yet.  I want a sequel or some kind of postscript to know what has happened to her since the publication of this book. I find myself thinking about her every day, wondering if she and her family have been able to get out of the slum of Katwe and how she is doing in the next championship.This is the story of a real-life hero and role model that adults and teens need to read, and that needs to be shared with other children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R558AF1NQG27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451657811#wasThisHelpful","R558AF1NQG27","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Written in the style and theme of LaHaye's Left Behind books, The End Series featuring Joshua Jordan is a fast-moving Christian fiction thriller that presents possible political and military scenarios that could usher in the prophecies in scripture surrounding the end times and coming to power of the anti-christ.This is the third book in this series and finds Joshua Jordan in exile due to trumped up charges of treason against him by the United States after he refuses to cooperate with the plans of the corrupt President.  His wife Abigail, a lawyer, is his only hope to have the charges dropped but she has also become a target of U.S. authorities for her refusal to accept the government-mandated biochip implant required for every citizen.  Their adult son and daughter are also caught up in uncovering plans involving officials that will make believers enemies of the state and puts Israel in peril, and soon the entire Jordan family is in danger.  In the midst of all this drama are unfolding events that one by one point to the soon return of Christ as revealed in scripture.The ending of this book was somewhat predictable and could have ended the series except for another character that became prominent, making it possible for a fourth title featuring him in the ongoing battle against the rise of the anti-christ.I did enjoy this third title in the series and I think fans of the Left Behind books and other fiction by LaHaye and his co-authors will welcome this one to their collection.  Although this book presents a good storyline on its own, it does help to have read the first two in the series so as to fully understand what is going on.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher as part of their blogger review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WU2SE5JUMEGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031032646X#wasThisHelpful","R2WU2SE5JUMEGF","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a daily devotional based on the author's book, The 4:8 Principle: The Secret to a Joy-Filled Life (based on Philippians 4:8 in the Bible).  The idea is to transform thoughts from negative to positive as the apostle Paul encourages believers to do in that verse.I'm not naturally a ""Pollyanna"" type personality and confess that books like this tend to irritate me more than encourage me but I was pleasantly surprised as I read this one.  The approach isn't a chirpy rah-rah speech every day (thank you, Mr. Newberry!) but rather takes a realistic approach to helping the reader discover a way to think more positively in specific circumstances while acknowledging that it doesn't come easily for most of us.  I appreciated the ""think this, not that"" approach with suggestions I could comfortably embrace; things like thinking compassionate thoughts rather than harsh ones, bold instead of comfortable, serving instead of self-centered, victory instead of defeat, etc.Each day offers a 2-3 page reading on a specific topic, followed by an application exercise, thought for the day, and a prayer.  One reading that I especially appreciated was on Day 8: Stop Identity Theft.  This devotional dealt with seeing ourselves in the positive light and truth of scripture and what God says about us rather than being defined by worldly influences.  Other topics include Take a Vacation From Yourself, The Gift of the Present, Feeling vs. Fact, Harboring Gratitude, Whatever Your Hands Find to Do, to name a few.I do like this devotional and look forward to continuing my journey through it.  With Christmas coming up, this would be a great gift to give to friends and family.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher as part of their blog review program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKLH6S0BHEE32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414366906#wasThisHelpful","RKLH6S0BHEE32","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Medical Examiner Serena Hopkins is called to a murder scene that reveals the victim is someone she knew and as other victims turn up it becomes apparent that women Serena graduated from high school with are the targets.  The murderer is playing a game with poetic clues and dolls sent to Serena, challenging her and FBI agent Dominic Allen to figure out who the next victim will be.  It soon becomes apparent they are dealing with a copycat killer since the method is identical to that of a serial killer from years ago but that person is in prison and couldn't have commited the recent murders. Then, when Serena herself becomes the target, Dominic must put his romantic feelings for her aside in order to save both their lives.This is the second book in the Deadly Reunions series in the genre of Christian romance and suspense.  Because of the many references to characters and events introduced the first book (When the Smoke Clears), it's advisable to read that one first so as not to become confused.  The plot itself is unique and interesting and held my interest so much that I finished the book in one day and liked that I was completely surprised by who the killer was.  The storyline also included a subplot dealing with domestic abuse and runaway teens that added another interesting layer to the story.Because this is part of a series with an ongoing storyline introduced in the first book and continued in this one, there isn't closure on certain aspects of that which creates more frustration for me than anticipation.  That issue aside, I did feel this book was better than the first in the series with a unique storyline and I'm hoping the next one will be even better and worth the wait.  Hopefully the underlying story introduced in the first two books about a mutual friend of the other characters who is in hiding due to something she witnessed as a teenager will finally be resolved in the next.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher as part of their Revell Blog Tour program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEOFL7QX3OEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800720083#wasThisHelpful","R3EEOFL7QX3OEQ","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful book that is more than just a cookbook.  It addresses the topic of hospitality from a Christian perspective, has gorgeous photos of home decor and table setting ideas, and of course, recipes that make entertaining easy.Chapters include Three Delightful Luncheons, Festive Occasions, Four Convivial Dinners, Hospitality For the Very Young, International Cuisine, Blessed by Guests Who Stay Awhile, and Prayers of Gratitude.  Full menus along with the recipes are featured.I made a version of CC's Turkey Casserole, substituting a few ingredients with what I had on hand and was happy with the outcome.  Other recipes I hope to try include Spicy Sausage and Chicken Lasagne, Strawberry Fluff, Chocolate Coffee Pie, and Bacon and Blue Cheese Salad.  The recipes use ingredients that are easy enough to find or can be readily substituted without compromising the finished product.I enjoyed reading this book because it has so much more than just recipes. The photos are stunning and sprinkled throughout the chapters are quotes and scripture relating to hospitality and food.  It's not quite a ""coffee table"" book but it is larger than most cookbooks and would be a great gift for a hostess or favorite cook in the family.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher as part of their blogger program but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OELU5JVU6GL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401604536#wasThisHelpful","R24OELU5JVU6GL","A2TDE0GPWZHODP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TDE0GPWZHODP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've owned a Bissell carpet cleaner for about 15 years, and recently replaced it with this one.  Overall, I like the two reservior system (one for clean vs. dirty water). This new one doesn't have a few features that my old one did, but I think it's a better replacement in overall usefulness and effectiveness.  As for convenience, this one is a bit better as well.My old one had a series of lights that showed when you were moving the correct speed for effective cleaning and it also allowed more control over the amount of detergent used.  But, I really didn't like the old clean/dirty water system as it was a pain to use.  It also had a way to turn off the suction, which this new one doesn't.This cleaner is lighter than my old one, and has two rows of brushes instead of a single row.  It also seems to have better weight on the suction part of the cleaner to help with pulling water back out of the carpet.  It does seem to clean well, although it left my carpet more damp in some spots than others.The thing I like the least is how you have to fill the clean water tank.  There's only a small hole in the top, and the handle is kind of lower than the hole.  I fill it with hot water, but when filling from a tub, the water stream is too big to all go in the hole.  The water collects by the handle notch, which is right where your hand is, and therefore can burn.  There's no drain holes by the handle, so any excess water that spills there has to be emptied by putting the cap on the reservoir and then turning upside down.  Additionally, when holding it in the air, it doesn't hang vertically plumb, so you can't really tell if you're at the fill line or not.  The problem with this is that to properly measure the detergent, you fill clean water to the line, then add detergent to the next line.  That's fine if you have a flat surface to fill on, but sinks and tubs aren't always ideal for this.As for the easy-add detergent mechanism, it's ok, but not really anything to purposely buy this model for.  It's not like it automatically adds detergent while you're using it.  It's simply a way to add detergent while the lid is on the clean water tank.  Since you have to take the lid off to fill each time, and detergent has to be mixed with clean water anyway, I found it easier to just dump detergent in with the lid off.Pros:Clean and dirty water tubs are sized well to each otherLight for a carpet cleanerHeats the waterCons:No Pretreat/no suction abilityMust mix detergent directly in clean waterClean water tank is hard to fillShort cord","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KWTHRS953H99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C9A5K#wasThisHelpful","R1KWTHRS953H99","A3EK2KTYHJCPB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EK2KTYHJCPB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very comfortable and supportive, though the gel layer is a bit too squishy for my liking.  When turning or coming to a stop it actually allows some movement under your feet.  It also tends to wander as it's stepped on, so it's not completely immune to sliding on our hardwood.  Not that it would slip out from under you, but about once a day we have to reposition it.

"I like the fit, though I really don't notice the oval shape at all.  These are more comfortable than many other earbuds I've had, and I like the feel of them.  They are metal, which keeps them small and solid.  The left ear has a slight texture on the cord's strain relief so that you can tell just by feel which is which.  The cord is plenty long, and the right angle connector fits in my phone's case easily.Things that I wish were different include having more button on the inline control.  It's only a single button, so no volume control or back/forward or volume controls.  I wish the right angle connector was shaped a bit differently so that it's easier to remove from the headphone jack.  Also, while the sound is decent and pretty good, it's a bit light on the low end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBC7BEL8QK5C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NA2NBU#wasThisHelpful","RBC7BEL8QK5C1","A3EK2KTYHJCPB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EK2KTYHJCPB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually received the black plaid shorts, but since I liked them, decided to keep them rather than exchange them.  The fit is perfect on me and I don't necessarily even need a belt.  The material reminds me of swimsuit fabric - it's that light and kind of crinkly.  But, on the inside, it has a texture to it that makes it feel more like normal shorts, so they wear much more comfortable than a swim suit.  They are pretty hard to wrinkle, and even when I fold them, they look good.

"This review provides a comparison of three sleeping bags:Slumberjack Boundary 20-Degree Sleeping Bag - RegularSlumberjack Boundary 40 Degree Sleeping Bag - RegularNorthstar Tactical Operations Sleeping Bag Hooded Mummy 30 - 40 Degrees (Black)Of the three, the Northstar bag is more fully featured.  In addition to the full length draft tube along the zipper, it has draft tubes around the collar, a pocket inside near the top, has larger, more robust zippers, and a much better stuff sack.What the Slumberjacks have going for them are that they are a bit more roomy, but they are more expensive for a similar temperature rating.  While they also seem to be a bit thicker, I'm reserving final comparison until after I've washed and dried the Slumberjacks several times as I've done with the Northstar.Between the Slumberjacks, the construction of the different temperature ratings (I have both the 20 degree and 40 degree) is exactly the same, they just have more fiberfill for the colder rating.  The colder rated bag has a slightly larger stuff sack as well.  I do like that the Slumberjacks have a different trim color for the ratings, and that the rating is printed on the bag itself.  I do wish the stuff sack was printed, just to make it easier to identify the difference.The roomyness of the Slumberjacks is a big plus for me.  I'm 5'10"" and around 210lbs, and I was a tight fit in the Northstar unless I was on my side.  In the Slumberjack, I could lay on my back and not have to have my arms on top of me.When it comes to the stuff sacks, I'm disappointed in the Slumberjacks.  The sack doesn't have a cover for the top - it's just a flap of fabric that kind of flops over the hole in the top, but since it's on the inside of the sack, any water getting in there will still soak your bag.  Also, the drawstring's stopper doesn't have a really tight hold on the cords, so it comes open fairly easily.  Contrast that to the Northstar's stuff sack, which has a full cover and large nylon straps and buckles to allow you not only to keep water out, but also compress the overall size of the packed bag, and it's a real letdown that Slumberjack included such a cheap sack for the price they charge.So in summary, while nicely constructed and they do offer more room than the Northstar, I think the Northstar has some nicer extra features with the extra draft tubes, pocket and much better stuff sack.  When you get into the colder rated bags, the pricing seems similar, so it might come down to room vs. features in order to make your final decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGD29W35Q7E3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQF9FTU#wasThisHelpful","RGD29W35Q7E3I","A3EK2KTYHJCPB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EK2KTYHJCPB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fits perfectly over my table, just like the picture shows.  I like how long it is, because the wind doesn't get under it easily, and I can just push our chairs in to keep it in place rather than use the straps.  My table is on a 2nd storey deck, so we get a lot of wind, rain and sun.  It's holding up really well so far.  I also like that the straps at all four corners have actual buckles rather than just velcro.  The buckles are big and sturdy as well, so it's good quality all around.  About the only thing I could even complain about a little bit is that since it's big, there's a seam in it that runs along the length of the cover.  It' placed off-center, so it doesn't have all that great of a look, and at first I thought I had it positioned incorrectly.  I'd rather have had a clean seamless top, or have two seams, but have them offset so that neither of them were on the flat surface of the table.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXXZSO7CMTVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFIZ4FW#wasThisHelpful","R3BXXZSO7CMTVN","A3EK2KTYHJCPB9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EK2KTYHJCPB9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I seem to drink a lot of beverages. I prefer them to be unsweetened and non-alcoholic. Plus, they have to taste acceptable to me. I recently found a real good one at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. Its called Pure Leaf Tea, ice tea if you like. I seldom ice mine, but almost always drink it cold. Good! Nice fresh-brewed flavor, slight but good aftertaste. Non-sweetened, of course. Its quite refreshing. An 18.5 ounce bottle goes down quite easily, especially on a hot day. This is a good bottled tea, one of the  best in my opinion.

"Back in my youth, I used to love Cheez-its. I could sit down and eat a whole box. Mmmmmm, good. Well, a lot has happened since then. Somewhere along the line, Goldfish appeared. Hmmmm. Is there any difference besides the shape of the cracker. I don't think I could tell the difference. Either one is equally good, in my opinion. It just so happens that my little store sells only Goldfish, so that's my latest choice whether I prefer them or not. I actually prefer Cheez-its, but the difference is ever-so-small that I don't worry about it.Another change is that these little morsels come in a variety of different-size and different types of packets. I prefer the smaller ones. It's a way of controlling my intake, a necessary way to do things with these little jewels. Mostly I buy them in one to two-ounce bags. Sometimes I buy the little 2-ounce milk-container-like boxes. This way, its much easier to control my intake. I'll have one or two packets per sitting and thats it!In another change, the little packets now come in regular baked crackers and whole-grained crackers. I've opted for the whole-grained variety. I actually prefer the old non-whole-grained crackers, but my long-tern health concerns suggest that whole-grained ones might be a teeny bit better. My latest acquisition is a large bag of smaller bags and this worked rather well. I can eat one of two of the smaller bags and experience little guilt, as opposed to pigging out on a whole box or large bag. Alas, choices, choices.

"I enjoy late night snacking while reading or watching TV. I'm on a diet emphasizing cutting out as much sugar as possible and peanuts fit the bill with less than one gram per serving.. By the way, my bag is only 12 ounces and is branded with the ""San Diego Padres Baseball Club"" imprinted on the label. Probably a local variant. Same salted in the shell nuts. Different size bag. Same Hampton Farms logo. Maybe every city large enough to have a baseball club has it's own variant. Interesting way to sell more nuts, I suppose. In any case, they're quite good nuts. Mine seemed a little stale (not a problem) and I would have preferred them to be a little saltier. My last bag of peanuts was a five-pound bag of Hoodies that was stale to the point of inedible.

"Cleaning the bathroom bowl is one of those tasks I always find myself putting off. It's an onerous chore! In my bachelor's days I used to let it go so long that an ugly dark ring would form around the water level and the entire sub-water area would be deeply discolored. I remember one time when it was particularly bad because I had run out of bowl cleaner and I couldn't seem to remember to buy some more when I went to the store. So, one day I found myself in the local discount store (Wall-Mart) looking over the cleaning goods. Alas, all the bowl cleaners were gone except for one brand called ""The Works,"" of which plenty was available. ""The Works"" was only about half the cost of the other unavailable popular brands, and I figured that was probably why they had so much of it. It probably didn't work nearly as well. In any case, my situation was desperate, so I picked up a bottle.Upon getting it home, I took it into the bathroom and emptied a portion into the festering bowl. It was a light, watery and largely uncolored liquid, quite unlike the thick, sticky oddly-colored popular brands. My reaction was negative. There was no way this watery stuff was going to clean that filthy bowl. I let it set for about an hour and then returned with my toilet bowl brush determined to carry out the onerous task. Whisk, whisk, whisk and the bowl gleamed. I was absolutely dumbfounded! This is a hard water region and the bowlstains always required scrubbing. With this stuff, one wipe and they were gone. Amazing! Astonishing! It was, by far, the best bowl cleaner I had ever found, and the cost was bargain basement. The next time I visited the store and tried to pick up some more, none was available. The same thing happened on the following trip. Then one day, it was back. I picked up ten bottles. It was that good. I've been using it ever since.""The Works"" is an amazing unsung product. I've never seen an ad for it and I don't see the product in most stores. Evidently, the advertising is largely word of mouth and the product can be hard to find. But if you're ever interested in getting your bathroom bowl as fresh and sweet as a spring breeze with an absolute minimum of effort, give it a try.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UF332R95JU5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HXLQ9U#wasThisHelpful","R2UF332R95JU5U","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two cats, one cat litter box, a 42-pound bag of clumping cat litter and a tendency not to clean the box often enough. In fact, one time I let it go so long that the box was just one clump. LOL! As such, I tend to break a lot of litter scoops trying to remove some of the larger lumps. I know, it's all my fault, and I ought to take better care of the box. However, at my age, I doubt that I'm going to reform. Plus, the cats seem to be very tolerant and don't complain. Well, I've gone through a lot of scoops in the seven years I've had the cats. The latest scooper has held up well. It seems to be made of a tougher plastic and has lasted a lot longer than the less flexible ones that are made of brittle plastic. I don't recall where I bought it, but this little scooper has a price tag on it that is about half of the listing price here. As such, the lower price plus the tougher construction makes it a good value. Perhaps I should go to one of the stainless steel scoopers, but this one is pretty good for plastic and I tend to be somewhat cheap.Gary Peterson","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DFRVB5ULFCDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIB9NWE#wasThisHelpful","R2DFRVB5ULFCDM","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A few years ago I noticed that my large toenails were discolored. I thought nothing of it, but someone said that I had toenail fungus. Toenail fungus? What next? Anyway, I put up with it because it didnt seem to be doing any harm and I always keep the nails under cover.A more recent lady friend noted my ugly nails and said I really ought to do something about them. She gave me a small bottle with a small brush and said I was to apply the liquid several times a day. The liquid was FungiCure. I painted the nails on an irregular basis ever time I managed to remember it (about once every three days or so for about the next month). Then, earlier this week, I looked at the nails and the discoloration was almost  entirely gone and the nails looked much more healthy. This FungiCure Broad Spectrum Anti-Fungal liquid had apparently done the job. Great! The nails not only appeared better, they also looked better. They felt better too.

"I take daily low-dose (8 mg) aspirin and have for many years. I don't use it as a pain reliever, although it might work fine if needed for that purpose. I use it to thin my blood. I have an occasional irregular heartbeat and the doctor said that condition can lead to the formation of blood clots. He wanted to put me on Warfarin. I read the warnings and looked for some other way. I found baby aspirin and asked my doctor about it. He said it would probably work, but wouldn't be as good. That suited my temperament well. In any case, I've been using it for years and years and have experienced no difficulties.I've use a wide variety of brands. but I guess they're all about the same.

"In the late Fall of 1970, I read the book ""Vitamin C and the Common Cold"" by Linus Pauling. I found the book to be very interesting, followed his instructions and went eight years without a cold or case of the flu. I was astonished in that. for me, at least 2 or 3 colds per winter season were ""normal."" Much later, I became much more interested in the immune system and started eating probiotic foods, mainly yogurt along with my more normal intake.. I was very pleased with the Vitamin C plus yogurt regimen and told a lot of people about it, much to their disinterest and/or disbelief. However, I've had great resistance to infectious diseases and I'm very pleased. I someone doesn't want to listen, that's their business and I won't press the matterMuch later, I discovered probiotic capsules containing up to one billion bacterial units and started taking them. When I retired, about 4 years ago, the elderly man in charge of my folder remarked that I had more unused sick leave hours of anyone he had ever checked out or heard about over his entire career. We get extra retirement credit for unused sick leave time, I should add, and I got quite a bit. At about that  time, I switched to a Trunature Digestive Probiotic capsule containing 3 billion units and I've been using them for about 3 years. I found them in a package of 100 capsules at Costco. Alas, about a year ago, they disappeared and I went back to the 1 billion count capsules. Then, about 6 months ago, some more Trunature Capsules (those reported on here) containing up to 10 billion units each made an appearance. I grabbed them in an instant and have been taking them ever since. I'm amazed at the results.A person might want to use these probiotic capsules for two different reasons. One is to remain free of infectious diseases. I've been almost  free of such ailments for the past 4 decades, and my semi-public Kaiser Permanente health records might document my statement. It's hard to prove, however, I might be just an extraordinarily healthy person. Then again, it might be my nutritional awareness and special care. Who knows?A second factor related to my probiotic regimen might be my bowel record. For me, constipation has been rare and very mild. I'm almost never overly runny either, unless I have eaten something that disrupts my system and that only lasts for a day or so. When I go into the bathroom and sit down, that little rest typically lasts under a couple minutes.So, all of this might be regarded as non-scientific hearsay. I'm a PhD scientist, by the way, but not in the area of nutrition and/or medication. I'm a geologist and deal mostly with rocks. If my information might be of help and/or use to you in any way, I'm delighted.

"I first bought a Casio watch (chronograph) in 1982 when I began running and needed a timer for racing. I loved it. This is my fifth Casio. This is a wonderful watch, but they don't last very long. The timepiece itself is excellent. The biggest flaw is the watch band breaking. Flexing a plastic band for fastening it on and off will ultimately crack and break the band. Be careful. Open and close it with the least flexing as possible and the band will last much longer.  A second flaw are the buttons. They can be hard to operate and become stuck with the least amount of grime. This one is very hard to operate for me (I'm 77), however, my small boy (age 6) with his tiny fingers can seem to manage. Such is life. Despite these difficulties, it's a wonderful watch and I will continue to buy them. In any case, it's a marvelous timepiece!All of my other Casios were black, as  are 99 out of a 100 that you will see. This time I spotted this red one and decided to try it for a change. I like the color and it's amazing how many people will spot it and comment. Go figure. The color makes no difference in the workings,  of course.Remember the days when everything seemed to be made in Japan? Well, I do and Casio products were some of those things.

"I have a Brazilian Pepper tree in my front yard. Some people consider it a Southern California weed, but I rather like it. It's about 20 feet tall and has an equal spread. The branches are flexible and droop over giving the tree the shape of a large green umbrella. I have it trained to have a straight, tall (about 10 feet) trunk. To keep it in this shape, the bottom of the drooping tree branches have to be trimmed back about once a year.I've used a variety of tools to trim back the branches, but the best I've found is the Fiskars Pruning stick. I can walk around under the tree and lop off all the drooping branches to the height I want (usually about 8 feet above the ground) to give it the umbrella shape. The top always remains unaltered. I've used a variety of cutters to perform this task, but my latest acquisition (the Fiskar pruner) is by far the best. The cutting gismo can be easily adjusted to a variety of angles. The cutting blade (quite sharp) is activated by pulling the handle down or pulling a cord which runs through the pole. I mostly use the handle. Neat. Very handy. Makes trimming the pepper tree real easy. Why didn't I discover this handy trimmer years ago?The illustration, by the way, includes only about 1/3 of the total tool and doesn't include the pull-down handle. I bought mine in a nearby garden shop, so there was no problem. I'd have trouble figuring it out from the accompanying illustration.

"I was given this Gildan tie-dyed Tee Shirt by a Lady Friend from Joshua Tree, California. I probably wouldn't have bought it for myself. I'm much too conservative! Mine is just like the one shown, but it has ""Hi-DESERT ROCKHOUNDS (of the Morongo Basin) and the club logo printed in black across upper third of the front. Seeing the rock club gathered together is quite a sight!In any case, quite apart from the artistic design, it's a nice, soft well-constructed tee shirt and should give a lot of good wear. It takes a bit of courage to wear an item like this as it grabs a lot of attention and generates comments, not all of which are complimentary. It took a little while, but now I enjoy wearing it out and about. I might add that I'm 78 and few people of my age would wear it. Such is life. I rather enjoy it.

There were five servings in a 1.5-ounce bag. Not much of a serving, if you ask me. I chose a bag of Mango Snacks.Interesting snacks. Low sugar. Tasty.

"About a year ago, I bought a Philips Sonicare twin pack of electric toothbrushes. I dont know why I would buy two brushes as my wife and I are now separated. A lapse of thought, perhaps. In any case, I bought them at Costco and the price was right. It turns out that the two-pack was right in that one of the toothbrushes gave up about a month ago. Im still annoyed, I might add.The Sonicare is quite a good toothbrush. Im quite pleased with them, except for the early demise of one. Are these things Made in China? Just joking. It does a good job, according to my dental tech. The heads are long lasting, much longer than a  conventional toothbrush, and it comes with an extra brush head, and a couple travel cases. Nice set.The feature I best like about the Sonicare is the two-minute timer. I focus on brushing the four quadrants of my mouth (top, bottom, one side, the other side) for 30 seconds each. This is much longer than in using my conventional brush and can only be for the better. All in all, Im very pleased, but Im docking the rating by a pint for the failure of the one brush.Gary Peterson","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DP5IJ46UZH1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JRZJBO#wasThisHelpful","R2DP5IJ46UZH1Y","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been on a diet for about 8 months now and Im very pleased with losing about 25 pounds with very little effort. Its called the SOS Diet - Stop Only Sugar. However, I still like to snack so Ive been seeking out sugar-free (also refined carbohydrate-free items) for such indulgences. One such item is Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame in some small (1.58 ounce) bags which I purchase at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. My latest bag is a spicy Wasabi variety. I dont particularly like soybeans, but the added flavoring helps a lot. These things are spicy, to be sure, and the soy bean taste is well masked. Theyre quite good. The only problem I have with them is that theyre quite unevenly flavored. Some are mild, and just as I like, and others are excruciatingly hot. I mean, at time I have to squeeze my eyes shut  and top breathing for a while. Its more than I can take. If you like this typeof wild flavor, they by all means indulge. Other flavorings are available.

"My nearby Fresh and Easy Market now shelves Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Crackers in two varieties (Cheddar and Whole Grain). Ive always liked Goldfish. They taste a lot like Cheezits, but seem lighter in flavor, which I prefer. I buy mine in these nifty 2-ounce cartons. Theyre just right for a serving and theyre easy to stack away on my pantry shelves. Nice combination. One thing I like is that they are a snack item but they have only a trace of sugar (less than 1 gr/serving). My boy (6) loves them too and theyre one of the  better snack alternatives.

I looked through Amazon and found this 5-piece Gammon Set in metallic blue. It was perfect and the price was right. The drum set arrived in three days and I was amazed!The set took a lot of time and effort to assemble. Im unable to follow instructions and the parts and pictures were all I had to go on. It worked. I got it set up in two days of part-time tinkering. The set looked nice, appeared sturdy and sounded well. Ill have to get someone who knows drums to fine-adjust the sounds.The set appears well made and sturdy. Time will tell. When my boy saw it and started playing it (read: beating it), he was just ecstatic. ""This is the best present ever,"" he exclaimed three times during the evening.

"I enjoy Daft Punk music and have since I first discovered it about five years ago. Nice stuff! There's captivating beats with real fine melodic intervals interspersed. Wonderful listening. Good dancing too. Vocals are sparse and simple, but quite effective. I own most Daft Punk CDs and DVDs including the wonderful ""Random Access Memories"" which picked up the Best Album of the Year Grammy. It earned it.More recently, I discovered the ""Musique Vol. 1"" album. I already have about half the songs on this compilation disc, but I bought it anyway. It focuses on Daft Punk music turned out from 1993 to 2005 and most of my stuff postdates that so I pick up a lot of the early stuff, in addition to the repeats.The album is nicely done and the songs are appropriately mixed in a good order for my listening. I seem to like almost all Daft Punk music, but here I especially enjoyed ""Around the World,"" ""One More Time,"" ""Robot Rock,"" ""Technologic"" and ""Human After All."" The others are good also and I'll probably learn to like them more as I continue to listen. This early Daft Punk music has a more stiff, mechanical feeling to it than the recent ""Random Access Memories"" disc. The latter sounds less ""computerized"" and has a lot of traditional instruments employed including a lot of guest vocalists. I take it that this is the direction that Daft Punk will go in future issues. It's nice stuff, and I'll be looking forward to it. In the meantime, this early Daft Punk compilation fills a nice void in my CD library.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WOIFYPJMRC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EHPXXI#wasThisHelpful","R27WOIFYPJMRC4","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been troubled with minor pimples and blackheads for my entire life. It's no big deal, but I'd like to get rid of as many as possible. I remember that when I was a teenager, my mother had one of these little steel pimple removers and it worked well. Hence, I spotted the Rosallini Blackhead remover and I ordered one. It took over a month to arrive and I was annoyed by the time it finally got here.The blackhead remover doesn't work very well with me and partly it's my fault. Using it requires close vision with a mirror. As a teenager, that was no problem. However, as an adult, I've gone through many changes in eyeglasses and now wear bifocals. My vision, either with or without the eyeglasses is insufficient. Second, the elongate remover is completely straight. I cannot get the little hole on the blackhead because one or another part of my face is in the way. I would regard this as a basic design flaw. So, the long-awaited blackhead remover has failed in every way. I'll rate it as two stars, because my weak vision is not the fault of the tool. If you can use this thing, I wish you well.Gary Peterson","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8ALQYHLCMMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Z96OI2#wasThisHelpful","R1A8ALQYHLCMMF","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I listen to a lot of music and most would fall into the ""Popular"" category, as opposed to to ""Jazz"" or ""Classical,"" although I listen there too now and then. I don't particularly care for ""Metal"" or ""Country,"" but even there lurks some good stuff. For example, I've always had a fancy for Metallica and I own three albums including ""S and M,"" their gig with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (quite a good DVD, I might add). With ""Country,"" I enjoy listening to ""Bluegrass"" now and then and I enjoy watching bluegrass musicians perform. Well. not too long ago, a Facebook friend called my attention to a ""Fade to Bluegrass"" CD featuring Iron Horse. It's a ""Bluegrass Tribute To Metallica"" and is very highly rated. After reading just a few of the Amazon reviews, I just had to have it. I've been very satisfied from the first play.What can I say? It's a collection of 10 well-known Metallica songs done up in fine  fashion by an excellent bluegrass combo. Who would have ever thunk? You just have to hear it to understand and when you listen, you'll probably have a smile on your face. I particularly enjoyed ""The Unforgiven,"" ""Nothing Else Matters,"" ""Fuel,"" and ""Enter Sandman,"" but all of the songs were exceptionally well done by a very capable combo. It might take a bit to get used to Metallica songs without a drummer, but the rest of the bluegrass instruments fill in to provide a fine rhythm section. The harmonized vocals are really, really good. I'd say your enjoyment of the album would be enhanced if you liked bluegrass music and had a tolerance and familiarity with Metallica. Neither is really necessary. It's just good music. Relax and enjoy!I had a friend over who enjoys music. I didn't indicate anything about my new album and just put it on. A few bars into ""The Unforgiven,"" a puzzled look appeared on her face. It quickly changed to bewilderment and she stated ""I know this song."" I said ""Think Metall..."" That was all it took and she had it down. We both laughed and enjoyed the rest of the album.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDO4SKJT3ZVDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CC866#wasThisHelpful","RDO4SKJT3ZVDE","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an ongoing intermittent problem with a rough and irregular speaking voice. It often bothers me when I'm talking to classes or speaking to groups of people or, sometimes, just when I'm trying to carry on an extended conversation with an individual. It's not  a sore throat, such as comes with cold. It's probably more a problem with my vocal cords. In any case, a cough drop can provide relief. The question is, which cough drop? I've tried a lot of them over the years. The best I've found is the Halls Triple Soothing Action Mentho-Lyptus drop.

"I review a lot of things for Amazon and have been doing it  for about ten years. As such, I'm ranked toward the top of the reviewers list and I get a lot of offers to review things, mostly books of one kind or another. I turn down about 99% of the offers in that I just don't have the time. Every once in a while something comes along that catches my interest. The San Francisco Salt Company, for example, asked if I might review a couple of their specialty salts. I agreed to do it and they suppled me with  two five-ounce packets of the products.The first was an Alder Smoked Sea Salt and I reviewed it a couple months ago. It was really distinctive and I loved it. Next was a Black Hawaiian Lava Salt. This one I find a little puzzling. It's dark black in color and looks more like pepper than salt. Evidently, the color is provided by activated charcoal which has anti-oxident properties. It's quite a good salt, but I can't see any other particular advantage over other good sea salts. It's a novelty, that's for sure, to have a quality salt on your eggs that looks like pepper, but the novelty wears off in short order. In any  case, it's quite a good tasting salt, much better than the typical commercial salts. It will be put to good use and I would buy it again. However, it's nowhere nearly as distinctive as their Alder Smoked Salt.

"Many years ago, I was a  runner. I used to race every weekend and I've completed 11 marathons with a best time of 3:27. I finally gave up marathoning at about the age of 50 because of recurring sore ankles. I continued running for  another 20 years but finally gave it up altogether at about the age of 70. The problem was sore ankles, particularly the left ankle. Those ankle problems continue until today and I'm now 77.The ankle problems are no big deal and I'd do the whole thing over if I had the chance. I take some minor pain medications when they act up. One of my favorites has been Bengay Pain Relieving Cream. It helps.A couple weeks ago, I slipped on a stairs and gave my left ankle a good  twist. Now, it really hurt and the Bengay didn't seem to help much. I was mentioning this to my Mother-In-Law (from Russia) and she  suggested Alezan Cream For Joints, a product from Russia. Okay, I decided to try it when I discovered it was available on Amazon.The Alezan Cream is sorta like the Bengay in that it comes in a plastic tube, I put a little on a hand and then rub it in to my sore ankle. Afterwards I put a sock on that leg to control the Alezan over night. Acually, I have no idea if this is the correct way, in that the Alezon comes only with explanations, cautions and instructions in Russian. Such is life.I'm really surprised that I've had excellent results, much better than with Bengay. The next morning, my ankle is pain free and walking  around on it was much  easier. What a relief! I can't imagine that a topical salve,  such as this,  does the damaged interior any good, but it certainly makes it feel a lot better. I plan to continue until my ankle feels better and then keep a supply around in case I ever injure it again.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZ6QFE8KQTC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPPITEI#wasThisHelpful","R2NZ6QFE8KQTC9","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometime during the Fall of 2013, I decided to set my furnace thermostat at 65F and just leave it there until turning it off in the Spring of 2014. San Diego doesn't get very cold during the winter so the furnace would seldom be running. It's not much of a sacrifice to comfort. In fact, it's rather nice to have cool air around you and something that hasn't been dried out by a furnace. Now and then it gets bit chilly and for those times I had a couple light-weigt  fleece jackets.I went close to a month into this winter heating plan when my mother-in-law gave me a Mountain Hard Wear Ghost Whisperer Down Jacket (Silver Color) for a Christmas present. Nice. It was ultra light-weight and weighed barely more than a normal long-sleeved shirt. It was warm and comfortable without being hot or feeling like a heavy jacket. It felt good inside or outside the house. Zip it up and it resisted mild winds quite well. I could put it on as a liner under a heavier jacket for added warmth during real cold episodes.

"Not too long ago I bought and tried a bag of hemp seeds. They packed a nutritional punch and mixed well with other foods. Then I couldn't find them any more. Now, on my latest trip to Costco, I found this 1 pound, 8 ounce bag Nature's Earthly Choice raw shelled Hemp Seed. Into the cart it went. I find all kinds of uses for this stuff. I add it to my yogurt. I add it to soups and stews. I stir it into various dishes. It has no sodium, a good fiber content and loads of protein. The fat content is somewhat high, but it's all the good fat. This stuff is hard to beat as a dietary additive.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLZ0PGXKQF87P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EMLIQG#wasThisHelpful","RLZ0PGXKQF87P","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some time ago I used to enjoy a 180 almond snack which I got at Costco, but then they stopped carrying it. Just recently, I found this Almond Rice Pops With Blueberries in a 17-ounce pack.

"Here's one of those handy impulse items you find at the front when you walk into Costco. It's a Contigo 2-pack of Vacuum-Insulated Travel Tumblers. Neat. I've needed this but didn't know where to find them. They're aluminum, come in a variety of colors and hold 14 ounces of cold or hot fluids. I use mine for coffee, at present.I use my Tumbler in two ways. One is for auto traveling. I can put hot coffee in it and it will still be drinkably hot after four hours. Good for taking short trips. Second, in the mornings I make a pot of coffee and drink a couple mugs. There's always another mug left over. I pour it in one of the tumblers. If I feel like having a hot cup of  coffee in the afternoon it's there, with no additional preparation. Handy.

"I discovered these little snack gems near the chips isle at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. Somersaults with Sea Salt, they were called. They're crunchy nuggets baked with sunflower seeds and assorted toasted grains. How could I resist? Into the cart it went.

Evidently, the store needed some extra shelf space.These little nuggets  are really good!  They have a rich sunflower seed taste.

It's labeled as ""unsweet tea"" and that's the case. Real nice flavor. It's brewed and not made from concentrate. This is good stuff. Nice flavor and goes down real easily!

Good stuff!One word of warning, and it won't be included in the rating. The bottle is huge and won't fit in my fridge in a standing position. the only way I can get it in the fridge is lying on it's side. Be careful to get the top screwed on straight.

"San Diego tap water smells a bit and leaves a lot of white crud in the glass if evaporated dry. It's mostly from the Colorado River. But, what the hey? Why should I buy supplemental minerals if Colorado River water already contains a good variety? In any case, the city says it's safe and I'm unaware of any major problems. Well, there's the taste. My wife feels differently about such matters. She's from Europe and nobody there supposedly drinks tap water. It's considered disgusting. Proper drinking water must come in a bottle and be collected from some important and well-known springs. Besides, she seems to have elevated perceptions in taste, smell, sight, hearing and all other senses. In any case, to keep peace in the household, I agreed that we would drink bottled water. We gradually settled in on Kirkland Signature bottled water. The price was right! Well, now even that isn't good enough. My wife seems to have discovered Fiji Natural Artesian Water which comes in attractive rectangular bottles and is imported all the way from the South Pacific. It costs several times as much as regular brands, but that's part of the appeal. It's the best, she claims. It's so smooth and goes down so easy, she says. Now other bottled waters, although OK, are not nearly as good. No, Fiji Natural Artesian Water is the water for her. I must admit that it's excellent, but the cost is way too high.Gary Peterson","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UF0JM3TQTVTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNONTI0#wasThisHelpful","R3UF0JM3TQTVTM","AY12DBB0U420B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY12DBB0U420B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I expect this book to be a finalist if not the winner of the Bachelder-Coddington award.This is a gorgeous, loving, and full-color look at a national treasure that is part of the construction of how we see this battle.The whole is contained in a physically handsome oversized book that is a pleasure to hold.This is both a history of and a close look at the restored Gettysburg Cyclorama that is on display at the park.Cycloramas are huge oil paintings, 40 by 400 feet, which were very popular prior to movies.Displayed in specially constructed buildings, patrons use a covered walkway to enter the viewing room.From a platform about 12 feet high, surrounded by the battle, most were awe struck.The first two chapters cover the creation of a cyclorama and how their display.These painting weigh about six tons and require a team of artists months to complete.Paul D. Philippoteaux painted four Gettysburg cycloramas for display in America.These chapters cover the for profit business and what happened to these cycloramas when the profit ended.Lastly, they tell us about the restoration project that restored the current Gettysburg cyclorama to its original condition.Chapters 3, 4 and 5 tell about the hidden portraits and details of the Gettysburg cyclorama.As Philippoteaux learns about the battle and to sell tickets, he made changes to the existing cycloramas.Changing the painting caused changes to the souvenir program too.However, since it is easier to change a program than a painting, differences accumulate and the author gives us some intelligent ideas on these.The balance of the book is a detailed look at the cyclorama based on the ten Tipton photographs.Each chapter opens with a two-page section of the cyclorama.The next page contains the original Tipton photo with a modern color photo taken from the same height.These two photographs address how we are preserving our parks and can make you question improvements.The next page is a full-color view of the section of the cyclorama with a key.The balance of each chapter is an explanation of each key with blow-ups and modern photos.Each chapter has endnotes.The book ends with a Bibliography and full index.This book is a joy to read while exploring the details of the cyclorama and seeing the hidden messages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q96PTYNC9E9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611212642#wasThisHelpful","R3Q96PTYNC9E9G","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Small battle histories are a favorite of mine.

Saddled with a political general as commander and trapped on the Virginia coast, they became a replacement pool.Butler understood what the situation could mean for his future planned an operation to retrieve some of his reputation as a general.Improperly garrisoned, Petersburg is a critical link in the supply chain for Richmond and the Army of Northern Virginia.Butler plans a raid that will overrun the garrison, destroy the bridges over the Appomattox River and get back to the safety of his lines in about 36 hours.Why this did not happen as planned is a fascinating story of how things go wrong.Central to the story are the old men and boys that fight to save their city at Rives Farm.This is one of the few battles where civilians fight veterans during the war in sight of their homes.Hal Jespersen provides excellent maps to complement the authors very readable text.Illustrations and photographs grace almost every page reminding us that these are people.Footnotes, at the bottom of the page, a full index and Bibliography mark this as a serious history.Lastly, this is a physically hansom that is a pleasure to hold and read.A book that can be proudly given as a gift and will be a joy to receive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P4E23PN56G1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611212146#wasThisHelpful","R2P4E23PN56G1W","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Playing Dungeons & Dragons style games requires someone to act as the dungeon master and direct the game play,The Pathfinder card game system replaces a dungeon master with a deck of cards allowing all players to play or allowing real solo play.Pathfinder enjoys a large established presence with a number of blogs that support play with discussion, advice and answers to questions.This is invaluable to the new player as a guide and teacher.D&D style games are NOT easy or quick to learn, their and a number of rules that need to be mastered.Additionally, a sequence of play is important along with an understanding of monsters, weapons, spells and any number of items.This game is no exception!  You will need to study the rules, think and investigate to master this game.This is NOT a quick an easy game for casual play but a relatively in-depth dungeon crawl with a full story line, interesting characters where thought and planning will pay off.Someone said this is just flipping cards.  Im not sure they really got into the game or tried to understand play.You need to understand the abilities and limits of your character(s), quickly select a tactic to deal with monsters and take advantage of wins while dealing with setbacks.Overall, this excellent game works with a group or alone.Wrath of the Righteous is a base game, containing the items needed to play this game.  The game contains one introductory adventure and the first installment of the Worldwound adventure.If/when, you buy additional items; you need to stay with the Wrath of the Righteous title.Currently, there are three base games available each a different adventure.Each base game comprises additional characters and adventures building to completion of an adventure.Each base game has five or six additional adventures available for separate purchase.Character decks will work with any base game giving you more options and adding depth.This can be an expensive but very rewarding gaming experience.If you want a dungeon crawl and cannot always have Dungeon Master this is an excellent choice.The game has depth, plenty of options and will provide hours of enjoyment.This is a well-supported system with the potential for almost unlimited expansions and a substantial active group of players.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LRONO8UWM1SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R1LRONO8UWM1SG","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I open our mail over coffee in the afternoon.I opened the box and she started reading about the game.Next, we were looking at the puzzle cards.She started punching out counters as I put the feet on the trays.Two hours later, we stopped playing to fix dinner.This is a simple game easy to understand and a great deal of fun.Six cards make a puzzle that all players need to solve within a timeframe.Players get and lose points for a number of easily understood reasons.Each puzzle is a round six rounds are a game.Quick logical thinking is the key to winning but no one really loses as players easily score points for partial solutions.Game components are heavy cardboard with a plasticized finish.The game balls are heavy and solid enough to quickly build with and the game try holds them in place.This well-designed and built game is great fun and worth having.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLW2V67FLH9GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY3U8#wasThisHelpful","RLW2V67FLH9GE","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When you move beyond reading about battles and leaders, you quickly discover Earl J. Hess.Chances are you will have read some of his battle histories but are now ready for his how and why books.This author is one of the few authors to look at how and why the war worked as it did.In doing so, he helps us understand some of the silly decisions and/or question some of the standard assumptions.These books give us an understanding of the environment the officers and men fought in and the reasons for their decisions.The American Civil War saw the transition from the smooth bore to the rifled muzzleloader.Rifling and bullet design resulted in a weapon that was lethal way beyond a smooth bore.However, battlefield conditions, the ability to communicate and human abilities worked to keep combat at about 100 yards.The author looks at how liner tactics were an efficient way to fight during the war.Additionally, the book looks at formation for regiments to corps on and off the battlefield.The training of both officers and men is well documented with a good discussion of the books available and how they differed. Last is a section looking at how the training, theory and formations worked during battle with examples drawn from reports.This could make for a sleep inducing book except for the authors skill as a writer.The author grabs and holds are attention with excellent intelligent writing that is easy and fun to read.Well place and easy to understand illustrations support the text.This is a scholarly history with endnotes organized by page numbers at the top of the page.A full index, bibliography and glossary of terms complete the book.This handsome well-made book is a pleasure to hold and to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HCF2S9ZO5X9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807159379#wasThisHelpful","R19HCF2S9ZO5X9","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most impressive ships in the fleet.  The detail is excellent with varied coloring to add emphases.Small molded details and openings on the underside hull make this look built not molded.The addition of an X-wing Fighter is welcome.  Players tend to not have the number of X-wing and Tie fighters that we see in the movies.This is a Huge Ship with new rules for initial placement, damage location and movement, this expansion come with a special maneuver template.The transport is slow, hard to turn but capable of absorbing plenty of hits making it an interesting ship to play.The ship has two set of damage cards, fore and aft.  Each set is ten cards following the standard damage card rules.A three-part Evacuation of Hoth Campaign is our major chance to play this ship.  The rules state it cannot be fielded in 100-point squads of standard play.Mission 8: Rendezvous requires three Rebel Transports to play and is not something I expect to see happen.The rulebook would be improved by illustrating the special counters and placing them in a section.  Im still digging out what is what; most of the counters are part of the missions.There is a good set of upgrade cards and new X-wing pilots in the box.This is a good expansion but is best a late addition to your game because of the limited playability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14CIKPLKBX2AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616616741#wasThisHelpful","R14CIKPLKBX2AA","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Custer creates problems for me. I recognize that he was an inspiring combat commander and built one of the better fighting units in the Civil War. He was willing to take responsibility and do what he felt right in the face of orders to the contrary. His decision on July 3, 1863, helped the Union turn back Stuart's Cavalry and while not winning the battle it did not hurt either. Sheridan and most other high ranking officers thought well of him and used his services to good effect in the closing days of the war. On the other hand, Custer may not have been bright enough to understand details like flanks support or take the time to consider the size of the opposing force. In the end, these details killed him and destroyed his command.James Donovan is as close to a Little Bighorn expert as we have, this is his latest and I think best book on the subject. As always, he does an excellent job giving us an intelligently written comprehensive account. This is a full account with background, campaign details and aftermath.

"Just in case you have never ever heard of Zombicide, Ill give you a quick background.Something turns people into zombies that attack people and turn them into zombies.A few people, survivors, didnt turn and are now being attacked by the zombies.You and your team are working together to stay alive and complete a mission.Rue Morgue is the third standalone game in the Zombicie system, designed to be played either alone or with the existing games and expansions.Two new zombie types, helicopters, team actions and competitive play are the new items in this game.The optional competitive play changers players vs. zombies to players vs. players while zombies go after everyone.Team actions introduces a limited ability to have your characters act together.This adds a new level of decision-making and tactical considerations without undue complications.Helicopters have limited application in this game but could be an important expansion as we learn to use them.The new Skinner Zombie can spawn a crawler zombie when killed.The major zombie is the new A-bomb.  This is an almost invincible zombie with the ability to grab survivors and pull them into its zone.Add some new weapons, game tiles and survivors to a large box and you have Rue Morgue.One possible problem; there are no Zombivor figures included in this game; they are in the Lost Zombivors box, making this less than a full standalone game","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKV2280PGTAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3MLGNI#wasThisHelpful","R3UKV2280PGTAK","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More and more we are brewing our coffee using a Keurig not a coffee pot.The ease of use, consistency, the cup of coffee you want and only the cups needed have changed how we make coffee.They designed the new Keurig 2.0 system to refuse pods that are not Keurig pods; about five minutes on the internet will show you how to hack this feature of the brewer.The best feature of this brewer is the ability to brew a 4-cup carafe and single cups.The carafe is not included, allowing you to select from several providers and styles at about $30.The second good feature is the ability to get a stronger cup of coffee on request.The worst feature is the largest cup/mug is 10 oz., most systems have a 12 oz. mug.The second worst feature is the 40 oz. water reservoir, which is to small for this system.Like all Keurig brewers, it brews a great cup of coffee and the company supports their product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXS43VOVZ8PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWEAXPY#wasThisHelpful","RPXS43VOVZ8PC","A32B6XWNR55SRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6XWNR55SRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hello everyone,So I previously reviewed the original Bose SoundTrues and I absolutely loved them. They weren't perfect, but I thought and still think that they are excellent headphones for the price. The new SoundTrue Ultras refine three things from the original SoundTrues. With a new more expensive cost of $149.99, the new SoundTrue Ultras have improved noise isolation, higher quality audio, and a new design.So lets start with noise isolation:The noise isolation on the SoundTrue Ultras are superb. Bose now includes StayHear Ultra Tips. These tips are improved from the original StayHear tips in that they now have a round tip at the end. This round tip helps to create a seal that was not present with the original StayHear tips. With the new tips, noise isolation is no longer a problem and I no longer have to increase the volume all the way in a moderately loud environment. I've had a big issue with noise isolation on the original SoundTrue earphones and it's really great to see Bose fix this issue in the new model.People have commented on my video review of the new SoundTrue Ultras(video on my YouTube channel) that these new tips are simply rebranded StayHear Plus Tips found on other Bose earbuds. I don't know if this is entirely true, but regardless, the new tips are fantastic.People were also wondering if you could use the new tips on the original SoundTrues and the answer is yes. I have tested the tips on my OG SoundTrues and they fit no problem. It seems like Bose has the same tip attachment mechanism on the back of all of their earphones so the new tips should work on older Bose earbuds, but since I've only confirmed this with the old SoundTrues, I won't say anything factually. For owners of the original SoundTrues just looking for an upgrade in noise isolation, you can simply buy a set of replacement StayHear Ultra tips, which is great.Moving on to audio quality:Sound is drastically altered from the sound signature of the original SoundTrues. Like Bose advertises, lows are immensely improved. There is now so much more detail and presence in the lower frequencies than before. This brings details I wasn't able to hear with the older SoundTrues. Vocals are also much smoother and clear. The one thing to note though is that bass is still a bit lacking. It's there, but it's tight and lacking for my preference. For audiophiles, the SoundTrue Ultras may surprise them since Bose is notorious for not having reference-like sound.Unfortunately, while the sound quality is improved, it's kind of boring. It's the kind of sound I'm used to with something like the Audio Technica ATH M50 series, neutral and lacking bass. If you've tried them, you know what I mean. Soundstage is also virtually nonexistent with the SoundTrue Ultras.Lastly, design.Not much to talk about here but the new SoundTrue Ultras feature a new design. I like it. It looks more modern. Bose is still going with a plastic construction on the housing which I feel is the right choice. I'm not a fan of metal earphones since they tend to put weight down on your ears. Bose says they've improved durability for sweat and weather resistance. However, their website says that they would prefer you use the SoundSport model for more rigorous physical use, which implies that while improved in durability, these are probably not meant for the athletic lifestyle. Comfort is still relatively high with the ultra-comfy StayHear Ultra tips. Beside the new look of the housing, Bose has incorporated a T-Joint cable splitter. It's pretty much like before but because you've got plastic ends coming out of the splitter, it helps to keep the left and right cables more conformed to a shape. This just helps to prevent tangling and your cables getting to out of whack, which I appreciate. One last thing I want to note is that I wish the cable was a bit different. It's still pretty thin, which I don't mind, but it just feels cheap and meh.Overall, the Bose SoundTrue Ultras get a 4/5 stars from me. Like before, these aren't perfect, but they're well-rounded and make an excellent pair of earphones. For previous owners of the original SoundTrues, I wouldn't say that it is essential to upgrade to these. I would say that if noise isolation is your only problem, get a set of StayHear Ultra tips, and you should be golden.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F95S1SBRM0GN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYDW#wasThisHelpful","R3F95S1SBRM0GN","A14H9KMAMC590S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14H9KMAMC590S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where to start..Protection: The Lumenair is a pretty thick case. The Note 5 by itself is already pretty big, but with this case, it's a bit too bulky for my taste. However, with that bulk, you are given added protection. The hard polycarbonate frame will help keep the inner silicon membrane intact as the silicon absorbs the shock from impact.Design: I'm definitely a big fan of the see thru polycarbonate back. It just looks really nice to see the original back of the Note 5 through the case.Cutouts: For cutouts, you've got the plastic button coverings for the volume and power buttons. They are extremely clicky and tactile, which is nice. The headphone jack, micro usb, speaker, and microphone cutouts are very precisely cut out but the cutouts are extremely recessed, making using third party accessories a bit of a challenge. The cutout for the SPen is also an issue. The top part of the cutout needs to be cutout a bit more as it blocks the S-Pen from coming out of the case. Definitely a serious issue if you are an active S-Pen user.Features: So the Lumenair is designed to be a ""flashing"" case. Meaning that it uses the Note's flash for producing a flashing effect on incoming calls or alerts. This is done by having a sliding piece of plastic cover the flash on the back of the Note 5. Although it's not something that I enjoy, for others, this may be a feature you're interested in. Especially if you're constantly losing your phone. Note, you can slide off the plastic covering the flash for when you need to use it as an actual flash. Another novelty feature is the glow in the dark silicon. The silicon membrane that you wrap around the phone before putting on the plastic covering features glow in the dark capabilities. However, in my testing, while it definitely does glow, it's a somewhat weak glow. For those particularly interested in this aspect of the case, you might want to look elsewhere.Conclusion: Overall, the Lumenair is a decent novelty case. It's definitely not a case for everyone but it does work as advertised. Some specific things to keep in mind: the S-Pen cutout denies access to the pen, the case is a bit thick, and the glow-in-the-dark silicon is not too bright.*Product was sent for free for an unbiased review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDX4ZWWZDCU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011URJR3M#wasThisHelpful","RPDX4ZWWZDCU5","A14H9KMAMC590S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14H9KMAMC590S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There really isn't much to say about the EcoMoist screen cleaner kit. It does as advertised and does it very well. EcoMoist claims that the product is made of natural and green products, and even if that is true, I'm not sure if it makes a significant impact on a product category like this. Still, for those conscious of the environment, it's not a bad thing I suppose. I've only tried one other product in this field and that's the iKlear screen cleaning kit. Unlike the iKlear spray, the EcoMoist solution is noticeably scentless and wipes off much better than the iKlear, this is definitely a plus. One thing I do like about the iKlear kit though is the plethora of microfibers of different sizes and types. The EcoMoist kit comes with one black microfiber(very nice size by the way), but it's not the type of microfiber I prefer. I am someone who likes thinner and more silkier microfiber cloths rather than the towel like microfibers. This is completely personal opinion though so if you don't mind it, it's not something you should even take into consideration. Overall, the EcoMoist screen cleaner kit is nice.

"I reviewed the After Effects model of this cover and while I gave that one 5 stars, I don't think I can do the same for the regular one. Like the AE model, this one has the same great quality and everything, but like I stated in my review of the AE model, typing speed is decreased for me with the rubbery feel of keypresses. I tried my best to get used to it but I just cannot type consistently fast with these covers. For the AE model, because it's very useful and specific for learning After Effects, I believe that it's a great tool and cover, but because this cover has no specific purpose, I don't think it's as useful as the other application-based covers.

"The XSKN After Effects Keyboard Skin is pretty great. As an amateur video producer, I recently began to learn After Effects and while I do know some common shortcuts, I don't know all of them. I could teach myself by looking at the Adobe website but why bother when you can just get a keyboard cover like this. I think that visually being able to see a cheat sheet for all the shortcuts helps newbies like me learn much more quickly and efficiently than looking at a website. The quality of the cover seems to be really nice. Fit is good as well. My only con is that I noticed by typing speed decrease a bit with the cover. I used it for a few days to see if I could get used to it but it just doesn't feel as good as a naked keyboard. So what I do now is only use the cover when using After Effects rather than using it all the time. When using After Effects, I don't do a lot of typing, just shortcuts usually, so slow typing is not an issue. When going back to other applications though, I will take it off to get my normal typing speed back.*Product was sent for free for an unbiased review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G74TGK1JW62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0HE00U#wasThisHelpful","R39G74TGK1JW62","A14H9KMAMC590S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14H9KMAMC590S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are my impressions on the Voix earphones.Regarding sound: Too much bass for my liking. There's so much emphasis on bass that it really drowns out the vocal experience for me. For the serious bassheads, you might find yourself to love these but they're way too bassy for me. Clarity is nice but like I said, we need to lessen the bass emphasis just a bit. There is also not much soundstage on these earphones.You do get a metal container/case for the earphones which is something you definitely don't see for earphones of this price.Design: I do like the design of the earphones. They look unique and they fit well in my ears due to how they're shaped. The cord is a flat tangle design which I like as well. The jack on the end is a bit large and bulky.The microphone/remote is pretty decent. Controls work just fine with my devices and the mic sounds average.Overall, I rate these 4 stars all things considered.*Product was sent for free for an unbiased review*","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8YRJ0TD2PJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVT4DLO#wasThisHelpful","R3A8YRJ0TD2PJJ","A14H9KMAMC590S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14H9KMAMC590S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So to start off, being a previous QC15 owner, the QC25s are not overly better than the QC15s. I would say that the only reason to upgrade to the 25s might be the new design. However, for those who have never owned a QC15, you will love the QC25s.In terms of sound quality, the QC25s sound very similar to the older QC15s but the bass and clarity is improved on the new QC25s. Everything sounds much tighter with better fidelity.The effectiveness of noise cancellation seems the same to be quite honest.Comfort is still phenomenal on the 25s. The QC15s were incredibly light and comfortable, and the tradition remains. The QC15 was one of the few headphones I could wear for long, long periods of time, and I'm glad that the QC25s continue to be insanely comfortable.In terms of design, I much prefer the look of the new 25s. The 25s look much more modern and youthful, whereas the QC15s looked more executive and business-like.Another great feature with the 25s is that they will still work without batteries. The noise cancellation won't work of course, but you won't be stuck with no audio. In addition to losing noise cancellation, you do also lose some fidelity in audio quality, it still sounds pretty decent.Like the QC15s, the battery life on the 25s are still exceptional. I haven't done any extensive and scientific tests, but it can last quite a while.Overall, the QC25s are great headphones. People criticize Bose for being overpriced, but they really aren't. The QC25s don't sound as good as some other $300 headphones, but they excel in many areas(sound, comfort, design, usability) unlike competing products that excel in only a few(sound only), making the QC25s a balanced and well rounded product, and that's what makes it worth $300.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K4ZKH9D35O10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1NEUKK#wasThisHelpful","R2K4ZKH9D35O10","A14H9KMAMC590S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14H9KMAMC590S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this vanilla bean whey protein powder as a breakfast smoothie.  I like to mix either frozen blueberries or frozen strawberries, 1% or 2% milk and blend in my Ninja blender.  Today I tried using a mix of coconut milk and almond milk instead of regular cows milk.  It was just a delicious.  I always select vanilla protein powders as I think the vanilla flavor is very versatile, as I can make a frozen berries and cream smoothie one day, or a frozen banana and raw cacao powder shake the next. As with several protein powders on the market this one has Stevia, which I would prefer it did not.  I can taste this sweetener in the smoothie and other food products with this ingredient. I would have rather it have no sugar or perhaps even Xylitol crystals (100% pure birch xylitol) instead. I have never liked the flavor of Stevia or similar sweeteners. That being said, when I mix it with my frozen fruit, it does mask the Stevia flavor some.  The smoothie is delicious and I really liked mixing my almond and coconut milk with it.This has 21 grams of protein, which is a bit less than the usual 25 in some other brands, but still a nice amount.  Women who are not pregnant should get about 45 grams per day and those who are breastfeeding or pregnant, need as much as 70-75 grams of protein per day.  My absolute favorite brand is Garden of life Raw (unflavored does not have Stevia), as they are a whole food / raw diet source with probiotics, however that brand only has 17 grams of protein (per ONE scoop).  This brand suggests using 2 scoops for 21 grams of protein.  I recommend this, but would suggest an unflavored version to also be available without any  Stevia or sweeteners. *I received this as a review sample for an honest evaluation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226NSBSFGFWYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9WIFEM#wasThisHelpful","R226NSBSFGFWYC","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice bamboo wash cloth set.  I love bamboo as it is antibacterial, antimicrobial, and so very soft.  We use bamboo cotton for our cloth baby wipes (used in a Munchkin wipes warmer with essential oils, coconut oil and natural castile soap).  We mix water, fractionated coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, rose water, pure (non alcohol/non chemical) aloe vera and baby mild Dr. Bronners Castile soap for the solution.Bamboo is gentle to baby and feels nice in my hands when using it.  These cloths work wonderfully for cleaning our baby during his cloth diaper changes.  Regular cotton terry can often be scratchy and not the most comfortable to use.  The bamboo cotton set includes 6 wash cloths, and 1 yellow bib.  It is a very soft set and the stitching and edges are precise and secure.  I have not found any flaws in the set I received.I have not had this set for very long (a bit less than 2 weeks) so I cannot comment as to how long it will stay looking new, however it appears to be durable and if washed with gentle and natural based baby laundry soap, it should last a long time. Since these are used in our cloth baby wipe rotation, we wash these with our cloth diapers.  I use Nellies Natural Laundry powder and a small pouch of soap nuts.  I generally do not machine dry these since they go into the wet wipes container after washing.

"I recommend this new baby set for a family member, friend, or your own baby.  I love bamboo as it is antibacterial, antimicrobial, and so very soft.  We use bamboo cotton for our cloth baby wipes (used in a Munchkin wipes warmer with essential oils, coconut oil and natural castile soap).  Bamboo is gentle to baby and feels nice in my hands when using it.  Regular cotton terry can often be scratchy and not the most comfortable to use.  The bamboo cotton set includes 1 hooded bath towel, 1 bib, and 2 wash cloths.  It is lovingly packed in a gift box with tissue paper and makes a beautiful gift.  It is very soft and the stitching and edges are precise and secure.  I have not found any flaws in the set I received.  I would have preferred the lettering under the bear to either be easier to read, or to have been not present on the material as it is a bit distracting.  I love the bear and think it is very sweet.  I have the blue set, the blue is not faded or too light.  It is a classy and attractive shade of blue.  I would have preferred the entire set to be blue, or perhaps blue with white bib and wash cloth as I am not fond of yellow.The hooded towel is a generous size and although this is best suited for newborn up to 12 months, this fits our smaller sized 18 month old.  I have not had this set for very long (a bit less than 2 weeks) so I cannot comment as to how long it will stay looking new, however it appears to be durable and if washed with gentle and natural based baby laundry soap, it should last a long time.  I recommend putting this in a delicates bag (such as for lingere, sweaters, or other delicates) and washing on gentle.  *I received this set complimentary for review, this is my honest opinion and evaluation.

"This is a beautiful and well made skirt.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and am very pleased.  At the time that I received this, the largest available was xl.  I am wishing I got the xxl as I am entering my second trimester of pregnancy and sadly will not be able to comfortably wear this skirt for the duration of the pregnancy.I think this skirt is classy, feminine, and has a touch of vintage flair.  I adore the black and white stripe.  It reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, and would pair wonderfully with some bright red or pink shoes, with matching lipstick and black cat eye liner.  The skirt is thick and does not wrinkle easily.  The stitching and workmanship of the skirt is precise and lovely.  The zipper works as expected, without any hesitation.  There were no chemical odors and I did not find any flaws.  I recommend this skirt, it could be dressed up or semi-casual.  *This was a review sample, sent to me complimentary for my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HW52JSCJY36C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OQ0R26#wasThisHelpful","R2HW52JSCJY36C","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are a generous size and do help with freshening areas that need some help.  We have both of these hanging in our laundry room area in the back as our nearly 100 year old home has a musty aged odor at times.  I do not use chemical air fresher sprays, so this is a nice option.  These do not completely take away the odor, but definitely help.  Usually I have an essential oil (lavender or lemon oil) diffuser on in 1 or 2 areas of the home to also assist with any odor.I appreciate that these are in a burlap material and are about to be hung on a hook.  I would have preferred these to have the rope loops as other similar types of charcoal bags.  I also would have preferred these to not have any logo or writing on them.  Other than those small changes, I find that these work well for how we are using them.  **I was sent this product complimentary for my fair and honest review.

"Being a child of the 80s, I am very font of this nostalgic print.  I remember making mix tapes straight from the radio.  This is a colorful diaper and very suitable for a girl or boy (I think).  This diaper has been tested for a month.  To prep this diaper (and all our diapers) I washed on hot 5-6 times before use.  It is possible to prep this diaper less, however, I highly suggest the extra washes as this diaper has natural materials which contain oils that could lessen the absorbency and perhaps cause some mild repelling.  My baby has used this diaper frequently and we wash every night or every other night.  I do 2 full wash (hot) cycles (each with a cold rinse) and then a final (third) cold rinse.  I wash with Nellie's Natural Laundry Powder and a large pouch of soap nuts).  I hang the diapers to dry on my IKEA octopus hanger and dry the inserts on low to medium heat on the dryer (no dryer sheets) with 6 wool dryer balls.  The thing to note about this diaper is that since it is a sewn in insert (inside the pocket) it will take LONGER to dry.  Normally, my regular pocket diapers and covers take a short 8 hours / over night when hung immediately after washing on medium spin (we have a high efficiency washer without an agitator in the middle).  This diaper needs to be turned inside out and then hung.  It will most likely need 10-12 hours to dry when hung.  But to be honest, most cloth diaper users know that it is necessary to have at the very least, 24 cloth diapers to have enough to wash every other day (prolonging to wash longer than 3 days can cause some serious ammonia stink and set in stains) so for our family, we have other diapers that can be used while this one is drying.How this diaper is beneficial / different than others in our stash:This Happy Endings diaper is cute, but also functional and well designed.  I like having the option to put this in my diaper bag as a quick, already stuffed, diaper for on the go.  I also like how I can add an additional insert for increasing absorbency.  This is a fantastic night time option as well as perfect for long distance car rides when baby falls asleep.  The insert on this diaper is fluffier / thicker than my other charcoal bamboo / microfiber inserts, and while some may not like the added bulk, I welcome it.  My little one drinks a lot of water and so is quite a heavy wetter.  This ""night night"" insert is slightly larger / wider as well.  (as seen under another non night night insert from this same company)This diaper has has a sewn in 4 Layer soaker cream colored insert (2 layers of bamboo/2 layers of microfiber) as mentioned above.  I love the inner lining on this diaper.  It is a deep grey which not only makes it stain resistant, but the charcoal bamboo fleece is antimicrobial and antibacterial.  It is gentle on baby's skin as it does not keep wetness against their skin (which would cause rashes).I love the gentle fold over elastic / double leg gussets.  Crazily enough, not all brand of diapers have this.  (They really should.)  In my diaper reviews, I tend to compare these with brands I have (which are mainstream brands that other cloth diaper users might be wanting comparisons on as well). Our Bum Genius diapers do not have gusset, and this is the reason my love for Bum Genius has fizzled a bit  (I still love them, but they really need to improve the line with gussets). I have had some serious messes at the most undesirable times and places with my Bum Genius (at the eye doctor when I had both children and my husband was getting his eye checked and the bathrooms did not have changing tables.)  I would have been protected with gussets.  I also wish BG would improve their elastics, as even with normal, gentle, non bleach, non drier use, the elastics generally loosen and need replacing (by hand) after about 6 months to a year of use.  It is true, this Happy Endings diaper has only been used for a little over a month, however the structure of the elastics, as well as the added gussets seem to be superior to the BG.This diaper, and other Happy Endings diapers, have 3x3 adjustable rise snaps + hip snaps.  I love that the snaps cross over at the tabs (BG and many other brands do not cross over).  This is a big plus for our family! Often smaller babies need cross over tabs, and my 18 month old still uses this function. The snaps on this diaper function as my other diaper brands, and so far I have not had any splitting.This diaper is perfect for night time or day time.  You can use only the sewn in insert or add the additional insert.  I have not had any blowouts or leaking.  The stitching and overall construction of this diaper is nice and the price is reasonable at just under $15.  Sadly, more diapers are getting into the $20+ range, without necessarily being a better diaper.  I recommend this brand and really like the night time version of this diaper.*I did purchase this diaper at a discount, and this is my honest experience and review.  Please know that with cloth diapers, you may need to try a few different brands before finding the type or brand that works best for you and your baby.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EI98ATZS72EJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ESD996#wasThisHelpful","R2EI98ATZS72EJ","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another quality diaper from Happy Endings.  I honestly had no idea I would like this brand as much as I do.  The cloth diapering world is over run with the well known brand such as FuzziBunz, Bum Genius, Thirsties, and Rumparooz, that the lesser known diapers often do not get a chance to shine.  I have used cloth diapers on my little ones since they were about 3 months of age and have experienced most of the well known brands.  There are aspects of all diaper brands that are good and bad and some brands are definitely better than others.  Our favorites have been Thirsties and Bum Genius, with some recent additions from Buttons diapers.  The aspects of the above diapers that I like have been seen in Happy Endings, along with some improvements.Happy Endings diapers come in a variety of styles/types.  I like this feature as you can select a diaper for you and your babys individual needs, such as cater to the amount of absorbency inside (stuffing a pocket) or laying inserts on top of the diaper as an all-in-two version.  This diaper is a real cutie and reminds me a bit of the coveted Audrey diaper from Bum Genius (I will have it somedayif only people did not charge ridiculous prices for a harder to find print, sheesh, it is a diaper that will hold messy potty!)  At just under $15, this is a real gem of a diaper, and not just because it is adorable.This diaper has gussets!Bum Genius does not sadly and is one of the reasons I reach for this Happy Endings diaper along with my Thirsties and Buttons.  I select these over my Buttons diapers because the Buttons are basically covers that you snap a liner into.  Buttons (which is extremely similar to Best Bottoms brand) often bunch up on my baby and so those I end up using a hemp cotton prefold in, which is not always ideal.  So then, I end up reaching for Happy Endings diapers as they are super easy to use and so reliable.I like how they are different than my other brands because they have charcoal lining!Trust me, if you have not experienced charcoal lining, you are in for a treat.  In my experience, I rarely have to spray my charcoal lining diapers before washing.  Seriously, the solids come off so easy into the toilet.  (We are cloth- diapering mommys, we can talk freely here about mess cant we?) The charcoal bamboo is soft against babys skin, and does not hold wetness (which could cause rashes and discomfort).  The bamboo is antimicrobial and does not hold stink.  I absolutely love it.  The 5 layer charcoal bamboo insert is basically microfiber with charcoal bamboo on the outside (which makes it skin friendly).  You should never allow bare microfiber to be against babies skin as it absorbs to quickly and is harsh, which can dry babies skin and cause rashes.  This insert has 3 layers of microfiber between two layers of bamboo charcoal. Most cloth diapers come with microfiber inserts, and while microfiber is absorbent, to me it is rough and the material irks me when I touch it.  It sort of feels like Velcro to me and finger nails on a chalkboard.  But, when it is covered with bamboo charcoal, it is pretty amazing and works well for us.Better inserts!This diaper comes with a snap-in, 5 layer bamboo charcoal insert and has an extra pocket for stuffing is needed. I personally just add 1-2 inserts inside the pocket without laying anything on top, but with this diaper, customize it however works best for your baby.  In case you want to use this as an all-in-two diaper, here is how: the insert snaps into the top of the diaper which allows you to reuse the waterproof outer shell when only the insert is soiled (replace with another insert).This diaper has hip snaps and cross over tab snaps!This diaper is adjustable with 3x3 snaps + hip & crossover snaps, and fits babies 8-35 lbs. It is crazy, but many diapers do not have cross over snaps.  Bum Genius says they fit babies 8 lbs. and up, but we could not use them until our babies were about 11 lbs as we had slim belly babies.  My little one is 18 months and still utilizes cross over tabs.How long have I tested this diaper?? How do I wash this?I am extremely satisfied with this diaper.  The gussets are gentle against my babies legs and hold in messes.  The snaps are durable and have not cracked.  These diapers have been washed and used multiple times for a month (I always wait a fairly generous amount of time before posting a cloth diaper review since I would rather know how a diaper holds up for 1-2 months, instead of a mere week or two).  Cloth diapering can become expensive (at first) and I would hate to purchase multiple items only to hear that after a few short weeks the diaper does not hold up.  This diaper by Happy Endings has been thoroughly tested and loved.I prep my diapers with 5-6 hot washes BEFORE using (technically you can wash once before first use, but natural fibers have oils in them and it is best to fully remove them to increase absorbency).  Once we use the diaper, I wash diapers every night or every other night (using soap nuts and Nellies Natural Laundry Powder), and so when testing diapers, they get loved and used.  I wash 2 full cycles and then a final third cold rinse.This diaper still looks as great as it did when I received it.  The only difference is the charcoal lining tends to get white lint on it from time to time, as I use cloth wipes (baby wash cloths).  I keep a lint tape roller on hand for the extra fuzzies.  I do not dry my diapers in the machine.  I hang them on my IKEA octopus hanger.  These dry overnight.  The inserts dry quickly on low to medium heat with my wool dryer balls.*This was purchased at a discount for an honest review and evaluation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK8B4H0MH8ECX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160BGGDC#wasThisHelpful","RK8B4H0MH8ECX","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yodo makes a nice, budget conscious diaper bag.  They do still look like diaper bags and will not replace my love for Petunia Pickle Bottom and Storksak, but they are still a brand I recommend when you do not want to spend for a higher end bag, but yet want a quality bag that looks nice.  This diaper bag in blue is pretty and I love how the color is leaning towards a tiffany blue aqua.  The bag has accents of a blue toned silver which coordinates with the aqua.I have a large collection of diaper bags (larger than you would imagine as I mix and match according to my outfits, our activities that we have planned, etc.).  I have reviewed a few other products from this company and have been impressed.  The bags never smell like chemicals and the bags have precise stitching and overall construction.This diaper bag is spacious, yet remains lightweight.  It feels sturdy and has an assortment of pockets to suit even the over-packer.  I like that it is a glazed, glossy finish which makes it easy to wipe clean and makes me confident in rainy weather.  I normally use my PPB Cake bags most of the time, but when the weather is fickle, I need a bag that I can use when it is raining or when we will be at an event or activity where we need a bag that I do not have to worry about.  Although I never have set any of my bags on the ground, it is nice to know that this could be wiped clean if needed.  I would have preferred this to have feet on the bottom.I like how this bag has comfortable shoulder straps that are generous in length, as well as a messenger strap.  I appreciate that this included a changing pad and bottle bag.  I would have liked a hard wipes case to be included, but that is not a big problem.  This bag has several large outer pockets which make it handy for stowing snacks or a small teether or lovey toy.I recommend this bag and think it is a great option.  *I purchased this bag at a discounted price for an honest and thorough evaluation.  This was my personal opinion and experience with this bag.  I do want to note that my bag did arrived to me with a flaw on the lower area of the bag (a few pin holes and snagging).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PSAAMJ468HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB4V3I4#wasThisHelpful","R35PSAAMJ468HA","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the Aurora blue and I have to say the stock photo does not do this color justice.  The is far more beautiful and stunning in person.  It is a gorgeous almost tiffany blue aqua and is not the pale shade seen.  This ring is nicer looking than other silicone rings I have been seeing on Amazon and online. The ring is comfort-fit and slightly rounded and there are no sharp or abrupt edges.  There were no flaws to the silicone and the brand logo is very understated (which I appreciate).  I am a stay at home mom and generally only wear my wedding rings when we go out of the house, which for me, is 1-3 times per week.  (currently one car family for now)  I do not wear my wedding band or diamond engagement ring while cleaning, sleeping or showering, and with an 18 month old in diapers (and another on the way) i am not one to wear my nice rings with all the messiness that I often am cleaning up or experiencing (those of babies and toddlers know all THOSE kinds of messes far too well) And this ring is soft against baby, easy to wear and thankfully easy to CLEAN. :) I really like this ring and the size is great for me even as I am growing (I do not have to worry about my pregnancy causing me to have to refrain from wearing a ring (which might happen if/when I swell in my fingers).  *This was sent to me complimentary for an honest review and I truly think it is an excellent ring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FCDKFONSO8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010TVHTPS#wasThisHelpful","R12FCDKFONSO8U","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ring is nicer looking than other silicone rings I have been seeing on Amazon and online.  I like how it is not two-tone or with a seam as some other brands apparently have (such as a grey with black stripe or blue with a stripe, etc.) I have noticed that those could potentially come apart as they appear to not be one continuous piece of silicone.  The storm grey is a perfect match to my husband's Titanium wedding band and looks believable from a few feet away.  The ring is comfort-fit and slightly rounded and there are no sharp or abrupt edges.  There were no flaws to the silicone and the brand logo is very understated (which we appreciate).  This is a great ring for those who work in a job where your finger or hand might get caught, (fireman, metal worker, cable line/ telephone line repair, construction worker, etc.) or just someone wanting something comfortable to wear to the gym (fingers gripping metal and weights).  It would be beneficial for bowlers or those who do sports.  My husband works in a busy hotel restaurant so this can potentially come in handy, but he mainly wears this to sleep (as his regular ring scratches his face with marks and sometimes small cuts on his forehead as he is a side sleeper and has his hand near his pillow/face).  He also wears this ring when doing recreational sports or working out.  *This was sent to me complimentary for an honest review and I truly think it is an excellent ring.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFWY4ONC9ZNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RNDPE2#wasThisHelpful","R2BFWY4ONC9ZNF","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always suggest trying natural supplements for assisting your body and mind. I am not fond of taking prescription medication unless absolutely necessary. St. John's Wort has been used for supporting a positive, healthy disposition and emotional well-being. Some people take this supplement as a preventative measure to keep their outlook on life pleasant and their mood happy. However some people that take it are trying to bring themselves out of a severely depressed state of being. It has been shown that St. John's Wort is as effective as some prescription antidepressants, and yet has fewer adverse side effects. This is a botanical herb (from the flower of the same name) and can be taken without a prescription.I personally had great results with taking St. John's Wort (not this brand but others) off an on over the years, but have not taken it since having my children, as in the last 5 years I had either been pregnant or breastfeeding and have always been leery of taking excess supplements unless directed by my doctor and absolutely necessary.  Since I am currently pregnant with my third child, I decided to have my husband try this product.  My husband has been taking this supplement daily for about 3 weeks.  He has not had any negative side effects.  He takes this in the evening with a few peanut butter Ritz cracker sandwiches and his other supplements.  It is possible that this is assisting him with mood and stress, but as with any supplement, I feel it is still to soon to accurately tell.  Most supplements need at least 2-3 months of persistent use for measurable improvements to be seen.My husband has been under a lot of stress with work, our decline in finances and the excessive need of expensive repairs on our home.

"I did test this a few times for frothing milk in my coffee, and yes it works wonderfully, however I had other plans for this little gadget.  I already have a milk frother for our lattes, coffee and such, so I use this one by Kukpo to activate the saponin (suds, soap) in our soap berries / soap nuts.  Since we (my husband, myself and 2 little ones) are all sulfate and chemical free, and do not use traditional shampoo for our hair, my natural suds of choice is soap nuts.  My husband uses sulfate free shampoos with essential oils (sometimes I do as well, but I am picky)  I wash my hair in soap nut shampoo and even wash our cloth diapers and laundry in them (separately of course).  I have even made hand soap from soap nuts.  This frother is powerful and creates some nice suds.  This runs on 2 AAA batteries.To activate, I put about 6-15 soap nuts in warm water in a large pitcher and then use this Frother.  I was using the blender but that got a bit time consuming with cleanup and so I found that this was more convenient.  I like to add pure aloe vera to my soap nut shampoo for 2-3 times a week.  Once per month I add a flavored beer (such as pumpkin spice, raspberry, orange spice, chocolate, etc).  Beer adds a natural healthy luster to my hair and gives it added protein for strength.  I often add some amla and shikakai powder (Indian herb powder).This is a great frother and I use it several times a week. *I was sent this frother for evaluation and honest review.

"This is a fantastic product for the eye area and even the rest of my face.  I have tried a lot of these types of eye gels and a lot of them are similar.  I do like that this product is in an airless pump instead of a dropper bottle like a few of my vitamin c / hyaluronic acid / aloe based eye and face serums.The container is attractive with a nice label.  It is easy to dispense the product, and the airless pump keeps contaminants and light out of the product.  My particular bottle was fresh and feels nice on my skin.  I want to mention that this is not a cream as the description title would suggest.  This is indeed a gel and reminds me of aloe vera.  It is cooling and soothing and is not sticky or gummy.  I am able to use this before my makeup application without any concerns of uneven foundation.  This does not roll up on my skin prior to foundation application as some similar serums.  The fragrance is light and does not bother my nose when applied.I thought it was a nice addition for the company to add Frankincense to the product, which is a nice choice for a skin care product.  I use Frankincense in my natural, homemade based tooth pastes.  Frankincense is perfect for oral care as it has antiseptic qualities, and can assist with the prevention of and even heal existing cavities and oral infections.  When used in skincare, Frankincense can tone and tighten skin, and even help with smoothing fine lines.  This product has cucumber, aloe, vitamin e and eye bright, which seems to be in my other similar eye care products as well (all of which are beneficial for the delicate eye area and surrounding skin).  I liked how this product has Reishi which is not in my other similar skincare products.  Reishi is a type of mushroom that is often taken internally for boosting brain function, and is used for preventing and treating various diseases.  The use of this mushroom was used in ancient medicine and is gaining popularity today for anti aging and even cancer studies.I cannot make any claims to looking instantly younger, and I did not want to post a review until I had tried this several weeks (and in my case almost 2 months) but I do have to say it is a wonderful product and as good as (and perhaps significantly better) than some of the other brands I have tried.  The results of my using these types of serums have generally been good for other serums, but what I like about this one is the addition of the ingredients mentioned.  It seems the company has done some additional research and added some extra ingredients that can help with skincare and anti aging.  I still do have some darkening under my eyes, but that is due mainly to my lack of adequate sleep and genetics.  However for overall appearance of my skin (I use this lightly over my forehead, cheeks, neck, and area area) I do seem to have smaller pore size, softer skin and a healthy appearance.  Please note that I do drink a lot of water daily, never have smoked, and I am sulfate free, so I do not strip my skin with traditional soaps and chemicals.  I also try to apply argan, rosehip or jojoba oil at least once a week (often 2 times per week) after a deep cleanse with a sonic type brush.

"These are very comfortable pants.  I have the xxl in black.  I like these, they are breezy and perfect for lounging at home.  The material is thin, but soft and I have not had any issues with excessive wear.  I personally would not wear them out of the house as they do not look very flattering on me, but I wear these at home frequently. The waist looks incredibly small, but has a lot of stretch and fit me perfectly.  I am fairly tall at 5' 8 and these were long enough for me (in sock feet).  The seams and stitching on my pants is even and neat.  I can see these being well suited for yoga or relaxation exercise.  I highly recommend these pants.  *I received these as an evaluation sample at no cost for my honest review.

"I like this spin mop and bucket set.  It is true, it may feel lightweight and may be on the cheaper side of materials, but I think it functions well.  I have used it several times and it is perfect for my needs.  I am a mommy of 2 small children that are walking and crawling on the floor and this cleans the floor while also allowing it to dry promptly (no over soaking the floor) so that they can walk on it again.  The light weight of the bucket is easier on my back even when it is full of water.  I often use one bucket for 2 small rooms and so this is easy to carry from one room to the next.We do not use chemicals for cleaning and so for this system I use my soap nuts that were soaked in hot water and then made into a liquid version (I use a milk frother to activate and make the foam).  I add some of that liquid to some hot water and fill this bucket to the recommended line.  Soap nuts are natural and low sudsing (so your floors won't have a sticky residue or need rinsing).  The water is not dirty in the picture, that is just the natural color of the soap nut water after it has settled.  For added scent you could use 2 drops of lemon or orange essential oil or even lavender.I like that the system includes 2 mop heads.  You can use one for dry mopping before you wet mop.  I have not had any shedding of the mop head and it was easy to snap together.  The handle easily screws together and has a foam grip for a comfortable hold.  I am 5' 9"" and this was a bit on the short side for me to use, but I still like it.  I would have preferred to have a small extender (maybe 2-3 inches?) come with the mop (as an optional piece to use for taller users).The spinner works well and removes the excess water.  The mop head fits in the spinner but is a tight fit.  There is a locking mechanism at the bottom of the mop to make the mop go from spinning to stationary.  Over all this is a great mop for the price.  I am actually more likely to use this as it is easy to set up and break down each time.  The heads can be washed in the machine on delicate, and then I make sure the washer spins them mostly dry.  I am not yet brave enough to put the mop head in the dryer as I do not want to accidentally change the shape of the plastic.  I would not suggest this for cleaning a filthy home that perhaps you are restoring / renovating, as this might not perform well with heavy use, but for my needs it works great.  *This was sent to me as an evaluation sample, however this is my own personal experience and honest opinion.

"My husband takes one of these each evening with his other supplements.  He has not been using this long enough to see an increase of hair on his scalp, but supplements usually take weeks or months to show drastic improvements.  We do know that Biotin works for both of us.  We are trying natural methods for regrowing and thickening his hair that has thinned from stress and poor diet.  He also has some male pattern baldness as well.  He normally would take as many as 3 capsules of Biotin each evening, and so he is happy to try these instead since he already takes so many other vitamin supplements.  He thinks these Biotin Bursts taste delicious and I am hoping the ease of use, and the flavor will motivate him to take these regularly.  I tried one myself and agree it does taste good.  These are acai berry but taste a bit like grape in my opinion.  The chews are very fresh and soft which is maintained by the zip top resealable foil bag inside the box (and then individually wrapped).

"These grape teether toys are durable and cute.  The purple is bright with nice grooves for a nice sensation on baby's sore gums and teeth.  The green is a bright lime green and can easily be looped onto a toy leash / pacifier leash.  The silicone is food grade and I did not notice any strong odors with this set.  I like having the set of 2 so I can keep one in my bag and one clipped to the highchair when my baby is done feeding and needs to be entertained while we are doing dishes and cleaning up.  I have not yet tried putting these in the dishwasher, but I assume that these would do just fine on top rack in our munchkin dishwasher basket (where we put baby's dining ware).

"This is an incredible and PURE aloe gel.  Yes it does have a few preservatives at the end of the ingredient list, but that is necessary for this to have a decent shelf life.  It has much fewer ingredients than other brands I have tried.  I use this aloe gel everyday and for so many uses.  I use it on my face, on cuts and insect bites, I have used it for hair gel, I have used this for burns, etc.  It is a more liquid form of aloe than my previous brands.Baby Wipe Solution:My daily use of this is for my baby's cloth wipe solution.  We cloth diaper and use baby wash cloths in a Munchkin wipes warmer for wiping his bottom.  I use a few squirts of this aloe, Dr. Bronner's Baby Mild unscented castile soap, water, jojoba oil, argan oil, calendula oil, fractionated coconut oil, lavender essential oil and tea tree essential oil.  This is calming on his skin.Homemade Shampoo:Since I am sulfate free and do not use traditional shampoo, I use a mixture of soap nuts (activated in warm water and then used in my blender to make a frothy foam), water and aloe vera to wash my hair twice per week.  On the non shampoo days, I just rinse with water when I am showering.  Once a month I add a fragrantly smelling flavored beer to my wash mixture (such as pumpkin spice, raspberry, orange spice or even a chocolate brew.)This aloe is so nice and it does not have any fragrances or colors like the blue or green ""aloe"" I see at the local stores.  The only somewhat safe and somewhat pure aloe that I had been using was the ""Fruit of the Earth"" clear aloe.  However, it seems to have more chemical sounding ingredients: Aloe Vera Gel, Triethanolamine, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea.  Some aloes have alcohol in them, can you believe it? This is alcohol free and so gentle and healing.I like that this InstaNatural aloe does with a pump, however after a few uses, the pump made the product squirt out fast and get on the counter and on my clothing sometimes.  So I decided to just use the flip top cap.  I love this product so much and although *I was sent this at no cost for my honest opinion*, I will be purchasing this brand of aloe from now on.

"I like this toner, it does not make my combination skin dry, nor does it strip my skin to make it over produce oil in response.  It does not feel sticky on my face.  I am sulfate free and mainly use the oil cleaning method a few times per week to remove my makeup on the days I get out of the house.  I am a stay at home mommy to 2 little ones so when I do not leave the house my face is bare so it can breathe.  I do wash my face with a natural, simple ingredient charcoal, jojoba oil, calendula, aloe, and coconut oil based soap that is sulfate free and chemical free.  This toner is all natural except for the last few ingredients that are preservatives.I like to use this immediately out of the shower and lightly mist my face.  I let it soak in while I get dressed and then I apply vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serum each day (morning and night).  I only use this toner during the day.  It has a light citrus fragrance that is not over powering.  It does not irritate, sting or cause me any break outs.  I love the witch hazel, geranium essential oil, tea tree essential oil, aloe vera, chamomile and green tea added to the vitamin c toner.  Those are all ingredients I have on hand in my apothecary cabinet that are just lovely for my skin.  This makes my pores appear smaller and stay cleaner.  My skin is soft and feels refreshed.The spray is easy to use.

"This is a nice product from InstaNatural.  The ingredients are of nice quality and I find that it makes my face stay clearer and have a natural, healthy glow.  The serum is bright orange, and while it does not color my face, I think I would have preferred it to be more clear and less sticky.  I do like the slight citrus fragrance.  I use this one mainly at night as it seems slightly stickier than other serums I have used.  Still, I have tried many C serums over the past 2 years and love how consistently good InstaNatural products are.  I apply this on a freshly washed face and finish with some Argan Oil or RoseHip Oil.This serum is packed with skin nourishing and healing ingredients.  Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide (B3) are 2 ingredients that I have had excellent results with.  I like having those ingredients included with my C serum so that I do not need to apply them separately.  The Niacinamide keeps my skin free of blemishes and lightens past acne red marks.  I am entering my early thirties and although I do not have wrinkles, I do have very large pores and some fine lines around my eye area.  I also have dark circles that I am trying to lighten.I like that this is in a dark amber glass bottle to block out light that may lessen the potency, and an easy to use dropper.  Despite this being a small bottle, it will last me a while as I do not need to use much.  I have tried this product for over a month and like it a lot.  I would prefer it to be less sticky.  Although the orange fragrance is pleasant, I would prefer it to be unscented.

"This is a fantastic smelling (a hint of rich vanilla coffee--see the ingredients) mascara that has several lash fortifying and nourishing ingredients.  (natural based and botanical extracts and oils) This is not a dry, or overly waxy mascara.  My lashes are not crunchy or brittle feeling when this dries.  They stay full and soft.  It can smudge a bit at the end of the day (but to be honest, I have long days and generally do not go to bed (removing makeup at that time) until 2 am most nights--as this mommy of 2 little ones needs time to get chores, blogging and emails done).  I have some flaking under my eyes after a few hours, but not much to complain about.  I generally brush the little 2-3 flakes away when I see them, without disturbing the mascara on my lashes.  This is not waterproof but is water resistant.  I generally prefer water resistant as it is gentler to remove.  I oil cleanse my face and use either castile soap, African Black soap, or just plain jojoba, rose hip, or argan oil to remove makeup.  This removed easily when I wanted it to.I like the long and traditional bristle brush and often find these types work best for me.  I do have naturally long lashes and this did thicken them, but did not add length.  As mentioned above, this smells so nice and is so much better for the lashes than the chemical laden (sometimes paint like smelling) mascaras that are not so natural.  This is a smaller mascara tube, but that is actually a plus for me as I am bad about replacing mascara when it needs replacing.  I have about 10-15 mascaras in my rotation (varying from natural to chemical based) and they are all full sized.  It is nice to have a smaller tube to keep with me for travel, or even just to ensure I buy a fresher tube when needed.  You are actually supposed to toss mascara and eyeliner after 3 months, but to be honest, I keep them 6 months to a year.  This size will help me be better.I recommend this mascara (and the gel cream eyeliner from the same brand) and have been using it the past 2 weeks.  *I received this as a sample, however this is my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOAUMYO21FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0HZX9Q#wasThisHelpful","RCOAUMYO21FI","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am impresses with this eyeliner.  I frequently like to do a vintage inspired black cat eye look, and usually use my felt tipped Stila Stay All Day black liner (my ""never fails me liner"").  This gel/cream eyeliner by Endlessly beautiful works well depending on the type of brush used.  I have several options ranging from thin lip / eye liner brushes, long and wide  flat brushes, and short dense ones.  I selected the one with the silver end.  It is actually a lipstick brush, but is firm and dense and creates a neat line.  It is a little too easy to use too much product as this product is ultra creamy,  so I end up using the edge of the jar to skim some excess off the brush before application.  I then gradually make my line thicker or darker as desired.I tested this in weather that was early Fall, so it was still warm outside but not the 85-95 degree weather we had been having.  (so this stayed put despite my natural oily lids).  I think this may be even better for me to use this winter to ensure it does not smudge from the excess heat.  I wore this with frosty pale pink lids and used the natural mascara of this same brand.  I am new to Endless Beauty, but am impressed.  I have been sulfate free, and almost completely free of chemical based products for all cosmetics, except for some of my makeup.  Mascara and eyeliner have been 2 products that are difficult for me to find satisfactory in the natural category.  I usually have smudging or the product appears too light in pigment.  This is a dark black which is exactly what I want.  I love how it is made with 100% natural and partially organic Ingredients.  Several of these ingredients are very nourishing for skin and hair follicles.  (CastorSeed Oil, Coconut Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Vitamin E, and various botanical extracts: Oregano Leaf Extract, Thyme Extract, Cinnamon Bark Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Goldenseal Root Extract.) I already use castor oil, vitamin e, and coconut oil for my face and hair, and am happy to see these ingredients listed.

"My husband uses 1-2 drops of this liquid Biotin in his daily coffee. It is a natural Vanilla flavor and so easy to use (we keep it right next to the machine).

They come with a nice draw string storage bag  (with an unfortunate placement of barcode sticker on the back of the bag that I have yet to be able to fully remove without sticky paper residue) and a microfiber cleaning cloth.

"I love these inserts.  We use a variety of cloth diaper types ranging from Bum Genius 4.0 one size snaps, Kawaii, Coqui Baby, Happy Endings, Thirsties hemp cotton refolds with covers and a few others.  These are super absorbent and very trim (even when I put 2 of these in his night diaper).  They feel much nicer in my hand than bare microfiber (bare microfiber tends to feel like hook and loop / Velcro at times and often attracts lint, hair and threads--not favorable).  Microfiber however, is a good material for absorption.  These inserts exceed my expectations and are better than traditional bare microfiber inserts.  These have the softness and extra holding power of bamboo.  These inserts are made up of 3 layers of bamboo terry and 2 layers of microfiber, and are antibacterial and antimicrobial.  I have yet to have any issues with residual staining or odors.  I am pleased with the generous size and overall construction of these inserts.  These have not become misshapen nor have they had any noticeable shrinking. They fit well in my pocket diapers and I have often paired one with a cotton hemp (size 1) Thirsties prefold for night use in a pul cover.I prepped these thoroughly before using by washing in the machine on hot for about 5 cycles.  This ensures that they absorb the maximum amount of liquid, and not repel or leak.  I dry these on low to medium heat in my dryer and have not had any issues.  We use Nellies Natural Laundry powder and I wash my diaper laundry either daily or every other day.

"These are a great size for newborns, but also for my 17 month old cloth diapered toddler and my 4 year old.  We use one of these inserts for boosting absorbency of diapers for our toddler, but these are also a perfect fit in our 4 year old's night undies (Super Undies brand for bed wetting).  My daughter is 99% potty trained for day, but at night she has a tendency to wet the bed (most likely due to her always drinking so much water before bed and stalling for more a few times).  We use the cotton lined Super Undies that have a pocket for increasing absorption.  We love these inserts for that purpose.  For my 17 month old, I use this on top of larger charcoal inserts for when we need extra absorbency but not the added bulk of 2 large inserts.  I have used one of these in between a Thirsties hemp cotton prefold and then I lay the prefold inside a pul waterproof Thirsties cover (or other PUL brand cover).  These are great for both of my children.These wash well and dry very quickly.  They are antimicrobial and do not hold odors.  The dark color and type of fabric is stain resistant.  They are stitched neatly and seem like they will hold up well to daily washing and wear.  They do need to be prepped (hot wash cycles) several times before use (I generally do 4-6 cycles of hot wash with cold rinse).  They dry quickly by air dry or machine.  Ours do tend to get white lint frequently from washing and drying with our white baby wash cloths (which are solely used for cloth baby wipes in our warmer).  I have nothing negative to say about these.  They work well and the price listed is reasonable.

When only the insert is soiled (but not soaked through or messy anywhere else) you can remove and add a clean one.  I personally do not use this method for these all in two diapers as I cannot wipe the cover clean.  My Thirsties (and other PUL waterproof covers) are obviously wipeable on the inside and seem better suited for this idea.  But if it works for your baby (perhaps a younger baby) then feel free to d what works.  For my little guy, (at night, extended length outings, or long car rides) we use a charcoal insert on the inside pocket and snap one on the top and when he has used the diaper, I rinse with the diaper sprayer (if needed) then separate all the inserts and put in our dry, closed diaper pail (using a Planetwise pail liner inside).  As seen in the stock picture, when using the snap on insert, there is some overlap over the tummy guard strip, and since we use a pocket insert as well, we fold about 2 inches under in the front for our little guy to allow the stay dry strip to keep his tummy dry as he has always been a tummy sleeper.  This also gives even more absorption where he might need it.  For casual day use, we just snap one on top, and do not stuff any insert since he gets changed every 2-4 hours.This has a very soft lining, it is the same charcoal fleece that is used on the inserts.  As mentioned, the inserts are a mix of charcoal bamboo and microfiber (5 layer charcoal bamboo with 3 layers of microfiber between two layers of bamboo charcoal). I have used these type of inserts for several months and prefer them to the usual bare microfiber.  Bamboo Charcoal has antibacterial qualities, is soft, resistant to staining, highly absorbent, and wicks moisture from skin.  The only somewhat issue (but not a reason to dislike) is that I often get white lint all over the inner liner and insert.  I am thinking it is from some of my cloth baby wipes (wash cloths) that are a bamboo cotton terry material.  The bamboo charcoal attracts the white fuzzier.This diaper has double gussets with soft covered elastic! LOVE! I always prefer diapers with gussets and wish our Bum Genius one sized diapers had them.  We love Bum Genius and most of our rotation is the snap 4.0 Bum Genius, but we have had messy problems around the legs a few more times that I would like to remember.  This diaper has been used about 5 times so far and we have not had any issues. My son is 17 months and about 22 pounds, with plump cherub baby legs.  We do not have any issues with irritation from the elastic.This diaper is cute for a boy or girl.  The background on this particular one is black and the star are very bright.  The yellow is slightly neon.  This is designed to fit babies 8-35 lbs.  It has 3 rows of 3 snaps as well as hip snaps.  (great feature)  This diaper washes well and the charcoal insert dries incredibly fast.  We hang our cloth diaper covers and shells on a delicates hanger (we have the octopus from IKEA) and sun diaper outside to freshen, dry and lift any staining on the white inner lining diapers.  I dry the inserts on medium heat in our dryer.  I suggest thoroughly prepping the diaper and inserts before using  For natural fibers, I usually wash on hot for about 4-6 cycles before using to allow for best absorbency.  We use Nellies natural laundry powder or soap nuts to wash diapers.I recommend the Happy Endings AI2 charcoal diaper.  It is holding up well after several prep washes and daily washing (we wash either every day or every other day and do a full cold cycle wash, cold rinse, then laundry soap wash hot, rinse cold, then extra rinse cold.)  We have not had any issues with odors with this diaper.  *I was sent one diaper in the stars pattern to review.  This is my honest opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EA7SC3DSAA22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H8ZXCG#wasThisHelpful","R2EA7SC3DSAA22","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is actually my first experience with a fitted type of diaper.  I have tried various brands of diapers and most everything from prefolds (hemp cotton Thirsties) with snap covers, Pocket diapers (micro fleece/ microsuede, microfiber inserts, hemp/charcoal/bamboo/cotton), all in ones, all in twos, etc.  I always prefer natural fibers for diapers.  This is a very soft and well constructed diaper and I am impressed with it.  It is 55% hemp 45% organic cotton and naturally anti-microbial.  It softens after multiple washes.  I prepped this diaper by washing on hot with Nellies Natural Laundry powder and did about 5 cycles.  I am used to prepping with multiple washes as I am growing my collection of hemp cotton prefolds and inserts.  This is a one sized diaper and fits approximately 8 to 38 pounds. The snaps are sturdy and adjust to a variety of shapes and sizes with 4 rise settings. There are 2 inserts: 1 shorter sewn-in (hourglass)  and 1 long snap-in insert (a generous 20 inches) with a unique cover flap that protects baby from the back of the snaps.  I love how these have the similar warranty that my Bum Genius diaper have, a full 12-month product replacement warranty.I use a Coqui PUL waterproof cover or one of my Thirsties covers.  (Love the Coqui ones as they are a seemingly more durable PUL material, however they do not have gussets like the Thirsties).  I find that this Bel Canto diaper works wonderfully as our night time diaper.  We add a newborn size charcoal insert inside this for added absorption.  You may not need to add this, but our 17 month old still breast feeds 1-3 times during the night, and so in the morning he has a really wet diaper.  This holds it all and we have not had any leaking.  We tuck in all of the Bel Canto fitted (under the pul cover) so that nothing wicks out.It has cross over tabs and as mentioned, a generous 4 rows of snaps for the rise.  The diaper is a natural cream color and is trimmed in a sage green.  The diaper feels well crafted and is one you will want to have in your rotation (perhaps maybe 2 or 3).  My 17 month old is roughly 22 lbs, see below for how these fit on him.  The orange cover is also from Coqui Baby and a great choice.  *I was sent one fitted Bel Canto 2.0 diaper for an honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R380B5MAP3IZDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUW0K46#wasThisHelpful","R380B5MAP3IZDH","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great diaper and has been serving us well for the past few weeks.  We wash every night or every other night, so this has had plenty of time on my little one's bottom.  When this arrived, I removed the inserts and separated them from the diaper and put this in the washing machine to prep.  Most diapers should be washed several times before using to get out any residual oils and chemicals, as well as increase the absorbency.  I usually wash in hot water (rinse cold) and then do 3-4 of those complete cycles.  I use Nellies natural laundry powder and sometimes soap nuts.  These are microfiber inserts so they do not need to be washed as many times as my hemp and organic cotton.  These come with a large insert that adjusts in size with snaps, as well as a smaller, newborn sized insert that can be used with the larger one to use over night or for heavier wetters.  I personally prefer hemp and organic cotton as microfiber feels a bit icky to my hands, but I am used to using it as we have used Bum Genius diapers with our daughter and now with our son.  Also, microfiber does absorb well, so I can understand why it is so frequently used with various diapers.  Being that this is a pocket diaper, you could switch out inserts with your desired material if you desire.  I often use a Thirsties hemp cotton prefold in size one, fold it over, and put the small infant microfiber insert inside the prefold, and stuff the pocket.This diaper has been washed multiple times and has not faded or shown any signs of defect or wear.  The stitching seems well done and the diaper feels well constructed.  The diaper does have a 3 month warranty.  I feel that is a little short of a timeframe, but it is still good to have.  Our Bum Genius has probably to most impressive warranty I have seen: they will guarantee their diapers for one year from the date of original purchase of new diaper.  These look similar to our other cloth diapers and the snaps work well.  I do like how Simba & Mama diapers have a cross over snap as both my little ones had to wait to use the Bum Genius until they were about 3 months of age due to their slim bellies.  The tabs are stretchy and sturdy with each diaper having a slightly different shade for their tabs as the rest of the diaper.  The color of my diaper was orange and I would describe the main area to be a creamsicle orange color, with the tabs being a brighter orange. (described as gold in the description).  It would be nice for a boy or a girl.I like how wide and easy the diaper is to stuff.  This allows for customizable stuffing depending on how much your baby or toddler needs.  You can put 2 large inserts if you need, or a prefold, or a hemp or charcoal insert if you like.  I like how it has the tummy guard (like our Bum Genius) as both my little ones have always been tummy sleepers, even in the wee months.  This diaper has white micro suede inner fabric which is soft and wicks moisture, helping to keep your baby feeling dry and with less irritation.  We keep our diapers bright white and fresh by drying outside in the sunshine (and even on cloudy days).  To extend the life of your diapers, do not machine dry the actual diaper (only the inserts).  The leg elastic openings are comfortable and have not left any marks on my baby's cherub thighs, nor have we had any leaks.  I generally prefer double leg gussets with diapers, however not all my diaper brands have them, and so far I have not had any issues with messes.  To give you an idea on fit, my baby boy is 17 months and roughly 22 lbs.  When using the Simba and Mama inserts, we use the large one snapped and the newborn one as well.Overall, I think this is a great diaper and I like how Simba and Mama includes a matching mini wet bag and fleece liner.  The wet bag can fit one diaper and is smaller than other wet bags I have used.  I had the perfect idea for it when it arrived.  It fits all of my breast pump parts for my electric single pump (bottle as well).  I am thrilled and the orange color looks great with the lime green on my pump.  The fleece liner is a cute daisy pattern (and I assume each diaper has a different pattern).  This is a micro fleece and allows liquid to go through the diaper and catch the solids.  This keeps the diaper stain free and easier to clean.  It is also fantastic for when you need to use diaper ointments.  We try to use cloth diaper friendly creams and ointments when possible, however, even those that are oil based could potentially build up and cause slight repelling.  I always recommend using a liner and so happy to have one included.  For the price of the diaper, 2 inserts, a liner and wet bag, this is a nice set.  I also love how Simba and Mama donates a diaper to a Mama and baby in need.  I would have preferred this diaper to have been made in the USA.  I recommend this diaper and find that it suits our needs.  *I received a sample diaper for the purpose of an honest review, all thoughts are my own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZEM9HCKG8TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FSNF1W#wasThisHelpful","R22ZEM9HCKG8TS","A35X85OH0V85HD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35X85OH0V85HD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nine Things About the Movie ""Blackhat""1. This was directed by Michael Mann, who is probably most famous for his 1995 crime classic ""Heat"". And ""Blackhat"" definitely has Mann's trademark cool look and feel. But something went very wrong somewhere. The movie seems like it was made by someone pretending to be Michael Mann.2. It's about a mysterious computer hacker attacking various places around the world for unknown reasons. The Chinese and American governments get together to catch the bad guy. In order to do that, they must release a buff, hunky computer hacker named Nicholas Hathaway from jail.3. This film is great proof that a movie can be complicated without actually being smart.4. There is a lot of cyber-jargon used in this movie. Computer experts say it's pretty accurate. They're the only ones that will know, because the movie doesn't really try to explain anything.5. Every 20 minutes or so, the movie slows down because the heroes have run out of leads. So Hathaway will look confused for a minute, get the ""light bulb"" look, and then tell everybody of an idea he just had that will lead the heroes down a new path. This path will last for about 20 more minutes. Repeat this step for about two hours, and the movie is over.6. There's also a completely predictable and unnecessary romance that develops between Hathaway and a teammate. It's supposed to add some emotional tension to the group, but all it really does is bring the movie to a grinding stop, wasting any momentum that the movie had built up.7. As the movie progresses, it gets more action-packed but less believable. The plot holes get bigger. And for an MIT computer hacker spending years in jail, Hathaway is surprisingly good in gunfights and knife battles.8. This movie was not only the first box-office flop of 2015, it's one of the biggest box-office flops in history. A week after being released in US theaters, its scheduled release in Australia was canceled - which is where the star, Chris Hemsworth, is from.9. This could have been a good movie. I don't know what happened. But in the end, it's just a way for computer geeks to fantasize that they're a sexy action hero with a girlfriend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCCGDVX76RNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG1353E#wasThisHelpful","R2OCCGDVX76RNQ","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Annie"" (1982)[After watching the 2014 version of ""Annie"" I decided tonight to go back and watch the original 1982 version again. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and I remember loving it when I was little. This review reflects my adult perspective on the revisiting. I realize that this review will make a lot of die-hard fans very angry with me.]1. What did I just watch? OK, the songs are just as catchy as they were. And fine, Carol Burnett still rules.2. But the movie itself? The movie is utterly ridiculous. And weird. And there is entirely too much dancing. Most kids today wouldn't have it.3. I realize that this movie is based in the Depression, and is based on the original comic, which had different social standards. But I still find the movie disturbing in ways that were completely over my head when I was 11.4. This movie is blatant capitalist propaganda. It openly worships money and power, and demonizes the poor. It even manages to make fun of communism.5. I was horrified to now understand the context in which the song ""Tomorrow"" was used - to encourage the President of the United States to distract poor people from paying attention to their situation.6. In this movie, money is always the solution, and people are essentially property.7. Besides being classist, the movie is sexist and racist.8. The character of Punjab is a car crash of gasp-inducing stereotypes.9. But they all smile and sing about it, so that counts for something, I guess.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3Z64XD72407/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000VCZKM#wasThisHelpful","R1V3Z64XD72407","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Cut and Run""1. This is the final movie of Ruggero Deodato's so-called Amazonia Trilogy (after ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust"").2. ""Cannibal Holocaust"", which is about a group of Western journalists being tortured and killed by savage natives of the Amazon, was so infamous that there was demand for a sequel. But Deodato didn't want to make ""Cannibal Holocaust 2"". So he made ""Cut and Run"", which is about a group of Western journalists filming drug runners being tortured and killed by savage natives of the Amazon. See the difference there?3. The plot consists of about three different stories that are as lost and confused as the journalists in the jungle. One of the stories is about a father and his missing son. One of the stories is about the cocaine trade. And one of the stories is a cheap rip-off of ""Apocalypse Now"". None of the stories are complete, nor do they mix well.4. 80's teen idol Willie Aames is in this movie. In clean-cut America, his good looks may have distracted everybody from his acting ability. But in Venezuela (where the movie was filmed), his terrible overacting made me laugh out loud.5.  Actually, a lot of this movie made me laugh out loud. All the acting is bad, the story is ludicrous, and the gore is everywhere.6.  Speaking of gore, this is Deodato we're talking about here. The only reason you watch one of his movies is to watch blood and guts and spears and knives. What's awesome is how elaborate all the decapitation and mutilation gore is, but when someone gets shot, they just fall over with no bullet holes.7. The movie is perhaps most notable for having the best depiction of a man being ripped in half by a jungle rope trap.8.  A young Eriq La Salle has a small role as a pimp, dressed all in purple. He later became the well-known and respected actor in the series ""ER"".  And the guy that plays the mutant Pluto in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is here, too. He just pops up out of the water every now and then and kills someone.9. Make no mistake, this is a bad movie. But for fans of bad movies, it's worth checking out. And while it doesn't have the kick of ""Cannibal Holocaust"", followers of Deodato's career need to put this on their shelf.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYWLVE7R4WMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005R24F#wasThisHelpful","R1YYWLVE7R4WMX","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[NOTE: I tried very hard not to give away spoilers in this review. If you want to see this movie, see it before you learn the actual story.]1. Most people (including myself) thought the trailer to this film was kind of vague and hard to remember; you couldn't really tell what it was about. People would say, ""'Foxcatcher'? That's that weird movie about wrestling, right? And Steve Carell sure looks strange."" But now I understand why. It's almost impossible to summarize the movie.2. The actual plot is easy to explain - two brothers, Dave and Mark Schultz, are Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. The younger one, Mark, is trying to get out of his brother's shadow and become his own person. Mark meets this really strange millionaire, John du Pont, who invites Mark to start a wrestling team on his ranch, and train for the next Olympics. Things don't go as planned.3. The plot is not what the movie is actually about, though. This is a subtle movie where some key points are shown through long, non-verbal scenes, or through short, almost throw-away lines of dialogue. Some people think this movie is too long, quiet, and boring. This means they have not been paying attention, and missed all the important stuff.4. The plot of the movie is basically a true story, but they changed quite a few things to make it fit, and to make the story more complex (there is a lot of controversy over some of the points in the film). The real Mark Schultz has a cameo, as a wrestling official weighing in the movie version of himself.5. I have only one thing to say about Steve Carell. He deserves Best Actor of the Year. And Mark Ruffalo deserves his Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor.6. Now let me say something about Channing Tatum. The fact that he was not nominated for an Oscar is one of the most mysterious and outrageous snubs I've ever seen. Tatum gives a performance that rivals Carell's. He inhabits his character physically and emotionally. Together, Tatum and Carell turn what could have been a weird little melodrama into a genuine piece of American tragedy.7. There is a constant thread of awkwardness and pain through the movie. It's perfectly matched with the muted, sorrowful colors of the film, the minimalist soundtrack, and the cinematography.8. The movie also sets up a constant, vague sense of unease. You get a feeling in the pit of your stomach that something is going to go very wrong, but you don't know what or when.9. This movie is a quiet, peaceful, psychological car crash, where morals clash with money, ""yes"" clashes with ""no"", family will both support and destroy you, and crushed dreams are painted onto other people. It's open to more than one interpretation, and I don't guarantee that you will like this movie. But I do guarantee that if you can stick with it, it will stick with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBUL9K5ZWELC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4ANEI#wasThisHelpful","RVBUL9K5ZWELC","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Trouble Every Day""1. Finally, we get a film that dares to explore the question we all have: How do you handle it when you marry someone who happens to be a cannibal?2. This movie is advertised as an erotic horror film, and is associated with the New French Extremity movement. It does definitely mix the erotic with the horrible, in pretty intimate ways.3. It starts out with a guy named Leo that keeps having to go find his wife Core, who continually wanders off to have sex with strange men, killing them, and start chewing on their faces.4. After awhile, we meet Shane and June, an American couple flying to France. Shane is trying to find Leo to ask for help with some mysterious ailment that, among other things, makes him afraid to have sex with June.5. Given the lurid plot, it's weird that the movie is more like a series of moving paintings than an actual film. It's slow, and beautifully shot, but kind of aimless. Not a whole lot really happens in the movie.6. This movie does have the distinction of containing two of the most traumatic and horrifying sex scenes I've ever witnessed. I actually did the classic ""gasp and cover my mouth with my hand"" move.7. It was directed by Claire Denis. She usually makes movies with a historical or political theme. So this is kind of a departure for her.8. I'm not sure if the movie is supposed to be a metaphor for bad relationships, the horrors of sex, the hungers of love, the cannibalization of modern society, an existential statement about freedom and bondage, or if it really is literally about people who love people who eat people.9. This is small art film for a small audience with an open mind and a strong stomach. A dedicated cult following will watch this multiple times. A large number of others will move on, feeling both bored and repulsed at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFA4Z96YEU4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKUBR5O#wasThisHelpful","R3GFA4Z96YEU4W","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""American Sniper""1. This movie knocked me speechless.2. Directed by 84-year-old Clint Eastwood, it's based (kind of) on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, who has the reputation of being the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. In the book, Kyle portrays himself as a stone-cold badass killer. The movie softens that up a great deal. In fact, after the first 30 minutes, the movie has very little to do with the real Chris Kyle. He's a convenient symbol from which Eastwood constructs a rather complicated metaphor, to show that war is both necessary and self-defeating.3. The movie starts by setting up Kyle's simple, patriotic, God-country-family loyalty. It's a world of black and white, good and evil. Kyle becomes a Navy SEAL to fight evil. But as the movie progresses, Kyle starts to be confronted with situations and ideas that don't mesh with his view of reality. This makes him angry and confused, and he deals with it by suppressing it and focusing on his job of defending America against evil; he returns to Iraq again and again.4. Kyle does four tours in Iraq, separated by periods back at home with his family. The random violence and constant paranoia in Kyle's military life suddenly switches to the carefree American oblivious family life. This is somewhat disorienting, which helps you to understand what Kyle is experiencing. The movie is an excellent depiction of the development of PTSD without ever mentioning that term.5. Bradley Cooper is astounding in his portrayal of Kyle. You can tell a great actor by what he does when he's not talking. Cooper nails the body language of a man who feels at home while he's at war, and at war while he's at home. It's not only in his body, it's even in his eyes.6. A LOT of people miss the entire point of the movie because they immediately move into their respective corners and watch it only through their lens. The hyper patriots that expect the movie to call him a saint are just as lost as the ones that expect the movie to call him a racist sociopath.7. The movie is pretty violent. And since it is almost entirely urban combat, the violence is more intimate, more intense, than in conventional war movies. There are no epic battle scenes. Every shot, every killed soldier, is shown individually.8. There is an unwritten rule of filmmaking that if you are going to torture or kill a child, you don't actually show it; the act is committed offscreen. This movie breaks that rule. Twice.9. The movie embraces the paradoxes of war by showing them through the eyes of a man that doesn't understand paradox. What makes the movie so polarizing (and so impressive to me) is the fact that Clint Eastwood turned the movie itself into a bullet, shooting straight for a deep nerve in American culture. Love it or loathe it, this is something we need to pay attention to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M1OU63BGAJY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGZ94SG#wasThisHelpful","R1M1OU63BGAJY5","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Selma""1. This movie is called ""Selma"", not ""King"". While Dr. Martin Luther King is the main character in this movie, it's really about the 1965 protest march to overcome restrictions on allowing blacks to vote. So it covers a lot more than just him.2. I'm not an expert on this area of history; but from what I do know, the movie stays fairly close to the facts. The biggest problem with historical accuracy is the movie's negative portrayal of President Johnson. He wasn't obstructing King's movement, and he didn't assign the FBI to spy on MLK (the previous president did that). They got along a lot better than the movie claims.3. In 2009, the King estate sold the rights to MLK's speeches to another Hollywood studio for a movie to be made by Steven Spielberg. So this movie wasn't allowed to use MLK's actual speeches. They had to invent new ones that said basically the same things, but without violating copyright.4. Reportedly, some white people hired as extras in the movie found out that they were supposed to play racists. They politely asked to switch roles, and were changed to marchers.5. The movie does a great job of showing the complexities of the situation - the black civil rights movement was not a unified front. There were turf issues, competing tactics, and even disagreement on exactly what they were trying to accomplish. It's also honest enough to show the sometimes cynical side of activism - the cold calculations of how and when to do things, in order to maximize media coverage and sympathy from other people.6. There are a few scenes that are overly dramatic and sanctimonious, but that's to be expected in a movie like this. And they really didn't distract from the bigger picture.7. It's ironic that in this film of such an iconic piece of American history, the roles of Dr. King, his wife, the president, and governor George Wallace are all played by British actors.8. If you think this movie makes white people look bad, or if it makes you angry at white people, you have missed the point. And you also aren't really paying attention.9. As far as historical dramas go, this one is better than most. It's smart, interesting, confrontational when it needs to be, and much more nuanced than you might expect. It's a great addition to cinematic portrayals of American history and the struggle for justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6DSXA0OD0QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0X6L48#wasThisHelpful","RY6DSXA0OD0QJ","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Nightcrawler""1. This darkly beautiful film is hard to categorize.2. It's a character study of an... intense young man.3. It's also a scathing critique of ratings-hungry news media.4. And it's a midnight-black satire on the ""fight to accomplish your dreams"" concept.5. Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely owns this film as Lou, an intense but aimless man who discovers he can make money by filming crime and accident scenes and then selling the footage to a news station. As the news station demands more graphic footage, Lou decides to step his game up, which leads to unpleasant consequences.6. Some people are upset with the ending of the movie, but I thought it was well-played and consistent with the rest of the film.7. The beauty (and terror) of Gyllenhaal's performance is that he never shows exactly what's going on inside Lou's head. Lou is a smooth, awkwardly friendly young man. But every now and then his mask slips, giving us a glimpse of what he's really like. And it's not friendly. Gyllenhaal rides this razor thin line brilliantly.8.  The cinematography is gorgeous, showing nocturnal Los Angeles in a shiny darkness, reflecting the personality of Lou.9.  From the unusual opening scene to the unconventional ending, ""Nightcrawler"" is dark drama with elements of a thriller and a crime film. This one will stay under your skin for awhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5SOAC9Z29GXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q3DMJZW#wasThisHelpful","R5SOAC9Z29GXW","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[NOTE: This is about the movie itself, not the Christmas 2014 controversy]Nine Things About the Movie ""The Interview""1. This movie was written and directed by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, and also stars James Franco. These three also made ""This is the End"" together in 2013.  If you've seen that movie, you already know this one is going to be kind of bizarre, and full of tasteless and weird humor.2. Franco plays Dave Skylark, a dumbly charming host of a Hollywood trashy gossip show. Rogan  plays Aaron Rapoport, the show's producer. They discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jung-Un is a fan of the show and wants to be interviewed by them. The CIA intervenes and wants the pair to assassinate Kim Jung-Un while they are there.3. Goldberg and Rogan knew their absurd plot was made more realistic after Dennis Rodman visited Kim Jung-Un and fell for the propaganda.4. The movie was originally supposed to be released in October 2014, but North Korea threatened ""merciless"" action against the U.S. So the movie was pushed back to Christmas 2014 and supposedly edited to make it more acceptable to North Korea. I have no idea what editing they did, but there is absolutely no way that Kim Jung-Un would ever be OK with this movie. The ending isn't even the worst part - Kim is mercilessly mocked throughout the movie. Goldberg and Rogan had to know they were hitting a very sensitive nerve.5. Randall Park (whose parents are South Korean) plays Kim Jung-Un. Hopefully he's in some sort of witness protection program, because I wouldn't be surprised if North Korea has taken a hit out on him.6. There is a certain amount of political satire in the movie, but there's more dumb humor and butt jokes. It makes for a weird combination. There is also a surprising amount of bloody violence for what is essentially a buddy comedy.7. Apparently, North Korean citizens really want to see this movie, even though being caught with it could cause them to be executed. So human rights organizations are actually balloon-dropping copies of the movie into the country.8. This movie will probably be counted one of the most memorable moments of Katy Perry's career (even though the slow version of ""Fireworks"" played at the climax isn't really Katy Perry - it's a cover by a singer named Jenny Lane).9. This isn't the best movie of the year, but it's certainly not the worst. It's dumber than it could be, but smarter than it looks. The humor will not be to everyone's taste, but it's one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D3TATBEPTX2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNRD7Y4#wasThisHelpful","R1D3TATBEPTX2P","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""A Million Ways To Die in the West""1. This movie could have been called ""A Million Jokes Die in this Movie"".2. It's proof that having an all-star cast cannot save a bad script.3. The plot is cobbled together from other old westerns; an awkward sheep herder named Albert is dumped by his girlfriend. Albert falls in love with a new girl who is secretly married to a gold bandit. They help each other out. The end.4. This movie is mostly a succession of jokes, with a few serious scenes thrown in. Some of the jokes are funny, and some of the characters are funny. A lot of the jokes and characters are not.5. Seth MacFarlane is mostly known for creating the TV show ""Family Guy"". This movie was written by Seth MacFarlane, produced by Seth MacFarlane, directed by Seth MacFarlane, and stars Seth MacFarlane. It's his first-ever on-screen acting role.6. Seth MacFarlane is a terrible actor. There is nothing remotely believable about his character. He just wanders around being Seth MacFarlane, making jokes.7. Casting Gilbert Gottfried as Abraham Lincoln was one of the worst cinematic decisions of the year.8. The best joke was set up halfway through movie, but is pretty offensive without the punchline... which doesn't come until the credits start (with another small joke after the credits).9. This movie is a mess, full of non-sequiturs and random sex and poop jokes. It does have a few really good moments, but on the whole, I felt embarrassed for the actors who agreed to be in the movie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AVDZKL4QC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9MP9I#wasThisHelpful","R4AVDZKL4QC4","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Unbroken""1. This movie is based on the true story of Louis Zamperini, a troubled kid that became an Olympic runner, and then fought in World War II, spent 47 days on a life-raft, and over 2 years in a Japanese POW camp.2.  If you've seen the trailer to this movie, you've basically seen the whole movie, except for the violence.3.  I know it's supposed to be inspirational, but this movie is my pick for the most feel-bad movie of 2014.4.  The best scene of the movie is the first one, when we get to see a crew of American bombers in a sky battle. After that, nothing really happens except a guy goes through hell and is still alive at the end.5.  A pretty big chunk of the movie shows the guys just floating along in a life raft, slowly dying. The POW camp doesn't come along until somewhere in the last half of the movie.6.  The movie gets more brutal and violent as it goes along. I don't know how it got released with a PG-13 rating.7.  As a break from scenes of helplessness, humiliation, and torture, we are sometimes treated to inspirational quotes such as:  ""The light always follows the darkness.""  ""If you can take it, you can make it.""  ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory.""  I think those quotes were really for the audience, to encourage them to keep watching this movie.8. The main Japanese character, Watanabe, was actually wanted for war crimes, so this movie runs with it and makes the Japanese look really evil. Some Japanese citizens are asking their government to not show the movie in Japan.9. It's not a terrible movie, but it is so dramatic that it sometimes backfires.  And you should only go see it if you are interested in watching people survive a series of increasingly dehumanizing events. Otherwise, despite what the title of the movie is, you may finish the movie feeling kind of broken yourself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3Q8DHFCVDSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLTDC9O#wasThisHelpful","R2E3Q8DHFCVDSB","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Annie (2014)""1. Growing up in the 1980's, ""Annie"" was a childhood touchstone for me. So when I heard it was being remade, I was ready to hate. But the filmmakers knew that this version would be compared to the original, so they brilliantly put a stop to that right away. The first 30 seconds of the movie make it obvious that they are not trying to replace the other version. Annie's teacher even calls her ""Annie B"".2. This movie, produced by Will Smith and Jay-Z, is a thoroughly revised and updated version of the 1982 classic that is specifically targeted to a 2014 audience. It is also a commentary on classism, and what it means to be poor, but told in a way that makes it accessible to kids.3. This Annie is no starry-eyed, cheerful orphan. She is a street-wise foster kid always on the hustle. Quvenzhane Wallis plays Annie. After her blistering, preternatural performance in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", I was afraid she would turn into one of those child actors that would never star in anything again. I'm glad to see her in this role - she turns Annie into a real person.4. Let me just get this out of the way. As far as bitter, alcoholic orphanage supervisors go, Carol Burnett is the only Agatha Hannigan.However.As far as bitter, alcoholic foster moms go, Cameron Diaz does great as Colleen Hannigan. Diaz doesn't even attempt to fill Burnett's shoes (even Hannigan's first name is different). Diaz takes what's in the script and makes her own character with it.5. Jamie Foxx does well with the Daddy Warbucks character - but here his name is William Stacks (Get it? Bill Stacks?). He's a cell phone mogul running for mayor that wants to use Annie to win the sympathy vote. Besides being the rich guy, Stacks is also the symbol of corporate America. As one of his employees says, ""Most people are afraid of the government watching them. They should be worried about cell phone companies instead.""6. Many of the original songs are in this movie, but they have also been revised and updated. ""Tomorrow"" is no longer a bursting, irrepressible ode to optimism, but a bittersweet attempt by a defeated girl to keep herself going. Similarly, ""Little Girls"" is no longer a booze-addled, comedic complaint, but a cynical rock anthem about the unfairness of life.7. While this is a family movie, there is an adult, sarcastic, self-mocking vibe to it that goes completely over kids' heads and is aimed squarely at the generation of adults who grew up with the original version. There are inside cultural jokes and cameos that made the adults in the theater laugh, while the kids seemed kind of puzzled. And there are a few hidden references to the original movie scattered in here and there, for the hardcore fans.8. It is very rare to have a wide-release family movie where the main character is a black girl, and where the most powerful man in New York City is also black (of course, the casual racism of the 1982 version is gone, too). But the movie seems content with letting that speak for itself - race isn't really a thing here. It's a quietly integrated, fully interracial movie, that doesn't call attention to that fact.9. This is still ""Annie"", so it has sentimental moments and messages that don't quite mesh with the underlying social commentary. But all in all, this is a surprisingly sharp, relevant, cool musical with some brilliant and wicked moments. It's trying to attract a new generation of fans without dismissing the original. The two versions of ""Annie"" are not competing, but complementary. It's OK to like both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SH9NZ0XBIT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FZ2F4#wasThisHelpful","R13SH9NZ0XBIT","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies""1. This is the third movie in the series of one children's book.2. Being the sixth movie about Middle-Earth, it's not really worth describing the plot. You know what's going on, or you don't. But for those that don't know the story, and think this movie is really all about the dragon, you will be disappointed. If you notice, Smaug isn't even in the title of this film.3. Being the last movie, everything is bigger in this one. The epic-ness is more epic. The melodrama is more melodramatic, and the corny humor is even cornier.4. Orlando Bloom has either become almost completely computer generated, or has had way too much plastic surgery done. He doesn't look real. He actually looks like a plastic action figure.5. Some of the battle scenes (and there are quite a few of them) are great, and almost awe-inspiring. Some of them look like amateur rip-offs of ""300"". And speaking of battle scenes, the orcs like to proclaim that ""the fields will run with blood"". But the only blood in the movie come from a few light scratches on cheeks. Nobody bleeds on the battlefield, even if their heads are cut off.6. I thought I was on acid when I was watching Galadriel banish Sauron.7. Note to self: If I want to win a war, I need to have the giant bear ride the giant eagles at the beginning of the battle, not the end.8. For better or worse, Peter Jackson has re-invented Middle Earth, and strayed pretty far from the original book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but people will forever think this was Tolkien's vision, when it was more Jackson's.9. There's enough fan service in this movie that Middle-Earth addicts will probably proclaim this is the Best Movie Of The Year. But there are enough problems with it that haters will be justified in hating it even more. Most of the rest of us will just shrug our shoulders and say, ""Meh. It was fine.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW3EJGLFBF6OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R3DODWI#wasThisHelpful","RW3EJGLFBF6OW","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Under the Skin1. This is surely the strangest, most beautifully baffling film of 2014. It's visually poetic, existentially stunning, and impossible to describe.  I think it's brilliant and scary, though I don't know why. This is art that cuts below conscious thought and messes around inside you on the human level. It either speaks to you, or it doesn't; it has nothing to do with your intelligence.2. It kind of has a plot. Scarlett Johansson plays a woman with the personality of an insect who wanders around Scotland, picking up solo men, and... makes things happen to them.3. The movie is so abstract that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. I think it's supposed to be about some kind of inter-dimensional vampire alien thing. But this is not an action science fiction movie.4. The movie could also be about a primitive force of nature that both distracts and consumes humanity.5. Or it could be about the predatory nature of humans, and how men differ from women in what they're after.6. There's relatively little dialogue in the movie - most of it is visual.  None of the characters even have names. Most of the characters were played by non-actors, and when they do talk, it was mostly unscripted.7. The scene with Adam Pearson, the guy with neurofibromatosis in real life, stops you cold with its depiction of the unutterable, lonely intimacy of human relations.8. This is a complete, perfect package of a film. From the surreal acting to the entrancing visuals, and the hauntingly unnerving soundtrack, you either take the whole thing or reject the whole thing.9. I'm still not sure if the ending is happy or sad. Or if it even matters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZB7R4TMTFMTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0MM4AM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZB7R4TMTFMTU","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Into the Storm""  (USA, 2014)1. This movie has some pretty spectacular storm effects. It's probably the best disaster porn I've ever seen.2. The rest of the movie is one of the worst films of 2014.  And if you combine these two things together, you get absolute magic.3. For some reason, they decided to make this a ""found footage"" film. All the characters run around filming everything. It's kind of like ""Paranormal Activity"", but they see tornadoes instead of ghosts.4. There are three separate mini-plots in the film, and the movie jumps from camera to camera, plot to plot. And sometimes it turns into a regular movie. But you can't tell really when that is, because all the cameras in the town are the same quality, whether they are high-end professional equipment, or cell phones.5. I love the scene when the dad is standing in torrential winds and rain, looking in horror at something, but his hair and clothes are perfectly dry and still, like there was one spot of clear weather right above his head.6. I also love the emotional, melodramatic scene where two teenagers are about to die so they film a goodbye to their parents. The girl tells her parents that she's dying next to a sweet boy that she hardly knows, ""so it's kind of OK"". And the boy tells his brother to stay awesome. And then the boy and girl hug each other, and I noticed that neither one of them is holding a camera.7. But my favorite scene is about the amateur storm chaser. He's terrified of bad weather, and keeps wanting to go home. But when he sees a tornado made of fire, he grabs the camera and basically runs right into it.8. Oh man, I can't even talk about the white-trash rednecks.9. The script is clumsy, the dialogue is awkward and sometimes nonsensical. The ""suspense"" is built on laughable situations. And the only real purpose of the movie is to watch the destruction of a town that's so small it has one high school, but also has a big airport.So what I'm saying is, this is a pretty great bad movie. I'm gonna be buying this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8OBCVMWXHRVQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJANW40#wasThisHelpful","R8OBCVMWXHRVQ","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Exodus: Gods and Kings1. This is a 3-hour epic that is kind of based on the famous Bible story of Moses rescuing the Jews after 430 years of slavery in Egypt. It takes the broad plot outline from the Bible, but makes its own story. To put it another way, I heard two people complaining behind me that it wasn't ""historically accurate"".2. Christian Bale plays Moses, adopted son of the Pharaoh. He is an atheist, and serves as a general in the Egyptian army with the Pharaoh's real son, Ramses (who was actually born 300 years after the events of the movie, but whatever). Moses helps to keep the Jewish slaves in line. But when he finds out he is actually Jewish, his mind is blown. He does some things that get him exiled, so he goes off and gets married and has a son.3. About halfway through the movie, Moses gets hit on the head with a rock and then sees God. After that, the personality of Moses completely transforms; you could interpret this new Moses as either a man who has found faith, or a religious extremist with possible schizophrenia.4. The movie rides a very thin line on the God topic. If you want to believe that the story is basically true, then you are free to believe that. But if you don't think the story is actual history, you are free to believe that, too. The movie provides a possible interpretation of the plagues as a chain-reaction of rare natural disasters that had nothing to do with God, but that fed Moses' religious mania.5.  Most of the famous plagues appear in the movie, but they go by very quickly. However, we do get a bonus scene of gigantic cannibal crocodiles. And I must admit, the climax at the Red Sea was pretty epic.6.  For a movie about God's wrath, there sure was a lot of politics, intrigue, and talking in it.7. The God of this movie is very much the God of the Old Testament. He is inscrutable, sadistic, bloodthirsty, and vengeful. God is definitely not Love in this movie. Ramses even directly asks Moses the Big Question: if your god is real, is such a god worthy of worship?8. The casting of the movie is just... confusing. It's about people in the Middle East, but all the main characters are white with a vague British/American accent. Sigourney Weaver is in the movie, but she has about six lines. And whoever thought of hiring John Turturro to play the pharaoh, well, there must be a special strain of weed for that.9. This is a very conflicted movie. And I'm conflicted about it. Visually it's spectacular. There are some amazing set pieces, fascinating scenes, and some great acting. But it does too much. It's a look at society, revolution, and the difference between leadership and slave-driver. Religiously, it tries so hard to include all perspectives that it ends up feeling hollow.The movie can't commit to anything, so it ends up meaning nothing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F49IDNIFIJPT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWUJMV0#wasThisHelpful","R1F49IDNIFIJPT","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Theory of Everything""1. This piece of obvious Oscar-bait is about the life of famous physicist Stephen Hawking. And I feel really conflicted about it.2. There are some great individual things about this movie - some terrific cinematic sequences and emotional moments. The soundtrack is lush and beautiful.3. But it's mostly a love story. A fake one.4.  The movie tries to give the audience a taste of what Hawking did to physics. But it ends up feeling very vague, and if you don't already know his theories, then you just end up with the idea that he was really smart. You don't understand how revolutionary he actually was.5. It's also a ""greatest moments"" look at the development of his motor-neuron disease, and how he went from a healthy 21-year-old to the famously wheelbound man with a wrecked body and robotic voice.6. The rest of the movie is a tired, by-the-numbers romance about a woman who stands by her man and together they overcome all odds. A lot of the relationship depicted in the movie never happened in real life, including how it began and ended. Not even close. The film just invents a new relationship for them.7.  I admit, I couldn't help but spend part of the movie trying to figure out which actors played which characters in the ""Harry Potter"" movies. It was kind of distracting.8.  Eddie Redmayne (who isn't very well known in America) plays Hawking. It's easily the best acting I've seen in 2014. The way he slowly contorts his body as the disease progresses is one of the best physical performances I've ever seen in my life. It should be illegal for him not to win some acting awards. He almost single-handedly makes the movie worth seeing.9.  As a showcase for some cinematography and acting, the movie is great. As an inspirational love story, this movie is melodramatic and saccharine. You know, the usual.As a scientific biography, this movie is terrible, and almost insulting.If you watch this movie, make sure you know what you're getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2T2IAFYO126/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFSHCR0#wasThisHelpful","R1E2T2IAFYO126","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Birdman1. I admit I almost skipped this movie, because I couldn't figure out from the marketing what I was supposed to be going to see. So the biggest reason I went to see it is because of the director, Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu. I've followed his career ever since Amores Perros.2.  I'm very glad I took the chance with this movie. This is an acidic, melancholy comedy that takes on serious universal themes, while set almost entirely in a Broadway theater.3. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a has-been Hollywood actor who, in a kind of pathetic attempt to make himself relevant again, decides to create a Broadway show. As the show gets closer to opening night, his mental stability deteriorates, and everything starts coming unhinged. People around him are forced to face their own insecurities and fears.4. The movie is very cleverly edited so that it seems like most of it is filmed in one long, continuous camera shot.5. While the entire cast is great, this might be Michael Keaton's best performance ever. He plays Riggan with just the right mixture of exhaustion, hope, cynicism and defeat.6. There is a dash of magical realism that pops up from time to time, which may confuse some audience members. And I'm still not sure what to do with the ending.7.  One of the themes of the movie is coming to the realization that in the grand scheme of things, you don't matter very much, if at all. Even if you do achieve some fame in this world, it's temporary and pointless anyway.8.  Another theme of the movie is the eternal battle about creativity. Specifically, it illustrates the way that the Hollywood movie culture and the New York theater culture resent each other for having differing ideas about art and importance and relevance.9. This is a very quirky, dark-hearted comedy that takes stabs all kinds of people. celebrities, and situations. And it's exactly that sharpness, as it slices up the characters, that lets the audience see that inside, we're all pretty much the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y0BBCCY5ICKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLG8LFY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y0BBCCY5ICKD","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Enemy1. This is one of the only films in my life that actually gave me nightmares. And it's technically not even a horror movie.2. It's about a neurotic, semi-depressed college professor, stuck in a routine life. When he sees a movie with an actor that looks just like him, he becomes obsessed with meeting his double.3. From there the movie veers off into very surreal territory, and begins to fold over itself in unexpected and confusing ways.4. Jake Gyllenhaal plays both the teacher and the actor. While they look identical, you can technically tell them apart because one of them wears a wedding ring. However, Gyllenhaal's two performances are so strong that he actually seems to be two actors. The two characters are so well delineated that you can tell just from Gyllenhall's body language and speech patterns which person he is.5. There is a real, masterful sense of creeping dread and menace that builds relentlessly to the final scene.6. Oh, and about that final scene. I don't care how good you are at predicting movies - you will not see this ending coming. And then either your soul will jump in frustrated horror, or you will start the movie over again. Or both.7. There are a lot of really short scenes that last only a few seconds - or short segments of longer scenes - that provide some clues as to what's really going on. You won't realize their significance the first time you watch the movie.8. The opening epigraph of the film is a quote from the novel on which the movie is based: ""Chaos is order yet undefined"". It not only sets the tone for the film, but provides the key for at least one of the film's possible meanings.9. Part thriller, part allegory, part existential nightmare, this is perhaps the most brilliant and inscrutable movie of 2014.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19HQ33Q3DKKYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKM5MIA#wasThisHelpful","R19HQ33Q3DKKYW","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Whiplash"" (USA, 2014)1. If I say this movie is about a kid who wants to be a famous drummer, it will probably make you think it's one of those musical prodigy movies, about overcoming obstacles to achieve your dreams. But you would be wrong. This movie is actually more like a psychological battle in Thunderdome.2. It's about a 19-year-old music conservatory student named Andrew who desperately wants to become a member of a studio jazz orchestra conducted by the legendary and fearsome instructor Terence Fletcher. Fletcher sees some talent in Andrew, and gives him a shot as a drum alternate.3. Once Andrew joins the band, however, he witnesses the cruel and demoralizing abuse that Fletcher hurls at his students when they don't do what he wants. Not wanting to lose his chance at greatness, Andrew practices to the limits of his endurance - and gets pushed to a breaking point.4. Miles Teller plays Andrew and J.K. Simmons plays Fletcher. There are other people in the movie, but you hardly notice them. The performances of Teller and Simmons are fierce and mesmerizing - everybody else seems slightly out of focus5. Jazz music plays almost constantly throughout the film. You don't have to like jazz to like the movie - but it helps.6. Speaking of jazz, I know music purists have problems with the film (like the fact that the famous Charlie Parker story the characters tell never actually happened that way). I respect that. But really, jazz is the setting of the film, not the point.7. The movie is refreshing in the way it illustrates the passion and sacrifice necessary to follow your dreams. It shows the emptiness of a culture where everybody is a winner. But it also makes you think about the line where you give up.8. The movie is also about teaching, and how instructors push their students to achieve things they didn't think they could. But it also makes you think about the line where they push too hard.9. ""Whiplash"" may seem like a weird title for a movie about student jazz musicians. But it's actually very fitting - the story slams your opinions and emotions around like a drumstick. By the end of the film, you may actually have psychological whiplash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IYXWLUKBWSNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRX8UBG#wasThisHelpful","R2IYXWLUKBWSNB","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Horns1. The 2010 book on which the movie is based is an original surreal fantasy with commentary on topics such as psychology, love, and God. But this movie adaptation of the novel is one of the biggest disappointments of 2014.2. Any story about a guy that turns into a demon after his girlfriend is raped and murdered needs to be handled delicately. And I think there needs to be a rule that if you don't understand a book, you can't make a movie about it. In which case, this movie would never have been made.3. The screenplay is by the relatively unknown playwright and TV scriptwriter Keith Bunin. The movie was directed by Alexandre Aja, a horror director best known for ""High Tension"" and the 2006 remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Oh, and, uh, ""Piranha 3D"".4. Whatever subtlety exists in the novel was completely lost on Bunin and Aja. They changed a lot of the plot, and they misinterpreted key themes. In short, they turned this story into a silly mess. They simplified everything so much that the movie doesn't even really make sense.5.  In order to keep the story moving forward, characters have to suddenly change motives with no justification, Random facts and events need to keep dropping into the script, usually for no apparent reason.6. Daniel Radcliffe (who left Harry Potter behind a long time ago) stars as Ig Perrish, a guy that wakes up from a drunken bender to find horns growing out of his head. Any problems with the movie are not Radcliffe's fault. He does a great job, considering the terrible script he was handed.7.  Most of the rest of the acting in the movie is not good. But again, that's not because they are bad actors, but because they were forced to turn a relatively sophisticated dark fantasy into a zany horror-comedy-romance-superhero-psycho-thriller.8.  Some of the make-up and special effects were nicely done. Some were TV-movie quality.9.  If you haven't read the novel, you might consider this to be a screwy supernatural comedy-drama that doesn't quite go where it needs to. But if you have read the book, you will know that the movie doesn't have a clue as to what it's supposed to be doing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CD55F0RXJW6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1WG6MS#wasThisHelpful","R1CD55F0RXJW6Y","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Only Lovers Left Alive""1. This movie was written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. When you see Jarmusch's name on a film, you know right away that nothing will ever happen in it.2. This movie is about two vampires that wander around, drive around, stare at things, talk, and do nothing. Random things slowly happen. And then the movie ends.3. It's almost worth watching just to see the performances of Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston, the two ancient emo hipster vampires that are trying not to get bored with life. Or death, whatever.4. Hiddleston plays Adam, a semi-suicidal musician who hates humans, so he lives in Detroit and releases music anonymously. Swinton plays Eve, who lives in Tangier, and finds joy in reading books and dancing. Together, they apparently knew every famous artistic person in Western history.5. There is a weird little subplot about the Christopher Marlowe/William Shakespeare conspiracy.6. There's also a weird recurring conversation about quantum theory, as well as Nikola Tesla. This just shows how embarrassingly little Jarmusch knows about science.7. Visually, the movie is lush and sumptuous; it showcases the beauty of decay and the decay of beauty. Sonically, the movie is also luxuriously grungy. The soundtrack is a perfect match for the visual style.8. Jarmusch almost seems to be making a point about humanity's self-destructive nature, or maybe the inevitable disintegration of everything. But Jarmusch fans don't need to worry; he stops himself from actually saying anything deep.9. Jarmusch movies always have a tone that is more important than things like plot or character development. If you can get into that groove, then his movies are enjoyable. But you can't appreciate his vibe, then his movies swing from boring to annoying. This is possibly Jarmusch's best film - or his least annoying one, depending on your perspective.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335GJZSJ8GOJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE7PC66#wasThisHelpful","R335GJZSJ8GOJK","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Big Hero 6""1. This is the most pleasant surprise I've seen at the movies in 2014. From the cutesy trailer and the stupid title, it's like Disney doesn't want anybody to know what the movie really is.2. It's about a 14-year-old genius named Hiro Hamada who lives in the city of San Fransokyo. He's out of high school, bored, and thinks college is for nerds. He spends his time in the city's battle robot underground. Hiro's older brother, Tadashi, is a robotics engineering student who has invented a new kind of robot named Baymax that specializes in health care.3. After some bad things happen, Hiro reluctantly teams up with Baymax and Tadashi's friends to stop someone from stealing Hiro's own invention of swarming microbots. But that quest opens up bigger problems.4. There are themes of death and loneliness in the film that aren't obvious from the way the movie is marketed. I was more emotionally invested in the movie than I expected to be.5. The filmmakers consulted about six universities and robotics research labs for help on this movie. I'm pretty sure this is the only animated film I've ever seen that uses the term ""tungsten carbide"".6. The character of Baymax was inspired by actual research in a new field called ""soft robotics"". And the swarming microbots in the film are also based on real research and inventions. Of course, the movie takes those ideas and then leaves reality behind.7. The animation in this film is so incredibly detailed that some scenes look almost like real life. The 3D is also worth the extra price, if you like that sort of thing.8. The movie unabashedly promotes science, technology, engineering, and education. It makes the point that some problems are too tough to solve through brute force; sometimes you have to think your way to a solution.9. If you are expecting an ""aww, that's cute and funny"" superhero movie, then you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun movie for the family, but it's also a real movie with real issues, emotions, and problems. It's the most thoughtfully fun animated film I've seen in a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O68TJRGGJY79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4ZC57I#wasThisHelpful","R2O68TJRGGJY79","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about Escape From Tomorrow1. This is a weird little surreal comedy psychological thriller that became an instant cult classic. Its about a familys vacation at Disney World, and how sinister things begin to happen to the father.2. Director Randy Moore knew he wouldn't get permission to actually film in Disney World, because Disney would never allow something like this to get made. So Moore did the next best thing - he snuck cameras into Disney World and filmed it anyway.3. In one interpretation, its about how the happiest place on Earth triggers a psychosexual breakdown of the dad while he follows a couple of underage girls through the rides.4. In another interpretation, the dad catches a bizarre form of cat flu and hallucinates while hes dying and the park covers it up.5. Or maybe its about how the dad stumbles onto the fact that the princess characters in the park are high-priced hookers, there is a secret robot base underneath Epcot Center, and his grade-school daughter almost becomes a sex slave.6. Whichever interpretation you go with, its not a positive portrayal of Disney. The film was made in secret guerrilla-style at Disney World without their permission or approval.7. There are long, rather boring parts of the film. Half of it is basically just the family wandering around the theme park and going on rides.8. But it does slowly build the paranoia, and there are several surreal and chilling moments that pretty much guarantee you wont look at Disney the same way ever again. In some ways, this movie is similar to weird daydreams I would have when I was at the park. It's just too happy to be real. Or healthy.9. Everybody assumed that Disney would sue the hell out of the filmmakers, but the director made sure to never actually violate any copyrights. Disney eventually decided to just keep quiet about it, so that it didn't get any more publicity than it already had.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32XQGX4ZCJVCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HRJVHOU#wasThisHelpful","R32XQGX4ZCJVCP","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about Inside Llewyn Davis (USA, 2013)1. Joel and Ethan Coen have been making movies for 30 years. This movie proves they still have the ability to come up with compelling quirky comedies full of even quirkier characters.2. This movie shows a week in the life of a folk singer, Llewyn Davis, in 1961 New York.Its based loosely on a real folk singer named Dave Van Ronk.3. Llewyn is a talended singer-songwriter, but his musical career has just never caught on. Hes trying to decide whether he should keep trying.4. Llewyn has a rather miserable life. He doesnt have a place to live, he just couch surfs through the city, staying with whatever friend isnt currently mad at him.5. As the movie unfolds, we see that his problems come from a mixture of bad luck and bad decisions. Mostly the latter.6. While this is a comedy, its a melancholy comedy with a kind of dark heart. Its about coming to the realization that nobody cares about your dreams but you.7. Justin Timberlake plays a small role as Llewyns friend. And Coen staple actor John Goodman deserves Best Supporting Actor of the Year with his portrayal of a cranky jazz musician.8. Characters sing a lot of folk songs in this movie. Im not a big fan of folk songs.9. Theres a subplot about Llewyns relationship with a cat. That subplot could be a metaphorical representation of the entire movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UNS3HSKFKNXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMV8L1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1UNS3HSKFKNXH","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about Frozen (USA, 2013)1. Kind of based on the fairy tale The Snow Queen, this Disney film is a funny, charming throwback to their classic musicals of decades ago.2. I can already see it being adapted into a Broadway musical.3. As a technical accomplishment, this movie is a masterpiece.4. The art direction is perhaps the most gorgeous of the year, and the animation is stunningly realized and detailed. The 3D effects are wonderful.5. The number Let it Go is on my Top 10 movie scenes of the year.6. Its a good thing the movie is so much fun to watch, because the story is kind of thin.7. Its about a princess that somehow has magical ice powers. She gets upset and accidentally freezes the entire kingdom. Her sister tries to talk her down.8. Since it is a Disney musical, it is partly about True Love.9. Thankfully, the movie does make the point that True Love doesnt spring into your heart out of nowhere. The main character, Anna, keeps getting mocked for wanting to marry the prince she just met. Its about time we started teaching kids that lesson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9BKYZ30QAV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G5G7EXY#wasThisHelpful","R1W9BKYZ30QAV8","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about New Years Evil (USA, 1980)1. This little cult film is one of those good bad films.2. Its about how radio and televisions hottest Los Angeles rock hostess Blaze throws a New Years Eve punk rock party and invites callers to vote on the best New Wave rock song.3. The first caller proposes that the best New Wave song is We Dont Need No Education.4. The next caller identifies himself as Mr. Evil and tells Blaze that he is going to kill someone each time an American time zone hits midnight.5. The New Years Eve concert is full of fake teenagers in a fake mosh pit to a band called Shadow. They dance like zombies, so I guess that means they are full of fake drugs.6. Across town, in an insane asylum, the inmates are watching the concert and dancing like they have Downs Syndrome.7. My favorite murder in the movie is when Mr. Evil suffocates a gal with a bag of weed.8. Since the psychopath is only trying to kill one person an hour, its not the most suspenseful slasher flick ever made.9. I think the movie was trying to make a statement that when women work, it effectively emasculates their husbands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWK6BWOJJIKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BJTXJG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWK6BWOJJIKV","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Movie The Quiet Ones (United Kingdom, 2014)1.For a horror movie, The Quiet Ones is well-named.2. Its set at Oxford University in 1974. A professor has custody of an insane young woman who thinks shes possessed. The professor hires three young assistants to help him with experiments to cure her.3. The professor believes that the girl isnt really possessed, but does have telekinetic powers that she doesnt understand or know how to control. His experiments are basically psychological and physical torture techniques that will upset the girl enough to let out her demon so they can discover whats really going on.4. As the movie progresses, and the girl cant get her demon to come out, the young assistants begin to suspect that maybe the whole thing is a hoax, or that the professor is obsessed with the girl.5. The movie gets points for actually talking about real science and hypotheses, and how experiments can be contaminated. Its also cool to watch the 1970s setting and scientific technology.6. The actual story is pretty interesting. But its not very scary; its more of a drama. So the director had to put in a few stupid jump scares just to make something happen.7. The movie does a good job of building a creepy, moody drama where you arent sure exactly what the deal is. After awhile, the possessed girl seems less threatening than the professor in charge of her.8. Unfortunately, the movie doesnt know how to end - the solution just comes out of nowhere to tie things up in a sudden and shocking way. It basically makes the rest of the movie pointless. I don't really even understand what happened.9. As a psychological drama, this is a pretty interesting, stylish story. But as a horror movie, its at first kind of boring and then rather ridiculous.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5B7H4RCSFXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOBUO42#wasThisHelpful","R2E5B7H4RCSFXK","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie The Rover1. This bleak, beautiful, existential meditation proves once again that nobody does post-apocalyptic dystopias like the Australians.2. At first glance, this seems to be like a Mad Max movie. But it definitely isn't. This is a more thoughtful and realistic vision of life after what they call ""the collapse"".3. Guy Pearce stars as Eric, a mysterious guy that really only cares about his car. When it gets stolen, Eric goes on a quest to get it back.4. Robert Pattinson (yes, Edward from ""Twilight"") stars as Rey, the wounded brother of one the car thieves. He's slow in the head, and very needy. He half-willingly joins up with Eric to track down the car and his brother.5. This is one of those movies that really doesn't have any good guys. Everyone is desperate and trying just to survive.6. Pattinson continues to leave his days as a sparkly vampire pedophile behind him. He gives one of the best acting performances I've seen all year. He is almost unrecognizable in his portrayal of the pathetic, simple man that can't quite put all the pieces together.7.  This isn't really an action film, although it does have some action scenes.8. There is a strong theme running through the movie about the meaninglessness of everything. People can do what they want, and it doesn't really matter to anybody except themselves.9. This is not a feel-good movie. It's an absorbing, stylish drama about the human condition in extreme circumstances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZLKCMNVDQGGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7DIK5A#wasThisHelpful","RZLKCMNVDQGGP","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Shivers [aka They Came From Within]1. Made in 1975, this was David Cronenberg's first film. As one of the godfathers of the ""body horror"" film genre, this film shows his first attempt at the topic of the human body as a frightening, strange, and grotesque process of destruction.2. It's a strange little movie about rich, bland people living in an exclusive apartment complex on an island. A crazy doctor wants to get people to stop acting so boring and rationally. So he puts a creature in a girl that is designed to make her want to have sex, and then reproduce and spread to others like an STD. The parasite spreads to people in the apartment complex, and they all start trying to have sex with other people - willingly or not.3. Now that I think about it, I think this is the only movie I've ever seen about sex zombies.4. On one hand, this movie is a pretty bad exploitation film. The acting is amateur, and the script is clunky. The concept is ludicrously impossible. It made me laugh a few times when it wasn't supposed to. The special effects are... not very special.5. On the other hand, this is a surprisingly original idea, especially for 1975. If you can get past the story, and pay attention to what Cronenberg is actually trying to say, it packs a nice little punch. Cronenberg said that the movie should be viewed ""from the point of view of the disease"".6. All sexual contact is treated the same in this movie. Straight or gay, through incest or pedophilia, it's all depicted as grotesque and threatening.7. The movie was pretty controversial for its time. Mixing sex and violence and monsters was not something that the general public was ready for.8. The movie is also worth seeing just for the groovy 1970's fashion and style.9. While not Cronenberg's best film, it's still very valuable for its ideas and as a way to see the evolution of his style and topics in later films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2FN0ENSOU96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305090343#wasThisHelpful","R2X2FN0ENSOU96","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""ABC's of Death"" (2013)1. This is perhaps the most unique movie of 2013.2. It's an interesting setup. 26 directors from around the world were given a letter of the alphabet. They picked a word starting with that letter, and then made a short film about that word that incorporates death. They were given complete artistic freedom to make whatever they wanted.3. The movie spans cultures, times, countries, and topics. Some are more conventional, and some are pretty extremely out there. Some are serious, some are funny.4. The movie has been criticized for being too uneven. I'm not sure that's a legitimate criticism. We have 26 different movies by 26 different directors. Each one has its own style and technique. Now having said that, some films were definitely better than others.5. There are some minor masterpieces, absolute gems, sitting in this infernal alphabet. Some are burned into my mind, whether I want them there or not.6. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but there seems to be a thread involving toilets, poop, or farts weaving its way through the films.7. There were more giant penises than I expected.8. If there was an award for ""weirdest film"" in this anthology, it would definitely go to Japan. Of course. No other country is quite in touch with their inner freakiness as them.I don't recommend this to most people - it's pretty violent, bizarre, and it goes to bad places that no mainstream film would ever consider.

"Nine Things About the Movie ""ABC's of Death 2"" (2014)1. This is the sequel to the almost instant cult classic ""ABC's of Death"" in 2013..2. But it's not really a sequel, it's a continuation. Using the exact same setup as the first film, 26 directors from around the world were given a letter of the alphabet. They picked a word starting with that letter, and then made a short film about that word that incorporates death. They were given complete artistic freedom to make whatever they wanted.3. Like the first one, this movie presents a wide variety of topics, settings and techniques. We go from Europe to Israel to Africa to secluded beaches in the middle of nowhere. Since the films last about 4 minutes each, if you don't like one, just wait.4. On the whole, the films are more solid than the first one, and the quality is more consistent. There aren't as many dumb films in this installment. Then again, there aren't as many jaw-dropping, confrontational WTF moments, either.5. Some of the films are jokes, some are serious. Some are just plain strange. Like the first film, there is kind of a meta-game in the movie: you can try to guess what the word the director picked.6. I'm pretty sure there was only one giant penis in this movie. There was a large penis on the end of a tentacle in the film about torture porn, but I don't think it counts as 'giant'.7. There were a lot of head wounds and decapitations in this movie.8. There are a few that make some strong social statements about society, religion, and culture. Oh, and the award for weirdest movie goes to Japan. Again. Of course.9. Like the first film this is a rapid-fire, global investigation of the ways people encounter their ends. There are some definite minor masterpieces here. It is a worthy successor to the first, and is worth watching for those that have... adventurous tastes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SYINYOOO6P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O40EEE0#wasThisHelpful","R24SYINYOOO6P3","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""John Wick"" (USA, 2014)1. This is probably the best action movie of 2014. It's certainly the movie with the highest body count of 2014.2. It's directed by two guys who, before they made this movie together, were mostly stunt coordinators and stunt doubles for people like Brad Pitt, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Keanu Reeves.3. Speaking of Keanu Reeves, he's great in this. You see, there is a very specific type of movie in which Keanu excels - action flicks where he moves around a lot and hardly talks. This had to be his dream role.4. Reeves plays John Wick, a depressed nobody dealing with the loss of his wife. When a few things go wrong, we find out that John isn't exactly a nobody. In fact, he has quite a reputation as an assassin for the Russian mafia.5. What's fascinating about this film is that this is no street-level gang war stuff. These are all super rich, civilized professionals that move in their own exclusive circles. There are codes to be honored, and rules to be followed.6. There are some truly great action sequences in the movie. These scenes were clearly inspired by John Woo's Chinese gun-fu classics like ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"".7. The movie has a sleazy, industrial rock soundtrack which is a great counterpoint to the opulent, cultured environment that the characters live in.8. Of course, being firmly in the action genre, it also follows those conventions, like bad guys that line up to take on the good guy one by one. And villains that like to tie the good guy up in a chair and give a speech, instead of just killing him. But people do run out of bullets sometimes, so that's a refreshing change.9. The movie has a wry sense of humor, letting us know that it knows what it is. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and doesn't try to be anything other than a revenge flick that kicks ass. If that's what you're looking for, then you just found it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UCWQ4YRUF1YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV3VGP0#wasThisHelpful","R1UCWQ4YRUF1YH","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Ouija"" (USA, 2014)1. This is just another lazy, uninspired jump flick. In fact, I finished seeing it 30 minutes ago, but I have to hurry up and write these Nine Things because I'm already starting to forget it.2. It's painfully obvious how this movie was made: The producers got together and said, ""We need to get some Halloween dollars from the kids. Let's make a movie about that toy, the Ouija board. It hasn't been the subject of a major Hollywood movie since`Witchboard' back in `86, so kids today will think it's fresh. Who has the rights to the Ouija board now? Hasbro? The `Transformers' people? Ok, somebody call them.""3. So that's what we have: a generically random script with generically attractive actors who wander around getting scared (and sometimes killed). When the ""plot"" needs to move along, a prop or character will suddenly appear and provide enough information for everyone to move to the next period of wandering around and getting scared.4. If you really need to know the plot, it's about a girl that kills herself after playing with the Ouija board. Her best friends think it's a good idea to find out what happened - by using the same Ouija board.5. This is the first horror movie I've seen where the evil spirit tries to be scary by writing ""Hi friend"" everywhere.6.  I know characters in horror movies are supposed to make stupid decisions. That's part of the genre. But the characters in this movie make so many stupid decisions that I started laughing in the theater.7. News flash, Hollywood: making people jump doesn't mean you made a horror movie. I can suddenly scream `Boo!' in front of a friend to make him jump. That doesn't mean I just made a horror movie. Even if I charge him for it.8. What's funny is that a small scene actually explains how the Ouija board works - the ideomotor effect. The movie debunks itself, and then goes on to pretend it's real anyway.9.There are a few individually interesting scenes that prevent it from being the worst movie of the year, but it's definitely not good. If you're desperate to throw your money at a horror movie, then I'm not going to stop you. Otherwise, go buy your own Ouija board from the toy store, get stoned, and scare yourself instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K2D4DYU83ZCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV60I6K#wasThisHelpful","R1K2D4DYU83ZCF","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Dear White People"" (USA, 2014)1. This brave, thoughtful firecracker of a movie sits right on the nexus of racism, classism, and homophobia. It opens a Pandoras Box of issues and identities in contemporary society.2. It is set in a mostly white, success-obsessed Ivy League college, and follows four black students as they try to figure out what they want from life - and what life wants from them.3. Each of the four main characters are well-played and embody various perspectives of young black culture: Samantha is a hell-raising protester. Troy is the guy that has it all made - as long as he can be a trophy. Coco is the one that wants to be famous. But I think the best performance of the movie comes from Tyler James Williams, who plays Lionel, the black gay guy that cant seem to find his place anywhere.4. The movie is kind of a hodgepodge of scenes at the beginning, as if the film doesnt know quite what it wants to be. But as it moves along, it begins to sort itself out.5. The movie is really funny, both in a satirical way, and in a oh-no-they-didnt way. But its humor with a point, and the movie bites you while youre laughing.6. While the movie is told mostly from the black perspective, it doesnt let anybody off the hook. First-time writer/director Justin Simeon knows his stuff, and is perfectly willing to aim some jabs squarely at the black community.7. The movie as a whole isnt quite as coherent as perhaps it could have been, but that can be forgiven when you consider what Simeon is trying to do. And there are some amazing individual scenes that have both the guts and sensitivity to push the topic way past the level of polite conversation.8. The movie raises more questions than it can possibly answer. It actually doesnt answer any of them, but thats ok. Its function is not to solve the problems, but to make sure we can all admit theyre there. The real brilliance of the movie is not just in its ability to illustrate the frustrating, vague tensions between the races, but in its ability to show the frustrating, vague, symbiosis of the races.9. This is a rare movie that I like more and more each time I think about it. Its not perfect, but its important, and necessary.

"Nine Things About the Movie ""Fury"" (USA, 2014)1. One of the best movies of the year, this is a film that lives up to its name. It is a bitter, gorgeous, violent, post-patriotic, post-moral examination of war.2. Set in Germany during the last month of WWII, its about a group of five men and their Sherman tank. A rookie typist is randomly selected to join the crew when one of the five is killed. He is a gentle and religious man, and the movie follows him as the war warps and destroys everything he has believed about the world and about himself.3. Ive never seen a war movie focused on tank divisions before, so the battle scenes are not the typical run up the hill and shoot the bad guy scenarios we are used to. The fighting is chaotic, suspenseful, and yes, furious.4. Between the war scenes are battles of a different sort, as each member of the crew tries to maintain their sanity, if not their humanity. They each have different defense mechanisms to deal with the horrors of what they experience. Shia LeBeouf is great as the religious one who tries to increase morale by convincing the crew that they are on Gods side.5. Did I say this movie is violent? Well, its violent. Like, really violent. But its war, so its ok, right?6. All five of the main actors totally inhabit their characters - there is not a weak performance anywhere. But Brad Pitt deserves to be nominated Best Actor of the Year for his role as leader of the group. He really straddles the line between hope and despair, and watches over his crew like a tired father who knows more than he can ever talk about.7. The movie drives home the point that idealism is all well and good, but if those ideals are to be maintained, someone has to betray them. The movie deliberately moves past the discussion of good versus evil - such distinctions are for people sitting at home, safe. The soldiers are here simply to kill as many people as they can before they themselves are killed.8. There is a smoldering, smoky rage that drifts through all the characters in the movie. Rage at the enemy, rage at the war, rage at the world and rage at themselves.9. I dont think this is a movie for the patriotic Team America crowd. Its a beautiful, merciless, tour of duty that makes you wonder whether war destroys our humanity, or if war destroys our carefully constructed polite exterior and lets humanity express its natural brutality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QYKECCMUSLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLI95R6#wasThisHelpful","R8QYKECCMUSLY","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About Lilting (United Kingdom, 2014)1. This is a startlingly excellent examination of solitude and connection.2. Set in England, it's about a young man, Richard, an elderly Cambodian woman, Junn, who speaks no English, and the dead man that ties them together.3. Junn's son, Kai, recently put his mother in an assisted living home, because he could no longer care for her. Unbeknownst to her, Kai's best friend, Richard, is actually his long time boyfriend.4. After Kai's sudden death, Richard feels obligated to help out Junn somehow, so he hires a young translator to help the blossoming relationship between Junn and another resident of the home, Allen.5. As the four begin an awkward journey of getting to know each other, they inadvertently open hidden wounds... and pour salt in others.6. The acting in the movie is impeccable. It's a small cast, and relatively unknown - at least here in the US. But I'd been waiting to see Ben Whishaw in something again ever since ""Perfume"" (no, I don't really count ""Skyfall"")7. It's really hard to make a movie work when it's almost all talking around tables. The fact that half of it also needs to be verbally translated - on screen - makes it even worse. But I guess first-time director Hong Khaou didn't know this was supposed to be hard. He took this one all the way home.8. Let's face it - this movie is going to be a hard movie to sell - ""No really, it's good! It's about gays and Asians and old people talking to each other!"" There's no violence or sex or scandal. There's not even an exciting soundtrack. And it's too bad that many people will miss this movie. It's one of the best depictions of the human experience that I've seen in a long time.9. This movie is about the varying levels of isolation that people feel, and the intersections of those levels. It's a quiet, poetic, sad, masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278GD7WHYYS54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUDYFIM#wasThisHelpful","R278GD7WHYYS54","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Gone Girl"" (USA, 2014)1. One of the best movies of 2014, this multi-layered, wickedly brilliant film is a great adaptation of the 2012 novel.2. It was directed by David Fincher. He collaborated with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross again for the smoothly foreboding soundtrack. Fincher has developed a unique cinematic style, and this movie is a showcase of it.3. The heart of the movie is a mystery - a wife disappears from her home on the morning of her anniversary. But not only do we not know who did it, we dont even really know what happened.4. The movie flips back and forth between the husbands perspective and the wifes, slowly unfolding its secrets like a black, poisonous flower.5. Besides the core mystery, the movie is also a commentary on media hype, along with trial by popularity. Nancy Grace probably wishes she could sue somebody for this movie.6. Perhaps more chilling than the mystery is the depiction of what has to be the most dysfunctional marriage in cinematic history.7. The movie is almost 3 hours long, but it doesnt feel like it. The plot is tight - no scene is wasted. The dialogue is snappy and razor-sharp. The acting is awesome, from the main characters all the way down to minor roles.8. Part of the reason the movie works so well is that the author of the book, Gillian Flynn, also wrote the screenplay. Its set in Missouri and feels pretty authentic, probably because the author is from Kansas City.9. A movie about passion, lies, obsession, the death of love, and living with sociopaths, this is a remarkable movie. It also reinforces my belief that I never ever want to get married.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ARS7EQUYJM8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4USLK8#wasThisHelpful","R2ARS7EQUYJM8L","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Dracula Untold (USA, 2014)1. This is yet another version of Dracula, that gets yet another origin story. But it's pretty decent, if you know what you're getting.2.This is not your regular blood-sucking movie. This Dracula takes the semi-historical Vlad the Impaler route. Vlad is a prince who grew up captured and fighting for his enemies, the Turks.3. Now back at home and ruling Transylvania, Vlad is threatened once again by the Turks. In order to save his people, he finds an ancient master vampire living in a Transylvanian mountain.4. Vlad accepts a deal from the vampire, and begins his descent into darkness.5. Vlad/Dracula is not evil in this movie, though he is an antihero. He is a physically and mentally traumatized man that feels a sociopathic duty to protect his people.6. If you look at it right, this version of Dracula can be seen as a metaphor for war veterans with PTSD, trying (and ultimately failing) to keep their inner demons at bay.7. A few characters from the original story make appearances in this movie; Mina appears briefly, and Vlad's gypsy servant Shkelgim is clearly the Renfield character.8. The movie's atmosphere and cinematography are great. There are a few scenes that are absolutely, gorgeously gothic.9. The movie touches on some deeper issues, but never explores them. So in the end, there's nothing about this movie that makes it particularly memorable. You watch it, then you go on with your life. But as an entertaining dark fantasy adventure, this is worth a look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4ROVF7OUN9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OALA8YS#wasThisHelpful","R1S4ROVF7OUN9X","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Annabelle (USA, 2014)1. The doll that opened the 2013 film ""The Conjuring"" gets its own origin story here. This movie starts with the same opening scene as ""The Conjuring"", but then goes back to a year before, so we see how Annabelle came to be so scary.2. It was directed by John Leonetti, who is mostly a cinematographer and TV director. From what I can tell, the only other movies he's directed are ""The Butterfly Effect 2"" in 2006 and ""Mortal Kombat Annihilation"" in 1997.3. The movie doesn't suck, but you need to know what it is. And it's not about Annabelle. The doll is hardly in it. When it is on screen, we usually just see the doll sitting there, not doing anything, while creepy music plays in the background.4.  It's really about how a nice couple get attacked by Satanists, and then move to a different town. The blood of a Satanist falls on the doll, and then weird things start to happen.5. When the nice couple meets a used bookstore owner - who also appears to be the only black person in town - you know this lady is going to have some spiritual knowledge of the situation.6. There are some good moments, and some legitimate jump scares.7. In the end, it's really just another generic haunted-house-demon story, with the doll thrown in as a hook. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I was really disappointed with what Annabelle turned out to be.8. Similar to ""The Conjuring"", when you actually try to make sense of this story, you realize how dumb it is. The ending just doesn't work.9. I love scary doll movies. But this isn't one. Yeah, the doll looks scary, but it doesn't act scary. If you want a good scary doll movie, watch ""Dead Silence"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W20FWXUTFYFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UWVYA#wasThisHelpful","R2W20FWXUTFYFB","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Detention"" (USA, 2011)1. This cult classic independent comedy-horror-science fiction film mixes ""The Breakfast Club"" with ""Mean Girls"" and gore films. It's a postmodern, post-ironic, pop-cultural mash-up about identity and fear of the future.2. The plot (or really, plots) about high school, serial killers, and time travel, is extremely generic and overused. And everybody knows it. So it becomes fresh again. I mean, this movie deconstructs the deconstructors.3. It's kind of about a group of teenagers that wrestle with prom and popularity while a masked slasher from a popular horror movie series kills them. Plus it's about time-travel, body-switching, and aliens.4.  The movie is a whirlwind of cultural references from the past thirty years. You could make a game out of just trying to catch them all - some are pretty obscure, and require you to have lived through the 80's and 90's. Some references are aimed directly at the Twitter generation.5. It was directed by Joseph Kahn, who is already known in bad-movie circles for ""Torque"". But don't worry - he actually insults ""Torque"" in this movie, so it's all good.6. The cast is fairly unknown, except for Josh Hutcherson, who went from this movie to ""The Hunger Games."" Oh, and Dane Cook plays the principal, if anybody still cares about him.7. The fact that the movie makes several direct references to one of my favorite bad movies, the Patrick Swayze classic ""Road House"" (including the famous line about pain), just sealed the deal.8. The pace and editing are very fast, and you hardly have time to catch a joke or a reference before it's on to something else. It might be a little more gory than some people were expecting, too.9. It's really hard to make a movie that knows it's making a movie about generic things, and yet stay fresh and sharp. This is not ""Sharknado"". A meta-meta film with cheap but charming special effects, ""Detention"" hits so many notes that even if a few of them are out of tune, the whole thing is a crazy-ambitious symphony that is endearingly brilliant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LLANUML20FPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081FSMNI#wasThisHelpful","R1LLANUML20FPV","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Tusk (USA, 2014)1. Theres really only one thing you need to know about this movie: Its about a guy that kidnaps another guy and starts turning him into a walrus. If that sounds interesting to you, then you can stop reading this and go watch the movie. If it doesnt sound interesting to you, then you can stop reading this and dont go watch the movie.2. This movie continues director Kevin Smiths evolution away from the films that made him famous - like Clerks and Mallrats. He made his first real break from his past in 2011 with the minor masterpiece Red State, which most people didnt even recognize was a Kevin Smith movie.3. Tusk is the first of a trilogy about weird things that happen in Canada.4. Its based on a prank personal ad of a guy that wanted a roommate, as long as the roommate wore a walrus costume 2 hours a day. Even though the ad wasnt real, Smith saw it and ran with the idea.5. The acting is great. Justin Long owns his role as the smarmy podcaster that gets captured. Michael Parks (from Red State) is totally believable as the traumatized old man doomed to repeat the best and worst moment of his life. He manages to balance the insanity of the character with the wounded little boy that he really is.6. Kevin Smith admits he made this movie while stoned.7. Speaking of stoned, Smith helped to create a Tusk-brand strain of marijuana, which is meant to be enjoyed with the movie.8. There is a special guest star in the movie that I totally didnt recognize until I saw his name in the credits.9. This is a hard-to-categorize film. Its definitely horror, but its definitely comedy. And its most definitely macabre. It doesnt always work perfectly, but it gets under your skin and makes you feel very strange. There are some amazing moments here. And if you look under the surface, you will find a very strong metaphor for the animal vs. human instincts in each of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROEZVWDRSEW0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8M8SWY#wasThisHelpful","ROEZVWDRSEW0H","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Elephant (USA, 2003)1. This is Gus Van Sants minimalist interpretation of a school shooting.  It was the second school shooting movie released after Columbine (that I know of).  As an indie art film, this movie is decent. As a Van Sant film, its below average. As a depiction of the circumstances surrounding a school shooting, this movie is laughably terrible.2. The young actors did a lot of open improvising as they did their scenes. You can tell. Just like theres a certain self-conscious awkwardness to most performances, like they know they are being filmed and are trying not to look at the camera.3.  The movie is told non-linearly, jumping back and forth in time, showing various perspectives of different high school students as they roam the hallways on the last day of their lives.4. The cinematography is kind of impressive, using long camera shots to piece the timeline together like a puzzle. But every frame is so tightly choreographed that it backfires and makes the whole spontaneous feeling of the movie seem really staged and artificial.5. A lot of the movie just shows people walking around, acting kind of bored with life. Even after the shooting starts, people never really seem more than mildly concerned.6. Even though its a big school  there appear to be only 75 people in the whole building. And when they realize they are in mortal danger they run - or rather, walk more quickly - everywhere except for the exits.7.  The propaganda component of this movie is as subtle as the Hitler film the two school shooters are watching the day before they do their thing. The shooters are smart and sensitive - the leader even plays Beethoven on the piano and quotes Shakespeare as he starts his massacre.8.  I understand what Van Sant was trying to do with the shower kiss, but it came across as pandering and doesnt really fit with the rest of the movie.9.  This movie could be shown to teenagers as a way to stop school violence. It makes shooting up a school seem so damn boring and pointless that kids will forget about their violent plans and go do something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOTXPJVRT30K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001EFUFK#wasThisHelpful","R2MOTXPJVRT30K","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Movie Sin City: A Dame to Kill For  [USA, 2014]1. In 2005, the original ""Sin City"" was released. It was a startling, ultra violent, hyper noir film based on the famous graphic novel. It was a masterpiece of atmosphere and style.2.Nine years later, the sequel is released. Directed by the same two guys (Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller) this is more of the exact same thing. Same style, same atmosphere, and some of the same characters as the first film - even one character thats dead.3. As with the original, this movie features several separate stories that intertwine with each other. Characters float in and out of the various stories to kind of tie them all together and make it feel like one big terrible place. You can never be sure who will live and who will die.4. Beneath the gorgeous visuals, the movie is a cynical, depressing look at a place where nobody is happy, everything is corrupt, and even if love isn't really just an act of betrayal, it's doomed anyway.5. One of the stories takes place before the first film. One of them takes place after the first film. The other two stories dont really give any clues as to when they take place.6. You dont technically have to see the first movie before this one, but its a good idea. There are numerous references to the events of the first film, and it wont always be clear whats going on if you havent seen it.7. While there is plenty of violence in this movie, it doesnt feel quite as brutal as the first one.8.  The strength of the movie is also its weakness. Filmed in black and white with splashes of color, it's a mixture of live action, computer animation, and comic-book-style illustration. It's gorgeous, but its the same stuff as in the first one. There are no new innovations in its style or technique, even though the filmmakers had nine years to think about it.9. This movie moves a little more slowly than the first, and the stories arent quite as cool. But its still beautiful, violent, and one of the more original movies of this year. Fans of the first movie should still find plenty to love about this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROFC7DMC6APQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N201WPM#wasThisHelpful","R3ROFC7DMC6APQ","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie The Woman (USA, 2011)1. This upsetting movie is based on Jack Ketchums novel of the same name. If you dont know Jack Ketchum, he writes award-winning, and controversial, horror novels.2. Its the sequel to the movie Offspring. But you dont really need to have seen that movie first. In fact, Offspring was pretty terrible. This movie pretty much stands alone..3. Theres a very early scene in the film during a barbecue, when a boy named Brian witnesses a girl be bullied and abused by other kids. Brian just looks the other way and shoots basketball. Its a very chilling scene, and lets you know right away that something is Not Right.4.  The main plot is about about a feral woman roaming the woods outside of town (if you have seen Offspring, you get the backstory of that). She is found by Chris, Brians father. He is a nice conservative lawyer, and he takes her back home. Then he chains her up in the cellar.5. Chris wants to make the woman he found civilized, which really just means he wants to do terrible things to her. He makes his family witness and participate. He especially wants to make sure his son follows in his footsteps.6. One thing that makes the movie so disturbing is the way we learn about the rest of Chriss family - his wife and two daughters. Nothing outright is told to us, but we slowly figure out that the whole family is disturbed for different reasons.7. The performances of the cast are all solid. Given the sensitive and horrific subject matter, the actors stay true to their characters. This is especially true of Zach Rand, who plays Brian, and Pollyanna McIntosh who plays The Woman.8. The final act of the movie is outrageous and savage. Its a combination of physical violence, psychological terror, and unexpected plot twists that made my jaw drop. Its up to the viewer to decide if it has a happy ending or not.9. The Woman goes into the Hall of Fame of dysfunctional family movies. It is mercilessly misogynistic and yet ferociously feminist. Its not for all audiences. But it is a very effective portrayal of the various cruelties that humans put each other through.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATXI2EP1J72V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SQRYB4#wasThisHelpful","RATXI2EP1J72V","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (USA, 2014)1. This is one of those movies that doesnt suck, but isnt awesome, either. Its fun, but thats about it.2. Its the fifth movie about the turtles, based on the classic comic series. This is a pretty big reboot. Its directed by Jonathan Liebesman, who directed ""Battle: Los Angeles"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"".3. The movie had to go through several script changes. It was originally darker and more gritty, like the original comic series. But since Nickelodeon was helping to make it, they had to change the script to make it more family-friendly.4. The plot is generic and tired; an evil businessman wants to poison a city by releasing a chemical into the air. The four turtles try to stop it (yeah, youve seen this before, only it was Spider-Man that tried to stop it).  Dont try too hard to make sense of the story - its kind of just thrown together.5.  Megan Fox plays April ONeil. In this version,  April is a TV reporter. For some reason, Casey Jones is not in this movie. Oh, and Johnny Knoxville is the voice of Leonardo.6. The turtles themselves are masterpieces of computer generated characters. The special effects in the movie are pretty amazing. And its totally worth watching in 3D.7. Its got a lot of humor - some of it is kinda dumb, some of it is pretty funny. And it has some great action sequences, although they are confusing to watch.8.  It was produced by Michael Bay. It looks and feels like a Michael Bay film. The last 30 minutes is basically ""Transformers"" with turtles instead of robots.9. Hardcore fans of the real, original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will probably think this movie cuts out all the zany grit that made them so awesome. But if you dont really know anything about the turtles, youll have a good time. And then youll go on with your life and probably forget you saw it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNMQ4SCP35VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI1X58S#wasThisHelpful","RWNMQ4SCP35VB","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Movie Guardians of the Galaxy  [USA, 2014]1. This movie is kind of different than how its advertised. The weird thing here, is that the movie is much better than its trailer.2. It was directed by James Gunn, who is mostly known only among cult movie fans for making the goofy horror-comedy ""Slither"" in 2006. If youve seen that movie, then you know the kind of filmmaking style he has.3. The movie opens with a serious, poignant scene of a young boy named Peter facing his mother as shes dying of cancer. Then he gets abducted by aliens. This forms an emotional core for the rest of the movie, which takes place 26 years later.4. The movie gives a surprisingly complete picture of the universe that Peter grows up in, and drops a lot of information (and characters) onto the audience in a pretty short amount of time. It requires some attention from the audience to keep up.5. This is a super smart-ass movie, with quick dialogue and humor that ranges from stupid to smart to just random. Its one of the funniest science fiction movies Ive seen in a long time.6. It also has incredible set design and makeup work. A lot of effort went into the details, making each part of the galaxy seem like its own unique place. Not to mention that this movie has some of the most spectacular space battles since Star Wars. Seriously, its kind of epic.7.  The movie is extremely tongue-in-cheek, but has a couple of somber motifs that weave through the fun. Periodically, issues of family loss and the feelings of being a misfit make some big points.8. There were only a couple of times that I thought the movie got a little heavy-handed about the power of friendship or whatever.9. This is a goofy, sarcastic space opera with big action, as well as a big heart. Its rare that I say this, but there really is something in here for almost everybody.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9CCUWD5XB2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NNM95Y#wasThisHelpful","RN9CCUWD5XB2X","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Lucy"" [France, 2014]1. This movie is equal parts style and stupidity. Its fun to watch, but it requires you to power down your brain. Which is ironic, given the subject of the movie.2. Its based on the urban legend that humans only use 10% of their brains. Of course, thats not true, but it doesnt stop writer-director Luc Besson from using it as the main idea. Besson proves once again that hes better at action than storytelling.3. Its about a young woman named Lucy who accidentally gets forced into being a mule for a synthetic superdrug. When she gets beaten, the drug leaks into her system, it boosts her brainpower, and she becomes magical.4. The movie is pretty interesting and suspenseful for the first half-hour. Then Lucy becomes indestructible, so all the intensity leaks away. Theres nothing to do except watch Scarlett Johansson kick ass. And apparently the smartest, most god-like woman in the world still likes wearing sexy high heels all the time.5. The movie makes less and less sense the farther in you get. There are more plot holes in the script than there are neurons in the brain. But it looks cooler and cooler, so theres that. The ending of the movie is both trippy and ridiculous. Everything comes so unhinged that you have to just roll with it..6. Morgan Freeman, who is excellent at narrating real science shows on TV, had to be wincing as he said some of his lines, which were so stupid that no brain scientist would ever actually even think them.7. Every now and then, the movie tries to sneak in a bit of real philosophy. But its surrounded by so much lunacy that any actual wisdom the movie tries to impart is quickly lost - or contradicted.8. Scarlett Johansson absolutely makes the movie. Shes in almost every scene, and she single-handedly holds the movie together with the force of her own personality.9. I predict this movie will become a new weed classic. Watching it stoned will increase the films trippiness, and make you think the movie is actually deep, which will spark many memorable conversations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JYMMXJ34M6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M25EALG#wasThisHelpful","R12JYMMXJ34M6B","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Wild at Heart"" [USA, 1990]1. David Lynch is my favorite director. Wild at Heart is my least favorite of his films. The movie is still good, but Lynch seems to be forcing things together that dont really mesh..2. This is a darkly comic, punk-rock riff on the American Dream. It is Lynchs funniest film, and has the most quotable lines. Of course, funny is relative with Lynch.3. The core plot is about Lula and Sailor, two young people in love who are on an us against the world road trip. Lulas insane mother sends her boyfriend off to kill Sailor, and then a hitman off to kill her boyfriend.4. There are many references to The Wizard of Oz throughout the movie, except the ruby slippers dont work, and you can break down on the yellow brick road, so you have to wander off into the wild. Or small-town Texas.5. Lula, played by Laura Dern, is the Dorothy character - if Dorothy was raped as a girl and turned into an oversexed chainsmoker that falls for bad boys. Derns real-life mother, Diane Lane, is the Wicked Witch character - if the Wicked Witch was a codependent alcoholic with rage issues.6. Nicolas Cage plays Sailor, a thief and killer who has an Elvis obsession. And Willem Dafoe steals every scene hes in as a creepy sleazoid. A lot of the rest of the cast comes from Lynchs other projects, Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.7. The movie is incredibly over the top. Everyone overacts their characters, but in such a specific way that it forms a complete tapestry.8. There are plenty of Lynchs trademark visual and verbal non-sequiturs that may or may not make sense, and that you may or may not like.9. There are several awesome scenes in this movie, and it did win some awards. I really like it, but I cant help feeling that it is missing some unnameable key ingredient that his other films have.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16D2ELNI8UIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTUWSNO#wasThisHelpful","R16D2ELNI8UIM","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Y Tu Mama Tambien (aka And Your Mother Too)"" [Mexico, 2001]1. This is a rare coming of age film that dares to explore the topic of young adulthood in a deeper way than most such films do. Honestly, when this movie was released in 2001, I dont think America was ready to handle it. Its too truthful.2. It stars Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna as Julio and Tenoch, two horny teenage boys who are best friends. The movie opens with two sex scenes - each of the boys is giving a special goodbye to their girlfriends before the girls take a trip to Italy.3. Once the girls are gone, the boys are bored, so they convince Luisa, the hot wife of Tenochs cousin, to go with them on a road trip to a beach - even though they made the beach up in their head. Their plan is to sleep with Luisa during the trip.4.The boys plan begins to work, and of course both boys start falling in love with Luisa. This opens a much deeper well of sexual angst and tension than they are ready to deal with. Emotions become raw and secrets come out.5. Every now and then a narrator jumps in to give some background information, or to tell the audience things that the characters dont know. Its a weird touch.6. There is some political subtext to the film, which I admit I didnt really understand.7. Bernal and Luna positively shine as the friends who love each other more deeply than even they know. The movie would have been an awkward flop without their emotional commitment to the roles.8. The movie won a number of international awards. Unfortunately, the films explicit sexual content prevented it from getting a wide release in America. Which is stupid. Yeah, there is a lot of sex, and a lot of nudity (male and female) but its not pornographic or gratuitous. It is an integral part of the characters development. Anyway, once again, very few Americans saw this film.9. Even today, there are people who will not be comfortable with this movie because of the open sexuality of the characters, and the way the movie sensitively exposes secret (but common) characteristics of close male friendships. And that's too bad. This is a touching and honest portrayal of young adults figuring out that their emotions are a lot larger and less logical than they expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKJVINHKLF2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B8HC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKJVINHKLF2O","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Platoon [USA, 1986]1. This is Oliver Stone's early classic, a scorching view of the Vietnam war. It was the first of Stone's Vietnam Trilogy (followed by Born on the Fourth of July and Heaven and Earth).2. It is based on Stone's actual experiences as a soldier in Vietnam. This was the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a Vietnam Veteran.3. Stone made this movie as a counterpoint to the very pro-military John Wayne Vietnam movie, The Green Berets.4. It stars a young Charlie Sheen as a rich white boy that drops out of college to volunteer to fight in Vietnam. This is how Stone deliberately points out the class (and racial) disparities of the soldiers who fought in the war.5. Far from depicting the American fighting forces as united against the enemy, the movie shines a light on the various political maneuverings inside a single platoon - which is responsible for more than one incident of ""friendly fire"".6. Besides the fantastic performance of Sheen, Tom Berenger's portrayal of a soldier who has been in country just a little too long is also memorable.7. The point of the movie is to show Sheen's character arc. He slowly learns that the men that survive the longest are the ones that give up their humanity and act on bloodlust and animal instinct.8. The movie is also famous for it's soundtrack, which showcases one of the most epically sorrowful pieces of classical music ever, ""Adagio for Strings"" by Samuel Barber.9. Even now, almost 30 years after it was made, this movie remains one of the defining accounts of the Vietnam War. It's fascinating, tragic, and important.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UPQ013V7SEK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TJ1H2S#wasThisHelpful","R1UPQ013V7SEK9","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Film ""Hercules"" [USA, 2014]1. This is a very interesting version of the Hercules legend. But you need to know, the legend has been reinvented. The trailer for the movie is kind of misleading. This is not the Hercules you are used to..2. The birth of Hercules, his childhood, and his legendary 12 labors are all pretty much done before the opening credits.3. In this movie, Hercules is really just a human mercenary, with a team of warriors helping him out. His nephew has the sole job of making up the legends of Hercules and spreading them around to give Hercules a badass reputation.4. It is set in a time when people are starting to doubt the existence of gods and magic, but still need something to believe in.5. This movie has some really impressive, epic battle scenes.6. Hercules's companions are a diverse and entertaining group. Ian McShane is especially good as Amphiaraus, who does drugs and gets ""visions from the gods"". Some of these visions come true, and some don't.7. The movie does a good job of illustrating that some monsters you have to battle are psychological ones.8. There are a few moments that contradict the movie's attempt to stay grounded in reality. That's annoying. But there aren't very many of them.9. If you want a movie full of gods and monsters, you will leave the theater angry. If you like to see military battles, and a reflection on how heroes are made, you may appreciate it. This movie is certainly smarter and more layered than most movies of this type.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R241DS7XE4IMYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M265CSU#wasThisHelpful","R241DS7XE4IMYE","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""Bellflower"" [USA, 2011]1. I usually find romantic dramas to be predictable and boring. But this movie is a rare exception.2. Its about two best friends, Aiden and Woodrow, who moved to California together to make their lives different. They spend their spare time (which they have a lot of) fantasizing about what they would do during the apocalypse. They build Mad Max-inspired cars and flamethrowers as their hobby.3. Woodrow falls in love with a girl named Milly, and Aiden starts spending time with a girl named Courtney. They embark on their respective relationships, which are realistic and heartfelt. But halfway through the movie, things go bad. There is cheating, car accidents, brain damage, and betrayal.4. The last half hour of the movie splits into two different timelines, and it is up to you to decide which one is the real one and which one is imaginary.5. The movie works largely because of the two lead actors. Tyler Dawson plays Aiden and Evan Glodell plays Woodrow (Glodell also wrote and directed the movie). Its one of the best portrayals of adult male best friends Ive ever seen. They perfectly illustrate the young adult male psyche dealing with love, friendship, and the realization that idealism rusts away, that changing where you live doesn't change who you are.6.The cinematography by Joel Hodge is very unique. Beautiful macro shots combine with dirty lenses and grungy perspectives to give the film a look Ive never seen before. It was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography.7. No matter which version of the timeline you believe, if you watch all the way through the credits you may get confused again.8. The movie shows that some apocalypses really do happen. But they are not global, they are personal.9. This movie is a beautiful emo-hipster tragedy, and is further proof that some great movies never make it to your local pop culture movie theater.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7RG1Y9GUG6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KC4LJE#wasThisHelpful","RE7RG1Y9GUG6","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie The Purge [USA, 2013]1. Despite how it was advertised, this is not a horror movie. The sooner you realize this, the better.2. This is a dark, violent, well-acted, and uncomfortable allegory about the American class system.3. The movie takes place over a span of 13 hours. Ethan Hawke plays a well-meaning, but rather rigid, father that lives in a very wealthy gated community with his family. They settle into their home for the evening behind their state-of-the-art security system to keep out of The Purge. The Purge is a night where all crime is legal. This is designed to let Americans vent their frustration, anger, and violent impulses, so that the rest of the year everyone can get along better. Anyway, the two kids end up compromising the security of their house, and the family must defend their lives from psycho college students who want things the family has.3 There are some parts of the movie that, at first, seem dumb or unrealistic. But if you look at those instances as metaphor, the whole movie unlocks and begins to make sense.4. This movie is less concerned with telling an actual story, and more concerned with examining issues of entitlement, envy, the dangers of using God as a foundation of patriotism, and the deep dehumanization of others (as well as the self) that is required to keep those things going.5. The home-invasion thriller part of the movie is well-acted and has some surprises.6. There is a lot of violence in this movie, but not like some people expect. It is not about showing rampant carnage so that the audience can experience their own Purge vicariously. The epic idea of the movie is scaled way down to become an intimate experience. This disappointed a lot of people.7. This movie is not about the Purge, but about the reactions and consequences to living with such a system as The Purge.8. It's about the self-deception that the wealthy engage in when they say ""Things like that don't happen in our neighborhood"". It's about the intrinsic instability that roils under the calm surface of the upper class, and how they really are like piranhas, tearing apart anything they see as prey - even if it is each other.9. ""The Purge"" is a suspenseful and thoughtful morality tale that makes a depressing case about human nature. The more you think about it, the more impressive it is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XPVB8MXRB7LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYGXE#wasThisHelpful","R1XPVB8MXRB7LE","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Purge: Anarchy"" [USA, 2014]1. I was one of the few people that really liked ""The Purge"". It was sort of misadvertised, so I understand why people didn't like it. It's an epic idea - there is one night a year where all crime is legal. But the movie itself focused on one family in one house, so a lot of people thought the movie was wasted, silly, and unrealistic.2. The reason I liked it so much is because I realized early on that it wasn't really a horror movie. Sure there is a home-invasion thriller plot, but the movie itself wasn't about that. It was a harsh allegory of American culture. If you can recognize the political, religious, and classist undertones, the movie unlocks itself for you and becomes a smart, engaging black satire.  But most people didn't recognize that, so they thought it sucked.3. So for the sequel, they tried to fix those problems, to make it more accessible. So everything becomes more obvious. The social undertones of the first movie become blatant overtones in this one. The action moves out of one house and literally into the streets, where nobody is safe because the cops are all off duty.4. It's a decent flick, but they went a little too far in the other direction. There are multiple plots in this movie - each one showing the adventures of a small group of people who find themselves out in the open city when the Purge begins. During the Purge, the streets are run by rival street gangs, religious end-of-the-world nuts, and lone lunatics. There is danger around every corner.  Little by little, the characters find each other and try to survive the night.5. The story mostly works, but it's really just cobbled together from parts of other movies, and is kind of predictable. Also, given the violent premise of the movie, there is surprisingly little blood and gore. A lot of the violence happens offscreen.6. Unless you completely turn your brain off, there is no way you will miss the social commentary here. The movie makes bold statements about American capitalism, the merging of religion with national pride, and the unbalanced class system.7. The ending is a heavy-handed moral lesson about revenge and forgiveness.8. This movie will play right into the conspiracy theorists that believe America is turning into a police state run by evil super rich people. The ""Zeitgeist Movement"" Kool-Aid drinkers will think this is a documentary in a few years.9. This is an entertaining movie that gives you a little to think about. It is louder and dumber than the first one, which many people will appreciate. There are some very chilling scenes, and some good action.  But I was left feeling a little empty. It could be a devastating statement on American values. Or it could be a grungy super-violent grindhouse film. But it tries to walk the line between both, so it ends up being neither.For such an outrageous idea, it's not a very outrageous movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5DKV3M66E8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWLX99A#wasThisHelpful","R3K5DKV3M66E8X","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie Beyond the Black Rainbow [Canada, 2010]1. There are four kinds of drug movies:a) movies about how terrible drugs are - most movies are of this type.b) movies that show drugs are funny and harmless - these are the weed movies like Friday and Pineapple Express.c) movies that can only really be appreciated if you are on drugs - movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Brazil, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Apocalypse Now..d) then there is the most rare movie of all - the movie that is itself a drug. These are movies that try to cause you to feel the same way that a psychedelic experience will.2. This movie is in the last category. There is no way to describe this movie in regular language. Combining Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch, Burroughs, and Lovecraft, this isn't even really a movie by traditional standards, but an experiment in using cinema to alter consciousness.3. The director himself called this a trance film, and downplayed the actual story for an atmospheric and dream-like experience.4. It's set in 1983, but the soul of the film is locked in an acid-induced fever dream from 1965. The plot, if it matters, is about a telepathic girl held against her will in a bizarre hospital, while her doctor does strange things with drugs and a glowing crystal in an attempt to find ultimate reality. Or something like that.5. The movie shows the dark side of the hippy movement. While trying to bring peace and light to the world, the movie argues that hippies did just the opposite, causing people to go too far in their quest for inner peace - whether it was from drugs or occult games. The Balance was upset.6. There is not much violence, and even less sex, in this film. This film is concerned with issues far beyond such mundane dramas. For example, if you dont get the reference that the movies drugs are provided by a pharmacy named Benway... well, then you cant fully appreciate what the movie is reaching for. Im sorry.7.The film uses amazing old-school visuals and mesmerising soundscapes to make the viewer feel... weird. Trippy. Comfortably uncomfortable. The movie exterminates rational thought. Some people will understand this. Some wont.8. Ive seen the film more than once, and each time I swear they changed the movie and added in scenes that werent there before.9. I dont need to tell you if you should watch this movie - you already know by the time youve read this far .If you are questioning whether this movie is for you well, then its probably not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROS4NMB7RH8ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B9JTDQ#wasThisHelpful","ROS4NMB7RH8ZI","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things About the Movie I Stand Alone [France, 1998]1. Out of all the countries of the world, only two - France and Germany - produce people that have the unflinching courage to make movies that depict the hellish pointlessness of life. This movie, being French, is one of those movies.2. In 1991, French director Gaspar Noe made a short, 40-minute movie called Meat (the actual French title is Carne). Its about a strange and bitter man working as a horse butcher. He has an autistic daughter, and he struggles to raise her by himself - without giving in to the temptation to molest her. The short film won awards for its unique vision and brutal style, but was never released on DVD, so most people have never seen it.3. In 1998, Noe made a sequel with the American title I Stand Alone. The beginning of it summarizes Meat very quickly; but if you have the resources to find the original film, I suggest watching it before this one. It makes it easier to understand the characters and what makes them tick. Plus it gives you a taste of Noes unique style - and lets you decide if you actually want to watch the sequel.4.The main character doesnt have a name, hes just a mentally unstable butcher. His life is miserable and empty, and he hates everything, including his wife and unborn child. And black people, and gay people, and rich people, and Nazis. Anyway, after a violent confrontation that leaves him homeless, the butcher strikes out on his own to remake his life. But life has never worked in his favor, and the butcher heads towards a breaking point. He ends up with only a gun and three bullets, and he has to decide what to do with them.5. Most of the movies script consists of the butchers internal monologue - he narrates whats going on inside his head as he bounces between friends, jobs, and bars.6. While the butchers experiences are a commentary on contemporary French life, it could just as easily be a commentary on America.7. The butcher is racist, homophobic, lusts after his daughter, and believes that life is completely worthless. He is one of the most unredeemable characters in cinematic history. And yet the movie makes us sympathize with him as we understand how he got this way. We recognize that societys angry crazy people are really just sad and pathetic.8. Twenty minutes before the end of the movie, the audience is given a warning that they might want to stop watching. This is not because the rest of the movie is too violent to handle (though it is pretty violent), but because it detonates a psychological nuclear bomb, and you are whiplashed through the butchers breakdown. You are horrified, then hopeful and then horrified again.9. Its a controversial movie because you get inside this mans head to such a degree that you understand how violence can naturally seem to be a solution to a life that is so tortured as to be unlivable. This movie is an intimately devastating punch in the throat that dares to show you the black truth sliding in the background of our life.This is not a date movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29P2QP0Z0RKT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005K9O8#wasThisHelpful","R29P2QP0Z0RKT5","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Movie The New World [USA, Britain, 2005]1. The thing about Terrence Malick is that you are either a fan or you are not. He has made 6 films in 40 years, each covering a different time in American History. But in a sense, Malick has really only made one film - and hes made it six times. His movies are always basically about the incomprehensibility of the world and our place in it. One could even go so far as to say he doesnt make movies - he films philosophical poems. And he doesnt seem to care if anybody understands him. Needless to say, I am a fan.2. This movie, his fourth, has all his trademarks. Its full of quiet voiceovers, poetic musings, and images that dont match the plot. It is gorgeous, lyric, and breathtaking. The soundtrack is hypnotic. Malick once again proves he is a visionary, infusing the mundane with the sublime in ways that cannot be described in words.3. This movie is Malicks account of Americas beginning - the founding of Jamestown, and the story of Pocahontas. The surface plot of the movie is not complicated: British settlers come to America, and meet the local natives. Captain John Smith falls in love with one of them, and the cultures clash as they try to work out their differences..4. But the movie is three hours long. It doesnt take three hours to tell the story of Pocahontas. Thats because Americas origin story is fertile ground for Malick to ask the Big Questions, even though we will obviously never get the answers. This movie might be the most philosophically challenging of all his films. And thats saying a lot.5. The movie asks questions about religion. What is God? One group of people calls God Father. The other group calls God Mother. How does ones religion shape the way you see and treat the world?6. The movie asks questions about love. What is love? Why is it so intense and uncontrollable?If its true that God is love, or that love is truth, then what does it mean when the person you love does not love you back? What does it mean when love goes away entirely?7. The movie is itself a metaphor for the battles inside ones own soul. Its an illustration of how we can never really know any other person - maybe not even ourselves.8. Predictably, the movie was a box office flop. Audiences (and some critics) were confused, bored, and frustrated. It was given credit for being historically accurate in its setting, but disliked for being a complete myth in its story. And yet, other critics defended it fiercely. It was even proclaimed by some people to be the best movie of the 2000s.9. If you are looking for a historical adventure romance, this movie is way too long and boring to be useful. If you arent familiar with his work, but want to give him a shot, this may not be the best movie to start with. However, if you can connect with what Malick is trying to say, this movie becomes a vital, challenging, fundamental study of what it means to be alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IT021K10Z0J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041KW3AK#wasThisHelpful","R2IT021K10Z0J1","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Things about the Movie ""The Bunny Game""  [USA, 2012]1. This is the feel-bad movie of the year. Maybe of the decade.2. Filmed entirely in black and white, this movie is partly art film, partly torture porn, partly regular porn, and partly industrial music video. It's nothing more or less than a depiction of the total destruction of a young woman..3. The movie starts out depressing as we meet a miserable, empty, homeless prostitute with a drug habit. She feels dead inside and goes through humiliating sexual experiences so that she can pay for her next fix. She meets a trucker and they share cocaine (this is the happiest part of the whole movie). Then the trucker knocks her out and chains her to the back of his trailer. After that, the movie is not depressing anymore... it's worse. The rest of the movie documents the way the trucker tortures and terrorizes the prostitute in nightmarish, horrifying ways. Well, except for a few breaks when we witness flashbacks of the trucker as he terrorizes, tortures and kills a different girl.4. The movie should come with a trigger warning - people who have been in extremely abusive situations should probably not watch it.5.  This movie is banned in Britain because of the way the subject matter is handled.6.  The performances of the two main characters are amazing; they are the most talented new actors I've seen in a long time. Rodleen Getsic stars as the prostitute. She also helped write the script. Jeff Renfro plays the trucker, and he is one of the most disturbing (and disturbed) villains ever put on screen.7.  As bizarre and vile as the film is, it is also oddly compelling. I wanted to turn the movie off, but I couldn't, because it's so stylish that it kind of hypnotized me. I admire the strength of the vision of the filmmakers. It is artistic, brave, creative, and repulsive.8. The ending of the film is deliberately vague - all you know is how the experience psychologically nuked the young woman.9. This movie is a fundamental piece of transgressive cinema, and it burned scenes in my mind that will never go away. Most people don't need to come anywhere near this movie. It's strictly for people who want to witness the far reaches of human cruelty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UAVRV22O1D32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082A3IOK#wasThisHelpful","R1UAVRV22O1D32","A7DAL9PK7F4M1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7DAL9PK7F4M1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I put these in the smell is greatly reduced in the morning. But they dont get rid of it completely Nothing really can besides throwing them in the washer on hot My overall opinion on activated carbon is that it really isnt the best odor remover out there think of it like a sponge that can only hold so much watereventually It fills up from all the toxins in the environment and thats it. You can try and recharge in the sun but they have a limitThe Bottom Line:If you are just trying to moderately control an odor in shoes this is a worthy option.

"Likes: Wraps around Ankle perfectly Nice tight firm fit Great support (on the ankles it held my tendons in nicely but allowed movement)Thoughts:I dont use support all the time  but it does come in handy when I have an injury that needs to recover but I need to remain active. I struggle with my ankles ever since ditching orthotics. It has been a hard transition on my body and these types of supports help when things become too much.  I found the wrap to work better than other brands because I was able to stretch this one considerably and it just held on longer. Most wraps/supports comes loose during the dayAs with all support...remember you are supporting a dysfuction so really try to get the root of the problem instead of relying on this all the timeThe Bottom Line:If you are looking for some support that will last and not lock your body from naturally moving, this is it.

"Pros: Larger magnet than most of the other ones- its pretty powerful too You can keep this out of the way because its a vent mount I like that this model swivels and tilts The magnet that you put on your phone is also useful for any other type of magnetic mount So if you already use a magnetic mount for another application it becomes universalTips: Be careful when you mount this on your vent Some vehicle vents crack really easy The fins of the vent really arent that strongThe Bottom Line:I have reviewed a similar mount in the past which had a smaller surface area. Im a fan of these mounts Because I really do not prefer to use suction cups or take up my cupholders And I like to have the mounts out of the way. This one also swivels which the others were all fixed so even better. This product accomplishes that and works very well so I have no complaints and I can definitely recommend this.

It mounts right on my frameI had to move my water bottle holder for this to fit The pump clips in pretty firmly so even over road bumps it didnt break looseOther Thoughts: Its a manual pump so expect to pump this thing a lot to fill an almost flat tire If you are mountain biking im not sure if this pump will break loose out of the mounting bracket. I guess it will depend on how hard you rideThe Bottom Line:If you feel you may need air on the go or like to alter tire pressure for different terrains this is a good tool to have on hand.

"This was used on a 1996 Dodge Ram 1500The Good: Everything is well packaged and protected inside with foam, cloth bag for mirror Just like OEM fit wise, brings back that moose look on these trucks...but these aren't the extended mirrors for larger trailers I can't tell a difference between the craftsmen ship between these and OEMOther Thoughts: These are POWERED, but manual fold you can fold them flat against the door They shake a bit while drivingbut thats expected to the length  Be careful with the mounting bracketseasy to strip the threads You dont need to have these professionally installed unless you are clueless when it comes to toolsThe Bottom Line:I really like these mirrors and recommend them to anyone enhancing the look of their truck or for safety reasons. For the price they are barely more than others I have seen that are all manual operation.

"My Trial: 1 month, 1 capsule 3 x times a day before mealThoughts:In the world of supplements it is very confusing to know what to take and when to take it. We never know what sourcing/manufacturing standards the company is practicing.  I rely on Consumer Lab Reportswhich you can subscribe to. They test supplements and report back if they are contaminated with heavy metals, contain what they say, etc  So in that respect all I can review is my thoughts on what the company has told me and how I felt taking it for a month now.The main thing about HCA Garcinia Cambogia  supplements are that they are saidf to aids in weight loss. The research is mixed with success of food suppression in animals but a more recent study in obese women showed that those who took 800mg 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 2 months while also reducing here calorie intake, had a significant reduction in triglycerides levels compared to women who took a placebo.but no reduction in weight or body mass index.So really what this all means is that the evidence suggests that in some situations HCA may help in weight loss but no guarantees. There are also a ton of quality concerns out there today..consumerlab found 6 out of 13 supplements that tested to pass for containing the labeled amounts.The Bottom Line:At the end of the day I didnt lose any weight while taking this but it doesnt mean it wont work for you.I Hope this helps you make your decision.I was provided this product in exchange for my honest feedback. All of my reviews are comprised of my unbiased, honest opinions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JG0GLEUO38P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JDE24G#wasThisHelpful","R7JG0GLEUO38P","AT8TS7XTO8TIE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT8TS7XTO8TIE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Top Likes: Ready to go right out of the box (just set it up and light) Visually appealing (flares up and then rotates 360 degrees with looping birthday song music) Good pointed base to push into a cake or ice cream cakeSuggestions: Note that this is a disposable candle. One time use..Although I was able to fold mine back up to stop the music and save the little candles. It wont be able to self open again.The Bottom Line:Whats better than regular candles? How about a singing rotating candle! If you are in the market for something to wow someone for their birthday than this candle will do the job.

"Like my review for the Silver and Rainbow, these are the same except Warm White.  See the Video Under the Rainbow review for more info!The Good: So many options of brightness, flashing etc.. with included remote Because its copper wire you can mold these around anything (20ft) The adapter cord is 5ft so you can reach an outletOther Thoughts: You NEED to be really careful when you unwind these or you will tangle them into a knot and never get it out. Ive done this several times out of frustration and they are useless once you know them up. I would advise caution in using these outside, they are not rated for thatThe Bottom Line:Copper wire lights are cheap, easy to set up, and generally provide a good show.

"I have to say that I am not so thrilled with this towel. I bought three of them, and wish that I had ordered the All-Clad Textiles 100-Percent Cotton Solid Kitchen Towel, Cobalt instead. To be fair, I've only washed these towels once, but I am not impressed.Pros:It's a nice size, and feels soft after being washed and dried.Cons:(1) Despite this being dyed with a ""Fiber reactive process [that] treats the towel so the yarn completely absorbs the dye"" the color bled in the wash. I was afraid that would happen, as the manufacturer warned us that we should ""Machine wash cold, with like colors and tumble dry low; do not use bleach or fabric softeners.""Just what I need - a kitchen towel that needs to be coddled. The solid colors have no such warnings. My fault for not paying closer attention, but silly me, I trusted the Ritz and All-Clad names.(2) The printed image of the tomato cluster is oddly positioned. It's not centered (so the tomatoes are on display when the towel is folded in thirds) nor is it off to one side (so the tomatoes are displayed when the towel is folded in half.) This wonky arrangement strikes me as just plain sloppiness on the part of the manufacturer.  (See product images)(3) There were loose threads all over the thing, even after the first wash and dry.If you are in love with the way the towel looks, just buy one of them to put out when company comes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYSKWE3EM6GU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UABRXNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AYSKWE3EM6GU","A3N9TOPHBENB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N9TOPHBENB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When they started to leak I decided to try these, because they have good ratings and are much less expensive.Cons:They are a bit more difficult to get into the ear than the pricier ones.They stick out from the ear, so they might be uncomfortable under a swim cap.Pros:They keep out the water perfectly.

"I bought two new dresses, and the washing instructions ""use cold water, wash with like colors"" led me to believe that the colors would bleed. So I washed them by hand the first time.  Yep.

I also used COLD water, as directed.The sheets caught all the loose dye, and the white areas on the clothes stayed white.I am very pleased, needless to say, with this result.The downside is that this product is too pricey to use with every load of wash.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NTHRJJIS4SVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DIWJF#wasThisHelpful","R3NTHRJJIS4SVB","A3N9TOPHBENB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N9TOPHBENB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product last Monday, and used it five nights in a row.  The first night I used it I was surprised that it left my skin feeling like it had been washed with soap. I was expecting a moisturizing effect because the first ingredient is sunflower oil, and it also contains shea. But the fact that it emulsifies with water indicates that there are other ingredients in there that allows oils to be washed away completely. I was hoping that it would make it possible to not have to use a night moisturizer any more, but that was not the case.Even though I used my nightly moisturizer, my skin got dryer, and dryer, and dryer. This morning, (Saturday) while eating breakfast, I couldn't stand it any longer, and had to jump up and apply Regenerist serum to my face.  It still felt dry. So I applied a bit of jojoba oil, and my skin said Aaaaahhh.... Thank you.Pros:This stuff does get your skin really really clean.  I mean super clean. Incredibly clean. Amazingly clean. Waterproof mascara, gone.  Makeup, gone. Natural skin oils, gone.  Oooops.Cons:As I mentioned above, this product strips your natural skin oils away along with the stuff you want washed off your face.  If you have oily skin, that's probably not going to bother you.  If you have dry skin, that's a definite negative.So, it's back to using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser on my face.

"I ordered the workbench for visits from my very favorite five-year-old, my son's niece. I'll call her T.  The main item that attracted me was the toy lathe and baseball bat. T just about went into orbit when she saw the lathe because her daddy owns a baseball bat company. She has seen lathes working many times. Now she can pretend to do the same work that her daddy does.Assembly of the bench was fairly easy and the instructions were accurate, it went together simply in about 20 minutes. The bench is fairly sturdy, with a nice area to play on. The tools are a very accurate representation, well made, and fit the bench perfectly. Only tool that seems wobbly is the bench vice.The weak point in the system, in my estimation, is the cardboard backing. I can't see that it will last too long. I also don't particularly like the name ""Workman,"" but T is too young to understand gender bias, and I'm not about to mention it to her.The boy in the product picture is way too old to be playing with a toy like this. It is definitely a ""pretend time"" toy, and older children will want tools that actually do something.This is a great product for the age-group 3-6, and the size is perfect for a 5 year old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R917ULV0ZBE69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q058PRE#wasThisHelpful","R917ULV0ZBE69","A3N9TOPHBENB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N9TOPHBENB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I previously bought the TravelWise Packing Cube System - Durable 5 Piece Weekender Plus Set and really like it.  I bought this set in addition to that one to pack my dirty laundry to come home.  The other set stays nice and clean, and it doesn't matter if this one starts to suffer from having dirty socks packed in it.My review of the other set:I'd never previously used anything other than plastic bags to contain things in my suitcase. I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff. So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System. I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes. I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible. I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box. And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.These cubes are extremely well-made.

"Well I must be a small-minded dinosaur (using terms bandied about by other reviewers) because I find this book fascinating.  Yes, it does have a definite Western bias. But does that make it ""useless""?  I, personally, don't think so.For every given year since the start of recorded history one can look up what happened in history/politics, literature, religion/philosophy, visual arts, music, science/technology, and daily life. So, just for fun, I looked up 1620 and found out that in July of that year there was a huge massacre of Protestants in the border region between Switzerland and Italy. Hundreds of people were just dragged out of their houses and killed. Such information definitely helps to put things in perspective for the voyage of the Mayflower. Things obviously were generally bad in Europe for Protestants at that time. No wonder the Pilgrims decided to risk everything and take their chances in a completely new and potentially hostile environment.Now, the book does not spell out this relationship. It just has two separate entries that I chose to relate to each other: (1) ""Massacre of Protestants in the Valtelline,"" and (2) ""Pilgrim Fathers leaving Plymouth, England, in the ""Mayflower"" for N. America...""  It was up to me to put things together, starting with wondering what in the world was the Valtelline, and looking it up.The above is just one example of the sorts of relationships this book helps reveal.

"I add a few drops of API Tap Water Conditioner to a small amount of water in my bathroom sink to rinse the chlorine out of my swimsuit.  I decided to try this because I was really irritated at how expensive swimsuit rinses are when they have the same stated purpose as this product: removing chlorine.  I swim three times a week, and therefore was going through a lot of the swimsuit rinse product, which is far more expensive due to both the basic price (per volume unit) and the amount that the manufacturers recommend using.A few drops of API Tap Water Conditioner completely remove the chlorine scent from my swimsuits, and (as far as I can tell) the product does absolutely no harm to the swimsuit fabric/dye.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETT13XOH36Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LO9KSY#wasThisHelpful","R3ETT13XOH36Z5","A3N9TOPHBENB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N9TOPHBENB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Katie Stewart has a truly original voice.  In Treespeaker, she creates a solidly realized imaginary world populated by characters that are well-drawn and all too human.  One can easily imagine that the world of the Arrakeshi people is not too unlike the world of actual Iron Age societies who populated the forested regions of the world in times gone by.The hero is Jakan, a sort of shaman, whose power to foresee the future and heal the wounded is derived directly from his pure faith in the forest god Arrakesh.  He is often tormented, and filled with self-doubt in his quest to do the right thing, but nevertheless, his faith carries him along the path that he believes that Arrakesh wants him to follow.The world of the Arrakeshi is horribly disrupted by the arrival of a man who, by all outward appearances, is good and charming.  Jakan is the only one who seems to realize that this man is not who he appears to be, and that he constitutes a huge threat to the world of the Arrakeshi.  Jakan pays a huge and horrible price when he attempts to warn his fellow villagers about the danger that has come into their midst.This is not the usual fantasy story that features knights and dragons. My only criticism is that I wish that some of the characters that were introduced in the last third of the book were a bit more fully developed. But, to be fair, maybe I just wanted the story to last just a bit longer.If you're in the mood for a truly original bang-up good fantasy story, Treespeaker might just be the book for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146GK0WWBTF5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XDBOJG#wasThisHelpful","R146GK0WWBTF5E","A3N9TOPHBENB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N9TOPHBENB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Marker set is a great concept but poorly executed.Pros:None that I can think of...  Oh.  How about this:  The black marker writes dark enough that it can be read from across the room.  Whooo Hooo!And, wow, I just thought of another one: The erasers work!  Stunning accolades, for sure.Cons:The yellow might as well be invisible, and the rest of the colors are too pale to be read from more than a few feet away. As I noted above, the only marker that can be read from a distance is the black.The magnets are so weak that they are close to being useless.  I have a Quartet ReWritables Daily Quick List  on my refrigerator door, along with the black marker.  When the door is closed the marker slides down the door and drops onto the floor.  I tested the magnets on the other markers and they were just as bad. The only solution that I can see is to super-glue a decent magnet to the black marker.Disappointing, to say the least.Update, June 2014: Even after I glued the magnet to the black marker, I was still not happy with it.  Within a very short time the color in the marker faded, as if it was already running out of ink.

"The Ziploc Vacuum bags and pump work are a great way to extend the life of your favorite foods.I have been using the Reynolds 00590 Handi-Vac Vacuum-Sealing Starter Kit for the past 6+ years. I primarily use it for my cheeses. On average I have 5-7 varieties of gourmet cheeses and 3-4 varieties of cooking cheeses (block & grated) in my refrigerator, but being the only cheeseaholic in the family, I had been finding that my cheeses were getting spoiled faster than I could consume them. I toyed with the idea of a plug-in vacuum sealer, but it was just too inconvenient and un-appetizing after a good wine night. :o)  I had been using the Vacu Vin Wine Saver Pump with 2 x Vacuum Bottle Stoppers - Black to remove air from my wine bottles and had experienced great results, so when I found the Handi-Vac, I was overjoyed. The Handi-Vac has worked and continues working very well to extend the life of my cheese. It has just but one flaw  it uses 6 AA batteries. Batteries would last me on average 5 months with 5-6 weekly usages.As I started running out of bags, I came across the Ziploc bags which were cheaper and seemed to work similarly, however, they were incompatible with my Handi-Vac pump. I saw Handi-Vac to Ziploc bag adapters selling for about $20 and decided against them. I picked up a Ziploc starter bag from my local big-box and tried the manual pump  it worked even better than I expected. The manual pump is super effective and, unlike my electric pump, is only constrained in suction power by the tolerances of the pump construction and my strength. I was able to successfully seal a glass bowl to the point where the plastic bag was undistinguishable from the glass surface  and the seal held!I have bought a few starter kits for friends and family who love it, but sometimes complain about the seal not being effective. 99% of these complaints stem either from not sealing the zip properly, over-filling the bags or incorrect bag storage. Plan to use only 50-60% of the bag capacity, press the zip against your counter to seal it and keep liquids stored upright so that the liquid is not constantly hitting against the seal or zip.Besides cheeses, I use the bags for nuts and exotic dried fruits (figs, etc.). I have never lost a seal under proper usage/storage. The few times it failed was when I have accidentally punctured the bag through abrasion with other items  storage containers, refrigerator compartment doors/drawers, etc.I have successfully resealed the bags multiple times as I consume my cheeses. I have also rinsed and reused the bags especially when using with dry foods and they seemed to hold up well for one more cycle. I do not re-use any bags that have been used for soft, oily cheeses or liquids.Refills available in quart and gallon sizes.A definite Recommend!

"I saw these loafers on a deals site and since I love Varvatos shoes decided to check them out. The deal on Amazon seemed too good to be true - a Varvatos leather loafer for 37 bucks?? With free shipping and returns?? I was skeptical, but decided to take a chance - Hey! What did I have to lose?The shoes arrived a day later and I was glad I took the chance. They are very well finished suede leather lined loafers with great attention to detail - for e.g., the leather extends to the top of the sole for a semaless finish, stiching along the sole of the feet and the inner liner is excellent.The loafers, keeping with the Hipster style, seemed a little narrow but they accomodated my broad feet just fine. The fit, for me, was perfect and they were nearly as comfortable as my other $300 Varvatos pair. I field test every shoe by wearing them around the house - this was the first pair that I wore and walked out of the house - the price-point might have had something to do with that too ;o). I was on my feet for 10 hours that day and my feet did not get uncomfortable nor did I get any shoe bites - a rare thing for an unbroken shoe!I wear a size 9.5 and this shoe is slightly snug - about a quarter of a size small. If I had to choose all over again, I would choose the same size as it has already loosened up a bit. The front of the shoe is slightly stiff - and I like that because it maintains its shape.The color of the loafers is stated as wood brown and is close to a pair of ""camel"" color shoes I had.Highly Recommended! Especially if you can get this at the $37 price.P.S.: I would rate this shoe 4-stars but the price of this shoe definitely pushed it to 5.

"The motorized Bug Vacuum seemed a little overkill for catching and getting a closer look at bugs, but recent bug-bite events in the family have made me re-consider my thinking. My son got bit by what felt like mosquito bites - they ballooned into boils. My nephew got bit by a small bug that triggered an allergic rash on his arms. I think capturing from a distance is a good idea - especially for the young ones.The Bug vac consists of 3 components that can be separated. An intake nozzle, an observation chamber and the motor. Suction is activated through a trigger and pulls in the bug through the intake nozzle into an observation chamber. For a closer look at the bug, you can flip a switch on the chamber (connected to a magnifying glass) that seals the front end of the chamber. You unscrew the observation chamber from the nozzle and the motor and are able to get a 3D 360 degree view of the specimen. Flip open the switch to release the bug.The Bug Vac is not too powerful and seems safe for small bugs/insects, but that also means you cannot suck in larger bugs as they can overpower the suction power. Additional features included a green LED light and a plastic carabiner.Little expensive price-point, but worth the cost for the hours of fun!Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J8ACUJDCRYS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9GK#wasThisHelpful","R1J8ACUJDCRYS4","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stiga Supreme is a few levels above the base model and should work well for a mid-level player.The first thing you notice is the weight of the racket. It is very light - great for players who play infrequently to avoid fatigue. The blade uses Stiga's Tube technology (milled ridges) that are filled with different materials to customize features for the racket (spin, control, etc.). The racket is well balanced and Stiga's WRB technology ensures that the weight shifts to the point of ball contact providing additional power - which is great for newbies.I like this racket as it has a very good combination of speed (90), spin (92) and control (89). This is a great racket to grow into for someone who is starting off. The racket keeps up with the abilities of a new to mid-level player.This is not an inexpensive racket and I would recommend this for palyers who are passionate about table-tennis and play atleast a few times a week.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HZN99X4K1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JK002Q#wasThisHelpful","R8HZN99X4K1E","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my 5th WD Passport drive and my second WD USB 3.0 drive. There is hardly any difference between the 2015 version and the 2014 version drive - except for a few mm shaved off the external dimensions and a little faster read/write speed (updated firmware).I use my Passport drives to backup my data/documents. I backed up my 1 TB video archive at transfer speeds as high as 120 mb/s. Read speeds were also in the same range - 125-130 mb/s.My earliest WD Passport drive (160 GB/USB 2.0) is about 6 years old and still works well. WD drives are an ideal backup drive because of their portability and reliability.The only think I miss are the custom neoprene cases that WD used to offer with the early Passport drives. Guess since the prices are about one third of the 2009 drives for 15x the capacity, I should just pony up the 5-6 bucks for the AmazonBasics Hard Carrying Case for My Passport Essential or the Western Digital My Passport Carrying Case - Black. ;o)Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38J49EK2GS0A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8XXYSM#wasThisHelpful","R38J49EK2GS0A3","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 30214 Clear Vinyl Protective Cleaner is a medium-shine, anti-static, UV protecting cleaner and polisher for all exterior vinyl surfaces including 'clear' vinyl. It is a worthy competitor to my favorite cleaner, the Pro Honda Spray Cleaner & Polish 12 oz.. I primarily use both products to clean 'clear' vinyl surfaces like my helmet visor and motorcycle windscreen.The big difference between the 30214 and the Honda cleaner is that the Honda cleaner is wax based while the 30214 is a non-alcohol, chemical based cleaner. They clean 'clear' vinyl equally well but the Honda does leave a little a wax residue behind.The 30214 is a very good product, but it cannot repair scuffed or scratched surfaces, though the gloss does do a good job of masking them.Cleaning and protecting is very easy. Apply the product directly or with a damp applicator. I prefer the damp applicator because it does not streak like the direct application. Buff to a shone with a clean cotton towel or smooth micro-fiber. Voila! You have a clean, UV protected surface.Recommended - 303 makes great products.Tip: Spray onto a well-wrung, damp, lint-free cloth/applicator and apply to surface for even coverage.Pros:* Non-alcohol, chemical based formula leaves a residue free finish.* Leaves a UV protected, anti-static, medium-shine finish. The gloss masks minor scratches and imperfections* Can be used on vinyl and 'clear' vinyl non-control surfaces* One of the few cleaners on the market for 'clear' vinylCons:* Little expensive at $13 for a 16 oz bottle","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSAH4E9EPPB81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBHXC4E#wasThisHelpful","RSAH4E9EPPB81","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Phantom Aquatics 1500 is built like a tank! It is an all metal construction which feels as robust as they come. It seems indestructible.I do not dive, so cannot review the depth performance but it works perfectly in my snorkeling application. I have always felt the lack of good light for photography while snorkeling and the PA 1500 works perfect for my application. It's 1500 lumens are bright enough to light up a 25-30 feet range. My photos have never been better.The XM-L2 CREE LEDs are the highest-performing, commercially available, single-die LED which delivers 20% more lumens per watt. This permits the PA 1500 a 20 hr run-time on two 3.7v 5000 mAh (manufactured advertised 4000 mAh) Li-Ion batteries. The flashlight's 3 levels and strobe function are controlled by a sealed magnetic switch that is easy to operate underwater.The flashlight loses 1-Star because of the lack of a manual and lack of markings on the flashlight and the charger. Is this a Li-ion only charger or can I also charge Ni-MH batteries? There are no instructions on turning on the strobe feature (hold down the switch when the flashlight is turned on) or on preventative care to ensure that the flashlight stays waterproof (ensuring alignment of O-rings and applying a thin coat of silicone grease to the O-ring and threads). I have used underwater camera/flash housings and so understand the pre and post care required for an underwater product, but what if I were a newbie? And shouldn't there be a disclosure of maintenance required for the product to function properly? I know divers are a super careful bunch, so the risk that they will not know/research/learn the product prior to diving is pretty low. But a manual for such a product is mandatory! The worst part is that there is nothing available online even after an exhaustive search.Recommended - but ensure that you research maintenance for salt/fresh water products.Weight: 1.45 lbs with batteriesPros:* Tough, all-metal construction* 1500 lumens are super bright* 3 light intensities with 1 Strobe mode* Good throw - Spot with a 25-30 feet effective range* Latest CREE LEDs are brightest on market and 20% more efficient* 20 hours run-time* Magnetic switch* Two 5000 mAh 3.7v Li-Ion batteries included.

"The Pre de Provence men's shower gel smells amazing. It is reminiscent of classic European fragrances that I grew up with.My favorite colognes are European - A-Men By: Thierry Mugler 3.4 oz EDT Refillable, Men's, Paco Rabanne 1 Million By Paco Rabanne For Men Edt Spray, 3.4 Ounce, etc. The Pre De Provence fits into this fragrance profile. It is warm, sweet, rich, spicy and fresh. The fragrance's top notes are woody (cedar wood) with a little citrus, and it finishes into a mild leather and tobacco. I can smell lavender on the finish, but since this cologne does not have this ingredient, it might be the combination of the violet leaves and plum.Very little gel is required to create good lather and provide a great shower experience. You come out refreshed! The oil base keeps the fragrance lingering for hours and I have even caught a whiff of the fragrance when washing up after a 10 hour day.I did not use the gel on my hair. I did intend to, but when I removed the plastic/foam seal from the bottle top, it had disintegrated. I just did not feel comfortable.The price point might seem expensive, but it isn't since you need only about half the quantity of an average body wash.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LKUYSM10Q0TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCXS80S#wasThisHelpful","R1LKUYSM10Q0TW","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Samsung VU3000 is a powerful, light-weight, feature rich vacuum at a good price-point.The VU3000 was an easy assembly - the canister and wand clicked ino the main unit and it was ready to go. The wand-handle has a small collar near the top that controls the suction power. You can rotate it to increase or decrease the suction power. The power and brush on/off switches are on the side of the canister - a little non-traditional and takes a little getting used to.There is no lever to unlock the VU3000 from its upright position. All you do is place your leg on the left side of the vacuum and push the handle down. The suction power is instantaneously noticeable and you almost have to turn the collar to reduce the suction to move the vacuum. The red (dirty) and green (clean) lights are helpful to ensure that the area is clean - I used to love this feature on my old Hoover. The vacuum does a good cleaning job on carpets and hard floors. The bagless canister has a good capacity and does not lose suction till it is about half-way full.A nice feature of the VU3000 is that the canister and wand separate easily from the base unit enabling portability to clean stairs, blinds, fixtures, etc.The VU3000 is not without its flaws. The suction is very powerful, but even with that powerful suction it does not seem to be able to pick up as well as my Dyson Animal. My thought is that the motorized brush might not be agitating sufficiently to complement the powerful vacuum. Another flaw is the usability. The placement of the operating and release buttons are a little tricky. The power and motorized brush buttons are on the side away from your line of sight when vacuuming. The canister release button (to remove for emptying) often gets activated when carrying the canister (cleaning blinds, etc.) and you are left with the canister in one hand and the wand in the other. Lastly, the release button to dump the dirt from the canister is located at the bottom which means that you have to use two hands to dump the dirt.If you can get past these few flaws, this is a great vacuum ar the sub $200 price-point.Recommended.Pros:* Powerful, adjustable suction strength* Canister and wand separate for ease of carry when cleaning stairs, blinds, etc.* LED lights signal dirty (red) and clean (green)* Bagless canister with good capacity* Does not lose suction till canister is about half-way full* Transitions from carpet to floor with no adjustmentCons:* Motorized brush might not be the most efficient - some dirt left behind* Buttons placement is not the best","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF92SF2BIXRBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8IUDT6#wasThisHelpful","RF92SF2BIXRBJ","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The KIND Almond & Coconut bar is one of my favorite snacks. It is always refreshing and the coconut makes it taste fresh for me.

"The TP-LINK Archer T9E AC1900 paired with a good AC router has vastly improved my desktop experience.My desktop is hard-wired into my router as it is the most prudent connection for me - they sit next to each other. Surfing/downloads/uploads to the internet has never been an issue as my 10/100 card has successfully managed my cable bandwitdh. However, transferring large files to my media server (equipped with a gigabit nic), over wi-fi, has been painfully slow. Since I already had the Linksys AC2400 4X4 Dual-Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router, Optimal for HD Video Streaming and Lag-Free Gaming (E8350), replacing my desktop card, the bottleneck in my network, seemed prudent.Installation was simple. Plug into a PCI-e slot and you're ready to go. After restarting my desktop and connecting to the network, I transferred some files (0.5-2 GB size) to my media server at BLAZING speeds! My average transfer when hardwired was 5-11 mbps. With the TP-LINK, I was getting between 50-80 mbps - a 10-15x performance improvement. I also moved smaller files (10-100MB) to a USB 3.0 hard-disk connected to my router and I reached speeds of nearly 200 mbps.The only issue that I have faced are connectivity drops - which with the hardwire connection was never an issue. But the Linksys router is moody - so cannot completely blame it on the TP-LINK.Recommended.Pros:* Easy installation* AC1900 - claims speeds upto 1300 mbps* Dual band - 5 GHz & 2.4 GHz* 3 upgradaeable, omnidirectional antennas* Compatible with 802.11 a/b/g/nCons:* Little expensive at 80 bucks","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBY6DPCFV1Z53/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQEX7AQ#wasThisHelpful","RBY6DPCFV1Z53","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hanover Newport Wicker Lounge set is our first set of real wicker. The real wicker has a great texture and looks rich.Setup took about an hour with the help of my son - from opening the nearly 6 x 4 x 3 feet box to unpacking the carefully packed pieces to assembling the loveseat and center table with a few screws. The included tools are basic and a power screwdriver will make the assembly go much quicker.The color of the wicker is advertised as Brown/Tan but there is a gray highlght in the color. The gray accent cushions seem to be a good match. An added benefit for us was that the dark brown color blended into our existing brown pewter dining table set.The set is low to the ground and is a great set for a deck. The seating is deep enough to be comfortable for extended lounging. My favorite is the the chair-ottoman combination. The cushions are plush enough and are a secure fit in the furniture.Spring showers on the first day tested the furniture out. It dried up quickly. Pollen remains an issue compared to fake wicker - it gets into the nooks and crannies and though it was not difficult to get out with a water hose on new furniture, I am sure that it will get more difficult as the wicker ages/dries/cracks. Lastly, bugs and spiders get into the nooks and crannies and you need to be careful especially with young children.The wicker furniture is on the pricey side, but not out of range for such a well-constructed set.Recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXA6SSM7DFEYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOFA3H2#wasThisHelpful","RXA6SSM7DFEYE","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Belkin TrueClear is one of the few privacy guards available for touch screen laptops.As with all adhesive related installations, it is important to have a clean environment and surfaces. I use the iKlear iK-26K Complete Cleaning Kit to ensure that I have clean non-static surfaces. Installation is simple - stick a micro-suction tabs to each corner of the privacy guard. Remove the protective coating and attach to a ""clean"" laptop bezel. Cannot emphasize how important it is to have a clean, grease free surface. These micro-suction tabs are tacky tabs and not ""suction"" tabs.I have it installed on my Dell XPS machine and there is no lag in touch response. The privacy guard does require your brightness to be slightly higher which marginally impacts my battery life. The privacy aspect works very well. You have to be directly in front of the screen as once you are 30 degrees or more off the center you cannot see anything on the screen.The issues I found were that the privacy guard is heavier than most I have used. It may not sound too heavy at 2 ounces, but add in the micro-suction tabs and it only compounds the issue. I wish Belkin used the old 3M attaching concept where you permanently attach the tabs to your laptop screen and slide the privacy guard in and out. The other issue is that the micro-suction surfaces get clogged with dust and though you can clean them with sticky tape, they do not seem to retain their initial tackiness.If you are the kind of user than installs and forgets it, it'll work for you, but if you are the user that needs to remove it daily (like me!) it will not work for you. I am trying to find the old 3M plastic tabs so that I can rig up a solution to make this privacy guard work.Size: 11.32"" width x 6.75"" heightPros:* Works well - screen content cannot be seen 30 degrees off center* Touch Screen functionality works as expected and does not require a heavier touch* Easy to Install* No glareCons:* Expensive at $50* Heavy for a privacy guard - 2 oz* Micro-suction tabs are advertised to be reusable, but they lose tackiness after a few installs and removals","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFU217BOHTP7E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7R1CLK#wasThisHelpful","RFU217BOHTP7E","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bobble Presse is the new kid on the 'on-the-go french press' block.The Bobble Presse is a 5 piece construction - the 3 wall insulated cup, the stainless steel plunger, the screw mesh filter, the silicone seal on the plunger that prevents coffee and grounds from getting in between the plunger and the cup, and the silicone cap. The outside of the cup seems to be laminated and provides a good grip.The Bobble Presse is a wonderful travel accessory - good for camping, etc. But I have been using it primarily at work where the coffee is just bad. Having this as work, gets me a great cup of coffee in less than 5 minutes. Just add medium-grind coffee, hot water, stir, wait 2-3 mins and press down. Voila! The Bobble yields about 12 ounces of coffee.With the grounds being at the bottom, the coffee does become progressively stronger. I notice this even though I am a fast drinker - within 15 minutes. When I desire a consistent taste, I pouring the coffee into a separate cup.Cleanup is easy with the steel and silicone components - just rinse and air dry.The seal around the plunger is tight and it is difficult to pull out when the cup gets cold. To alleviate the issue, pull the plunger as soon as you finish drinking or add hot water to heat the silicone seal and make it more pliable. The Bodum Insulated Stainless-Steel Travel French Press Coffee and Tea Mug, 0.45-Liter, 15-Ounce, Red has a plunger which pulls easier and is a worthy competitor. I prefer the Bobble because it looks like a normal coffee cup.Recommended.Pros:* Well designed cup has all technology under wraps - no indication that it holds a coffee press* 3 wall insulation keeps coffee hot for hours* Micro-mesh filter ensure that medium+ grind does not flow back into the coffee* All stainless steel and silicone construction* Easy cleanup - does not retain any odor* Durable and Portable - ideal for camping* Wide plunger/press might be easier to use for folks with hand ailments - arthritis, etc.Cons:* Silicone cap is unstable and becomes slightly more pliable and loose when hot - not recommended for use while driving* Folks might not prefer hot coffee floating around the silicone seal - easily remedied with pouring coffee into a separate cup* Might be difficult for some to press in/pull out the plunger","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GBJ8LB3WMCT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T088TTM#wasThisHelpful","R1GBJ8LB3WMCT1","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Philips Wake-Up Light is based on the concept of waking up naturally in sunlight. It also adds in the option of chirping birds to complete the experience.The Philips Light seems delicately constructed but is robust. It does, however, have some stability issues caused by the location of the power cord on the stand. The screen and controls are centered on the light. Controls and the clock numbers light up in soft-orange and can be adjusted to 4 levels of brightness. In my opinion, the lowest 2 settings will be the most ideal for any bedroom.The wake-up light and sounds (2 nature and 1 radio) work together to provide an easy, low-stress waking up experience - a huge welcome from the angry beeping that my old clock-radio provides. You set the max volume (1-10) and max brightness (1-10) and the light will increase gradually over a 30 minute period prior to your wake-up time. At your set wake up time, the nature sounds (or radio) come on and increase to your max set volume gradually.You have an option for a 9 minute (fixed duration) snooze which is activated by gently tapping the top of the clock.Controls to customize light brightness, sounds, radio, volume and alarm are well-placed and intuitive.So who does this wake-up light really work well for? In my opinion, this works great for stomach sleepers who sleep facing in the direction of the clock - which I am! If you are a back sleeper, the wake-up light might not work for you. A positive externality is that your partner is not disturbed by the light.You will have to do a little trial and error to determine the best setting for you. My first day settings of light (5) and alarm (6) did not work. I need a setting of 7 for the light and 8 for the alarm.One last comment - this light will not work for everyone. Some people just need that rude awakening!Recommended.Pros:* Gentle, natural, stress-free way to wake-up* Great for people who do not face East when waking up or in regions with lack of sunlight* Well-constructed, well-designed light is a welcome addition to almost any room/decor* Light tries to simulate natural waking up - with gradually intensifying light and nature sounds* 2 nature sounds, 1 radio and light have 10 volume/intensity levels* Soft-orange numbers and controls are pleasant to the eye* Intuitive controlsCons:* Slightly expensive for an alarm clock, but not too expensive considering the benefits* Some stability issues caused by power-input placement on the stand* Light/Sounds might not work for everyone* Will work better for stomach sleepers versus back sleepers","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KVK8D5UR6XUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E91EGDS#wasThisHelpful","R3KVK8D5UR6XUP","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The New Balance NBG2002 is a 'synthetic' leather (misleading on Amazon Description) soft-spike golf shoe.My normal New Balance shoe size is a Size 10, 2E width, but I opted for the 10.5 D as it gives me a firmer hold on the width and a little more room for the top of my foot. Being synthetic, this shoe will not expand and you need to ensure that you find a fit that can accommodate your foot swelling and be comfortable after the first few hours of play.Build quality is as expected of New Balance and the material does provide good stability.The waterproof microfiber uppers do not wick moisture as quickly as I would like, but it is not an issue for me since I do not perspire a lot. But I can see it becoming an issue for folks who do perspire and have warm feet - the synthetic leather does not permit good circulation.Lastly, the cost of the shoe is definitely a concern. My waterproof Nike leather golf shoes cost about the same and are much more comfortable. I will keep these shoes for those days with guaranteed downpours, but I need my real leather shoes for all other play.Pros:* Well constructed shoe provides good stability and flexibility* 10 mm drop midsole provides lightweight cushioning and ground feel* Cleats provide good traction even on wet surfaces* Waterproof* Microfiber lining wicks away moisture* Antibacterial treatment for reduced odorsCons:* Expensive at $145 for synthetic leather shoes* Wicking works well only in moderate climates - synthetic uppers can become uncomfortable, especially in a hot and humid climate* No arch support* Misleading advertising implies shoes are made of ""Leather""","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYD66BEITHBO1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9EV38I#wasThisHelpful","RYD66BEITHBO1","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Miele Dynamic U1 is a beautiful piece of German engineering and has all the curves and lines you expect in a German sport car. The U1 is designed as a modern take on classic Americana with all the functions of a modern vacuum. The U1 retains classic elements like the rotary dial and stainless steel accents while updating the suction and technology to state-of-the-art.At first sight the U1 looks larger and heavier than most other uprights. But it is only a few inches wider and taller than my Dyson DC25 vacuum - which is a good size for me (I am of average build). The weight is the biggest consideration - 21 lbs versus the Dyson's 16 lbs - as we carry vacuums between two flights of stairs.In function, the U1 is silent and powerful. It picks up everything, in a single pass, across multiple floor types without missing a beat. The weight does not seem to an issue for maneuverability as it glides when pushed and its swivel head makes it possible to maneuver around or under furniture.A 4-speed rotary dial rotates clockwise from `curtains' (lowest suction) through `deep-pile' and `low-pile' to `smooth' (highest suction). `Low-pile' is what I use for very efficient normal vacuuming. The telescoping handle, which works off a separate vacuum motor, accommodates the crevice tool, upholstery tool, dusting brush and the mini-turbo brush. The mini-turbo brush is great for carpeted stairs and also for getting into tight places - like under your car seats.So what do I not like about the U1? Well, with its fantastic suction the U1 picks up more dirt that you can possibly imagine. But for a vacuum that uses bags, it means changing bags more frequently. I am going through a bag a month - at nearly $5 per bag. I wish it were a bag-less vacuum like the Dyson.Recommended. It is expensive, but the 20 year life socialized by Miele makes it worth the cost.Pros:* German design and construction - tough and beautiful, this vacuum is built to last* Classic Americana design blended with modern technology* Single pass cleaning - vacuum picks up everything* Vacuum glides with little effort, Swivel head works effortlessly around and under furniture* Powerful suction - Among the very best on the market* Rotary Dial to control suction power* Dual set of buttons near rotary dial and on handle to control carpet brush rolling* Separate telescoping handle for hard to reach places - ceilings, curtains, etc.* Powerful LED lights are functional* All tools on-boardCons:* Expensive at 650 bucks* Bags fill up quickly - 4-8 weeks when vacuuming 1500-2000 sq ft areas 1-2 times per week* Heavy at 21 lbs to carry between floors","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ71TPHVOXTU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGLY0#wasThisHelpful","RQ71TPHVOXTU0","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each cycle has three 20 second periods designed to clean each cheek and your T-zone. There is a pause between each cycle to let you switch areas. The great thing about this ~1 minute timer is that it is a quick cycle (which is not difficult to use even on those tiring nights) for deep cleansing and you do not over-abrase your skin.I have been using PureRadiance with Melaleuca Tea-tree products to control acne and it works wonders. I had been using disposable medicated wash cloths, but the difference between the medicated cloth and PureRadiance is like night and day. Within 2 weeks of use, the acne has subsided significantly and since I have not changed anything except my cleansing method, I feel that my cleaner and medication is getting in deeper for more effective, visible results.Recommended.Pros:* Philips brings its proven tooth cleansing Sonic technology to its skin cleansing line* Visible results in less than a week - skin feels cleaner, radiant and tighter* Deep cleansing of pores remove impurities and permit creams/medications to penetrate deeper* ~1 minute cleansing cycle should work for most people* Works with any face cleanser, lotions, make-up remover, etc.* Ergonomic design makes it easy to hold - even in the shower* Rechargeable - 5-6 hours for a full charge which yields ~30 cycles* Includes Normal and Exfoliating brush heads and a travel-case* Multiple brush types available for different applications - Normal, Exfoliating. Sensitive, Extra Sensitive and Deep Pore brush headsCons:* Expensive at $125* Charging stand does not hold up - have to lean it against wall when charging","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M3L3AD7QY2D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL5JW6E#wasThisHelpful","R2M3L3AD7QY2D5","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fire & Rescue Fusel Lodge Trackset is Disney's twist on spring launched toys which makes it easier for young children (3+) to launch the airplane safely and with no help from adults.The toy requires adult help to setup. The tracks are delicate and it is critical that they do not bend or warp for smooth play. Once setup you attach Dusty the plane's harness to the track and use the action shifter to pulls back and fire the sprint loaded launcher. The launcher pushes the plane to the top of the track and the plane glides back to the launch pad. There is no reset required - just lift the shifter and pull back for continuous play. The toy is simple enough even for my 3 year old nephew to operate and he loves launching and watching Dusty glide back down. There are 4 fire targets that you can place on the tracks or along the flight path for Dusty to ""put out"".This is smaller than the Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Piston Peak Trackset but is still a delicate and slightly unstable toy that you cannot leave it unsupervised with a small child. With its single play, older kids will tire of it quickly.The big difference with this set is that you can buy additional tracks (links below) that connect to this set for a more comprehensive game play. BUT the build quality of these other sets is questionable, for example in Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Smoke Jumpers Training Base Playset, Drip, the skid steer digger, is just a hollow plastic shell - no wheels or innards. I would definitely expect a die-cast vehicle if I spend 12 bucks on a toy.* Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Air Attack Training Base Playset* Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Wildfire Rescue Playset* Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Maru's Fuel Stop Story Set* Disney Planes: Fire & Rescue Smoke Jumpers Training Base PlaysetFun toy but delicate, pricey and fun is short lived.Pros:* Launcher is easy even for toddlers to operate* Well-designed track with turns and curves provide a nice flight path* 4 Fire targets can be placed on tracks for dusty to ""put out""* Additional add-on tracks availableCons:* Pricey* Toy has a single play - pull back on action shifter to launch plane* Delicate tracks - if bent or warped will not work* Toy overall is a little unstable as the entire toy moves with each launch","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MG3AS0CWO7MU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYWGG1E#wasThisHelpful","R2MG3AS0CWO7MU","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Classic Brands Advantage mattress is well constructed and an inexpensive product at this sub $150 price-point.The Classic mattress was a replacement for a Sultan mattress from Ikea - which has provided comfortable support for the past 10 years. The Classic Mattress is similar in design and comfort to the Sultan.After unpacking, I gave the mattress 7 days to extend to its potential prior to testing. The mattress is a medium firmness - not too hard on the back and definitely not squishy. I did, however, purchase the highly rated Pinzon Basics Overfilled Ultra Soft Microplush Twin Mattress Pad.

"Update - 2/2/15 - Star rating changed from 4-Stars to 3-Stars.Having installed a tempered glass protector I decided to get a slim, minimalistic case for my iPhone - The Spigen Air Cushion [ASIN: B00JH88D1O]. The edges on this case barely hug the phone...as a result of which there is a 2 mm gap between the case and the protector. The 2 mm gap by itself is not an issue, but coupled with the fact that this screen protector is cut to exactly the touch portion of the screen,  edge contact becomes a little weird - half on the Glass protector and half a few mm lower on the non-screen portion of the iPhone. You need a more pronounced touch on the edges to get a response - I am feeling this pain with a game that requires edge contact.  This wasn't an issue with my previous case which had thick overlapping edges. I just blamed the case for the difficulty in edge response.Not a deal breaker because of the great protection, but Zagg makes the same protector without the ""case friendly"" feature (not yet available on Amazon) that I would opt for.*~*~*~*The InvisibleShield Glass is a high quality, tempered glass screen protector.Zagg has been working over the years to improve their installation process and I believe that they finally have a winner. After ensuring that your screen is clean (steps below) align the InvisibleShield Glass and place carefully on the screen. The bubbles, if any, will disappear within a few hours. No squeegee required.The biggest issue when installing is ensuring that you have a clean surface and a dust-free environment. Flexible plastic screen protectors permit you to remove only part of the protective film cover when installing. In the case of the InvisibleShield Glass you have to remove the entire protective film prior to starting. The large, sticky surface is a huge dust magnet - and there are no second chances with this self-adhesive film. I would really focus on getting the environment as clean as possible.Recommended.Pros:* High-quality, 0.4 mm thin, Tempered Glass protector* Glass protector maintains the brilliance of the iPhone screen* Glass protector maintains original feel of iPhone* Oil resistant coating repels skin oils and is easy to cleanupCons:* Protector is designed smaller to accommodate cases, but might be too small for some slim cases* Installation is high-risk if you are not used to installing or good at aligning screen protectors - No second chances with this self-adhesive backed protectorMy Installation Process Steps:Tools:* Get a good screen cleaner - I use the Klear Screen iKlear 8 oz. Pump Spray Bottle for iPad, iPhone, Galaxy, LCD, Plasma TV, Computer Monitor and Keyboard* Tiny microfiber cloths do not work for me. Need a couple large microfiber cloths, like the AmazonBasics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth, (Pack of 24)* A roll of scotch tape - on a standing dispenser if possible Scotch Desk Tape Dispenser, 1in. Core, Black1. Find a clean, slightly humid place to work it [ Bathroom after a few minutes running a hot shower? ;o) ]. Seriously, this is important!2. Remove any case you might have on the iPhone3. Clean the entire screen and phone surface with the wet cleaner and cloth.4. Polish the entire phone with a new (or dry portion) of the microfiber cloth to ensure there are no residues, dust particles finger-print marks, etc. Ensure it is CLEEEAN!5. IMPORTANT! Lay the phone on the work surface for about a minute and see if it accumulates dust particles...if it does, you run the risk of a contaminated install. Find a new, cleaner location.6. Remove backing from the screen protector, align to the home button and drop it gently. In case you encounter dust/debris on the phone screen (DO NOT use on protector), pause install and use the scotch tape to lift it with your free hand.7. Squeeze out large bubbles with your microfiber cloth8. Clean once more with your wet cleaner and cloth and you're done9.

"The SK-II is designed to reduce the appearance of fine lines around the eye.SK-II is primarily composed of Pitera - a Sake yeast derivative. It comprises a blend of vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and organic acids to rejuvenate skin cells. It feels rich but is light in texture. It has a delicate rose fragrance.Application instructions are to apply sparingly and massage gently around the eye. Within the last few days, there has been a noticeable difference. Puffiness around the eye has reduced slightly and the skin feels firmer. The caveat here is that prolonged usage effects are yet to be determined.The SK-II is a high-end, luxury product line and the $125 price tag for half ounce is not very palatable for most folks.

"Finding a hot beverage, besides coffee, for a Nespresso machine was exciting.Aldecoa produces coffee and tea pods for the Nespresso Original line and though I have not tasted the coffee, they seem to have done a decent job with the green tea ""drink"" pod. I call this a tea ""drink"" as the pods are a blend of green tea leaves, spearmint leaves, lemon flavor and green tea extract - not 100% tea leaves.I start my day with tea and consume 2-3 cups a day. My family is in the tea business and I have access to tea from the finest gardens in the world. Aldecoa's green tea is of better than average quality. However, a 30 second brew is not able to extract the full flavor potential of this pod. The green tea, spearmint and lemon flavors come through, but it is a watered down experience. It is not medium-bodied and well-rounded as a green tea should be. I did open a fresh pod, pour the contents into a tea ball and brewed it for 3 minutes. It did actually produce a more satisfying drink.When the Nespresso machine produces an espresso shot in 30 seconds, it is saving you significant time and effort (grinding coffee, prepping, cleaning, etc.) against a traditional espresso machine, but that is not the case with making tea. All it requires is boiling water, placing tea in a tea ball or opening a tea bag (most are hermetically sealed to preserve flavor) and waiting 2-3 minutes for steeping - relatively low effort.I can see using these pods on a late night when a guest might want tea instead of coffee, but definitely not for daily use.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120QHPTJ9PRJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLDPR9Q#wasThisHelpful","R120QHPTJ9PRJA","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The KiiTAG is a plastic bluetooth bi-directional finder that works as advertised.I habitually misplace my keys and was very interested in a similar product called the ""tile"". However, with the ""tile"" being a one-time use (~1 year) product I thought it was wasteful to use it. The KiiTAG is a step beyond the ""tile"" as it not only permits you to replace batteries (~ 6 months life) but also can ping the host device - in case that is misplaced.My car key is tiny. With keyless entry I am not required to remove it from my pocket to open/lock car doors. I often forget it in my jacket/pant/shorts/gym bag/etc. The KiiTAG is a life-saver for me. I have already used it about 3 times in the last 2 days.There are a few steps to getting started - downloading app, creating account and registering/pairing keys. Once paired, you locate the KiiTAG from your phone by visual concentric circles that grow larger as you approach the KiiTAG. The stated range is 200 feet, and I had no problems locating it in a large house. In case the KiiTAG moves out-of-range, you get an alarm. The software then displays the last location of the KiiTAG. In case you misplace the host device, you can trigger a chime from the KiiTAG that will help to locate the device.I do like the ""exclusive ownership"" and ""community"" concepts. If someone else finds my key, they cannot use it and the app provides an avenue for them to return it to me. Also, once reported stolen, the community can help find it. Of course, this assumes wide-spread dissemination of this product and it might be a few years out.What I do not like is the pricey apps. The camera shutter app - use the button on the KiiTAG to trigger the phone shutter - is expensive at $4 from the iOS App Store.Recommended.Pros:* Great concept Bluetooth finder has replaceable battery* Well designed fob is not out of place on a keychain* Easy Setup - need to download app, create account and pair KiiTAG* Locate your item by signal strength - up to 200 feet range* Out-of-range alarm* Last known location lets you know where the KiiTAG went out of range* Exclusive ownership does not permit anyone else to pair and use the KiiTAG* KiiTAG community can help find lost KiiTAGsCons:* Pricey Apps* KiiTAG is slightly bulky - makes it noticeable.

"The Arachnid Pro 750 is a wonderful addition to my new game room. The soft-tip darts keep it safe for a family with younger children.The Pro 750 is a well-constructed, pub worthy quality dart board with game options and choices than I can ever envision using. You can program the board to call out your name which is a great feature when drinking and playing with a large group - can accommodate up to 8 players.I had friends who have never played before complaining about the bounce-outs and stating that they would have done much better on a cork board. True, on a cork board, they might have done a little better, but as they improved over the evening, they realized that it was their skill level to blame over the type of board. The Pro 750 is built with thinner dividing segments to reduce bounce-outs and they worked - by the end of the evening we had so few of them, that no one even mentioned the bounce-outs.The only issue that seems to prevail was that some shots didn't register, primarily when multiple darts were thrown or darts were thrown in quick succession.The really great thing about this board over a traditional board is that your entire family can enjoy it. There are no worries about errant darts damaging holes or kids getting hurt or misusing them - as teens, my older brother shot one into my younger brother's behind! That was the last I saw of that dart board. :(Recommended - a little pricey at $200 but a worthy addition to a game room.Pros:* Well-constructed board does not feel cheap or plasticky* Good electronics - voice is clear (not fantastic!) for game-play* Can accommodate 8 players in 36 games with 175 options* Darts have Nylon segments for durability and improved playability* Thinner divided segments provide greater play area and reduced bounce-outs* Board call out your pre-recorded name for up to 8 players* Family friendlyCons:* Needs an electric outlet - no batteries* Little pricey at $200","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33HSSRCUKQGNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJVAF8#wasThisHelpful","R33HSSRCUKQGNR","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Though late to the retractable lightning cable game, AmazonBasics has produced an excellent product. The cable is very well manufactured and has a 24 inch length.Even if you are not a traveler, the need for carrying your lightning cable around has become a necessity. Phone usage has sky-rocketed and batteries seem to die so much quicker. The stock Apple lightning cable is too long to carry and I had been looking for a shorter cable like the AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable - 4-Inches (10 Centimeters) - White to use with my myCharge RZ30V-A Razor Plus Rechargeable 3000 mAh Battery. The AmazonBasics retractable cable, in my opinion, is better as it gives me the flexibility of 3 sizes - 10, 18 and 24 inches with the added benefit of retracting out of the way when done.The cable, connectors and retractable mechanism are high quality and well constructed. The cable feels solid in the hand.One thing to note is that the plastic around the lightning connector is very slightly larger than the stock Apple cable, and though it should work with 99% of all iPhone/iPad/iPod cases, there is a possibility that precise cut cases might not be able to accommodate it.Highly recommended!Dimensions: 3.25"" x 2.25"" x 0.62"" - When coiled, this is the size of rectangle space required for storagePros:* Well constructed - product feels robust and connections are tight* Well priced* Light and compact profile does not take up too much space in a bagCons:* I found the central retractable unit to be slightly larger than expected (2.5"" x 1.25"")","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L977GKCRTO8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4QAS14#wasThisHelpful","R2L977GKCRTO8Q","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Pixma MG6620 is a photo printer primarily targeting the home enthusiast. The printer offers multiple ways to get you computer, smart phone and tablet photos on paper. Before starting, I would like to clarify that this unit does not have a FAX feature and the All-In-One designation eludes to printing from all types of sources(??)The Pixma is not the smallest printer on the market but Canon has tried to reduce the footprint from previous generations. The printer has a slightly larger depth than other printers in this class. The printer is designed for front loading and front delivery which would seem logical, but both trays being horizontal, you will find your copies on the floor. Also, the feed tray which is under the delivery tray holds fewer sheets (~45) and is difficult to close due to this design. Overall the feed tray is little flimsy and I keep feeling that I will snap it when pushing it back in.Setup was not difficult - as expected with all new peripherals, you have to disconnect and cycle the power a couple of times after the software install. I did assign it a static IP - which I find helps with keeping my wireless devices from losing connectivity.I do like the intuitive buttons (Power/Home/Back/B&W/Color/Stop) which work in conjunction with the 3"" touch LCD screen. The LCD screen is very responsive and scrolls and clicks like any smartphone screen. From copying to LAN setup to Eco Mode to Quiet mode to selecting photos from the SD slot, this screen is your one-stop for on-device printing and customization.Regular printing is very fast and so is the copying.

"The Japonesque Velvet Touch is a mousse style foundation that leaves an air-brushed, matte finish on application.A foundation brush is required for an easy and even application. Since the foundation is light and airy, a non-greasy moisturizer prior to application provides a perfect base.

Since the product finishes matte, it also makes a great foundation to build on.Japonesque has eight shades for this product but there is no accurate color chart available (even on the website) to make an informed decision.

One can apply it the face with fingers in a circular massaging way; or you can squeeze it into a warm, well wrung-out washcloth and massage your face with it.I prefer the washcloth as there is warm moisture being applied to my face along with the cleansing oil; and the washcloth can pick up impurities along the way. The finger method seems to tug at the skin and stretch it unnecessarily - especially near the eyes, where one has thinner skin.Juice Cleansing oil leaves the skin clean, nourished, non-greasy and smelling good - just like you do after a spa treatment!Recommended.Pros:* Spa like experience in a bottle* Organic product - all natural ingredients* Leaves skin clean, nourished and rejuvenated without the greasiness* Two methods of application - massage into skin or spray onto moist warm washcloth* Non-abrasive cleansingCons:* Seems to stretch thin skin areas - apply gently with care.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2DJAQRSZVDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTESTLS#wasThisHelpful","R2J2DJAQRSZVDO","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AmazonBasics screen protector is a high quality, basic, clear, non-HD screen protector. It does not have any anti-reflective properties and its resistance to fingerprints is its biggest feature.Besides the 3 films, there is a small micro fiber cloth and installation instructions. The instructions are basic and do not provide detailed instructions for the curved iPhone 6.The install was a difficult one since the curved profile of the iPhone 6 does not allow you to align the film to any of the edges. You have to align to the home button or the receiver opening. The protector being a little heavy and rigid did make the install a little easier. To add to the difficulty was the larger size of the iPhone 6+. It did take a few tries, but I got the film aligned perfectly and managed to complete the installation, without any air bubbles or dust particles, using the same process (listed below) that I have been using for years.Recommended.Pros:* High-quality film is rigid with good weight* Crystal protector keeps the brilliance of the iPhone screen* Protector maintains original feel of iPhone* Fingerprint resistant* Film on front of protector protects against scratches during installCons:* Non-HD, reflective protective* No squeegee cardMy Installation Process Steps:Tools:* Get a good screen cleaner - I use the Klear Screen iKlear 8 oz. Pump Spray Bottle for iPad, iPhone, Galaxy, LCD, Plasma TV, Computer Monitor and Keyboard* Tiny microfiber cloths do not work for me. Need a couple large microfiber cloths, like the AmazonBasics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth, (Pack of 24)* A roll of scotch tape - on a standing dispenser if possible Scotch Desk Tape Dispenser, 1in. Core, Black1. Find a clean, slightly humid place to work it [ Bathroom after a few minutes running a hot shower? ;o) ]. Seriously, this is important!2. Remove any case you might have on the iPhone3. Clean the entire screen and phone surface with the wet cleaner and cloth.4. Polish the entire phone with a new (or dry portion) of the microfiber cloth to ensure there are no residues, dust particles finger-print marks, etc. Ensure it is CLEEEAN!5. IMPORTANT! Lay the phone on the work surface for about a minute and see if it accumulates dust particles...if it does, you run the risk of a contaminated install. Find a new, cleaner location.6. Remove part of the backing from the screen protector, align to the home button and drop it gently while using a squeegee card to iron out the bubbles. You might have to lift and realign a few times to get it perfect7. If you get a dust particle on the screen or protector, lift using the tab and clean with a strip of scotch tape folded over your fingers. The dispenser helps when your other hand is occupied holding the screen protector8. Clean once more with your wet cleaner and cloth and you're done!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLO94WSV167VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJKZI8S#wasThisHelpful","RLO94WSV167VQ","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an expensive coffee mug at 30 bucks, but its stainless steel construction inside and outside justifies the cost. Plastic mugs ruin the flavor of tea/coffee; and steel mugs with plastic exteriors cannot hold a vacuum seal as well as ones with full steel construction.The mug is aptly named `Forge' - it feels solid in the hand. The self-sealing cap is leak-proof and works off a spring mechanism that can be operated with one finger. This cap can be locked in the open position by pressing down a tab on top of the cap. Large hands can probably operate the spring mechanism and operate the lock tab with one hand, but it is near impossible for small to medium hands.The plastic cap is smell resistant and doesn't feel too plasticky when sipping your hot beverage. The center of the cap under the self-sealing mechanism can get crud after a few uses, but the designers at Camelbak made the mechanism flip open (only when the cap is off the mug) for easy cleaning. Genius!Now for the vacuum performance.  After rinsing the mug with hot tap water, I did two tests - one at 135 F (hot tap water) and the other at 212 F (boiling water) and I was very pleased with the results. After the first hour, 135 F mug dropped 7 degrees while the 212 F mug dropped 10 degrees and after 2 hours the 135 F mug was down by 12 degrees, whereas the 212 F mug was down by 18 degrees. The only caveat here is that I did not open the mug and sip any of the beverage during this test - so for a real life scenario, except a further drop in temperature as you will open the lid more often and air will replace the beverage you are consuming.Recommended - Pricey but worth it.Pros:* Double walled, all steel construction vacuum mug keeps beverage hot for long periods* Plastic cap does not make beverage taste plasticky* Built solid - advertised to function even after being dented* One hand open/close operation* Mug can be kept in the open position using a tab on top of the capCons:* Expensive at 30 bucks","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359UA25RAEL15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G46CR00#wasThisHelpful","R359UA25RAEL15","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that the AC2400 has been the simplest install of a router since the Linksys WRT54GL Wi-Fi Wireless-G Broadband Router that I installed about 10 years ago. I have been through half a dozen routers in between that have just haven't delivered on speed or features. With the AC2400 I was up and running in less than 10 minutesThe setup is easy, launch the Linksys Connect software from the enclosed CD, connect the Ethernet cable from your cable modem, plug in the power and the software will install the router for you. Alternately, for advanced users, you can skip the CD - just plug in the router to your cable modem and type in 192.168.1.1 in your web browser to configure your options.The sorest issue with my previous USB enabled routers was that they were never able to network my USB printer. The AC2400 changed that and I have a 4 year old printer working flawlessly over my network. It requires downloading and installing a small piece of virtual USB port which took all of 2 minutes - it located my printer, printer drivers and set it up. Perfect!The AC2400 is near the top of the line of prosumer routers with a price to match. The 4x4 AC channel streams might be an overkill if you only have a couple of wireless devices and do not have a high bandwidth consumption - streaming, gaming, etc. However, it appears most average homes with the multiple laptops, mobile devices, tablets, game consoles and streaming services will benefit from this router. By dividing your devices, between the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, you can optimize the communication channels for your devices. For hardwired connections you have 4 lightning fast gigabit ports.Networking USB printers and USB or SATA hard drives are simple using the USB 3.0 port or the combination USB 2.0/SATA port. The Linksys Connect software makes this a simple install.To test my setup, I streamed HD movies on 4 devices while surfing the web on 2 separate devices - the router handled the traffic flawlessly. There was no lag but my laptop that was furthest away did lose connectivity to the 5 GHz networkRecommended.Pros:* Easy setup with Linksys Connect v1.5 software* Expensive - high end of prosumer routers* 1.4 GHz Dual core processor for router management* 4 independent antennas provide 4 streams of data to optimize high bandwidth consumption* 2.4 and 5 GHz transmission* 4 Gigabit ports for hardwired connections* AC standard is backward compatible with N/G/B/A standards* USB 3.0 port and combination SATA/USB 2.0 port* On/Off switch on router* Ready for upcoming MU-MIMO standards that permits heavy traffic and high bandwidth activities* PC/MAC compatibleCons:* 5 GHz channel transmission is weaker than older Linksys routers - would expect this signal to be boosted* Antennas cannot be configured manually for individual bands","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ARCZ6MFMA8B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ19M72#wasThisHelpful","R3ARCZ6MFMA8B9","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have over-pronation, commonly called fallen arches, where your arches look normal but roll inwards when walking. About 10 years ago, this pain became unbearable and I went to an orthopaedic doctor and got custom orthotics. The orthotics were uncomfortable but did reduce the pain. The $300 orthotics only  lasted for about 3 months after which they collapsed and the pain returned.I came across these in a sporting goods store and decided to give them a try. My feet fell relaxed and the pain was gone INSTANTLY! I bought two pairs and have never looked back. Every shoe I buy, I buy a pair of these arch supports to replace the insoles.You might need a half size larger shoe depending on the style of shoe. I change these every 6-12 months depending on usage.Highly Recommended!Pros:* Instant relief* Firm support with soft upper* Inexpensive* Works for mid to high arches* Long lasting* Full foot length keeps feet comfortable* Easily customizable for different shoe typesCons:* None","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXZB387X3BPU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR7PCR4#wasThisHelpful","R1PXZB387X3BPU","A1FUBPW8U2RYUY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FUBPW8U2RYUY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This will keep the entire front of the phone free from scratches without changing the look of brightness of anything on the screen.Application was very easy, just clean everything well with a lens cleaning wipe (I use the Zeiss wipes), peel the plastic sticker back about 1/3 of the way, position the protector and lay it down.

"The good:1) You can create notes to yourself in One Note, Google Keep, Evernote. You can use voice input or a (really tiny) keyboard!2) Completely customizable watch faces. I use the Watchmaker app to create watch faces, but there are also sites and online communities where you can get faces designed by others. Literally there are tens of thousands of watch faces available. I add ""On Tap"" actions so a single tap on the date brings up my calendar, a tap on the weather icon brings up the full weather app with radar, a tap on the time display shows my daily agenda.3) Excellent integration with the phone. I can answer text messages without having to get my phone...just speak the reply to the watch and it sends it. The voice recognition is surprisingly good (it uses the Google voice recognition engine).4) Full, ""OK Google"" right on your wrist.5) The battery lasts all day with ease. I have the display ""always on"" (but that doesn't mean always bright). Because this type of display doesn't use any power to display black pixels, the less information you show on the ""dim"" setting, the longer the battery will last. I start the day around 6:00 A.M., use the watch all day for notifications (display and vibrate), Google Fit, reply to texts and emails...and the watch usually has 30% or more life left when I finally finish the day between 11:00 P.M. and midnight. No, it won't last two or three days like a simple pedometer, but this is so much more than a pedometer that it really can't be expected to do that. I just charge it every night because I don't wear a watch to bed anyway.6) Waterproof/water resistant. According to the specs, you could drop this to the bottom of a 10-foot-deep swimming pool and it will still work (provided you don't wait around too long to get it out). Rain is not an issue for this watch at all.7) Full notifications, but you can customize which apps are allowed to send notifications to the watch. Even when you can't hear your phone, having that vibrating watch on your wrist virtually guarantees you'll never miss a text or email.8) With the newest updates, the watch itself connects to WiFi and gets updates, so even if you leave your phone in the desk drawer you'll still get your notifications to your watch.9) Google maps with navigation right on your wrist. Very useful for walking from A to B in a city you're not familiar with.10) You don't have to have a Samsung phone to use this watch. It runs Android, it will pair with any android phone. (I've even read a few people saying they were able to pair it to an iPhone in a limited way.)11) You can use any 22-mm watch band.12) It's just really, really cool.The bad:Well, there just isn't anything.

The chrome body of the watch blends right in with the steel of the band and makes it look like they were made to go with each other.The band is really easy to adjust for size...no removing links or anything like that. Just pop up the tension bar, slide the latch to the place you need it to fit your wrist, clamp the tension bar back down. Now you just have to hook the clasp on the latch and you're out the door with a watch that fits the way it's supposed to.The cut and polish of the band make it look good and the band is nice and heavy so I don't feel any fear of it breaking or wearing out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFWZ9YRX1XKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTDBK8C#wasThisHelpful","R1MFWZ9YRX1XKL","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a very nice book, but it doesn't match up well with the workbook By Claude V. King - EXPERIENCING GOD, REVISED - MEMBER BOOK (Revised & Updated) (7.2.2007), so trying to use both at the same time was a bit confusing and probably kept me from getting as much out of the study as I could have otherwise.I think a person should go through the workbook first because it goes into a lot more details about how to see God at work around you, through you, in your life and has useful exercises to help build that relationship.

"This is a really nice case and belt clip for the Galaxy Note 4, but it does have a couple issues.Good:1) Installation is really easy. Snap the two parts of the hard plastic together around the phone the put the silicone wrap around it.2) Very good drop protection. The silicone wrap is nice and thick and will absorb a lot of shock.3) Good screen protection. There is a built-in screen protector, and there is a nice-sized bevel around the edge of the phone that will help keep it from making contact with the ground if it falls face first.4) Nice belt-clip holster. I was concerned by the pictures about how tightly the phone would be held in the holster with just those four corner things and the clip, but it turns out it's held in quite tightly. There is a reassuring click when you push the phone in all the way (if you don't hear the click, you haven't secured your phone yet) and it's in there nice and tight. I tried it with a really good pull and the phone didn't come out of the holster, so I'm not worried about it falling out.Bad:1) Dark spots under the screen protector. (See photos) If I try to use a squeegee to smooth it out, it just gets worse. Maybe if I let it sit for a few days it will relax and fit to the screen better, but I don't have a few days to wait and see if that works. I need to use my phone every day, and I want it to look right when I do.2) There is one port that I cannot get the silicone outer wrap to sit correctly on. It's a small port, so I'm not too concerned about it, but it looks a bit off and it's one of those, ""Once you notice it..."" things.This is a good holster and case for the Note 4 and if I can figure out how to get that screen protector to lay down correctly and not be dark in some places and light in others, it will be a 5-star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30CRGH8RA1JSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Z4XHYY#wasThisHelpful","R30CRGH8RA1JSE","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two main coffee brands in Italy, Illy and Lavazza. In my experiences there, about 70% of bars (cafes) and restaurants use Illy, but about 90% of people use Lavazza in their homes. For my taste...Lavazza wins hands-down.The beans are perfectly roasted so they are dry enough to not ruin your burr grinder or automatic espresso machine, but grinding releases a kitchen full of aroma and a cupful of flavor.I would say this is a bold but medium flavor of coffee. It uses Arabica beans to smooth out the Robusto beans, and it's a very nice balance. Truely ""Top Class"" in all aspects. High quality beans, well roasted, and an excellent balance of smooth and robust flavors.This is an excellent coffee for making lattes and cappuccinos. The flavor works with the milk instead of one overpowering the other.It's not my favorite Lavazza for making espresso...that choice is Crema e Aroma Lavazza Crema e Aroma - Coffee Beans, 2.2-Pound Bag for its bold flavor, ample crema, and strong chocolate/licorice aftertaste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LKYVSWIZ737F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E2G06#wasThisHelpful","R2LKYVSWIZ737F","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A classic in every sense of the word. From the cultural icons of Long John Silver, pirates with peg legs, parrots on shoulders, and lively sea shanties being sung by a crew...Treasure Island is the place where most ideas of what a pirate looks like came from.There is violence...it's a book about pirates, after all...but nothing too graphic or gratuitous. Yes, people are shot and run through with swords, but you don't have the ""blood spatter details"" we're subjected to in so many media formats today. Leaving things to the imagination seems to be a lost art form, especially when everyone seems to feel the need to ""one-up"" the last book with even more graphic descriptions of violence...thankfully this book was written before that began, so you can let your teens or even tweens read this without having to worry about them being exposed to salacious details.Numerous other books, movies, even music have been influenced by Treasure Island.

"I bought this cradle to have one to throw in the glove compartment for those days when the battery decides (for some unknown reason) to run down in a hurry. This happened a couple times in the six months I've had the watch and I don't want it to happen again.Well, this is actually the best cradle I've had so far, and it's the other one that's going to be in the truck for ""emergency"" usage.This cradle fits on the watch firmly and securely but lets go easily (I push the tab toward the top of the watch screen instead of straight down because I think it's less abusive on that little locking tab that breaks so easily).

"This is, for all intents and purposes, a ""cryptic crossword"" in reverse. Instead of having clues and filling out a crossword, then selecting letters from the puzzle to make the encoded phrase...you are given the phrase and have to take letters from it to fill out the answers to the clues (but it's not even in a crossword format).In fact, it's even a bit more simplistic than that. The letters always appear in a block in the answer rather than being spread out here and there...so if you have _ _ _ _ CH as the answer, you know you're looking for four letters IN A ROW in the quote that will make that a word.Works without internet access, so it's good for the kids in the car, or your bus or train ride to/from work.There is no exit button and the tablet back arrow left 11 processes running in the background. (-1 star)The developer makes a big deal about the lack of permissions, but there are still buttons for rating the app, more apps, facebook, twitter, about, etc. All the author has done here is made your tablet launch a browser or another app instead of having it done from within this app...so no need for network permissions. Does that seem less than honest to you? It does to me...so -1 star.There is a huge block of ""Coming Soon"" buttons for more puzzles...but after reading some of the other reviews, it looks like those have been there for a couple years, so it's hard to know if those are ever going to happen.As a FAOTD, this is a 3-star game. I'm not sure the simplified game play and the number of available puzzles makes it worth getting when it's not free, but if the developers actually follow up on all those ""Coming Soon"" promises, it would be worth 99 cents.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7E15HG0YC03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008194C74#wasThisHelpful","R1F7E15HG0YC03","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun, entertaining, and educational game. Given a limited number of pipes, elbows, T-junctions, etc., you have to connect all the pipe fittings on the edge of the game board. Sometimes it's not just a question of which ones you use, but the order (pipe-elbow-elbow-pipe may not word the same as pipe-pipe-elbow-elbow!) you put them on the board.I have seen similar games in the past (I don't recall any names) and this one seems at least on par with them. There are even board games based on this idea where you use cards showing the pipe pieces. I have always loved this kind of game, so I'm probably a bit biased, but the graphics are very nice, the gameplay is smooth, the tiles go where you want them (this publisher's Montezuma games were having some issues with tiles ""jumping"" an inch or two above your finger when you were dragging them...that hasn't happened on this game).There are 100 levels getting progressively more difficult by introducing things like pipes that go over or under other pipes, T and + connectors, etc.There are no permissions, no ad networks, no hidden code snippets, the game exits cleanly with no background processes, no IAPs. Oak Team really has it figured out when it comes to privacy.The game plays without WiFi or data connection, so you can take it with you on your commute, camping trips, or the kids can play in the car without burning through your data plan.There is the ""rate-me"" nag, but even on that, I have to give the developers kudos for not breaking into the game every three levels. It looks like they've learned their lesson and are only going to ask at startup. (And you can always try hitting the button then back-arrowing out without actually leaving a review...that seems to get rid of the nag on some tablets and phones.)There is a facebook button and a link to the dev's other games on the menu page, but given that they've removed ALL the permissions and security issues...I'm not even going to take a star away for that (THIS TIME. lol).Outstanding game play. No permissions. No privacy concerns.I wish every developer made their games this way.This will definitely go on my daughter's tablet because I know it won't have to worry about her privacy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28J4YC29IEZQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3AW23G#wasThisHelpful","R28J4YC29IEZQL","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Couldn't be easier to set up or use.1) Plug everything you'll be using into the back of the switch.1a) Plug the device you'll use most often (cable/satellite box) into Input 1, the device you use next-most often (Blu-ray player) to Input 2, and the last device (game console or Roku/Fire TV box) to Input 3.2) Turn on all the devices you have plugged in.3) Insert the plug from the AC adapter to the switch.THAT'S IT!Now when you turn on the Blu-ray player or game console, the switch will automatically go to that input and pipe it through. Shut that device off, and it automatically switches back to the cable box!(One caveat here...your devices on Inputs 2 and 3 have to shut all the way down for the auto-switching to work. If they just go into standby/power-saving mode, they're still outputting a signal, so the switch won't know to deselect them.)There is absolutely no signal loss with this switch. The audio and video are exactly the same as having the HDMI cable going directly to the back of the TV.The lights on the front of the switch are kind of bright, but because the remote is IR and not RF, you have to have line-of-sight to use the remote, so you can't hide the switch in a cabinet. On the other hand, if everything is set up correctly, you should never need to use the remove...the auto-switching have worked perfectly for me every time so far.The only thing I don't have right now to test is a chromecast/fire stick/etc. ""USB/self-powered"" streaming device. As long as you have a power source close enough to the switch to plug in the stick, it should work fine.If you, like a lot of us, are finding that you have more HDMI devices than inputs on the back of your TV, this is a perfect solution. Even after we upgrade to a new TV with more inputs, I'm going to keep this switch set up for the satellite box and Blu-ray player because the auto-switching feature is so much easier than having to find out who used the TV remote last and where they put it then change the input on there.Unless you have a TV with 20 HDMI inputs, you *WILL* find this switch useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EP9NYLLP70FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049S6ZUS#wasThisHelpful","R3EP9NYLLP70FQ","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If an app has the words ""Ad-Free"" in its title, I expect it to be...well...free of ad networks! The developer of this app doesn't see it that way, and has included not one but TWO ad networks in this app. Namely, Charboost and Tapjoy networks.Oh...and Flurry analytics.AND In-app purchasing...in a paid app!Then every once in a while you get a popup that has some information about the game, or something to buy, or to like them on FaceBook and get your 50 free Golf ""bux."" Maybe it's just me...but when I'm playing a game and something pops up and forces me to stop playing and deal with the popup, it takes me right out of any fun I was having. I don't remember the fun I was having before nearly as much as I remember, ""grumble grumble grumble stupid popup grumble click the X grumble...""  :-)The physics is a bit dubious (and I'm a physicist, so I noticed this right away). Specifically, the range (horizontal distance travelled by the ball) doesn't change enough with the change in launch angle. As you change the angle from 45 degrees, each step makes a small change in the range until you get to vertical and then there's a HUGE change.There is a practice tee...but no tutorial (at least none that I could find). I went to the practice tee and just started pushing buttons to figure out what did what.Overall, because of the ad networks, analytics, and IAPs...this is not an app you should have on your phone or tablet. The questionable physics and lack of tutorial just adds to that recommendation.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9FISKKHA4L5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077SGMXM#wasThisHelpful","R9FISKKHA4L5T","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have an aquarium, you have to have a way of cleaning the detritus out of the gravel bed. A tank full of snails and algae eaters isn't enough to really clean up all that food and waste that accumulates at the bottom of the tank.This is a really great idea for cleaning that gravel (and the sides of the tank), but it's not without its drawbacks.You get two attachments, one for shoving down into the gravel so you can stir it around a little and break the stuff off of it, the other has a squeegee line that you use to clean the glass sides of the tank. Both cleaner heads produce good suction...and that's the first problem. You will occasionally pick up some gravel that may get caught in the impeller seriously reducing the suction. When this happens, you'll have to shut off the motor, let the rocks fall down the tube, and then start again. Which leads to the second issue. The impeller is at the to of the tube, and there's no way to prime it, so you have to have the entire length of the intake tube under water for the filter to operate. If you have a short tank, this can be an issue because the minimum length of the inlet tube is about 10 inches. If my water level is down much at all, I have to tip the filter sideways in order to get it started pumping; but once you get it started, you can move the unit around and even lift it up in the tank quite a bit and it will still work.The tube is two parts, one that slides inside the other to allow for extension for working with deeper tanks. The one real problem I have with this design is that there's no way to lock the tubes to keep the length constant...so if you push the head too far into the gravel, it can shorten the tube too much and you have to pull it out...but if you lift it too high while you're doing this, you'll lose suction and have to restart the whole process.On the other hand, having this adjustability means you can use one tool for several different aquariums.All things considered, this is a really good, all-around cleaning tool that any beginning or intermediate fish owner should have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WFT4I7C25RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003OYOPNW#wasThisHelpful","R27WFT4I7C25RL","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Kudos to the developer for going for efficiency rather than just bloating the app up.The app has ZERO permissions, ZERO adware/spyware/analytics, and exits cleanly via the tablet back arrow with no daughter processes.As today's Free App of the Day, there is no reason whatsoever not to get this app. If you only need to tie a real, utility knot once or twice a year...you'll want this app.Is it worth the asking price of $1.99 if you miss it as the FAOTD?

"Yes, there are a couple issues (see below), but this is a well-designed nonogram puzzle with TONS of levels (actually infinite if you take the randomized, not-resulting-in-a-picture puzzles).Pros:- Hundreds of ""picture"" puzzles and infinite random puzzles. Lots of replay value just on the picture nonograms.- A nice tutorial that walks you through how to solve the puzzles.- Runs without WiFi or data connection, so you can play it on the bus or train ride to work...or around the campfire if your family likes to head out in the woods for vacation.- There is no ""Quit"" button, but the app exits cleanly with the tablet back button with no daughter processes running in the background.- It does have a button so you can brag about solving a puzzle on Twitter and/or Facebook, but no analytics or ad networks (that I could find, at least), so it's safe to let the kids have it on their tablets or phones too.- Only two permissions. Internet (for the Twitter/FB ""brag on me"" button) and access to the vibration function. No concerns there at all.Cons:- The music. OH THE MUSIC!!! Imagine the worst stereotypical ""Chinese heroin den"" music from an old Sherlock Holmes movie...then make it even more out-of-tune and irritating. THAT is the background music for this app. Turn your volume all the way off before you open the app (and then deselect the ""music notes"" icon)...you'll thank me.- The menus really need navigation buttons. Having to use the tablet's back button to go up a level in a menu is ridiculous.- The menus are not laid out in a very logical or useful manner. Settings are here and there, completely unrelated settings right next to each other and things that are related are in two different submenus.Summary:At $5, this app seems pretty expensive. But given the number of puzzles you get (plus the infinite number of random, just-for-logic-playing puzzles) it's really not that much. I've seen nonogram puzzle apps for $0.99 that only had 30 or 45 puzzles...you get HUNDREDS here for $5.As today's FAOTD...there's no reason in the world not to get this (well, unless you really hate nonograms. :-) )","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81DL3VACUZ2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JM4CWY#wasThisHelpful","R81DL3VACUZ2G","AO8F2P769YIA9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO8F2P769YIA9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can be ready.  I like this product and am happy to recommend it to you.

"I don't think people realize how much a product like this can help to keep their floors protected.  I know for quite a while I did not and now have some nicks where I don't want them.  This is a great set.  First of all there are different sizes and shapes so you have a choice on what you need to use which is really great. They are thick enough without being too thick and stay where you put them.  I can't fix what has already happened from not using a product like this but by using this product I can stop it from happening again.  These really are helpful and well made. I think you will be glad you gave them a try.

"I  I was pretty impressed when I opened this product and saw how well made and sturdy it was, that was my first impression of it. It did not take very long to get everything organized to give it a try. This worked great as I did use it for my camera, but you can use this for many products as well. Perhaps this is one of those products that you don't have to have, but find out it is really a big help to have, that's for sure.  It just saves a lot of makeshift stands, trying to get view right and all of that. It makes life easier and isn't that what getting helpful products is all about.

"When I first saw this set I was impressed because it sure didn't look like the ones I'm use to using, and that is a good thing.  Bright and colorful they smile out at you, calling your name, encouraging you to give them a try. So I had to do it. I found each product to work great, I was a little concern if they would bend over but they didn't I whipped up my topping for my cake, not a problem. I stirred up some  things, it was great. Each product works wonderful and talk about easy clean up, 1,2,3  and I was done. I also display them on the counter because they are bright and colorful and happy.

"These are absolutely the best brushes I have seen in a while.  The brushes  are sturdy and the brissels are firm yet flow with what you are using them for. They are in different shapes and sizes so you always have just the right one to work on your Masterpiece.  You also get a little booklet to help you with knowing how to care for them.  They come in a sturdy case which is really nice.  I didn't want to use them at first because they looked so nice in their case, but I tried  them with my friend and Granddaughter as this is the time of year we paint together. They are also very easy to move about and you get a firm grip with them.  I love this Company, they never disappoint with their products, but you can always count on the best.

"This is a strong, sturdy flashlight. It even looks tough! Made with mostly metal it can stand up to most anything. It has a strong clip on it too. This clip will hold tight! No worry about it slipping off. The flashlight is designed in a way to feel comfortable in your hand. It has grippers on it to make it easier to hold on to. Of course the most important thing is that it is very bright! I absolutely love the power in such a compact size. The only complaint was that it did not say anywhere on the package what size battery it takes or how to get into the battery compartment. It was not hard to figure out but may frustrate some people. It is AA. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5Z3CU83HL23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UO5WZW#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5Z3CU83HL23","A1XJOSJN6FHFO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tender and soft, bright and cheery would be the words that I would use to describe this product.  Every one who has a little one wants the best for them especially  when it is going to touch their body.  These are very nice, just the right size  and add to their cuteness instead of taking away because of the cute designs on each one you can use them to blend I with cloths your little one is wearing.  They really do help especially if your little one spits out food, hum...., or is just a little bit too messy when they drink or eat, or drawl  during teething.  These are perfect.

"I am of Italian decent and I am always using Garlic, Onions, and so many spices like this so I was excited to try these Goggles for a honest review. I have had my eyes crying from chopping up these spices many a time, and it's not fun..  Would these goggles really work? Could be interesting.  So it was my day to make sauce, we have it at least once a week, so out came all  the spices and on went my Anti Fog Onion Goggles. First of all they are very comfortable and I could see clearly out of them, and they fit nicely.  So I'm chopping away and when I am done my daughter looks at my eyes and says, ""Mom no tears.""  And she was right.  Yes, this baby works and I am thrilled.  Who would have ever thought. Love this product, will use it again and again and it would make a great Christmas present.

"I am going to say right off this is the first time that I have used a Roller but it will  not be the last. Again different medical problems can be no fun so if you have a product that can help take away some of the pain, kinks, etc. it's well worth having.  It took me a little bit to get the hang of how I should use this but soon I was a pro. My neck and back give me problems and I actully was surprised that after using this I felt relief. That was wonderful. It definitely is solid and firm and does what it is suppose to do. Certainly is durable and should last a while, which is great.

"I am going to say right upfront, this is amazing.  I do workouts, not killing myself, but I do try to keep in shape and I was thrilled to be able to try this product.  First of all let me say that is very well made.  It has a little air pump to pump it up. You will not have to worry about it popping on you because it will not.  My balance has been a little off after healing from a inner ear infection so using this product really helped me to get back on track.  I actually found it to be fun using it, and yes it is strong enough to sit on, at least for me it was and that was exercise in itself to keep my balance on it. Great.  There is so much you can do with this to help your body, and even your mind to get yourself back on  track. We all need to take care of our body so having a product like this to use that is good for you and actually fun is well worth it.

The scarf is great as well, giving style and warmth at the same time, it is just fabulous. The gloves are also wonderful.

"The moment I took this out of the pouch I knew I was going to like it. I like Arm bands and I do use them but some are so uncomfortable, but not this guy. Easy to get my phone on it and actually felt comfortable on me, sort of like a bracelet which was nice, yet it had my phone secure. I was not worried about it slipping out or breaking. Good feeling.  So far I really like it and recommend it to you.

"I have to say this is quite a amazing little guy here, something I had not experienced much before.  I tried these out and was really impressed with all that I could do while wearing them.  First they are very well made and definitely a plus when you are using them for a long period of time, very comfortable. Pairing was easy and it is really nice to have your hands free.  After I tried them I had my Nephew try them while gaming, he games more than me, and was he ever impressed and plans to purchase a pair for himself. No, he can't have mine. *smile*....So I have to say this is a very good product that will be very useful especially for all the gamers out there.  Enjoy.

"First I would like to say don't let the color that shows up fool you. These are a beautiful green/blue color that is absolutely striking to the eye. And I mean that, they are really nice looking. Inter weaved they are very well made and are of considerable size. They really can be used on either side as well, which is great.  I really am impressed with this product, everyone that walks in comments on how lovely they look and feel.

"I love seeing how my dogs will react to different food. I know immediately if they are going to like it or not. I gave each one of them just a small amount and the sniffing began, but that did not last long. They gobbled up what I had put down and definitely told me with their mouth and eyes that they wanted more. I was impressed. You can tell right away how good a dog food is if you just pay attention to your animal. So they each got a bowl and were very happy about it. I was also impressed when I read what was in it. This is a good product that your dogs will thank you for getting for them. All five of my dogs are still smiling and hoping soon to have some more. Speaking for my dogs. ""YUM"".  Good product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CUEHW9MNPA4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IK5SWR0#wasThisHelpful","R2CUEHW9MNPA4W","A1XJOSJN6FHFO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great mirror in all ways.  It isn't overly heavy, or top heavy at all but is a good weight that does not fall over easily but is not too heavy to move around.  It does great, in regular size or oversized, the picture is clear. You can move it up and down anyway that you need it for what you are doing, be it hare, or makeup, it's up to you. It sits nicely and does not try to topple over which some of them do. My daughter tried to get this from me, but that's not going to happen, after all Mom  needs a good mirror too.  I love it and I'm thrilled that I received it for a honest review. I put a  picture in here so you could see how clear it is but my camera messed up so I'll try to redo it soon.

I like aLl the extra bobs that come with it, that was a nice surprise . I did not have any problems charging or pairing it to my phones and before I knew it I was enjoying my music which sounded clear.

"I am a lover of lights, I think every room should have a product like this because it is just so useful and makes such a difference.  It is not too big and not too small but just right. It gives out a perfect lights as I need it and is so handy to have near by. It is small enough to really place it different places and move it around as you need it. Definitely a very sturdy and very well made product, but not too heavy so you can change it around to other places if you want to.  I just like everything about it, lights are wonderful to have in every room, even outside if possible. You will really love this Lamp, is great if you are doing work, writing, or reading, is great if you just want a little light or a lot.

"To me the one thing I look for in a product is comfort. If headphones are too big and bulky it just takes away from everything, but I am happy to say this set fit is perfect and comfortable. Not to big, not too small. I also dislike when they bother my ears but there was No digging in the ears  with this set, which is great. It was not hard to get ready, even for someone like me, and I was set to go and ready to enjoy.The sound quality was good and clear, no strain trying to hear or having to constantly adjust, which can be frustrating. So, all in all, I like this product a lot, comfort, great sound, well made product , and reasonable price, it doesn't get better than that. Give it a try, very enjoyable to use.

"I love my dogs and if possible I like to take them with me places so having a safety belt isn't such a bad idea.

"Living in the State of Florida our feet are always there for the world to see because we wear shoes that show it all, so that can cause some feet problems as you can well imagine besides being rather embarrassing. So needless to say I was thrilled to receive this product for a honest review. My main problem actually is just having dry skin I guess from all the heat here but for whatever reason I wanted to see if this would help, and help it did.  Using it was very easy and not at all  painful, within just a short period of time the heels and bottom of my feet were smooth as I would want them.  I was thrilled. I also had a little something on one side, not sure what it was but it was gone as well. Wow! Listen this  product is perfect for your feet care, it's reasonable in  price and it works great. A winner for sure, happy to recommend it to you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVMI9D909SVDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016MMZJ1O#wasThisHelpful","RVMI9D909SVDV","A1XJOSJN6FHFO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off let me say that I have a lot of dogs, but most of them are large, and I mean large but I do have two that are smaller so I tested this  product on one of them because I really don't think it would control my bigger dogs. I was a little bit nervous that it was retractable but it worked out ok.  It was pretty good to use for the small dog. It hooked up well and I was able to control the dog with it. It was comfortable to use. However, I don't think it would be good for my large dogs, they pull away and they are strong. I would be afraid to trust this with them. However for a small dog it did fine, gave him room to walk around and I was able to control him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QA0BEN7XYRIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0133LPC5A#wasThisHelpful","R1QA0BEN7XYRIJ","A1XJOSJN6FHFO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried several of this type of  product before and always find them interesting.  Now I gave this a four only because it isn't a product that you can just  pour water in and set down you have to do some getting ready and than checking it and keeping it going so it takes some work that maybe you don't want to do, but maybe it would not be a big deal for you. It isn't hard to prepare but at first my dogs didn't want any part of it. Oh they sniffed around but looked at me like they were saying, ""I'm not putting my mouth in there."" but after a day or so they couldn't stand it anymore so they gave it a try. It did well and they seemed to be ok with it. It really does work well and the water is definitely cleaner than the other bowl of water that sat next to it. I think it is a good product if you are willing to keep it updated if you will and if your dogs accept it. It really does work well and of course is much better for your dogs to have fresh clean water at all times and this gives it to them. So  final statement, it definitely is a product that works and is good for your animals. I think it is well worth your consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHIB81L6QW12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6IY#wasThisHelpful","R3CHIB81L6QW12","A1XJOSJN6FHFO0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was happy to receive the Drift to Sleep Eye Mask because I use an eye mask every day both to block out light when I sleep and also for QiGong breathing practice.This mask is different from any that I own because it is molded, not soft and pliable.  It appears to be made from Styrofoam with a polyester covering.  The mask has deep indentations so that my eyes dont touch ever touch the mask itself.  Straps held by Velcro keep the mask firmly on my head.This mask is comfortable to wear.  It blocks out almost all light, except for the tiniest bit coming from where the material does not quite fit perfectly against my lower cheek.  The fact that my eyes dont touch the material of the mask is a new and welcomed experience for me.The front of the mask is black and the back is purple, not that the colors make any difference to me, but they may to some readers of this review.Bottom line: This is a genuinely comfortable sleep mask that is easy to fit on my head and does just what it is intended to do  block out light.

"I was pleased to be asked to review this product because it appeared to be something I could use every evening after my shower.  I was correct.  With my hair still wet, I applied a few drops of the Body Oil to the palm of my hand, rubbed it in, and then massaged the oil into my hair, face, ears, and neck.The oil was absorbed quickly into my hair, face, and neck leaving my skin feeling hydrated and comfortable.  Also, I like very much the faint lavender smell of this oil.  Faint in the operative word  no need to worry that your hair and face will remind you that you have applied oil after showering.This morning, after washing my face, I again applied a couple of drops of the oil onto my hair, face, and neck with the same good results as last night.I was interested in the ingredients of this preparation, so I turned over the bottle and found the following: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ethlhexyl Palmitate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.  Perhaps some readers are now asking: Where is the Jojoba Oil?  Good question.  I went to Amazon to read other reviews and found that Sara Ellis called the company about the missing Jojoba Oil on the label.  The company told her that the label was a mistake and that the product does contain Jojoba Oil.  Thanks, Sara.This all-purpose body oil will please most people who want an olive oil based moisturizer that has healthy and healing ingredients.

"I walk every day so I jumped at the chance to get NUYU Health Meter to keep track of the distance I walk and I find that I just walked 1.76 miles around our block, which is accurate.When the Meter came I immediately took a quick look at the directions included with the device and followed them to remove the back cover of the meter and insert the battery, which was included in the package.  The back cover snapped back on again and I was good to go.I tested the meter by passing my finger over the display screen in the front of the meter and scrolled through the time, steps, distance, and calories burned.  The meter comes with a magnet device that allows the wearer to attach the meter to a belt or other article of clothing.  I decided to attach the meter to one of the three watch straps provided in the box.  I easily attached the meter to a black watch band and then put the watch/meter on my left wrist, with a little help from my wife to get a perfect fit.The watch/meter is small, comfortable, and actually looks pretty good on my arm.  Now, how does it work?Sadly, for me, not too well.  For whatever reason, the screen is not sensitive to my touch.  Again and again I am swiping across it and I am getting no response.  Ah, it just came on, but as quickly disappeared again.  I am disappointed.  I wanted to like this meter and I would use it every day if it worked properly.I went back to Amazon and read John Greens fine review and I learned that John has had no trouble with this meter.  Also, he explains well all the ins and outs of getting the meter to work, noting that the instructions that come with the meter are incomplete and not much use.  He gave us a means of getting a full instruction booklet online which I, unfortunately, did not find  just lots of advertisement for NUYU.Bottom Line:  Sorry, mine works sporadically.  I will watch as other reviews are posted to see if anyone else has the same problems I encountered.Update 1: John, the top reviewer, gave me some good advice concerning swiping the display.  If I lightly swipe the bottom of the display with the ring on the left and the snap button on the right, the display does work.  As John points out in his review, the instructions that come with the device are incomplete and not very helpful.  I will continue to look online for a complete user's guide.  If I find it I will report back to Amazon readers.Update 2: After experiencing frustration trying to find a useful manual, I went to PC magazine to see what one of their top reviewers had to say about the NUYU.  I quote: ""The Nuyu Personal Activity Monitor isn't a great device, and its flaws became apparent after just a few hours of use.

"I am holding in my hand the Lucien Piccard Women's LP-40031-22S Misty Rose Analog Display Japanese Quartz Silver Watch.  It comes packaged in a handsome, brown box that includes directions for how to set and use this attractive watch.This watch is advertised as a womans watch, but as every Amazon reviewer notes, it is large, perhaps too large for some women.  The diameter of the watch measures 2  inches and the stainless steel band is  inch.  Other specs for this watch are:  60 second sub dial, silver dial with silver tone and white hands, silver tone hour markers and blue Roman numerals; luminous; stainless steel crown with black enamel cabochon; sapphitek crystal; stainless steel case and bracelet, Japanese-quartz Movement, Case Diameter: 38mm, water resistant to 99 feet.I gave this watch to my wife who immediately put it on her wrist.  Of course, the band was much too large, but that is not a problem.  Our jeweler adjusts watch bands for ten or fifteen dollars.My wife liked the watch very much, but said it was just too big for her small wrist, and she is certainly correct in her judgment.  She thought the watch would be perfect for me and I think she is right.  In my opinion, this watch can easily be worn by a man and, in fact, it is so large and heavy that some men may find that it is just too big for them.Summary: This large, attractive, heavy watch can be worn by either men or women, but it is, perhaps, most appropriate for a man who wants a big, heavy watch with a wide band on his wrist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUC3AL9DGJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QLZPJ0#wasThisHelpful","R2FUC3AL9DGJA","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life sits right above the title of Caroline Webbs new book, How to Have a Good Day.  This book is suitable not only for people out working for a living, but for students and folks who are retired  that is, just about everyone.  Caroline delivers on her promise to show us how to use behavioral science research in our daily lives.  I think she has done a fine job of explaining basic principles of behavioral science and then showing how they can be best used in our life and work.Caroline starts at the beginning with our priorities and our goals.  Much like Stephen Covey in The Seven Habits of Successful People and Alan Lakein in How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, two famous books I highly recommend to readers of this review, Caroline asks us to think hard about what is most important to us and then to start with activities that help us punch a hole in our top A1 goal.  She suggests that we make a brain friendly to-do-list; that is, dont overload our brains capacity and build in rewards for ourselves.  Good advice!Multitasking is the buzz word much in favor today and Caroline completely debunks it with the latest research that proves that our minds do not multitask effectively.  Instead she suggests that we batch our tasks so that we are doing similar things one at a time.  For those people who work best in the morning, that is the right time to be working on high priority goals and objectives.  Caroline suggests that there is often a best time to get work done and we should seriously consider when that is and then schedule our time accordingly.Taking breaks to renew and refresh ourselves is high on Carolines list of suggestions for getting the most done each day.  She knows that diet and exercise are critical not only for our overall health and well-being, but also for our success at work.  Mindfulness and concentration are part of her plan to help us become reflective and thoughtful about our work.She suggests taking small steps to keep the job and our stress level under control.  Also, she asks us to take stock of our talents and abilities and to seek employment working at what we do best.  She advises us to just say No to activities that waste our time and she shows us how to be graceful even as we are avoiding work that is not right for us.  Sometimes, of course, we must work on tasks we would prefer not to do, but Caroline shows us how to establish boundaries to prevent this from happening.  She suggests that we picture the benefits of the activity we are putting off until tomorrow and reward ourselves for doing something to start work on the project we are hesitant to begin.In Part three of her book, Caroline discusses the importance of relationships at work and in our personal lives.  In order to build rapport with others she recommends that we ask open ended questions and try to set collaborative goals that allow for both sides to achieve some benefits.  She knows well the power of a positive mental attitude and a smile, in contrast to a frown, to enervate and inspire people.  Often, we are our own worst enemies and we must do some self-analysis to understand our own biases and shortcomings before we attempt to help other people with their problems.Active listening is a foundation for healthy relationships.  Those open ended questions previously mentioned give people a chance to say what is on their mind instead of having them attempt to figure out what they think we want to hear.  Nonverbal supportive behavior is a key to good listening.  We have all been in conversations where the person we are talking to is constantly looking at his or her watch.  Caroline suggests that maintaining eye contact is one of the keys to good listening and she is certainly correct.Part four of this book discuses Thinking and ways to become our smartest, wisest, most creative self.  Those open ended questions we ask others work just as well for ourselves, exploring options and opportunities by avoiding absolute positions on any problem we are trying to solve.  Banish always and never from our vocabulary and move away from constraints that paint us into a corner.  Caroline suggests that we ask: What could I do? Instead of What should I do?Influence, resilience, and energy are the concluding subjects Caroline covers in her fine, well written, and thoughtful book.  As mentioned in the beginning of this lengthy review, Caroline directs her attention to people at work, but it would be a serious mistake to think that this is the only audience suitable for her many suggestions about how to live a rewarding, productive, and fulfilling life.Everything in this book is grounded in solid research in the behavioral sciences, but readers of this review should not think that this means Carolines writing is stuffy or difficult to understand.  Quite the contrary.  She writes for the general public and includes many interesting examples taken from her consulting experience to illustrate the points she is making in her text.How to Have a Good Day is not a book that should be read quickly, but slowly and deliberately.  Francis Bacon says: Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.  Carolines book is one of those special books that should be chewed and digested.  Recommended without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJTP9V6ZGT9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553419633#wasThisHelpful","RFJTP9V6ZGT9H","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this new Toshiba Satellite laptop because I had recently upgraded my Dell laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and I was not completely satisfied with the upgrade.  I wanted a machine with Windows 10 operating system factory installed.  I own a HP laptop with Windows 7, which I like very much, but I am not happy, like many others, with Windows 8.1, even though the Dell is a fine computer.Out of the box the Toshiba Satellite is the fastest and easiest computer to set up and get running that I have ever owned.  Within five minutes I was connected to the Internet and using Windows 10 without any problems.I immediately connected to YouTube to play some music for concentration while I tested the new Toshiba.  The sound I heard coming from the laptop is the worst of any computer I have ever owned  thin, tinny, most unpleasant sound.  OK, its a laptop.  I plugged in a small external speaker and now had decent sound.Now I started to surf the Net for a bit and noticed that the touch pad was so sensitive that I was sizing and re-sizing the large, 17 inch screen accidentally.  OK.  I installed without a problem a wireless mouse.  Now I was comfortable moving around the screen and exploring Windows 10, which has many similarities to Windows 7, but not Windows 8.1.  The Toshiba is not equipped with touch-screen technology.  That is a bit of an inconvenience, but not a problem for me.I took a look at the Quick Start Guide and noticed immediately two warnings.  The first told me that the Toshiba contains chemicals including lead, which can cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm.  I was warned to wash my hands after using the computer.  The next warning told me to avoid prolonged contact with the underside or surface of the computer.  When I read this, the laptop was sitting comfortably in my lap, like always.  I wondered where Toshiba expected me to put the laptop if not in my lap.Again, not a problem.  I do have a special base where I place the laptop when not in use.  It is thin and protects the computer from overheating.  I put the base on my lap and rested the computer on it, which is good advice given the next warning Toshiba gave me, which is that the base can become hot and  to avoid prolonged contact with the skin to prevent injury.  Everyone reading this review knows that some laptops do get hot, but most of us would agree that this is a design flaw that needs to be corrected.  Neither my Dell or HP laptops overheats.  Perhaps I am spoiled.Using this computer with Windows 10 is easy and effortless.  I brought up a movie from Netflix and watched it on the big 17 inch screen.  I was satisfied with the picture I received.  I then downloaded Google and Chromecast without difficulty and used Chromecast to project a music video from YouTube and then a Netflix film to my TV and I accomplished this without a any problems.The Toshiba Satellite is slower than either my Dell or HP laptops, but not so slow that I would consider it a problem.  Windows 10 works well so far and appears to be a dramatic improvement over Windows 8.1Many other reviewers on Amazon have criticized this computer and I wont repeat everything they have said.  My own conclusion is that the Toshiba Satellite is an inexpensive computer equipped with the latest operating system.  It works well, but a few more dollars spent will buy much faster and better computers.  The Toshiba is OK, but not any better than that.  The old adage, You get what you pay for is certainly appropriate for this laptop.Update 1: Please note my original comment about being slow. This is by far the slowest computer I have ever owned and used.  It is hard for me to believe that this is a new machine -- it is that slow.  I will turn it off, store it, and give it to someone who is willing to wait for the computer to work.  No reviewer on Amazon is enthusiastic abut this mediocre, budget computer.  Having had a chance to work with it, I can see why.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZWT4LDYBER2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLOB64O#wasThisHelpful","R2SZWT4LDYBER2","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a difficult review to write for my Amazon readers because Vichy Laboratories has not been forthcoming about the ingredients of their Magistral Elixir.  This is all the information that is provided on Magistral Box: Contains a unique blend of oils rich in 10% Omegas 6-9 to immediately nourish the skin with moisture and help replenish skin with essential lipids. Paraben-free.  Folks, thats not good enough.  With some difficulty I found that the Magistral Oil contains Safflower Seed oil, Rice Bran Oil, and Shea Butter.  OK, thats better, but still not enough.  Additionally, much of the box containing the Magistral oil is written using the Cyrillic alphabet.  Vichy is a French company owned by LOreal.  Why the box has Cyrillic writing on it is a mystery to me.What about the oil itself?  It comes in a one ounce bottle with a useful dropper to dispense the golden colored oil.  I placed six drops of the oil in the palm of my hand and rubbed it gently into my face, hair, and neck.  The oil has a light, flowery smell that is most pleasant.  It is immediately absorbed into the skin.Almost all of the Amazon reviewers have positive things to say about this product and I must agree with them.  I like it and will continue to use it.  I will return in a month and update this review for Amazon readers to comment on the long term effects of using this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDH5TCNF6U9LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HR1KNIY#wasThisHelpful","RDH5TCNF6U9LX","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was asked to review this organizer I immediately said yes because I knew exactly how and where I would be using it  in the bathroom to organize the surprisingly large number of products that I use every day.This organizer is well built and made of a light black metal mesh.  I count nine separate compartments of various sizes and shapes.  From one end to the other I measure it at 8  inches and it is 4  inches wide and 4  inches deep  just the right size to place on a shelf in the bathroom.  The organizer does not take up much space, but holds all that I need within it.For example, I have toothbrushes in one compartment, floss in another, toothpaste in a third compartment, razors in a fourth, scissors in a fifth compartment, combs in a sixth, tweezers in a seventh, vitamin C oil in the eighth compartment, and in the ninth, a handy drawer that pulls out of the base of the organizer where I have spare floss saved.  Everything I need is efficiently organized and easy to get at and use.Obviously, this organizer would work just as well in my office, but it is much more valuable to me in the bathroom.  I am delighted with this product and recommend it without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA6MWD3NBP7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Q7DJJW#wasThisHelpful","R1JA6MWD3NBP7P","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw these earrings advertised on Vine, I was impressed by how attractive they looked; but as we know, sometimes the pictures we see on Amazon look much better than the actual product.  That is not the case with these 18k Yellow Gold Plated Sterling Silver Round Filigree Lever Back Earrings.  I am looking at them now in their presentation box on my desk and they are beautiful.  Of course, they looked even better when my wife modeled them for me.Her first comment was to say how much she liked them, but then she asked Are they too big?  She answered her own question by saying, I dont think so.  I agreed with her.  But the point I am trying to make is that these earrings are medium to large size, at least by our standards.  How large?  The diameter of each earring is exactly one inch by my measurement.  They are thin and very light.The earrings are made of sterling silver and are gold plated.  The attachment for the ear has a locking device which my wife liked.  The chances of these earrings slipping out are nil.For earrings of this attractiveness and quality, the price seems reasonable.

"I was pleased to receive a bottle of Thyme Essential Oil to review because I use aroma therapy in my work and I have read on the Internet that Thyme can be used to stimulate the mind, strengthen memory and concentration, and calm the nerves.This morning before I started work at my desk, I placed three drops of the Thyme Essential Oil in my diffuser.  It has a pleasant, woodsy smell with a hint of oregano, a bit like a freshly cut Christmas tree.  Does it help with concentration as I write this review?  I think so.For me, anything I can do to make my working environment healthier and more conducive to productivity is worth some time and effort.  I am pleased to add this Thyme Oil to my aroma therapy collection.I have not mentioned the many other uses for Thyme in addition to aroma therapy.  On the Internet I found that Thyme can help us lower blood pressure, stop us from coughing, boost immunity, disinfect the environment, use as an insect repellant, boost mood, add to foods like pesto sauce, and so forth.This Thyme Oil is advertised as 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade.  I have no reason to doubt this claim.  I will continue to use it and am pleased to recommend it on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVP83EN6D8H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HWEMD2#wasThisHelpful","R3PVP83EN6D8H8","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pleased to be asked to review these Rivacci Sunglasses.  They come in a handsome and effective leather carrying case with a small special purpose cloth for cleaning the lenses of the glasses.I carefully measured the glasses and each lens, top to bottom, is an inch and three fourths and from side to side the lens is a little over two inches at its widest point.  The frame itself measures five and a half inches at the top at its widest point and not quite two inches from top to bottom.  These sunglasses are medium sized and perfect for me.  The black frames I ordered are definitely for men, but certainly women can wear them as well.The arms of the frames are somewhat stiff and pull rather than snap open.  The frames appear to be well made.  Of course, everyones head is different, but as luck would have it, these glasses fit me very well  no danger of falling off and not tight, but genuinely comfortable to wear.The lenses are polarized and also have full UV 400 protection.  This is most important.  Study after study has demonstrated the importance of protecting our eyes from cataracts and skin cancer of the eyelids.  We can protect our eyes by wearing sunglasses like the Rivacci Wayfarers when we go out in the sun..These sunglasses look good, are extremely comfortable, very affordable, and do a good job protecting our eyes.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N44PSDLZMP0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDNNDHI#wasThisHelpful","R2N44PSDLZMP0N","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should know better.  For the most part, Amazon reviewers are a savvy lot and they warned me that the Brita Pitcher I ordered was badly manufactured and poorly designed.  I went ahead and ordered it anyway, hoping they were wrong.  Sadly for me, they were not wrong.When I received the Pitcher I tried to do just what the instructions tell me to do; that is, thoroughly clean the pitcher with warm, soapy water.  Easier said than done.  As Sydney and Darcy, two different Amazon reviewers, warned me, it is not possible to thoroughly clean the pitcher because the top portion that holds the filter cant be removed from the much larger bottom portion that actually holds all the filtered water.  Darcy tells me that because it is impossible to clean between the filter portion of the pitcher and the bottom well that holds the water, the pitcher becomes contaminated with mildew.My wife and I did some serious problem solving.  We tried everything possible to remove the top portion holding the filter from the bottom portion which contains the water and we failed.  This pitcher must be thoroughly cleaned before it can be used and the design of the pitcher makes this task impossible.  One star.  Read all the terrible reviews and dont buy this cheaply made pitcher.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWK12U3IXDOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M5I#wasThisHelpful","R2MWK12U3IXDOX","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleased to get the plastic container of Herseys Snack Mix and Reeses Snack Mix to review because we like to have a quick and easy snack available to us when we are taking our various walks on Cape Cod, where we will be next week.I have at my desk both packages of snack mix open.  Lets first look at the contents of the Hersheys snack mix.  First there are small almonds, then pretzels, Hershey candy pieces, small round candy balls with that are crunchy and taste a bit like those old time malted milk balls.  Thats it.  Sweet and salty.  Not quite a candy bar in a package, but close enough.  Both the almonds and the pretzels are fresh and crunchy.Next comes the Reese Snack Mix.  Crunchy peanuts instead of almonds are the nuts included.  Then the pretzels, M&Ms, and Reeses peanut butter cups.  Again, this snack mix is not far from a candy bar in a bag.By the handful, both snack mixes are a tasty treat.  The Reeses Snack Mix tells me that it has 280 calories, 6 grams of saturated fat, 230 mg of sodium, and 18 grams of sugar.  The Herseys Snack Mix has 270 calories, 6 grams of saturated fat, 320 grams of sodium, and 17 grams of sugar.Now everyone reading this review knows that these snack mixes are a sweet indulgence, not health food.  I will keep them handy when my grandkids come for a visit.  The two ounce packages wont last long.For the adults reading this review who like candy, you have come to the right place.  Those looking for a healthy treat will be avoiding these snack packs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5ZNQCGWG09I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QQ4UBY#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5ZNQCGWG09I","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to receive the Yoga Straps to review because each day I do QiGong and Tai Chi and both require flexibility.The straps I received are six feet long and an inch and a half wide.  One end has a well-made plastic buckle and at the other end the belt is turned over and sewn shut to allow the belt to be attached tightly to the buckle.  The straps are made from thick and durable cotton.  They will last for many years.For readers of this review what I wish to mention is the support given by HF Yoga, the maker of the straps.  They sent me a beautiful PDF file which illustrates several most useful stretches using the straps.  I will just mention one that I immediately tried  the forward bend pose.  This stretch helps to lengthen the spine, very useful in both Tai Chi and QiGong.

"I was happy to receive these Duduma sunglasses for review because I rarely go outside the house without my sunglasses on.  Here are five reasons why anyone reading this review should also wear sunglasses outside:1. UV Protection. The sun's UV radiation can cause cataracts; benign growths on the eye's surface; and photokeratitis, sometimes called snow blindness, which is a temporary but painful sunburn of the eye's surface. Wide-brimmed hats and caps can block about 50 percent of UV radiation from the eyes but optometrists say that is not enough protection.  The Duduma advertisement tells us that these lenses block 99% or 100% of UVB and UVA rays UV 400.2. Blue-Light Protection. Long-term exposure to the blue and violet portion of the solar spectrum has been implicated as a risk factor for macular degeneration, especially for individuals that are sun sensitive.  The ad for these glasses does not mention protection from blue light.3. Comfortable vision. The sun's brightness and glare interferes with comfortable vision and the ability to see clearly by causing people to squint and the eyes to water.  The Duduma glasses are dark and reduce the impact of bright light outdoors.4. Dark adaptation. Spending just two or three hours in bright sunlight can hamper the eyes' ability to adapt quickly to nighttime or indoor light levels. This can make driving at night after spending a day in the sun more hazardous.5. Skin Cancer. Cancer of the eyelids and skin around the eyes is more common than people think. People should wear sunglasses outdoors whether they are working, driving, participating in sports, taking a walk, running errands or doing anything in the sun.  Everywhere you search on the Internet, you will get similar advice.  Wear sunglasses when you step outdoors.These Duduma glasses are large.  Top to bottom each lense measures 2 inches and side to side 2  inches.  The frames are made from a black plastic material with a matte finish.  The glasses are light, but appear to be durable.  Time will tell.These glasses fit me well and are most comfortable.  I hardly know I am wearing them.  I just looked in the mirror and the one thing I would like to again emphasize is the size of these glasses  large.  The price is reasonable for sunglasses of this make and quality.

"The ViewPoint Backpack 250 is an outstanding piece of gear.  Yes, it is expensive, but in this case, you get what you pay for.First, the size of the back pack.  As it sits on the floor it is 18 inches tall, 11 inches wide, and 5  inches deep at its widest point at the bottom of the pack.  I would call it a mid-size back pack.  This pack can be easily worn by an average size middle-school student and a small adult.  My wife weighs 110 pounds and the pack was just right for her.  I weigh in at 180 pounds and the pack is also fine for me.  A big guy might find this pack a bit small.The harness is contoured with padded shoulder straps. There is a sternum strap for extra support and stability.  The back of the pack has three pads for comfort when the pack is being worn.  The pack itself appears to be made from light but sturdy nylon.Three major pockets are provided in the front of the pack.  The first placed at the back of the pack is thin, perfect for an IPad or notebooks.  The second pocket is the largest and has compartments for a variety of gear.  The front pocket gives convenient access to those items that are most likely to be often used and wanted.Additionally, there are pockets placed conveniently on both sides of the backpack.  The larger of the pockets has no zipper, the small pocket does have a zipper.  The front of the pack also has an open pocket and a strap for hanging things from the backpack.I think everyone reading this review now gets the idea that Lowepro, the makers of this backpack, have gone all out to design and produce a backpack suitable for anyone who wants to be able to carefully organize and carry a variety of different types of gear.

"I am holding in my hand the At-A-Glance Weekly and Monthly Planner 2016.  This planer has a beige, thick cardboard cover with 2016 Weekly Planner printed right in the center of the cover.  It has a sixteen ring binder which allows the pages to lie completely flat on desk or table.  Tabs identify each of the months and make it quick and easy to get to the month and day desired.The first page of each month is a complete calendar of all the days in the month with a small space to make notations.  After the monthly calendar come individual pages that have the day and date noted with the page divided into four quadrants leaving plenty of room for notes for appointments or to-do-lists.  One quadrant is reserved just for notes.The length of the planner is 12 inches and the width is 8 and one half inches.

"I was asked to review Tough Rides China Season One and I said yes because I knew so little about China and this series of films might help me learn more about this large and important country.  I was not disappointed.Colin and Ryan Pyle are two brothers; the younger, Colin, lives in Canada, while Ryan has been living in Shanghai, China for ten years.  He is a seasoned veteran who knows some of the Chinese language; also, he has traveled extensively in the country.  Ryan has convinced his brother Colin to take a motorcycle trip around the circumference of China, a very long and what will turn out to be an arduous trip.The two brothers plan to take approximately sixty days to go completely around the country on their brand new BMW motorcycles.  They have a trailing vehicle with much of the gear they will need to make this long and difficult trip.  Also, a person in the trailing vehicle will shoot video footage of Colin and Ryan on their bikes and the scenery they pass through each day.  The boys have their own video cameras on their person and film their adventure as they are riding along and also when they stop at places of interest along the way.It is fair to say they found many places of interest in China.  I was most interested in the Chinese cities they visited.  Throughout the entire trip the Chinese people the boys met in the cities and on the road were friendly and welcoming.  They invited the boys into their homes for dinners and socializing.  When the boys had mechanical problems with their bikes, they found mechanics who often were able to fix the problems.Tough Rides is reality television.  Anyone who decides to buy this DVD should understand that often the pictures will look like they have been taken by an amateur, not a professional filmmaker.  Also, the weather did not help with the filming. Sadly, the boys encountered much rain along the way, which was both dangerous and uncomfortable riding their bikes and made getting good film footage difficult.That said, the film the boys and their crew shot was on balance very good.  The boys were more impressed with the scenery they encountered along the way than I was, but they were on the ground in person and I was watching on TV.As mentioned earlier, what I was most impressed with was the people and their cities and towns.  Ryan, the older brother who turned thirty-two on the trip, loves China and it is easy to see why.  It is a large country, just a tiny bit smaller than the United States, if we include Alaska.  1.357 billion people live in China, whereas we have 318.9 million - that's over a billion more people in a country just about our size in terms of space available to live.  The boys discovered that any stereotypes we have about the Chinese are wrong.  There is tremendous diversity in this great country.I watched the entire series of films at one sitting - not quite three hours of viewing.  The time passed quickly because I was most interested in the subject matter and it was easy for me to relate to the boys and their adventure.  For anyone interested in China, the land and its people, I don't think they will be disappointed with this series of reality television.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZO54V63Q09T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2JD630#wasThisHelpful","RDZO54V63Q09T","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleased to accept the White Mulberries for review because I remember well a large mulberry tree in the lot behind our house that once a year gave out a bumper crop of delicious red mulberries.  These white mulberries, even though they are sun-dried, do taste quite similar to the red mulberries I have eaten in the past.I am looking at one of the white mulberries that is sitting on a dish beside my computer.  The dried berry measures a half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide  that is, about a fourth of the size of a typical mulberry from our tree.  The white mulberry in my dish has a stem attached to it.  I removed the stem and put the mulberry in my mouth.  It is dry, yet easy to chew and has a sweet berry flavor.  Certainly these mulberries will go well as a topping for morning cereal  hot or cold  and of course, hot or cold green tea, one of my favorite beverages.  In addition, this evening I placed a small cup of the berries next to me and nibbled on them while I watched a program on TV.On WebMD I found the following information: White mulberry is often tried in order to help treat diabetes. It is also tried for treating high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, the common cold and its symptoms, muscle and joint pain such as from arthritis, constipation, dizziness, ringing in the ears, hair loss, and premature graying.I went online to find out more about the Immortalitea Company that sent me the white mulberries and I discovered that their main business is tea.  The white mulberries are the only product that they sell that is not tea.100% dried while mulberries are the only ingredient listed on the package and the country of origin of the berries is Turkey.  The berries are USDA organic.Summary: These berries taste good and they are good for us.  Readers of this review who decide to buy this product need to remember that many of the berries have their stems attached to them.  I removed the stems before I ate the berries.  Recommended.Update 1: As mentioned in the first review, these mulberries are good to eat out of hand; they are crunchy and have a sweet berry flavor.  The berries are much more flavorful when a handful of them is put into your cup of hot green tea.  Now the berries soften up; just a bit of crunch is left.  But more important, the hot tea brings out the sweet flavor of the berries.  Delicious.  NB  I removed all the stems before the berries went into the tea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W51E6QMIFYFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHNA2KA#wasThisHelpful","R2W51E6QMIFYFW","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to receive a bag of Goji Berries from Healthworks because of their value to our health and well-being. Web MD tells us that: ""Some studies using goji berry juice found possible benefits that included a feeling of well-being and calm, better athletic performance and quality of sleep, and weight loss."" That's just a start. Many sites on the Web describe in detail the health benefits of these berries.The advertisement for these berries on the Amazon site tells us that: Healthworks Certified Organic Goji Berries are soft and chewy berries that can be added to many recipes or enjoyed on their own for a Vegan-Friendly, Gluten-Free, and Low-carb option! Adding a nutrient packed energizing ingredient like Healthworks Goji Berries is a decision your body and taste buds will be happy you made.I am sorry to report that the advertisement is not correct.  The Goji Berries in the bag I received are hard and difficult to chew.  Few people, I think, will choose to eat these berries out of the bag, no matter how healthy they are for us.  Additionally, these berries have very little taste.  Right now I am thinking hard about how to describe the berries I am eating.  The best I can do is to say they have a slightly sweet berry flavor, certainly not at all flavorful.To be fair to Healthworks, if these berries are placed in hot oatmeal and allowed to sit for fifteen minutes, or better yet, overnight, the berries do soften up considerably.Yes, these Goji Berries are a good, wholesome food and if used in hot green tea or hot cereal, the addition of the berries will add nutritional punch, if not much flavor, to the beverage or food being consumed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R249ERV50E1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W8AZPWI#wasThisHelpful","R3R249ERV50E1T","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This chair comes unassembled with seven pieces, not including the wheels, which are easily snapped on to the base of the chair.  All the various screws are shrink wrapped and conveniently numbered.  A large Philips screw driver is needed to assemble the chair.  An Allen Key is provided in the shrink wrap.The directions to assemble the chair are reasonably clear; it takes thirty minutes from start to finish to put the chair together.Now that the chair is assembled, two mechanisms allow the user to control the height of the chair and the backward tilt of the chair.  Both work reasonably well.The chair does tilt back easily when so adjusted, but the tilt is slight, at least in my opinion.  When I adjusted the height, it was perfect for me.But what about comfort?  This chair is uncomfortable because of the lumbar support padding at the back of the chair that forces the user into a completely upright and unnatural sitting position.  My experience is the same as all Amazon reviewers who do not like this chair.  It is badly designed and unpleasant to sit in.For readers of this review, take a close look at the pictures provided on Amazon and you will see immediately what I am talking about concerning the lumbar support.  Now that I have the chair and look again at the pictures on Amazon, the chair actually looks uncomfortable to me, and it is.  Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MELLCXVLZVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4NAHWA#wasThisHelpful","R11MELLCXVLZVH","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I collect headphones and have tested and reviewed many for Amazon.  I was delighted to receive these from Vine to test and add to my collection.These headphones appear to be designed for teenagers.  The orange/red color does not appeal to me, but what do I know?  They are plastic and look inexpensive, which they are.  After making adjustments, the fit is tight for me and I have a normal size head, I think.  The ear pads are small and appear to be made of leather or some leather lookalike.But how do they sound?  Good.  I tested them first with a variety of music on my IPod.  Bob Dylan sounded great with Johnny Cash on The Girl form the North Country.  Yes, Bob Dylan can really sing when he wants to.  The music was crisp, clear, and well-defined. I then tried these headphones on my various computers.  In fact, I am listening to music to help me concentrate on YouTube as I write this review.  The sound I am hearing is free from distortion, rich, full, and most enjoyable.Look, everyone, these headphones cost $40.  Its not fair to compare them with the Philips A5 Pros that I recently reviewed that cost $363.00 or my favorite Sennheisers.  We know we get what we pay for.  That said, I think many teenagers are going to find these headphones acceptable.  3.5 stars is about right, I think.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUUYENMANU59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVERONI#wasThisHelpful","R2GUUYENMANU59","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to receive from Sabai their Lavender Oil for testing because I am a collector and user of these healthful, precious oils.Lavender oil is well known for its benefits to our health and well-being.  Many sites are available on the Internet for those who want to know more about Lavender oil.  This brief quote will give the reader of this review a good idea concerning the information that is readily available for research and study: The health benefits of lavender essential oil include its ability to eliminate nervous tension, relieve pain, disinfect the scalp and skin, enhance blood circulation and treat respiratory problems.  Also, Lavender is considered the most useful of all essential oils.  Known to help relieve headaches, insomnia, tension and stress, its therapeutic properties have been well documented all over the world.  Much more information is available concerning this useful and great smelling oil on the Internet.But what does Lavender smell like?  The best way I can describe it is that it has a piney, flowery smell, with a hint of camphor.  I placed a few drops of the oil in my diffuser and now my office has a very light piney woods smell  good and clean and healthy.The bottle of the oil is open and right next to my keyboard as I write this review.  I now pick up the bottle and place it under my nose.  The smell is powerful and delightful.  Just as advertised, it is relaxing and stress reducing.  The scent remains in my nose for several minutes after I put the bottle back down on the desk.For those people who are experimenting with aroma therapy or those who just want their work space to have a light, piney aroma, this lavender oil is one that I recommend that you try.  I am delighted to add it to my collection of precious oils.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CRJYHAUTQ7AE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N78I6HQ#wasThisHelpful","R2CRJYHAUTQ7AE","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many readers of this review, I am always looking for the perfect meal replacement bar, or at least one that is suitable for a healthy snack or to take on a road trip.  The number one ingredient in this bar is Hemp Hearts, and that is the taste that comes through when eating this bar that looks like a thin, elongated brownie.  That is where the similarity ends.  My wife said, ""It tastes like grass.""  I asked her, ""What about Apple Cinnamon?""  The box tells us that these bars should have that taste.  My wife said, ""Nope, I'm sorry.  Grass.""I use ground hemp in my oatmeal in the morning so I was prepared for the earthy taste of this bar, but somewhat less prepared for the sweetness that came with the earthiness.  No surprise.  The second ingredient is coconut sugar and the third ingredient is organic brown rice syrup, another sweetener.  Dried apple and cinnamon come at the tail end of ingredients, which is one reason it is hard to taste them.But listen, everyone, hemp is good for us.  Good for our heart, head, weight loss, digestion, and skin, to name just a few important reasons to add hemp to our diet.  I do taste a bit of apple with the hemp and I think this bar tastes reasonably good -- but that's just me.  Others disagree with me, but I must say that health food is not often the tastiest food option available to us.  I don't like the added sugar, but the bar would probably be inedible without it.I'm going out on a limb to give this bar four stars.  I'll come back later after I have finished every bar in the box and update the review.  So far so good.Update 1: I have been eating these bars every day and I like them.  I split the bar in two and have one piece in the morning and one in the afternoon.  I do taste the apple cinnamon and the sweetness does come through.  Perhaps these bars are an acquired taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GDTVS5ODDJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014852WIK#wasThisHelpful","R24GDTVS5ODDJ0","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was delighted to receive and review the beautiful Lucien Piccard watch now being sold on Amazon.  The watch arrived in a handsome presentation box that included the very few instructions needed to set the watch.  The battery was included and the watch was running when it arrived at my door.After following the instructions and setting the watch, I now examined closely this lovely timepiece.  The watch itself measures an inch and a half in diameter. The description of this watch follows:  White mother of pearl dial with white crystal accents, gold tone hands and white and gold tone Arabic numerals; gold ion-plated stainless steel bezel encrusted with white crystals; sapphitek crystal; gold ion-plated stainless steel case; white leather strap.I checked online to learn more about Lucien Piccard and this is what I found: Lucien Piccard has been handcrafting fine watches for generations. Founded in 1923 in Switzerland, Lucien Piccard timepieces have adorned royalty, dignitaries and celebrities world-wide.Thats just a start.  One of the goals of this watch company is to make good watches affordable.  Readers of this review must decide for themselves about the cost of the watch, which is expensive.I immediately gave the watch to my wife who put it on her wrist and then admired it.  We both agree that it is an attractive watch.

"The first thing I did when I received the Swaddle Me blankets from Amazon was to put them in the wash, as directed, and then in the drier to see how much the blankets would shrink.  They came out of the washer smelling fresh and clean.  I measured the blankets after they came out of the drier and they shrunk very little.  They are just short of a 40 inch by 40 inch square.The picture on the box the blankets come in shows a baby being swaddled in one of the blankets.  Some interested readers of this review might ask, why swaddle a baby.  Here is the answer: Swaddling is the art of snugly wrapping a baby in a blanket for warmth and security. It can keep your baby from being disturbed by her own startle reflex, and it can help her stay warm and toasty for the first few days of life until her internal thermostat kicks in. It may even help to calm your baby.These blankets will serve that purpose well.  They are constructed from light muslin and appear to be well made.  One of the blankets has a colorful blue green stripe pattern.  The other two blankets look quite similar to the picture provided on the box shown swaddling a baby on the Amazon site.These blankets are designed for swaddling a baby, but they may be just as well used as a light summer blanket for a baby or anyone else for that matter.

"Our old wheelbarrow was rusting out on us and it was time for a change.  We decided to purchase this Rubbermaid carry all and we are happy we did.First let me say that Commercial is the wrong description for this wheelbarrow clone.  It has been designed for light duty around the yard, not for carrying huge and heavy loads.  My wife puts her tools and other lawn gear in the Rubbermaid and easily either pushes it or pulls it around the yard.  She loves it.We paid $58.00 for our Rubbermaid on Amazon and I notice that the price has risen dramatically.  The Rubbermaid was delivered completely assembled in a large cardboard box.  Once out of the box it is ready to use.  It is perfect for grass clippings, leaves, yard debris, trash, tools, etc.  The handle is high enough to push and pull comfortably and it moves easily over the lawn.

"I have tried many shampoos sent to me by Amazon Vine and this one by Nexus compares favorably with all of them.  Nexus tells us that this shampoo is enriched with babassu and marula oil and 100 percent pure, concentrated elastin protein which richly cleanses, replenishing lipids nourishing hair within.  If that sounds like hype to the readers of this review, I agree.  Such is the nature of advertising about all these hair care products.But does the shampoo work as advertised?  Yes.  When it comes out of the bottle it looks like a creamy lotion.  I squirted a small amount of the shampoo into the palm of my hand and then messaged it into my wet hair.  It has a light and pleasant smell which I liked.  It does not produce lots of lather, but just enough to get the hair washed clean.  It rinses out easily and completely.  After toweling dry, my hair felt soft and comfortable.  Right now as I write this review my hair feels clean and soft, very pleasant to touch.This is an expensive shampoo, but it is high quality and it does what it says it will do.  It cleans and moisturizes hair and the end result is hair that is soft and smells good.

"Lights Out is a frightening account of how woefully unprepared we are in the United States to prevent a cyber-attack from knocking out the electrical grids that bring power to our major cities.  Let's be clear right at the beginning of this review about just what a cyber-attack is: ""Cyber-attack is any type of offensive maneuver employed by individuals or whole organizations that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, and/or personal computer devices by various means of malicious acts usually originating from an anonymous source that either steals, alters, or destroys a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system.""Ted Koppel has done his homework.  He has used his connections as a famous and knowledgeable reporter to gain access to many important leaders in our country responsible for homeland security.  Not once in the entire book did he receive any positive news about our preparedness to defend ourselves and our power sources from malicious attack by cyber criminals.  Quite the contrary.  Chapter by chapter Koppel show us that our enemies have the expertise and technology to shut down the life giving electric power that we depend on to live in our modern society.  For the record, former director of national intelligence Mike McCarthy states: ""If we were attacked (by cyber criminals), we would lose.""Let's be specific.  Koppel states that perhaps one in ten of us would survive the loss of electric power for a year.  That statistic seems unbelievable until Koppel demonstrates that electricity is life and most people would die without it.  Later in the book Koppel talks about those Americans who are now prepared to survive without electricity supplied by power companies.Perhaps some readers of this review are familiar with the National Geographic Channel's series Doomsday Preppers.  I must admit that I had not heard of it.  Ted Koppel mentions it in his book as an example of the willingness of some individuals to prepare for the catastrophe created by a cyber-attack.  I checked various reviews of this program on Amazon and found one reviewer who said that  ""some preppers focus on EMP (Electronic Magnetic Pulse) disasters, other focus on the results of an economy meltdown, others on natural and man-made disasters.""  What all preppers have in common is their willingness to take responsibility for their lives in the face of the calamity that would result from long term loss of electric power.Koppel shifts his focus from individuals to groups when he goes to Utah to interview leaders in the Mormon Church.  ""Members of the Church have been counseled for many years to be prepared for adversity. Preparation, both spiritual and temporal, can dispel fear. With the guidance of Church leaders, individual members and families should prepare to be self-reliant in times of personal or widespread emergency.""  That last quote was taken not from Koppel's book but from a Mormon web site.  Specific recommendations are given for what each member of the church should do in case disaster strikes.  It is fair to say that the Mormons are one of the few large groups in our society prepared to survive a cyber-attack.Sadly for us, according to Koppel, our leaders know that the cyber-attack problem is real and poses great danger for us, but the billions of dollars needed to protect ourselves is not available.  Other priorities take precedence over defense of our electric power sources.  We are vulnerable, and for the time being, we are going to stay that way.Readers of this lengthy review will note up front that I only gave four stars to Ted Koppel's book.  I thought that Koppel took too long to get his message across and spent too much time with the Mormons, a group he respects for their preparedness.  I much enjoyed learning about the Mormons, but I thought Koppel lost his focus by spending so much time with them and their story.  I do recommend this frightening account of our unpreparedness for cyber-attack with noted reservations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392RI03RQXO4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341996X#wasThisHelpful","R392RI03RQXO4K","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use bottled tea tree oil particularly in the winter to keep my humidifier clean and fresh and I also use it in the wash.  I was delighted to see it advertised on Vine for use as a foot cream and I immediately tried it out on my dry feet.Before talking about the results of this lotion on feet, hands, arms, and legs, I want to mention the great number of sites on the Internet that talk about the many benefits of this amazing oil.  I'll only mention one, but readers of this review will have no troubles finding many more.The site I went to is called Backdoor Survival and it lists 80 Amazing Uses for Tea Tree oil.  Many foot problems are mentioned such as ""Calluses & Corns: Massage area with 5 drops oil to 1 tbsp. of carrier oil. Repeat 2 times daily. Once the corn or calluses have become soft use tweezers to remove, and apply a few drops of tea tree oil and cover with bandage.""  Folks, 79 more of applications await the interested reader online.Now, about my experience: I took a small amount of the lotion, rubbed it lightly in the palm of my hands, and then massaged both of my feet from toes to heel.  The lotion itself is clean, not greasy, and it is easily absorbed into the skin.  The smell of the lotion is light and fragrant, but not perfumy.  I asked my wife to put some on her hands to tell me what she thought about the smell.  She loved it and thought it was most pleasant.I didn't stop with the feet.  I rubbed the lotion onto my elbows, arms, and hands.  I have some on my hands as I write this review and my hands are not greasy and smell fresh, like outdoors.  Every surface that the lotion touches becomes softer and feels better.Like almost all the reviewers on Amazon, I recommend this lotion.  It is reasonably priced and works just as advertised.  I will come back in a few months and update this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMP9DA3WXOSDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQBBTLW#wasThisHelpful","RMP9DA3WXOSDL","AY3AVLL5IWW9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY3AVLL5IWW9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Without history, the memories become private, which today means national; and the numbers become public, which is to say an instrument in the international competition for martyrdom.One such number is 33,761. That is the number of Jews shot at Babi Yar, near Kiev, in the Ukraine. On numerous occasions throughout this monumental and essential history, Timothy Snyder uses very precise figures such as 33,761. Admittedly, it rubbed me the wrong way, since in the world of much uncertainty, as Heisenberg and others have proclaimed, it is impossible to know such a number, with that type of certainty and precision. But on the very last page of his account, the author, a Yale historian, explained fully why it is so important to use the odd number. It is the humanity that is revealed in the 1, which can be multiplied by a million or more. It is the fragments of the stories of individuals who once had a real name, that have been preserved in diaries, or the memories of others, or simply a departing sentence scratched on a wall.Snyder does also use round numbers, as in 14,000,000. That is his estimate of the number of CIVILIAN deaths in an area he defines as the Bloodlands, between 1933 and 1945. It is an area that stretches from St. Petersburg in the north, encompasses the entire eastern shore of the Baltic to Danzig, all of Poland, and on, down to the entire Crimea, and touching the Don River in the east. One of the many strengths of this book is the numerous excellent maps set within the narrative. His contributions to our understanding of what happened in that space and time are numerous. Central is his examination of the disparate motives behind these numerous deaths, and to present a balanced account, in a world of madness. Snyder starts in the Ukraine, with Stalins efforts to collectivize agriculture, which lead to the death, by starvation, of millions. Many others were deported to the Gulag. Next there was the Terror, in the late 30s, in which Stalin purged many in the leadership ranks of the Soviet Union, with a particular focus on the Poles. In fact, the Polish Military Organization was simply invented for the purpose of justifying the terror. Though the Soviet Union promoted an image of their tolerance towards minorities, which many in the West, probably at one time including myself, accepted, with the you can make an omelet without breaking a few eggs rationalization, Snyder concludes otherwise, to a stark degree. Next there was the brief period that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were allies, which, in part, resulted in the partition of Poland between them, and the calculated decimation of the Polish leadership.What more can be said about the Holocaust and the Jews? Actually, quite a lot, I found. Once again, Snyder condemns best in measured, factual analysis. He deals with the big picture, and demonstrates how, after the German failure to take Moscow in 1941, that the destruction of European Jewry became a wartime German objective. He names numerous concentration camps I had never heard of, because they were taken by the Red Army. Prior to reading Snyders account I was under the impression that the gas chambers had to be constructed because there was some natural limit whereby soldiers could not be ordered to shoot and kill unarmed men, woman and children, and be expected to obey. The soldiers themselves would simply rebel and refuse to participate in these heinous crimes. Not so, apparently, as the author documents how so very many were simply shot, including all those at Babi Yar.Amos Oz, the Israeli novelist once proclaimed that the dead of the Six Day War belong to all of us; the dead of the Lebanese War belong only to their mothers. Snyder posits a similar issue concerning a Soviet Ukrainian Jew who had once lived in an area considered to be Poland. She can be claimed by four different national entities; who does she belong to?  And to what political purpose today will these entities use her death? And like Bernard Schlicks principle character in The Reader, who is accused of war crimes, but asks the Judge: What would you have done? and receives no reply, Snyder cautions against assuming the identity of the victim, and raises the issue of what people who are just trying to get by will do in order to stay alive including being Jewish policeman in the ghetto.My first efforts to obtain a different vantage point on the Second World War, other than the one I was brought up on, as an American, that is, Pearl Harbor and D-Day, was reading Alexander Werths Russia at War: 1941-1945, in the 60s. William Shirer proclaimed it to be the best book we probably shall ever have in English on Russia at war. I found it strange therefore that in Snyders extensive 37 page bibliography, it is never mentioned. Of course, some of Werths information and opinions, as set forth in 1964, are outdated and have been superseded. For example, Werth had left it an open question as to who killed the Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, the Soviets or the Nazis. We now know for certain it was the former, and Snyder details this.I also compared accounts concerning the doomed Warsaw uprising of 1944. I found Snyders account less rigorous, with the implicit assumption that the Russians had simply stopped, for no particular reason, and allowed the Poles to be slaughter as a result. Werth seemed to be much more explicit and detailed, clearly condemning the awkward questions of the Moscow radio appeals at the end of July to the people of Warsaw to rise and the Russian refusal to let supply planes from the West land on Soviet airfields. Also, it was clearly in Stalins interest to allow the Polish elites again to be decimated. Nonetheless, Werth quotes the German general, Heinz Guderian on the inability of the Russians to take Warsaw, cites the failure to cross the Vistula in July, with a loss of 30 Russian tanks, and Werth concludes: The only conclusion this author, at any rate, has been able to reach is that in August and September, 1944, the available Red Army forces in Poland were genuinely not able to capture Warsaw, which Hitler was determined to hold. At a minimum, I think Snyder should have at least addressed this issue, and Werths knowledge of the matter.Despite the above one flaw, I consider this an essential historical work. 6-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBGS54CNIYE6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465031471#wasThisHelpful","RBGS54CNIYE6Q","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way back in the 60s, this work was often found on the brick and wood plank bookshelves in the apartments of earnest, and not so earnest students. Somehow I never got around to reading it, and as part of my effort to re-read (or in this case, read for the first time) books that commenced my real education, I finally decided to close this lacuna. I note that Wikipedia states that this was a staple work of the counterculture, and remains one for the New Age folks of today. And in the interest of full disclosure, I STILL have some brick and wood plank bookshelves.Kahlil Gibran left Mt. Lebanon, in what was once the Ottoman Empire, and is now present-day Lebanon, with his mother, in 1895. They were fleeing what they considered to be the injustices of Ottoman rule, of which there were a few. They were Maronite Catholics. They stayed briefly in NYC, before moving to south Boston. Ive just recently read Linda Jacobs excellent Strangers in the West: The Syrian Colony of New York City, 1880-1900 about the first Arabs who came from the Syrian area of the Ottoman Empire between 1880 and1900 and settled in New York. She does not mention the fleeting transient of the most famous Arab-American writer. In fact, Wikipedia states that he is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.Though way beyond (formal) school days, much of this work of 26 essays, covering varying facets of the human condition, resonated. A couple of quotes: Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the souland then walks grinning to the funeral. On love, make not a bond of love when love beckons to you, follow him. (or her?, as we might more appropriately say, almost a century after the book was originally published.)Gibrans axiom on friendship is also most valid: You give but little when you give of our possessions, It is when you give of yourself that you truly give. In terms of housing, the authors advice: Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast, and an adage that scored in the age of sexual liberation: And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain, Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more our your skin and less of your raiment.Woodstock and Altamont. The summer concert of love, followed in less than six months by a concert which reflected the darker human impulses towards violence. Gibran is Woodstock, and overlooks those darker impulses with statements such as: You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked. And So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.  And then the author really gets fuzzy with this one: For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst? Fuzziness squared: For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are oneAnd when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.There is much in this work to savor and appreciate, and even re-read. On the other hand, as I am finishing Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin about the area that was trapped between Hitler and Stalin, resulting in 14 million civilian deaths, I am certain that many of the dead did not truly dance when the earth reclaimed them.

"When the Vine program offered me this watch, I decided that it was not to my tastes, so I asked my son if he wanted it, and received a solid affirmative. The following are his thoughts on it:For starters this is a good looking watch that received many compliments the first time I wore it. The casing is a little thicker than some of my other watches which might be due to the mechanical movement.It has a window in the 9 position to show off the inner working of the watch as well as a clear back.  The leather of the strap feels nice and supple and has a gator print. The strap does have a metal clasp like a watch with a metal band (more on that later). The box that it comes in looks very nice too.I have never owned a watch you have to wind so wasnt quite sure how it worked or how long they will last. This is where I was a little upset with this product. The instructions that came with the watch were from a completely different product! No mention of how to wind it i.e.,: can you wind too much, how long should it keep running for (~2 days), any required maintenance? Also no mention of the clasp which was extremely tight and hard to work with. I personally wish the watch just had the leather strap but some people seem to prefer this set up. The clasp became easier to work after a few uses and works fine now.Lastly the way the watch is sold doesnt seem right either. Lucien Piccard used to make watches in Switzerland with price tags over a $1000. Now they are made in China and are sold at $750 with a markdown to $100. This does raise some red flags but only time will tell if they are warranted!Overall I think this is a good looking watch that feels great. Just disappointed in the lack of instructions and the clasp on the strap. 3.5 stars if that is possibleOtherwise 4. I have read reviews on this brand that it stops working after 3 months so it could be garbage putting it and if so, will come back and re-rate it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PT9P92G9XJMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QYCN1U#wasThisHelpful","R1PT9P92G9XJMF","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Her advice: exercise and maintain a healthy weight.  So says Gary Stix, in an article originally published in Scientific American in 2012. A long time ago, in my youth, I was a subscriber to this wonderful magazine, and looked forward to the monthly articles. Twelve times a year there were a diverse selection covering a range to topics, some fairly comprehensible to the non-specialist in the field, others less so, with their specialized vocabulary. It was impossible to keep up on all of science back then and now, half a century later, with an exponential growth in segmentation and specialization, it is impossible to the 4th power. This particular Kindle offering pulled together 30 articles that had been published in the magazine over the past decade, all devoted to a subject of increasing relevance to many of us, particularly those who read once read the magazine in the days of yore. Despite immense achievements in other scientific areas, for example, increases in computer power, I was struck by the rather paltry increases in the knowledge as to why we actually age, and the essential question: can we slow the process?  Moms advice, as quoted by Stix, coupled with not smoking (or abusing other drugs) and staying mentally active is around 70% of the takeaways from these articles.Aside from the confirmation that mom was right, I found considerable value in diversity of the information presented. One of the sections, comprised of four different articles, is on Radical Damage. The first article is on the myth of antioxidants. Admittedly, I didnt really know what an antioxidant is, or why it might be good for you, though it is repeatedly used as a pitch for various products. The article debunks their value, and confirmed my biases about the varying eating fads, and what was once rated as good is not, and visa-versa. In another article in this section, Mary Franz confirmed my bias about going to the local big box store so that I have a steady supply of yogurt and blueberries for breakfast. She says: Emerging research suggests that compounds in blueberries known as flavonoids may improve memory, learning and general cognitive function, including reasoning skills, decision making, verbal comprehension and numerical ability. Now that is research, fad or no, that I like!Another important section is on Alzheimers Disease, which I read with much interest.  Way back in my youth, the mid-70s, I was instrumental in establishing the second unit, a 50-bed unit, for the treatment of Alzheimers in the State of Georgia. We had a wonderful, dedicated physician, in his 80s, who tried various experimental protocols. Admittedly, there really was no progress in reversing the disease. And so, four decades later, the situation is much the same, despite the increased study of the disease. Still, it is now known that it is an excess of the protein amyloid beta in the brain that causes dementia. One of the drugs that has been on our wish list for 25 years is a drug that would clear existing amyloid deposits, says Stix, in his article, but it is in a field littered with drug failures. In another article by Stix, I was stunned to learn that the forgetfulness of people in Macondo, in Gabriel Garcia Marquez One Hundred Years of Solitudehas a firm basis in real life since the area around Medellin is the home to the worlds largest contingent of individuals with a hereditary form of Alzheimers disease. Members of 25 extended families, with 5,000 members, develop early-onset Alzheimers, usually before the age of 50, if they harbor an aberrant version of a particular gene.There were several other excellent articles, including one that quantified the longevity of women over men, and how caloric deprivation is one of the sure-fire ways to increase ones life-span (but is it worth it?)  Overall, excellent articles, just what you would expect from Scientific American, and I note some other collections of SA articles that will also be worthwhile reads.

"This work is one of Jack Londons most famous. It is set in 1897, at the time of the Yukon gold rush, which London himself participated in when he was 21. The protagonist is a 145 lbs. German shepherd, named Buck. The novel is told largely from his point of view. The novel must be a favorite of many a dog-owner, of which I am not. It also seems to be a school assignment book, but does not garner the numerous 1-star reviews that bored students seem to post, maybe, just maybe, because it strikes an action/adventure chord in them. I did not draw this book as a school assignment, since I am now way past school, at least of the formal variety. This is a first time read, and it struck a similar chord in me.Buck was leading the good life, comfortable, on a pleasant estate in California. The good life ended when he was kidnapped by the gardener, in search of some quick dollars to pay off his gambling debts, and sold for a considerable sum, due to the high demand for strong and serviceable dogs to provide transportation, via dog sled teams, for the miners in search of that yellow metal that can often drive a man (and a woman) mad. It is indeed a very different world, where dogs must work hard, in very adverse conditions, as a team, pulling sleds of supplies and mail from the Pacific Ocean at Skagway, over the coast range, to Dawson in the Yukon. It is a steep learning curve, and Buck masters it quickly. For example, in the camp, where did all the dogs go at night? They buried themselves under the snow  effectively creating their own igloo  in order to stay warm.It is also about becoming the Alpha dog, that is, the top one. London depicts the interactions of the dogs with each other, as well as their masters. There are fights  to the death  in order to be the Alpha. Their masters run the entire spectrum, from ones who truly loved the dogs and cared for them, to those who cared for them as one would a car it is necessary to maintain it in good working order in order to survive, to those who are utterly incompetent and arrogant to boot, which so often leads to their own death as well as that of their dogs. London maintains a brisk pace, stringing incident after incident together, providing a telling portrait of rather unique human  animal interactions.The author also describes the beauty of the great northland in the changing seasons. In conjunction with that beauty, London evolves the theme implied by the title. To me, it recalled one of Aesops fables, about the dog, well-fed, but who had a collar on, in conversation with the wolf, and his life, but who wore no collar.  No question, Buck takes great pride in his work, and his abilities to lead a dog team, and work well for his master. But there is also that call, a primordial one buried deep in Bucks genes, that yearns for life without a collar, a life of running free and clear.Back in that school that I am now way past, I was taught not to project human emotions and characteristics onto animals, who simply were not capable of these emotions: indeed, the worst of ethological sins was anthropomorphism. As animals have been studied to a much greater extent over the intervening years, that dictum has been softened. Londons tale is, as the subject line indicates, delightfully anthropomorphic, and reflects a very real and/or projected reality. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVNHA6OQ1345/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503302946#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVNHA6OQ1345","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of months ago the Vine Program offered me the Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 15.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 1TB HDD, Black). It is currently $200 cheaper, at $449, compared with the L55-C5384. At first glance, the two computers are largely the same. Both have the new Windows 10 operating system, the same 1 TB hard drive and 8 gigabytes of RAM. Both have a DVD drive. And the screen size and resolution are identical, and the overall computer weight is likewise the same. There are some subtle differences, like 2 3.0 USB ports as opposed to 1. The main difference is that the computer being reviewed has the latest Intel processor, the Intel Core i7, as opposed to the Intel Core i5. Among other advantages, the new processor is 10% faster, with a clock speed of 2.4 gigahertz. But can you tell the difference?  Frankly, I cant but then I am not a gamer, where I assume the lightning speed becomes self-evident. If you are mainly typing, the new processor does not improve that very static WPM number. As a final advantage of the newer, and more expensive L55-C5384, there is a much improved internal speaker system, by Skullcandy, that even my tin ear can detect a significant difference. However, once again, it depends on ones intended usage, and since I primarily play music via my Sony sound bar, with true orchestral output, the improved speaker function is of marginal value to me.I found the out-of-the-box to fully functioning computer set-up about as smooth as possible, requiring no more than 30 minutes. There is a minimum of what is commonly called bloatware. It is frustrating to be confronted with yet another program that is the promoted program for viewing videos as well as still pictures, but they all do seem to work fine the challenge is attempting to discover what the improvements are, if any.THE NEGATIVES: The touch pad is the most notable one in terms of the hardware, and I have noted that other reviewers seem to have problems in this regard. I much prefer to use a mouse, which continues to provide better control. Is that preference due to my age? I note that my 29-year old son has the same preference. Even in the Word program I am currently using, the cursor has a very disconcerting and irritating habit of jumping around, meaning that if I pause for a moment or two, and resume typing, the typing can appear several lines up in the paragraph, necessitating deleting and repositioning the cursor. Is this due to the hypersensitivity of the touch pad, or is it a flaw in the Word program?  I still dont know for sure.I have also noted two major flaws in the Windows 10 operating system, and I have not seen these flaws reported by other reviewers. I have been using the one computer for approximately two months, and despite several updates from Microsoft, the flaws have not been corrected. The first is that I cannot download webpages, or other documents with the Microsoft Edge browser (!)  How can this be? And is it just me?  So, for the past two months I have had to utilize the Google Chrome browser when I want to download. The other inexplicable problem is that an error message appears when I attempt to send an email from the accounts I have with my Internet provider (Comcast), but NOT from other email accounts, such as gmail. I did contact my Internet provider, who one would think would want this corrected but, you might know how that goes, and I was eventually referred to Microsoft, where I have not gone. Instead, when I want to send an email from these accounts, which fortunately is far less frequent, I have to fire-up the older laptop with Windows 8, and all works fine. It is just flat-out bizarre, particularly that neither of these major issues is being addressed.Overall, based my personal usage, and my tech philosophy of not buying the latest item, but waiting for version 2.0, as well as the all-important value for money determinant, Id give the current offering 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QK80M54U2T14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806RNU#wasThisHelpful","R3QK80M54U2T14","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert B. Reich has served in three different national administrations, including as Labor Secretary under Bill Clinton. Most recently, he was an advisor to President Obama. He is currently a professor at UC, Berkeley. Far from being a risk (and opinion) adverse apparatchik, he has provided a scathing critique of the increasingly dysfunctional economic and political nature of American society. He has also provided proposals to remedy it.The story is now a familiar one, at least to those not totally engrossed in fantasy football or other such diversions. For a period of around 35 years after the Second World War, the vast majority of Americans experienced a growth in incomes and prosperity, deriving a share of the growing economic pie. Rather suddenly, all that stopped, and now for the last 35 years, virtually all the increased wealth of American society has gone to now-famous ONE percent, and the rest of us have not even experienced trickle down, but only stagnant or declining income, and wealth would be a serious misnomer. How is it possible in a democracy that new Pharaohs have been created?Tellingly, Reich entitles his initial chapter The Rigged Game. The Rich really are different from you and me, as the old saw goes: they play by different rules, the ones they write. The author cites a few examples. They pay less in income taxes. Many a billionaire hedge-fund manager pays less in taxes, on a percentage basis, than the server at the local restaurant, thanks to the carried-interest loophole that allows their income to be taxed as a capital-gain though no capital was ever at risk. Bankruptcy? It has been made extremely difficult for homeowners and students, and their debts. But the rich, including one infamous presidential candidate, routinely utilize it as a business tactic which helps them shed pension liabilities, for example.In another chapter on the rise of the Regressive Right, the author posits that the agenda is not only to undo the social legislation of the New Deal, it is to go even further back to the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, including economic Darwinism. In terms of sheer economic concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, we are already there. Reich identifies the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision as being a landmark measure in facilitating the one percents ability to purchase the best government it can  and cites telling examples on some phenomenal  return on investments. Reich identifies 10 of the biggest economic lies, and how they are re-told, again and again, so that much of the populace believes them.Reich also correctly disses the authority of the credit agencies  who want to pontificate on the correct level of debt that the country should have, but had rated all those toxic mortgage bonds Triple-A.  But I do not feel the author went far enough. How did the rich get bailed out from the consequences of their poor decisions?  The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet by buying up all those toxic assets, a phenomenal transfer of wealth to the tune of several trillion dollars. Also, by maintaining interest rates near zero for almost a decade, there was also a tremendous tax placed on savers, to the benefit of the profligate borrows. None of this is really addressed.Reich published this book during the 2012 presidential campaign. There was a glimmer of hope in the Occupy Wall Street movement at the time, which has disappeared as quickly as a late spring snow. Reich proposes a number of actions that we, the people can take, in order to reclaim our share from the 1%. Realistically, as another presidential campaign (of distraction) commences, none of this is happening. Fantasy football is. The lock on power, of the very few, seems even more secure today than four years ago. Change will come, just as it came to the Soviet Union, but probably from a mechanism that none of us can predict today. Reichs heart is more than in the right place, his call for action is appropriate, but simply is not occurring.  For the book, 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26IBXL6K4GUZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345804376#wasThisHelpful","R26IBXL6K4GUZZ","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wallace Stegner won the National Book Award for this work in 1977. This is the fifth book of Stegners that I have read, and I am still not satiated  far from it.  I remain impressed with the range of his works. Having lived in Saudi Arabia for 20 years, I found his account  bowdlerized or not  of the early days of Aramco fascinating Discovery!: The Search for Arabian Oil. Now I find myself living five meridians west of the 100th, and thus also found Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West exceedingly relevant, along with the story of John Wesley Powell. The third non-fiction work of his that I have read is The Gathering of Zion: The Story of the Mormon Trail. The other previous book of fiction that I have read is Angle of Repose (Penguin Classics), which won the Pulitzer Prize. The explanation of the title is most memorable.In The Spectator Bird the protagonist is Joe Allston, a retired literary agent (hence the spectator to others achievements.) He lives with his wife Ruth, in the country, one hour north of San Francisco.  At 69, he is my coeval, which was the first hook. Like Angle of Repose, a fair amount of the novel concerns the aging process, and where one is in life, when one is coming down the home stretch. He has walked down the long drive, awaiting the mail. It arrives, with a postcard from a woman he has not seen in 20 years. He decides to pocket it. The post card is the key motive event that propels the novel forward.The post card is from Astrid, who is Danish. He does eventually share the post card with his wife, and they reflect back on their trip to that country 20 years earlier. There is so much about Denmark that is worthy of emulation, as Bernie Sanders, currently a Presidential candidate recently noted, and I would concur. But there is also something rotten in the state of Denmark, and I felt that Stegner brilliantly unveiled what that was, with Astrids role in the drama. Ive spent some time in Denmark, have some Danish friends, and so there was much in the authors depiction of the country that strongly resonated. Stegner uses a fair amount of untranslated Danish as well. After knowing one of my Danish friends for more than three decades, it was this novel that finally revealed why he held himself in a particular manner when he said Skaal, the classic toast which so many Americans adopted, without knowing all the rituals involved.Stegner writes so well. The novel is filled with incisive observations and bon mots.  Consider: California February as new and green and sodden as a fern basket dipped into a pond. Ben is the very chief of the tribe to make old age out to be a time of liberation. hanging around the national parks that enclose other peoples archaeologies.There are those parallels with ones own existence, and there are also the perpendiculars, as it were, as well. There was a moonlit stroll of two decades earlier, and Joes later reflection: I wanted to be alone for a while with that possibility I had renounced, or been made to renounce, twenty years before and carried around with me like a cyst ever since.  6-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER4QUONNH1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0023ZLLE4#wasThisHelpful","RER4QUONNH1J","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"than the old solid rubber hoses, that are prone to kink, are heavy, and consume much space in the rather large box used to reel the hose onto a spindle. When I first started used the lightweight, expandable garden hoses, about a year ago, I considered it a step-function upgrade, akin to moving from the very heavy cathode ray TVs to a large flat screen TV.In New Mexico, with 11 inches of rain annually in Albuquerque, one must water a lot, in order to have a garden.  I have been using expandable hoses for about a year now the emphasis is on the plural, and although I really like them, there is one BIG problem, and it may relate primarily to our desert climate, and the thorns which so much of our flora seem to have for their own protection. The thorns puncture the expandable hose  catastrophically  and it has to be discarded.Fortunately I was provided an Otps expandable hose (in return for that proverbial fair review) so that when my latest expandable hose snagged that thorn, and started and water started gushing out of the side of the hose, I could immediately switch over. The Otps appears to be substantially better constructed. The most obvious improvement are the brass fittings, as opposed to the plastic connectors that were on the older expandable hoses. The multiple 8-setting spray nozzle is also more substantial. Finally, and most importantly, the hose itself, while expandable and lightweight, IS also more substantial, hopefully enough to defeat those thorns.The garden is my laboratory, for my not-so-green thumb, but now for the Otps hose is also in the lab for long-term evaluation.  For now, 5-stars, and Ill update this review when if/when it fails hopefully in a year or more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q14I1Y9A2FC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146CCCLW#wasThisHelpful","R2Q14I1Y9A2FC1","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" is one of the themes of JG Farrells Booker Prize winning novel, as indicated by Pankaj Mishra in the introduction. But there were numerous other themes that also resonated. I knew of the Indian rebellion against British rule which occurred in 1857, but knew virtually no details, and felt I was long overdue to decrease the width of that lacunae. Farrells novel, which was written in 1973 is modeled to a large degree on the siege of Lucknow. This work is part of a trilogy which take a jaundiced view of the British Empire, with the other two being The Singapore Grip (New York Review Books Classics) and ""Troubles"".The novel is set in India, but there are virtually no Indians in Farrells account. They are simply the other, with a common designation being that of sepoy. And they are howling at the gates, trying to upset a comfortable lifestyle. Their reasons are never explicitly stated, but can be deduced from the attitudes of their white English rulers, now besieged. The sole Indian that is developed as a character, at least to some degree, is Hari, the son of the local Maharaja. He is trying to straddle both cultures, both for cultural and political reasons.Farrell develops a fair and representative sampling of characters that reflected the attitude of the British ruling class. The ultimate cynic is the Magistrate, a retired judge. The leader of the besieged British community is the Collector, Mr. Hopkins, so called due to his vast collection of European and Indian items. Both are old Indian hands. Youth is represented by Fleury, who had just arrived in India the previous winter, and Harry, the son of Dr. Dunstaple. There is the padre, interpreting Gods Will in the continued developments of the siege. There are three memorable women: Louise Dunstaple, daughter of the doctor, and a wonderful catch that Fleury has his eyes on. There is Fleurys sister, Miriam, who arrives in India with him, a young widow due to the loss of her husband in the Crimean War. And there is Lucy Hughes, a fallen woman for having had one sexual relationship, ever so briefly (this was the Victorian era!), and how she is shunned by her fellow women for breaking ranks (?)Hubris takes many forms, and certainly a dominant theme is that British rule was justified by the amount of good they were bringing to the natives, often called a civilizing mission. In part, that civilizing mission involved the production of opium, and its export to China, which was the matter of a couple of wars. But one of the sub-themes I found most interesting was the conflict between the communitys only two doctors, culminating in very different theories about what caused cholera. Men of medicine, and therefore men of science?  Hardly. Their egos become wrapped around certain hunches, and no amount of objective facts will change their minds. Ancient history? More than a 150 years later, though the cause and treatment of cholera is well-known, hubris was a contributing factor to the death of 7,500 Haitians from cholera in 2010.In terms of memorable scenes, it would be hard to beat the attack of the black bugs, the cockchafers, which occurred in conjunction with the on-set of the monsoons. I sensed much research on Farrells part, over a wide range of topics, from the flora and fauna of India at the time, to military tactics and weapons, as well as the psychology of individuals in besieged settings. Bon mots?  In speaking of The Collector, the author writes: At the same time he realized with a shock how much his own faith in the Churchs authority, or in the Christians view of the world in which he had hitherto lived his life, had diminished since he had last inspected them. From the farmyard in which his certitudes perched like fat chickens, every night of the siege, one or two were carried off in the jaws of rationalism and despair.Ancient history? I think not. In fact, it seems to have only become worse. In terms of isolation from the natives one is ruling, it would be hard to beat the Emerald City of the Green Zone inside Iraq. Padres no longer carry the gospel, it is the economists of the International Monetary Fund who know that the natives will be much happier with a flat-rate income tax.  Plus ca change  As for Farrells excellent historical reconstruction of an uprising on the plains of northern India more than a century and a half ago, when Indias population was less than half that of the United States today, 5-stars, plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9C3IZ7PEPXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159017092X#wasThisHelpful","R2G9C3IZ7PEPXZ","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just recently became acquainted with the Tumi line of luggage when the Vine Program offered me Tumi Tegra-Lite  Max Continental Expandable Carry-On, T-Graphite, One Size.  At last, a carry-on that it is unlikely the wheels will fall off and in that unlikely event, Tumi will fix it for you, gratis. So, when I was offered this travel satchel, I had to say yes.One of the best features is that  at first glance  it looks like a bag that might cost $50.00. Im of the school that believes one should not travel with a sign on ones back that says: Look at what I have, and you dont, why dont you rob me? In essence, at least in appearance, travel simply.But on your own more careful examination, the quality is apparent, and depending on your projected life expectancy, the bag might be a legacy for your descendants. Very solid nylon construction, with a Tumi easy-to-use combination lock. Two zipper compartments, with zippers that will also last. Comfortable hand-grips, and an equally functional and solid shoulder straps. I also appreciated the five solid rubber half-inch feet that will keep the bag off the floor, and out of the inevitable puddles that seemingly lurk to ruin your belongings.Any downside? Not in terms of the bags design and construction. Think the sole problem is the price and I guess that I am NOT in that school that proclaims: If you have to ask, you cant afford it. I still need to ask, and thus find 300 plus bucks for such a weekend bag a bit pricey. Thus, for me, considering the quality/price tradeoffs, I give it 4-stars, and if you are in the famous 1% that doesnt need to ask, then it is a solid 5-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1665K8TC5XAY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFPWX4Q#wasThisHelpful","R1665K8TC5XAY3","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently went hiking in the mountains above Santa Fe (NM) to enjoy the aspens, now in full autumn yellows. Took a few pictures. Just projected them via this Epson 7240 projector, and it was as though I was seeing the details and the colors for the first time: it was that intense, with colors truer than Ive ever experienced. For that aspect of the products performance, it deserves a 6-star rating.I acquired my first portable computer-compatible projector about 15 years ago. It cost around $5000. Fortunately the company I worked for bought it, and I duly cranked out those everything is great and they will only get better in the future type presentations. The features were impressive at the time, but the color was of the this is the best we can do variety. In the varying fields of human endeavors, at least the quality of the projectors are greatly improved. I also like the design of the unit, and the very convenient carrying case.In terms of the set-uphum I experienced my share of frustrations before seeing those autumn golds.  The HDMI cable was missing! And yes, I checked everywhere, and it was simply not included in the box. Nor was there a packing list that indicated what should have been included, and what you would be required to buy though I did receive the two batteries for the remote! A VGA cable was included, but my new laptop does not have that port. A USB cable was also included, the ports were available, but I continued to obtain the no signal message, even after searching. I read the smaller print on what is supported:  Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, XP blah, blah but no mention of Windows 10, the operating system on my computer.  UGH! Many of us have been there before:  a new niffy tech product, that appears to be dead on arrival. But I asked my son: Would you happen to have an extra HDMI cable? And bingo, I immediately experience the golds of autumn.As with some of the other reviewers, I found the various set-up menus klutzy. Something from the 90s. I still fondly recall the name of a software company in Cincinnati, Sledgehammer Cybernetics. And that is the message from those set-up menus we spent our entire developmental budget on the niffy new product, but explaining how the product works, and troubleshooting, well, you are largely on your own but if you just keep hammering, or preferably, sledgehammering away it will all sort out in the end a couple of extra needlessly frustrating hours later.Finally, I had to chuckle to myself looking at the pictures of the possible uses for this product at Amazon. The first picture demonstrated use in a courtroom, where I was lately. We were unsure of the video-support functions available, and as a backup, my brother asked if I had a projector. I said NO, we winged it, and all did work, but now I have an all-important back-up, for the next time. Mainly though, if you are into photography, think the price is right for home use, and the pictures are, after a bit of hammering away, dazzling. Overall, 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P349P73L5QSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYNAW#wasThisHelpful","R3P349P73L5QSC","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Linda Jacobs holds a PhD in Near Eastern Archeology/Anthropology. More importantly, perhaps, she holds an informal PhD in the subject area of this book: the first Syrian group of immigrants (the colony, as she calls it) in the United States. Her grandparents were all charter members, that is, in the original colony in the early days of its development, and as a descendent she already had much background for this academic study. She states that the work is focused on a 20 year period, 1880-1900, and involves approximately 3500 people, all of whom emigrated from what was then the Ottoman Empire.When she offered me this book for review, my initial reaction was that this might be far TOO narrow a focus, and far too detailed for this general reader:  I am not an academic, and I am not Arab. Thus, there was no hot buttons, but there were some warm ones. In my own way, I had immigrated TO a country whose coasts had once been part of the Ottoman Empire, (Saudi Arabia), and had lived there over a period of a quarter century. I had travelled through much of the Middle East as well, including Syria. But what I most recall was the hospitality of the seemingly tight-knit Lebanese/Syrian community in Memphis, in 1993, over a one week period, as a Saudi and I reviewed the operation of St. Judes hospital (which they, along with Danny Thomas, had played a major role in developing and maintaining), with the intention of replicating it in Riyadh (which did eventually occur). It was that week that led me to say yes to Ms. Jacobs, and I am glad that I did.By Syrians, Jacobs means residents of a larger area than present day Syria, and includes Lebanon, and parts of Jordan and Palestine. Almost all of the original colony were Christians, divided mainly between the Maronite and the Orthodox, with a dash of Roman Catholic thrown in. Why did they come? Jacobs provides no definitive answer, on the push or pull question. Did they come to improve their economic prospects, or were they fleeing Turkish rule? Jacobs somewhat wryly notes that telling the immigration officials that they were fleeing persecution for their religious beliefs upped the chances of their applications being approved.The Syrian colony settled around Washington Street in lower Manhattan. It was a slum, but Jacobs points out that Jacob Riis, of How the Other Half Lives: A Jacob Riis Classic (Including Photography) did not photograph it. Their first jobs were often that of a peddler, and many made reasonable money, enough so to move up the economic chain and open small shops, or even own manufacturing facilities. The authors range is comprehensive. She covers marriages, schooling (or lack of same), religious and political groupings and views, crimes, and the relationship with the mother country. She delves into the restaurants, nightclubs, smoking parlors, and even the many claims to the women who claimed to be Little Egypt.There were numerous insights that I will remember. For example, the term auto-Orientalism, which essential means that the immigrants, at times, would deliberately ham up their exoticism in order to sell trinkets from the Holy Land. As with other immigrant groups, and in particular I am thinking of the Vietnamese, in 1975, the newcomers were taken advantage of by their more established in-country compatriots.Jacobs appears not to have interviewed many of the descendants of the original colony; rather she relies heavily on the Arabic press, mainly Kawkab America and Al Hoda, as well as Court records, and her research appears to be extensive. Of course, as the author points out, Court records provide insights into the unhappy marriages, for example, and not the happy ones. Time and time again I was impressed with the authors balanced judgment, when sifting through the knowns and unknowns from the historical record.I believe several categories of readers might find this book of interest, and even enjoyable: the academics in the fields of history or sociology, all the various Arab and Muslim groups now living in America, as well as those preparing for the arrival of 100,000 Syrian refugees. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EB8A6IAKSC68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0983539251#wasThisHelpful","R2EB8A6IAKSC68","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive read Greenes The Quiet American (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition) three times. He was amazingly prescient in depicting the complete inability of the CIAs agent, Alden Pyle, to see the reality of Vietnam that was before him. Rather, Pyle chose to view everything through the prism of the Ivy League academic theories of Professor York Harding. My copy of Our Man in Havana came with an introduction by Christopher Hitchens. In the intro, Hitchens indicates much the same, including:  Greene seemed to have an almost spooky prescience when it came to the suppurating political slums on the periphery of Americas Cold War Empire. And,  the mandarins of MI6 are eager to deceive themselves, and to be deceived, and they get no more than what they ask for.Cuba is again topical, as the United States has finally decided, after more than half a century, to kiss and make-up with the Communist government led by Raul Castro, brother of Fidel, who seized power from the dictator, Fulgencio Batista shortly after Our Man in Havana was first published. Greene knew a thing or two about the British intelligence services, since he once worked for them, recruited during the Second World War, by his sister, who worked for MI6. His initial posting was in Sierra Leone. His novel is a wonderful slap-stick farce that, in all likelihood, accurately depicts the meaningless levels of intrigue, and the pre-disposition of the intelligence leadership to hear, as Simon and Garfunkel once famously sang: A man hears what he wants to hear, and disregards all the rest.Jim Wormold is a failing British vacuum cleaner salesman, working in Havana. He has yet to sell one model of the companys latest product, the Atomic (vacuum cleaner!). He is estranged from his wife, and is attempting to raise his daughter, Milly (Seraphina), now in her teen-age years. She is both a devote Catholic (the father is not), as well as more than a bit of a hooligan. She also aspires to higher economic levels in society, commencing with the ownership of a horse. Her aspirations are clearly beyond Wormolds ability to fulfill, and thus he is an easy mark that can be recruited by Hawthorne, an MI6 operative. In farcical style, the recruitment takes place in the bathroom of a restaurant, with the water running (to make it more difficult to pick up the sound on the microphones!).Wormold seems to intuitively understand the great game, and simply makes up all the intelligence, including the agents that are working for him. He pockets their salary and expenses, thereby funding the needs of his daughter. Meanwhile, back in London, Hawthornes boss, a senior MI6 operative, believes he has an intuitive understanding of Wormold, one of the merchant princes of the British Empire. There are a number of other well-wrought characters, including Captain Segura, a Ministry of the Interior enforcer of the Batista regime. (only certain classes of people are subjected to torture)Real life imitating fiction? Greene has produced a satirical masterpiece, and if the reader considers it over the top, one need only consider the crazy machination involving the presentation of intelligence on Iraqs purported weapons of mass destruction including those famous aluminum tubes, based on the testimony of a defector with the ever-so-apt code name of curveball.In ways, Greenes novels on Vietnam, Cuba and Haiti constitute a trilogy on imperial folly. I will soon read the third volume, The Comedians (Penguin Classics) on Haiti. As with other novels of Greene, alcohol is also a main character. A pithy summation of Greenes view of life is provided by Hitchens: The human condition seen through the bottom of a glass darkly Our Man in Havana is a most memorable novel. 5-stars, plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36MS7YELC9EM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142438006#wasThisHelpful","R36MS7YELC9EM5","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is that time of year again, when I am harvesting tomatoes from the garden. The complaint is now a familiar one, and concerns language: how can we use the same word, tomato to describe the freshness and flavor of one produced from the garden, and the ersatz cardboard version that is the staple fare of the grocery stores? Ditto that for peaches, plums, etc.When I listened to one of my favorite orchestral pieces, Gustav Holsts The Planets, Op. 32, on the Sony HTNT3 Sound Bar, it was as though I had never heard it before. Admittedly, I have a bit of a tin ear, yet the difference in the quality of the sound was so overwhelmingly apparent, that I was truly stunned. Alas, I have never heard The Planets performed live, yet with the new Sony system, I had a front row orchestral seat (with clapping being optional). And it appears that most of the other reviewers also highlight the sheer quality of the sound and the listening experience.When the Vine program offered me the Sony sound system, I felt it would be ideal for my son, who needed to replace a five year old sound system (with wires!). He was instrumental on the set-up, and the following are his thoughts about the system:_____Im using the Sony Sound Bar to replace a 5.1 surround sound system. I have to say that the sound out of this is great! No one wants wires anymore and this takes care of that problem. The Sound bar and the subwoofer have different power cords and connect to each other wirelessly with no issues. The Bluetooth function works great! Easily connected two computers and my cell phone without difficulty.The system easily connected to WIFI and downloading updates has been simple.The plugins can be a little tight but I think this design has to do with the way the sound bar would be mounted to the wall. Pretty tight to fit my chromecast but it works. The display is hidden in the speaker and is only visible when it is lit up which is pretty cool.They system has 3 HDMI ports and you can also plug in an optical audio cable (not included).The Spotify feature works great too!If I had to pick on something it would be the tight plugins and that it doesnt seem like you can change the name of the HDMI inputs. But if you are looking for great sound and easy connectivity then these two things are easily overlooked!____I will add a hearty amen on the EASE of connectivity via the Bluetooth function, to the different computers in the house as well as the cell phone. Connectivity has often been an issue via Bluetooth with other devices.As with all Vine reviews, they must be posted within 30 days of receipt, so the reviewers extensive experience with the product cannot be noted, but I will come back in six months, and provide those updates, and unlike the garden tomatoes, which can only be enjoyed 6-8 weeks a year, the Sony Sound bar is good, year-round. 5-stars, plus","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6BA5CQFN91A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78GG76#wasThisHelpful","R1S6BA5CQFN91A","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this book in a bookstore on the Cours Mirabeau, near Les Deux Garcons caf, in Aix, in 1991. At the time, the bookstore carried only books written in French. This work of Peter Mayles had just been issued, in quick pursuit of the immense popularity of his initial work A Year in Provence.  Toujours Provence was released only in English in 1991, and somehow the bookstore had mistakenly ordered it, no doubt due to the title (In 1998 Mayles account was published in French).  After my read in 1991, I concluded that it was not of the same caliber as A Year in Provence.  Currently I ache to return to the many joys of Provence, and therefore decided to give this light-hearted work a re-read, and have concluded that it is as good as A Year.Mayles substance and style are unchanged from his previous work. There are a series of vignettes that often focus on the uniqueness of Provencal life as experienced by a recent expatriate arrive who has taken up residence in the Luberon region (Mayle, who is English, arrived from London). The observations are a blend of the self-deprecating as well as the condescending. And he peppers his work with untranslated French (which I understand).  Generally, though not always, the meaning can be determined from the context for those who know no French.A Year introduced me to the Auberge de la Loupe in Buoux, where I ate a wonderful dinner on a cold dark evening in November, 1989. Subsequently, on many repeat visits, Ive enjoyed the 17 appetizer lunch, along with the Tavel Ros. Maurice is the owner of the restaurant, and Mayles wife arranged for le pique-nique with the owner for Peters 50th birthday. It was in grand-style, since Maurices avocation is the restoration of many 19th century horse-drawn carriages, which was the mode of transport to a glorious setting under the trees, with white linen tablecloths and the obligatory champagne. Mayle explained how he had grown to dislike picnics in England due to the often inclement weather. In the end, after the delights of a wonderful lunch, it did turn into un pique-nique anglais.Food, and more food, and yet as he concludes, they have actually lost weight living in Provence. Many of his vignettes center on food and alcohol, and include a trip to a degustation in Chateauneuf-du-Pape, as well as a discourse on the origins and effects of pastis. He also describes his trips to two radically different restaurants  Hily  in the heart of Avignon, near the Place de Horlage, and a truck stop on the N7 at Orgon. The key selection criteria for both: value for money. Other stories concerned seeing Pavarotti in concert at the Roman Amphitheatre in Orange, singing toads, Vogue magazine highlighting the various escapes of the rich and famous, the dog show and the wild fires that can decimate the countryside. Variegated, yes.In the final chapter he raises the rather unique British admonition on Going Native, again a bit tongue-in-cheek.  The expression was mainly used during the Raj, the British rule of India, and how the British were supposed to maintain a certain distance from the native classes, by adhering to their own rituals and clubs. One of Mayles visitors from England noted that Mayle was in T-shirt, shorts, barefoot, and seemed to be oblivious to a rigid time schedule. Had Mayle gone native and become a Provenal?  And he answers in the affirmative, noting the gradual and at times imperceptible changes in his life, and that overall, they were much for the better, and had improved their mental and physical health. All the better, since he had no native guide to help him. Imagine if he had!  5-stars, on the re-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSOCOI6NPLMT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679402535#wasThisHelpful","RSOCOI6NPLMT2","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Naguib Mafouz when I picked up Midaq Alley from a revolving stand of odds-and-ends book in a newsstand on Olaya Road in Riyadh in 1980. It was to be my first venture into Arabic literature. I remember being impressed at the time, feeling it gave me a slender glimpse into the lives of the Egyptians who lived in those apartment buildings, with laundry on the lines, on the balconies, along Olaya Road. The men ran many of the shops along the road, and they were petites functionaries in the burgeoning governmental bureaucracies. I was quite pleased when Mafouz won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the only writer in Arabic to do so. I realized there was much more to his work, and recently read the psychological thriller, The Search. Thus, Autumn Quail is the third work of Mafouzs that I have read, and I have made a personal commitment to read at least three more.In world history, between the wars most often refers to the period between World War I and II. Mafouzs novel is situated between two seminal wars in their history: the 1956 seizure of the Suez Canal by British, French and Israeli forces and the 1967 Six Day War with Israel. The opening scene depicts the rioting and fires in Cairo, which were a reaction of the civilian population to the killing of Egyptian policemen by British forces.The protagonist is Isa ad-Dabbagh, a young official successfully on the move in the political establishment. He is engaged to his cousin Salwa, the daughter of Ali Bey Sulaiman, a Justice and senior palace official. Then disaster strikes. There is a dramatic shift in the political structure: the outs are in. The ins are out. Those who were too closely associated with the monarchy of King Farouk are history. Isa must appear before the Purge Committee, and although his level of crimes were normal under the rules of the prior power structure, he is released from government service, albeit with a modest severance package.  Hassan, who is another cousin of Isa, and had been on the outs, finds his team to now be winning, and he is driving that perennial status symbol: a Mercedes. The remainder of the novel depicts Isa loss of status, and his drift, due to lack of work.The above set-up occurs in many countries. The familial relationships in Egypt are often stronger  with the aforementioned marriage to cousins  and thus Mafouzs tale is colored by those familial considerations. Salwa dumps the fallen Isa. Much of the rest of the novel relates to his efforts obtain a satisfactory wife, and he eventually settles for an overfed nonentity, Qadriyya. He also feels that he cannot remain in Cairo, and flees to the relative tranquility and anonymous existence in Alexandria, hence the title.Mafouz ranks with Balzac, in terms of insights into the Human Comedy. His characterization of Isa, and his relatives and companions is incisive. In terms of political commentary, Mafouz includes, twice, in relationship to both wars, the sometimes familiar lament of people who had been colonized: should they bring back their former colonial masters, in this case, the British, since they seem to be utterly unable to rule themselves?  Roger Allen has provided an excellent, fluid, and at times lyrical translation. I had to keep reminding myself that this is actually a translation. My only criticism of this edition is that Allen provides a complete summary of the plot as an Introduction.  Surely, that should have been relegated to an Afterword. He also leaves enough Arabic words (with suitable explanation of these words, as well as place names and historical characters, in the Note section) to provide local flavor. 5-stars, plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCFG0XFT5VX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385264542#wasThisHelpful","R1JCFG0XFT5VX5","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After a few decade hiatus, Ive been reading (or re-reading, as in this case) the works of Shakespeare. Principle themes in King Lear involve the aging process, letting go, and the (seemingly inevitable) dissent among the children, particularly if some money is involved. These are all eternal themes, and Shakespeare has set a good benchmark.Lear has made it four score years; frailty, mental and physical have set in. Like so many, he wants to ensure his legacy. He has three daughters, Cordelia, Regan and Goneril. He asks each to profess their love for him. The latter two are profuse in their praise, as well as hypocritical. Cordelia is neither, but she is true in her love, and is disinherited for her efforts. She will go on to marry the King of France. And this sets in motion forces that will lead to literal war among the three daughters and their husbands.There is also a major subplot, involving Edmund, who is the illegitimate son of Gloucester, and Edgar, who is legitimate. Edmund is a true villain, and successfully plots Edgars ejection as heir. As he says: A credulous father! And a brother noble, whose nature is so far from doing harms, that he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy. I see the business. Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit: All with mes meet that I can fashion fit.Some other memorable quotes that have resonated through the ages: How sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child. Away, Away. And let not womens weapons, water-drops, stain my mans cheeks. And hasnt the following truth always been with us: Our present business is general woe.  Concerning her father, Regan says: Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.After having now read several of the tragedies, there is a very familiar trajectory to the plot, which is a very foreshortened variation of John Maynard Keynes famous quip: In the long-run, we are all dead.  In Lear, it is in the short-run of the play that virtually all the principal characters share that fate. True to form, the influence of the Greek tragedies is heavy, with the fool providing a useful foil, Lear is condemned to his fate by his own hubristic actions, and there is even a character, Gloucester, who is blinded, and must wander, or as one of the daughters jibs: Let him use his nose to find his way back to Dover.I continue to be impressed how these school assignment plays demonstrate immense insight into the human condition, and remain relevant today. However, think I am ready for a comedy, where not everyone is dead in the end, long or short-term. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E1YE5LVAYVZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CQBFTW#wasThisHelpful","R2E1YE5LVAYVZC","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charles Bernet and Pierre Rezeau are researchers at CNRS (Centre national de la recherch scientifique) in Nancy. They worked and collaborated on the 13 volume Trsor de la langue franaise, tome 8, of which a single volume, number 8, is currently selling for $404, in the Amazon secondary market. Before ""wading into"" those very heavy volumes (Amazon is indicating that one volume weigh eight pounds), this single volume provides much insight into the nuances and ""tricks"" of French idiomatic expressions. This work was published in 1989, and I purchased it in the 1990's, in part because the cover flap seemed to describe me:  (this work is) ""for the foreigners who learned the French and who hear or read something which they cannot find any part of the `key'.) This work is only in French, so those looking for a translation of a French expression into English (or some other language) should pass. Nonetheless, I found their explanation of French expression quite lucid, and even memorable. The work is approximately 400 pages long, with an excellent index.To cite a couple examples, both of which resonated with me.  I seem to have struggled with internalizing the various usages of ""foutre"" and I found an example utilizing my old ""friend,"" the gravelly-voiced singer Serge Gainesbourg:""Se foutre en l'air"" (`detruire sa sante') (to demolish one's health)""Serge Gainesbourg chante la plupart des chansons `pas degueus' de son dernier album.... ou il met en gard ses jeunes fans contre la drogue: `touchez pas a la poussiere d'ange. Surtout n'ayez pas l'impudence de vous foutre en l'air avant l'heure dite' The quote is from an article in the French newspaper `Le Monde' from 1988, and it is Gainesbourg's admonition not to use ""angel dust"" so as not to damage your health before the appointed hour.I had to chuckle since the expression immediately before ""Foutre"" seems to relate to precisely what I am doing in life now: ""Coup de pied dans la fourmiliere"" which the authors state is: ""prise de position novatrice d'un individu qui derange la routine d'un groupe."" I am ""kicking the ant-heap"" which is to take an individualistic position which disturbs the routine of the group.This is the type of dictionary that can be read ""cover to cover,"" a few pages at a time. It provides much insight into the French language, and is highly recommended, and if I ever stopped kicking the ant-heap, I'd have more time to concentrate on the important things in life, like finishing this excellent dictionary.  5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3POGXK47E2JIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2020128683#wasThisHelpful","R3POGXK47E2JIY","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently reviewed Caroline Aux Sports D'Hiver (French Edition)It is part of a series of French childrens books that are standard cultural references. More than 38 million copies of the series have been sold. However the Martine series easily trumps Caroline, with over 100 million copies sold, in a 60 book series. This series was conceived and executed by the Belgium author, Gilbert Delahaye. His first book was published in 1954, he died in 1997, and the last in the series was published by his heirs, in 2010. The subject volume was published in 1965.And it depicts air travel as it was then, free, easy, maybe even a bit of fun and adventure. For an adult reading this book to his child, it can be a trip down memory lane. And for the child who has endured the present-day hassles, it must seem like a fairy tale, and not one with a bad ending. For example, the passengers actually walk out on the tarmac (naturally under sunny skies) and board by climbing the steps they descend from the rear of the aircraft. There is real china, real silverware, and real glasses, all in the golden era before hi-jackings led to some serious modification. And the security is such that there dog manages to ride in the baggage compartment.Overall, particularly if you are trying to teach your children a different language, as well as the ways of a different culture, these books remain a very tangible, and lovely pedagogical device. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9XWNB31I8MAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2203101156#wasThisHelpful","R9XWNB31I8MAC","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first novel of Gore Vidal that I have read, and will certainly not be the last. Admittedly, by not having read him earlier, there was a major lacuna in my historical and literary American perspective.  The title intrigued: a bit more than a decade after the Civil War, the latter subject of which I have read my share. A historical cusp, with the effects of the Civil War still apparent, holding back the desire to get on with life. It was about a period in which I knew little.  Who was President, and how they obtained office was a bit fuzzy. Vidals well-written historical novel provided much illumination. It was written on the American bi-centennial, about events 100 years earlier. The most astonishing aspect are the rhymes of history, a more nuanced way of indicating how often history repeats itself. In writing about the stolen Presidential  Election of 1876,Vidal would foreshadow many aspects of the stolen election in the year 2000. And it also is very much about family, and the aging process.The novel is told from the point of view of Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. He was sent to France as a Minister during the administration of Martin Van Buren (in the late 1830s), and stayed abroad for more than three and a half decades. He is returning to the United States at the end of 1875, with his daughter Emma, who sports the title Princess dAgrigente. All of which is a bit pass, since her husband, who obtained his nobility from Napoleon III is dead, as is the Second Empire, as well as Napoleon III himself, and thus Emmas nobility seems to carry far more weight in post-Civil War America than the new Third Republic of post-Sedan France. Father and daughter had survived the Commune in Paris; he is a bit famous for having written a book about it. Coming back to America after that many years abroad, and he feels like Rip Van Winkle.  It resonated.The novel is well constructed and written. Schuyler has to reestablish himself as a writer in America. In the process, Vidal provides a tour-de-force of the American economic and political elite, and thus there are really only two cities: New York and Washington. The Astors, the Railroad Barons and the corruption within the administration of US Grant all are thick strands woven throughout the novel.  Why was the Grant administration so corrupt?  Vidal postulates that he was still sore about not having been properly remunerated for having saved his country as Wellington and Marlborough were, so he was willing to turn a blind eye to the ""sticky fingers"" that several of his ex-general buddies had. Also, Gore postulates in the action  that Schuyler  who is fictional  is the illegitimate son of Aaron Burr  but also subscribes to the dubious proposition that the non-fictional Van Buren is as well.My page-turning speed increased as Vidal depicts the stolen election of 1876. The Governor of New York, Samuel Tilden, won the election, flat out. (Schuyler was a Tilden confidant, and hoped to be named Ambassador to France). Tilden had a 3% margin in the popular vote. But then through the machination involving the Electoral College, the use of Federal troops in un-reconstructed Southern states, and old-fashioned hard cash, Rutherford B. Hayes, a candidate who won ZERO votes in the first round of the Republican National Convention became President. And the Rhymes?  The state of Florida was a key battleground in the fraud, Tilden, inexplicably would not fight as hard as Hayes, and in the end, the President was decided by ONE MAN: Joseph Bradley.The minor notes, the personal ones, also turned into major ones. The aging process, and its impact on a man of 63 is also a sub-theme. And of the family? Vidal faithfully depicts a basically loving, but somewhat distant relationship between Schuyler and his daughter, Emma. But after the climax of the stolen election, when I thought that I was in the winding-up denouement stage of the novel, Vidal throws a hard-strike on the inside corner that knocks you back with the question: Can you ever really know your own daughter? Hum. Overall, an excellent 5-star, plus novel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABCC2JD7YUCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375708723#wasThisHelpful","RABCC2JD7YUCD","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was offered this messenger bag for review I was going to say No Thanks, since I had recently acquired a similar bag for my own use. But then I thought of my son, who is poised to enter the corporate world, advanced degree in hand. Cant keep carrying the laptop in the ubiquitous student backpack, now can we? Demonstrating that he is indeed older and wiser, he agreed with his dad, and most of the following thoughts are his own.First of all, it is stylish, suitable for the world of, as it were, suits. And it is a quality product, made to last for years, if not until one becomes the CEO. The bottom corners are reinforced with leather patches. The stitching is of a thick thread, and tight. The over-the-shoulder strap clicks easily and solidly to the bag, and is an inch and a half wide, appropriate for the weight that is most likely to be carried. There are four different pockets that are enclosed by zippers; one is external, on the backside of the bag, the other three are internal. There are an additional two compartments not enclosed by a zipper. There is also smaller pockets attached to one side, designed to hold your pens or External Flash drives. Like all other aspects of the bag, the interior lining has a quality feel to it. In addition to the shoulder strap, there is a leather handle, which is solidly attached with three metal studs. As for the two leather buckle straps that close the entire bag, they work, and work well, but as my son says... in the rush of the corporate world, you probably wouldnt want to be doing that every day. The bags designers agreed. The bag is securely closed with two magnetic fasteners which are carefully and cleverly disguised under the leather straps.My son tested it with his 14 inch laptop, and it fits, as advertised. It also fits snuggly, to use his term, with the cover that he normally carries it with. And speaking of retro, there is certainly enough room for some old-fashioned paper, like the latest corporate report.

"Once upon a time... there was a political scandal... with all the normal mixtures of intrigue, the egos of the powerful, money, definitely money, and, of course, the pleasures of the flesh. Christine Deviers-Joncour personified the latter, for sure, and was deeply involved in elements of the first three. I'm currently reading Gore Vidal's 1876: A Novel which, in part, focused on similar scandals in the administration of U.S. Grant. And thus this book came to mind, which I read almost two decades ago, when the ""scandal"" was daily fare in the French papers, and barely mentioned outside the borders of ""the hexagon.""The title to the book is derived from what a judge called D-J in official proceedings. Not even soften... if that would be the right interpretation, by being called a ""high-priced one."" It didn't start out that way, of course, it never does. She was brought up, in Sarlat, Perigord, as ""the dutiful daughter,"" to use the expression Simone de Beauvoir did for her own youth. Then D-J got involved ""in the wrong crowd"" that thought it was ""right,"" via a couple of marriages to powerful men. The ""scandal"" irrupted when she had the ""interesting"" position of being the (very well-kept) mistress of Roland Dumas, the French Foreign Minister while her ""mentor"" was Alfred Sirven, the PDG (CEO) of Elf-Aquitaine. Meanwhile, there are some (considerable) ""commissions"" to be made in obtaining the permission to sell six frigates to Taiwan. She has the ""access"" that a comfortable bed can provide...And it all blows up... in a most unfortunate way, for D-J. The whistle gets blown, Dumas abandons her to her fate, as she is thrown into jail,  in a legal ""process"" in which there is no recourse, all with the objective of making her talk, about matters that she says that she knows nothing about.The baffling thing to me is what to think of it all. She writes the book from the perspective of ""the victim,"" and, at some level, she definitely was ""a pawn in their game."" On the other hand, she rakes in 66 million franc (as it was back then), and acquires a very nice 320 sq. meter appartement on the rue de Lille, coupled with what was once a 7000 euro a month ""job"" with E-A for which she had no qualifications. In the book she seems to be deliberately reticent about certain key matters.Admittedly, I thought she made some points that resonated: ""It is a universe of the powerful and the powerless. These men are incapable of creation. The power is their one compensation"" (Hum... talk about saying too much about intimate insights). As for herself, she says: ""Like an old crocodile, my ""leather"" has thickened."" The ""internet"" provided a two decades retrospective of the scandal, indicating that she has lost almost all to the French ""IRS"", and that today, at the age of 68, she sees no one. Alas.As for the book itself, I'll give it 3-stars, with a ""high uncertainty factor"" of one star, either way, attributed to sorrow over the human condition.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U20YQ9U3WJHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2290052418#wasThisHelpful","R3U20YQ9U3WJHW","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How can a reviewer give Shakespeare a three-star review, other than all those high school students who prefer to write two sentence 1-star reviews because they were forced to read it? Ah, theres the rub, to coin a phrase, but I am NOT giving Shakespeare 3-stars: rather the edition I have just read, and even less than three stars for the manner in which Amazon displays the editions. It is just flat confusing, and wrong. Since I started my effort to read all of Shakespeare, at the pace of one work a month, I have been purchasing all the works for Kindle reading. The edition I purchased does have a cover which corresponds with the cover (currently) displayed on Amazon  the statue in the fountain, with the portico in the background. But the edition is (maddeningly!) incomplete  the last few pages are missing! At least the confirmation was comforting  a couple other reviewers gave it a 1-star review  for incompleteness, and not because they were forced to read it. And who could quibble with that?Then there is the matter that at least two other hardcopy editions are displayed on the same page, and the editorial reviews that are associated with the Kindle edition seem to have absolutely nothing to do with the edition since they speak of copious and concise explanatory notes et al., with the other review mentioning appendixes that relate to Plutarch, Montaigne, et al.  And none of this exists in the edition I purchased, admitted for only 99 cents... but still. If this was a page on Wikipedia, there would be three separate whisk brooms, with the admonition that this page needs to be (really!) cleaned up.Oh yes, was there an actual play involved in all the above grousing?  Definitely, and I must have read 95% percent of the complete play, which poses its own sort of dilemma in terms of recording the play as read. It is yet another classic story  historically based  of power, corruption, intrigue, and death. The death of Julius Caesar marked a key transition in Roman history, from Republic, in its faded forms, to Empire.As with so much Greek and Roman drama, Shakespeare commences with a prophecy warning of the ides of March. A prime plotter against Caesar, Cassius, brings in Brutus (of et tu? fame) and seeks the respectability of bringing in the silver hair of Cicero. There are refreshingly modern and straightforward details such as Cassius relating incidents from his youth together with Caesar, a swim in the Tiber (in which the latter almost drown) to an illness in Spain, all proof, he says, that Caesar is not a god. There is a discussion among the plotters about killing Mark Anthony too, but then the consensus is that it would be too much like a butchery, and not a seasoned excise of this ugly boil upon the Republic.Caesar is killed, literally on the floor of the Senate, obviously long before those ubiquitous metal detectors. He is killed half way through the play, so the remainder is devoted to the (naturally inevitable?) falling out among the plotters, including a key division between Cassius and Brutus. Anthony performs a brilliant funeral oration, that seems to argue on the justice of the killing, but actually turns the tide against the plotters. He allies himself with Octavius, who would become Emperor.At one level, an exhausting read of intrigue and perfidy that makes hanging chads a much preferable method for power transitions. Who would have thought Id say that? The plotters do lose out in the end... if I only knew what that actually end was! 3-stars, reflecting a triangulation between an excellent play and an incomplete edition that did not live up to its advertising.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XTYQE6FXFMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LGTJS8#wasThisHelpful","R39XTYQE6FXFMB","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About 15 years ago I became ""addicted"" to walking sticks. Before then I had considered them one more rather useless piece of equipment to ""clutter up"" a good hike, until, of course, they got lost. But then I began having serious pain in one leg, particularly on downhill segments. I was fortunate to have been in a position to obtain a vast array of medical advice and tests, and so I did. Results: Negative. Even though these docs were my friends, there was this subtle suggestion maybe the pain was really in my head. The invariable response: NO, it is in my leg. Then one day I decided to start using walking sticks and the pain, be it in my head or in my leg, just flat disappeared, for lo' these past 15 years. I became a Believer (in walking sticks!).I've been using the same walking sticks for those 15 years, and still manage to hike a fair amount. When I was offered this one to review, I had to say yes, if for no other reason than to see if there had been improvements to a rather straightforward (as it were) piece of equipment. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were.I like the design. It is ""shock-corded"", and breaks into three pieces, about a foot in length. Light, at approximately half a pound, but strong enough to support my weight, I suspect, at least twice over.  A couple of fellow reviewers critiqued it for the lack of directions. However, I felt that the assembly was intuitive, with the main ""direction"" being on the stick itself: pull, with an arrow. Once that is done, far enough, a metal button pops out, and locks the stick firmly in place. The only other adjustment is for overall height. The measurements are clearly indicated, and an easily adjustable latch firmly locks the overall height into place. There is a comfortable ergonomically designed handle, with two straps. One at the top of the stick, the second Velcro one for the ""bear bell"" and who knows what other uses?Overall, it seems perfectly designed, for easy use. Perhaps one should buy three, since the only thing not ""design-proof"" is that aforementioned ability to lose one... or to be of assistance to a stubborn friend who prefers not to carry one. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GF90NRSTIIR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y80GK84#wasThisHelpful","R1GF90NRSTIIR0","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Seems like Oliver L. North and I have a few things in common. During the American War in Vietnam, we were there approximately the same time, the latter part of 1968 and most of 1969. We were both in the field. Though he was an infantry officer, and I was a conscript in an armor unit, seems like we both learned that tanks can be dangerous to be around. As North says: ""...in February 1969, I was badly hurt when the revolving turret of the tank I was riding on battered me like a baseball in the midst of a firefight..."" When we returned from Vietnam in 1969, a couple months apart, we both ultimately arrived in the Pittsburgh airport, and my experience certainly matched what North describes in this book: ""...there hadn't been any brass bands playing or welcome-home banners. Fortunately, there were no protestors awaiting me either..."" Yes, no one spit on us, at least literally. Turns out we both went back to Vietnam, within a year of each other, he in April of 1993, and I in January, 1994. We both felt there was some unfinished business we had with the country, and much to North's credit, he did far more about it than I. The impoverished infrastructure was obvious to both of us, and he describes some of the deficiencies in the medical area. He specifically names two Christian-based relief organizations in this book written in 1993 that were working in Vietnam in this area. Over two decades later - per my Internet search - they are still working there, a much better form of ""boots on the ground."" And I say kudos for that. And hence the title to the book, with ""mission"" being incorporated in the name of one of the charities.We are also quite different people. North is most famous, or is it infamous, for his role in what has been dubbed the ""Iran-Contra"" affair. In the 1980's, the United States was selling arms to Iran, and using the proceeds, with North being the key facilitator, to finance the  ""Contra"" rebels who were fighting the Nicaragua government. Funding for the Contras was specifically outlawed by the US Congress. North was arrested, convicted of three felonies, and this conviction was ultimately reversed. His role in this key scandal of the `80's is only lightly covered in this book.The first half of this book covers his experience during the war; the second half is the return in 1993, and a strong plug for the charities working there. Right from the beginning though, I had serious problems with his account. On page 14, North says: ""Only a fool or a totally BNG - a ""brand-new guy"" failed to respect our adversaries. BNG!! Of course, the initials were NOT ""BNG,"" they were FNG, and everyone knows that, including Google, where I just tested it again. And to be quite clear, the ""F"" is an expletive. So, why did the author decide to change that, when he knew better? To protect the sensibilities of the folks back home? Likewise, even earlier, in his backhanded ""compliment"" to his ""minders"": ""...made us all realize, without really trying to, that there are redeeming qualities in those we once fought against."" He demonstrates an obsession with the 2,200 MIA's, who, let's face it, we all know are dead. Why not a little more ""obsession"" with a real live veteran of that war attempting to obtain a medical appointment at a VA hospital, particularly for damage caused by Agent Orange, which the US government, at the time, was still denying that it caused any ill-effects?Well... before I really get going, let's just say that we shared, at different times and places, similar experiences, and retain different perspectives on the matter. As for the charity work, bravo, and even a rarely given salute.

"Last April a fellow Amazon reviewer and I decided to tour the ruins of three Spanish missions which are within an easy couple of hours drive from Albuquerque. The three missions are Quarai, Gran Quivira, and Abo, located near the southern end of the Manzano Mountains. A cool, crisp morning, and as can happen here in the Land of Enchantment, we were the first ones to visit two of the missions. Abos ranger station had a small selection of books, and this one caught my eye, since I was familiar with portions of US 60, particularly from Socorro to Datil. Once one climbs out of the Rio Grande Valley, heading west on 60, there is an old timey boarded-up motel, sitting on the side of the road, with the vast plain of the plateau behind it; it speaks of the utility of another era, when US 60 was one of the main roads across the United States, from coast to coast. Now it is an extremely rare person that would undertake that journey of 60, since it has been bypassed by Interstate 40 to the north, and Interstate 10 to the south. In New Mexico at least, US 60 is now mainly ghost towns and other towns, struggling not to be. Lots of broken dreams are along the road.Dixie Boyle provides a useful historical perspective of the people who settled along the road. In the eastern half of the state, many were motivated by the proximity of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. In the western half, it was cattle and mining, particularly around Magdalena. Boyle starts in the middle of the state, at the railroad hub of Belen, and then travels eastward along 60 to the Texas state line. The route goes past Abo, through Mountainair, and on to Fort Sumner, Clovis, ending at the state line. The author includes numerous photos, mainly of abandoned buildings  those aforementioned broken dreams. There are also some of people  of the snapshot variety, - the figures who helped settle these towns. She then returns to the central part of the state, south of Belen, in Socorro, and finishes the journey through Magdalena, Datil, Pie Town, and thence to the Arizona border. In many ways, the route is like the atom itself: a bit of matter, but mainly it is empty space.The last half of the book is devoted to brief stories of those who lived in the area as it was undergoing settlement by non-Hispanic Europeans. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, famous hunters, the women along the frontier, the boom-and-bust of the mining cycle are all covered. Regrettably, the most impressive sight along the road now: the VLA (Very Large Array) is given only one brief paragraph.I learned a number of things from the read. Fires devastated frontier towns, again and again, and hence there is often the lack of a solid historical record. The location of railway yards, switching points, and even stations was the key to an areas prosperity and decline. The area around Mountainair was once prosperous pinto bean farms, which were devastated by drought in the 1920s and 1930s. And US 60, near the Arizona line, was only paved in the 1950s.Im glad to see that Boyle is bringing out a new edition of this work. Hopefully the editing will be tighter, as there are some redundancies in the current volume. Finally, after we had both selected this work in the Abo ranger station, and was in the process of paying the ranger, did she reveal that she was the author of this work. It is an important effort in chronicling what once was, before life moved on, along another by-pass. 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFTNXGMQ0FPC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1432760904#wasThisHelpful","R2TFTNXGMQ0FPC","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When I was offered this device for review, which is touted as a USB drive that is actually a sound recorder, I thought it surely cannot be that simple. But it is!To utilize it the first time the battery must be charged, via the USB port, which takes approximately two hours. There is a red light which indicates it is charging, and goes out when it is fully charged. There is one simple ON/OFF switch, a small one on the side of the device. When it is ON, the device is recording. It is rated to record up to 13 hours before it needs recharging. Turning it OFF, the device functions as a normal USB drive. The one or more audio files can be played from the computers audio/video programs. In addition, all Windows Explorer functions work; therefore the audio files can be transferred to the main computer or laptop, or deleted when no longer needed.I recorded the music I was listening to at the time. While not an outstanding recording, it is more than acceptable since the device will mainly be used for voice recording. The file was readily deleted. The device is billed as a spy recorder, and indeed it can be used for that purpose, either masquerading as a USB drive which is innocuously attached to the laptop, or simply in ones pocket. At 16 grams, less than an inch wide, and two and a half inches long, it can be placed most anywhere. The only criticism I would have is that the USB connection is not retractable, as most drives are now, but rather has the old-fashioned cap. No doubt the length would have had to be longer to have had the retractable function, and the designers must not have thought that feature worthwhile compared to the shorter version they produced. Fair enough.iGearPro touts a return and replacement policy, as well as customer support. For me, the best customer support is built-in, that is, producing a device that WORKS WELL, the first time, and thereafter, thereby obviating the need for support.  This is such a product. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GB5M2YDNXTKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2GY2UY#wasThisHelpful","R2GB5M2YDNXTKI","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a popular website that proclaims: ""We watch Fox News so you don't have to."" Presumably a useful function. They catalogue some of the more egregious ""news"" items on the network, as well as focusing on the ""bias"" in their reporting. The network has an entire subset of the nation as faithful adherents, and thus the website can provide ready insight into their thinking. When I was offered Jed Ringel memoir for review, the aforementioned website was the first thing I thought of. Daily, my favorite - and sometimes not so favorite - internet provider taunts me - on my way to my email accounts that I have with them - with some admittedly attractive women, and the question:  Am I ready for Internet dating yet? It is an entire subculture that I will never experience. Ringel's book reflects his experiences, usually in a rather droll way, and many times without suitable introspection, if you discount the incisive comments of his daughters.The author drew me in on the second page, relating how he responded to a classified in the New York Review of Books. In the `70's I was a faithful reader of the Review, including the classifies, though I never decided to try to make a link. I do recall deciphering the meaning of the term ""Rubenesque,"" and its frequent use, `lo those many decades ago. Ringel quickly moves beyond the print media of old, and relates in detail the games(wo)menship of using a popular on-line dating service. It works. Many are called, but few are chosen, as it were. Some encounters are obliquely described, many others, far more graphically.It is a ""global market"" as we have been repeatedly told over the last few decades. And with the Internet, that clich is true of on-line romance, the prelude to the press-the-flesh variety. In particular, Ringel makes selections from two other major world powers: Russia and China. In terms of compounding the long odds for a successful relationship, his forays into these other cultures raised the odds by a couple of magnitudes. In one experience, which strained credulity, he flies to Volgograd, and seemingly on the merits of a brief encounter, arranges for the Russian woman (who already has a `green card') and her son, an American citizen, to come set up home in his Manhattan apartment. In another medium-term encounter, he initiates a relationship with a Chinese woman whose broken English is difficult to comprehend, at times requiring ""translation services.""As his daughters note in passing, he breaks off relationships that seem plausible to promising, and then goes out trying to draw three cards to fill an inside straight. At times he calls himself a schmuck and a jerk, and his book should be a cautionary tale for women who try on-line dating. As a sub-theme, he seems to shed real estate holdings, and acquire new ones, without particular motivation, as readily as he does women.Overall, like that aforementioned website, I found the book a useful look at an area where I will never venture. A good sequel would be a book of what all the women he dated thought of their encounter. Overall, 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBXJYBLPZGBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7YXH0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3UBXJYBLPZGBD","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third novel of Per Petterson's that I've read. Thanks to the Vine program, I first read It's Fine by Me, which led me to actively seek out Out Stealing Horses: A Novel - with the encouragement of a fellow Amazon reviewer. I wasn't satiated by any means, and with his encouragement, chose this one. I had finished the first chapter without realizing that this novel is not set in Norway like the other two, but rather at the extreme northern end of Jutland, in Denmark.The narrator is a young girl, and the story commences during the Great Depression. It is a tough, ""gritty"" existence, as so many others experienced during that time. She had an older brother, Jesper, and they rely on each other growing up in an unloving family. Her mother is remote - finding her salvation in religion. Many others, as they do at that latitude in particular, find salvation in the bottle. The grandparents live on a farm, where life is tough and hard; even a hardscrabble existence in a small town looks better in comparison. Both have dreams of getting away from their humdrum existence, to distant lands, she chooses Siberia (oddly, since she does not like the cold), and Jesper chooses Morocco. One makes it, the other one does not.I really like the way Petterson unfolds his stories, with matter-of-fact narrative, and a confirmation of a key event occurring in a single sentence. There are also those hints of events in the larger world, which the old men debate: Spain. Thus, you know it's coming; this will not be a long, drawn out adolescence; rather youth will end abruptly, with World War II, and the invasion of Denmark by Nazi Germany in May, 1940. There is virtually no fighting, but there is ""occupation,"" having to adjust to even greater poverty, and a range of characters in a foreign army, from well-meaning youths just a few years older than Jesper, to ruthless thugs. Jesper has long had leftist leanings, and so he is soon one of the early ones in ""the resistance."" On the other hand, there are those who were marked for ""collaboration"" ten years before the invasion.I found parallels with Carson McCullers' The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. Both novels have young, very intelligent girls in hard economic circumstances due to the Great Depression, as well as difficult family circumstances, and seem to miss their ""main chance"" at further education as a result. The potential is snuffed out, and both suffer the same fate in terms of employment. Each novel is a heartbreaking read of alienation and resignation, all too early.Way back when, 25 years ago, I spent a week at a Danish holiday resort - a ""folkeferie"" - on the north coast of Jutland, only 40 km or so from the novel's principle town of Skagen. At the folkeferie, all was light, fun, enjoyment, a much better life, and yet in living memory there were the tough lives that Petterson is a master at depicting. This is another book I should have read before the trip - far more meaningful insights than any travel guide can render. An excellent 5-star read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17G3GIECVAXM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VTZSGI#wasThisHelpful","R17G3GIECVAXM1","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... and accompanied by the best installation guide I have ever seen.First of all, the faucet set simply looks good.  And it feels good, with a particular ""heft"" that would at least imply many years of pleasant and leak-free use (whether that is true or not, in 10 years, is obviously beyond the scope of this review, which must be posted in 30 days... but will be updated in there are actual problems in its usage.)For those who have changed out faucets before - as I have - one knows that there is no joy in the project. The hardest part is often removing the current corroded and normally leaking fixture. Once that is done, Delta has provided an excellent step-by-step pictorial guide for installing their fixture. And it is designed so that virtually all the work can be done from ""up top,"" thereby minimizing that literal ""pain-in-the-neck"" under cabinet work (Note: one must still make the under cabinet connections to the water source - obviously!)The guide indicates all the tools needed to accomplish the job...which most homes have, and they also provide the 3/32"" Allen wrench that is required. Once assembled, it functions smoothly. The only word of caution before purchasing is to ensure that your counter top has the required, and properly spaced three holes, with the minimum diameter of 1 "". If not, perhaps your counter top also requires an upgrade - and sure enough- they are also available at Amazon.As for the proverbial ""cost benefit"" analysis, Delta scores 5-stars on that metric too. You obviously do not want to be changing faucets every day, so put in one that feels like it will last. It is value for money.

"...fills me with nostalgia.""So says Isabel Cutler, in her introduction to this collection of photographs on Saudi Arabia. This book was published in 2001, and appears to have been sponsored, in part, by Saudi Aramco, the oil company. There are approximately 100 quality pictures of the Kingdom, with more than half being of the natural terrain. Cutler does not state where she was living in the Kingdom; I assumed it was in Riyadh, since the majority of her pictures were taken within a couple hundred kilometers of the capital, which includes the Tuwaiq Escarpment and the al-Dahna sand dunes. She also traveled around the Kingdom, and thus there are pictures taken in the Asir Mountains, in the western part of the country, the Nabateen tombs at Madain Saleh, the outcrops nears Tabuk, and the Nafud and Rub Al-Khali deserts. It is a collection that focuses on the desert and the ancient ruins (including Dira'iya), and some modern mosques.There are also numerous pictures of people, mainly Bedouin, both women and men. She also took several pictures at the annual Janadriyah camel race. What sets her book apart from other books of photographs of the Kingdom is the inclusion of appropriate translations of Arabic poems, from both modern and ancient poets, that complement the pictures. She also includes quotes from Western travelers in the peninsula, from TE Lawrence (naturally) to Pierre Loti. There is a suitable bibliography and ""credits"" page.For me, the most impressive picture was of the dirt road snaking up the escarpment, with green desert flora in the foreground (page 116). And the portrait of the older man on page 145 is likewise an excellent photo.  Some others however, particularly vast landscapes were less impressive, notable the one of sunset and the clouds on page 104-05, and an aerial view of the Rub al-Khali, page 100-101, which must have been taken from an airplane. I studied each carefully and am not sure why the quality is off - was it the printing, or the actual picture itself.  Also, Cutler captured a ""transition,"" and it is unclear that she realized it. On page 26 there is a picture of an individual riding a donkey, with many sheep trailing in the background. The picture is labeled ""Bedouin shepherd."" But the individual is NOT a Bedouin, at least in the tradition sense of the word. Almost certainly, he is from Bangla Desh... and I have spoken with several in similar circumstances. They have been imported under contract to tend to the sheep, as the Bedouin of Arab origins ""retire"" to the villages and cities.Overall, I felt the nostalgia, and I smell the cardamom every morning, still. For Cutler's work, 4-stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUIUDSV96QK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0847823598#wasThisHelpful","R1UUIUDSV96QK8","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So concludes Per Petterson in his award-winning novel of remembrance of those decisive youthful events that changed the course of one's life, as well as those of others. My first reading of Petterson was his novel, It's Fine by Me, which came compliments of the Vine Program. This is the second novel (and won't be the last) of his that I've read, and I consider it by far the better of the two, since it resonated more strongly on numerous issues.The novel commences with Trond Sanders, who considers himself a ""spry"" 67, deciding to seek the tranquility of a cabin in the woods, along the eastern border of Norway, near the sea, to live out his days. Many a reader might envision a ""Walden""-style retreat. The timing is as the millennium turns. A chance encounter with his most immediate neighbor, who still lives a considerable distance away, proves fateful. It is a person that he has not seen for over half a century. An event so improbable, that it would normally diminish the quality of the novel, as the author says.  His neighbor is Lars Hung.The novel moves back and forth over time, from the present (1999) to 1948, when Trond is 15, and Lars is 10. It is only three years after the German occupation of Norway during WW II. Events during the occupation still reverberate. It is about friendships and familial relationships. One relationship is between Trond, in his coming-of-age mode, and his father, whom he realizes he does not know, and as events unfold, never will (that secret world of adults!). Trond, and a neighbor friend of the same age, Jon, far before the age of electronic diversions, seek amusement and thrills by riding their neighbor's horse; hence the title to the novel... which we also learn later is used in an entirely different context.A loaded gun, left unattended for just a few minutes, leads to the ultimate in tragedy that tears apart two different families. But one learns that the ""fault lines"" were there before this event...and they stem from the respective positions and actions of the family members during WW II, who resisted, who collaborated, and who just tried to ignore it all. I love Petterson's story telling technique: providing one data point as he is describing the natural world, and then many pages later adding or reinforcing another, and the reader must draw the long line between. For example, the reader learns that Trond and his father might be interested in the same woman, one approximately the father's age. Only glances and a bit of tension are indicated. Then many pages later, Petterson is more explicit, and has the father tell the son to go find someone his own age.The relationships examined are far more than fathers and sons. There are spousal ones, ones with the neighbor's spouses, the best friends of youth, and as life comes full circle, there is the meeting with Trond's estranged daughter, at his Walden-like retreat. And it is all done in this Scandinavian-minimalist style, lean and functional. Petterson also throws in enough ""creaks"" in Trond's physical functioning to resonate with those of a certain age... yes, we have to decide ourselves when we will admit that it hurts.  And it all plays out against the beauty of the Norwegian natural world, which is screaming out for a re-visit. A wonderful, thoughtful, 6-star read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8NTYVK7C41C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312427085#wasThisHelpful","R2W8NTYVK7C41C","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been to Japan a couple of times. Felt it best to avoid Tokyo, and so I flew directly into Osaka, with easy access thereafter to Kyoto. The latter does contain so much of what is worthwhile in Japan, and on a manageable scale. Tokyo on the other hand, or so I thought, was ""trop,"" just too much, and would have been overwhelming and even incomprehensible.Michael Pronko has lived in Tokyo for 15 years, teaching American literature, film, music and art at a Japanese university. He is a keen and thoughtful observer. He quotes Gustave Flaubert: ""To make anything interesting, you simply have to look at it long enough."" And 15 years of looking has provided a wealth of insights into life in Tokyo, which Pronko has broken down into bite-size pieces, in order to provide a mosaic of life there that is comprehensible. There are 48 essays in all, 3-5 pages each, with topics seemingly plucked at random for the ""chaos"" that is Tokyo.Indicative of his wry insights, he connects the classic tea ceremony with its seeming antithesis, popping a soft drink out of a vending machine. He notes that one must still perform a ""tea ceremony"" bow in order to extract the soft drink from the machine. Restaurants feature hanging cloth menus, completed in beautiful calligraphy, in ""kanji,"" of course. Pronko says: ""These hanging signs enhance the appetite by highlighting the food, acting as a kind of linguistic condiment. Without reading the signs in Japan, half the beauty of eating is lost.""  He takes the reader shopping to a grand department store, ""Don Quixote's,"" that seems to have no departments, but rather is a mad jumble that encourages impulsive buying. Bags for carrying objects have an entire hierarchy of importance and social significance. The best places to ""people watch""?  Train platforms, due to the lack of public space in other areas. As for the ever so brightly lit Pachinko parlors, Pronko concludes that they ""...demand an unusual mixture of patience, optimism and compulsiveness."" The author, in describing the maps dedicated to the cherry trees, and their famous blossoms, also uses a troika of words to describe them: ""beauty, renewal and brevity."" Tokyo has no grand vistas... it is literally a-MAZing, the subject of another meditation. He compares it to the Ryoanji in Kyoto, which displays 15 stones, but not all of them can be seen from one place.A few more topics:  the color ""pink"", and the respective difference in its importance, between Western and Japanese women. Escalators and stairs, and praise for the many small spaces, the nooks and crannies that still exist in this crowded city. There is still the contrast between the glitz and the glitter of chrome, and the old wooden buildings, of which the author says: ""The back and forth between the two can be dizzying, but contributes to Tokyo's oddly variegated visual charm.""Like the good English teacher I suppose he is, Pronko ""practices what he preaches"" by not only writing well overall, but also ending each essay with a pithy one or two sentence summation. For the first time visitor to Japan, or the ""repeat offenders,"" Pronko's essays are an essential ""guide book"" that should easily double the visitor's appreciation for the continuing ""wonder that is Japan."" As for my own quirky rating style for books, I reserve an extra star for those which provide a far better service than confirming my opinions; rather, Pronko's book actually changed my mind about Tokyo. 6-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BGWUHFUP5XWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194241000X#wasThisHelpful","R3BGWUHFUP5XWH","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something SERIOUSLY the matter with this product. At least the bag that I received. And from looking at the other reviews, it seems that I am in a significant minority that obtained seeds that simply would not germinate. Not a SINGLE ONE. Is it me or is it them? I feel comfortable, even after granting them numerous allowances, in concluding that it is them. The error rate is simply too high. There should not be numerous bags in which none of the seeds germinate.The particulars: The ground was prepared beforehand, with last years dead grass thoroughly removed. Three weeks before I seeded, I fertilized the ground. I spread the seeds, and raked them into the ground. I have waited the entire 30 days that the Vine program allows the reviewer before posting, and for that entire 30 days, the seeds have been in the ground, and watered every day. It is SPRING... and the temperatures have varied between 40 and 80. And still, absolutely nothing... when everything else is blooming.The differential diagnosis, to borrow a phrase from the medical profession, is that two years ago I purchased from the local big box store a bag of Scotts Turf Builder Landscape Mix for Tall Fescue Lawns.  The seeds were not blue; I had to keep the birds from eating them, and they DID germinate, just fine. So, obviously it is not Scott itself, which is the preeminent name in the field.

"Romain Gary is a late-in-life find. I was first ""introduced"" to his works about a year ago, and now I have read three of them. I consider the current work the best. The other two are Les Trsors de la mer rouge, and Adieu Gary Cooper (Combedie Ambericaine) (French Edition), both of which I have reviewed at Amazon.Romain Gary had a full and varied life. He was born in Vilnius (now in Lithuania) when it was part of the Russian Empire. His mother and he moved to Nice, France, and became French citizens in 1928. He would become an aviator with the Free French Forces during World War II. Later, he would become a French diplomat. He won the Prix Concourt twice, the only author to do so. He earned it for Les Racines Du Ciel (Folio (Gallimard)) (French Edition), which he wrote under his own name, and for La Vie Devant Soi (Collection Folio) (French Edition) which he wrote under his pseudonym, Emile Ajar. His first wife was Lesley Blanch, author of the excellent (The Wilder Shores of Love). And while he was serving at the French Consulate in Los Angeles, he would meet, and later marry the American actress, Jean Seberg. Much of this work is set in Los Angeles, during that tumultuous year, for America, as well as elsewhere, particularly France, 1968.Gary finished the book in 1969, and it was published the next year. It is impressive that he understood many of the complexities and nuances of that year, before they were fully played out. Like Tocqueville, he was a keen observer of the social forces and individuals in America. And he knows it. At one point, when he is at the airport, and a young ""hostess"" is crying, as she watches the buildings burn in the rioting after the assassination of Martin Luther King, he says that she looks at him with ""confidence,"" as one who possesses ""secular wisdom"" as a European. Then he says: ""I desired to take my French crown, and rub it a little in order to make it shine better.""Batka, we learn early on, is the ""white dog."" Gary acquired it, since it was ""in lust"" with his own German shepherd. It has been trained as a police dog in Alabama to track and attack blacks. And Gary, through the movie contacts of his wife, seeks to ""un-train"" Batka. But the general consensus is that he is too old, until Keys, a black trainer, accepts the challenge. (the cover to the book is a great one for conveying this situation.)With the ""White Dog,"" the stage is set for a wide-ranging and incisive examination of racial relations in that critical year. His wife, Jean Seberg, was an ""activist"" and funder of black causes. As a result, numerous ones were at the house. There are several critical takes on the in-fighting and hypocrisy in the black movement, along with actions of the FBI to exacerbate the problems. How to control the black movements? To start them, as Gary quips. In DC, during the rioting, Gary and his wife are at the Hilton, and he meets an old (black) comrade-in-arms from WWII, ""Red."" The latter, paradoxically on the surface, is recruiting blacks to fight in Vietnam, so as to ""learn the tools of the trade,"" and return to America to lead the armed uprising. Red's two sons represent two diametrically opposed aspects of the ""Army"" game.Gary ranges back and forth, from Hollywood, and Marlon Brando, and his cocktail party efforts for the cause, to Paris, the ""soixante-huitards"" (the student revolt), the C.R.S (the ""riot"" police), the pieds-noirs (Algerians of French extraction), and even a few meals at Chez Lipp. And far, far more times than not, he captures the complex motives and attitudes of the people seeking change, in a good ""cause"", and the forces of reaction. As Gary experiences, even an ""old guy"" can get clubbed in the head if he is not dressed ""right.""Impressive was the climactic moment in the novel, a sadly suitable denouement, which provides meaning to the second half of the subject line: Chien Noir.  Overall, a vital read, a French perspective on the most critical year of the `60's decade. 6-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6U6W2LZU5BV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2070360504#wasThisHelpful","R3L6U6W2LZU5BV","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read several books on America's misadventure and failings in Iraq, which culminated with the invasion in 2003, and have been ongoing ever since. Overall accounts by Thomas Ricks in Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2003 to 2005 and Rajiv Chandrasekaren in Imperial Life in The Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone each tell the depressing story well. Michael O'Brien's account is more depressing still. He is a graduate of West Point, was a Captain when he left the Army, and worked in real estate for numerous years before he signed on as a contractor for an unspecified company (to avoid law suits, as he says) to work on real estate issues in Iraq. He was there for 14 months, 2006-07.  Real estate? At first glance, for a war, one would not think you'd need a real estate specialist. Fallow ground for making a blockbuster movie, like American Sniper [HD]. But glance again, and wars really do carry a significant ""this is all about real estate"" component. On a more particular basis, when a given piece of real estate is taken over for a ""fire base,"" what happens to the claims of ownership nurtured via living on the land with ancestors going back over 5,000 years? And when that ""fire base"" is transferred from American military ""ownership"" to Iraqi military ""ownership,"" is everything accounted for... or nothing? O'Brien freely admits he did not do his job...but it was not for lack of trying. In this book, he looks back in (justified) anger, and has produced this rambling polemic.Like some other reviewers, I found myself agreeing with a lot O'Brien had to say, and disagreeing with a lot, also. It is very well-trodden ground to say that Bremer should not have disbanded the Iraqi military. In fact, O'Brien must make that precise point at least 50 times. (Is there anyone who thinks Bremer's actions were well-founded?) Likewise, that Rumsfeld was the key architect of the invasion plan, and he committed far too few troops to it.  He also states that virtually all the generals (save Shinseki) lacked the moral courage to stand up to Rumsfeld (it would have ""hurt their careers."") I also appreciated what O'Brien said about Colin Powell, and how he gave his ""credibility"" to the Iraq invasion in the infamous WMD speech at the UN... but also that O'Brien had gone back and quoted from Powell's cover-up report on the massacre at My Lai.What makes the book a worthwhile read is his experience in Iraq, as a contractor. It is ""SNAFU"" to the third power. Conflict upon conflict, among those supposedly on the same side. Inter-service rivalries among the Marines, Army, Navy and Air Force, all wanting ""a piece of the action."" Of course, all the military despises the ""contractors,"" such as O'Brien, since they are making the ""big bucks."" Reserve units, vs. the regular full-time military. And our Iraqi allies, who we are ""nurturing"" for the big takeover?  Best not to tell them anything, and exclude them from meetings in which we turn over the bases to them. One telling anecdote: O'Brien decides to go to the ""Inspector General"" (I.G.) over egregious wrong-doing. The I.G. is one of the cadets who was kicked out of West Point in a cheating scandal in 1976 (and re-admitted two years later!). O'Brien ends up being aggressively cross-examined by a Marine Colonel ... and, of course, the complaint goes nowhere.As for my disagreements with O'Brien, they are numerous. He makes comparisons between Iraq and Vietnam. Fair enough. He at least says that with Vietnam as a ""role model"" as to how not to do it, Iraq is worse. Fair enough, again. The author asks: ""How is it that men with high levels of education... vast experience in government... could turn right around and repeat the mistakes of Vietnam, almost as if it was scripted?"" But at another part of the book, he says ""...if we had only had 500,000 troops in Iraq""... no one would have stood against us. What?  Isn't that precisely the number we had in Vietnam? He goes on to claim that President Nixon ""almost won the with Operation Linebacker...""  What, redux? O'Brien is in favor of the draft. Fair enough, again, and even provides a telling quote from Napoleon on the differences between a citizen and professional army. At one point, he is saying we have the finest Army in the world, at another he is attacking the volunteer military as ""a social welfare system that throws money at kids who want to buy a new car,"" and goes on to say they are WAY over paid! What!... redux, redux, compared to a contractor in Iraq? Wasn't that the one of the ""rubs"" in forming a ""collaborative team""?Rambling?  O'Brien manages to excoriate Jimmy Carter over Iran, drag Obama's birth certificate into the book, declares that Roosevelt ""gave Eastern Europe to `Uncle Joe,'"" that Gore tried to steal the election in Florida using well-fingered ""chads,"" (O'Brien was on the scene, supporting Bush),and claims that on the way to Baghdad ""our forces were up against thousands of plain clothed guerilla fighters who were hiding behind every tree, rock, wall and doorway.""  He also claims that the Department of State is a ""liberal/pacifist"" department. He displays considerable racism at times with quotes such as ""typical of any Middle Eastern businessman. Screw the client in order to make more money now...""... before he moves on to take on the Italians!Overall, I am glad I read it, and it did improve my understanding of the continued failure(s) in American foreign policy... but there was also a significant downside to the read. 3-stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M46DZLA2LUUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMGV9YW#wasThisHelpful","R3M46DZLA2LUUD","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... and more than a dollop of persistence seems to have been common characteristics of these twenty remarkable women of the American West. Karen Surina Milford has written brief biographical sketches, roughly six to eight pages each, on each woman. ""Trailblazers"" is an appropriate title, since the vast majority literally were the first woman in their field of endeavor. Each sketch is accompanied by one or more pictures (or drawings) of the women. I was generally aware of the story of five of these women; the other 15 were completely new territory.The five that I had known about were Sacagawea, Georgia O'Keefe, Mary Pickford, Dorothea Lange and Sandra Day O'Connor.Sacagawea was only 16 years old, with a young baby, when she (and her rather sorry husband) left her Mandan village in present day North Dakota and accompanied Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the Pacific. Since she was originally from the Shoshone tribe, who lived in present day Idaho, she provided invaluable translation and ""bon fide"" services for the expedition. Georgia O'Keefe was from ""back East,"" a famous artist who (understandably) fell in love with New Mexico. Mary Pickford, I learned, was a very shrewd and calculating businesswoman who made the best of being typecast as sweet ""Little Mary."" Dorothea Lange, I also learned, contracted polio in her youth, and was self-conscious of the limp that she walked with. I felt this was a key insight into the empathy she demonstrated in her pictures of migrant workers that she took for the Farm Security Administration. And Sandra Day O'Connor grew up on a ranch in southeastern Arizona, which had no running water, and went on to become the first woman on the Supreme Court.The other 15 women demonstrated an equally impressive range of accomplishments. Wyoming was the first place in the world where women could vote. It was an early pioneer to that state, Esther Hobart Slack Morris who had the political ""moxie"" to corner two legislators, one from each party, and made them promise. A promise a politician kept! Abigail Scott Dunaway was also active in the suffrage movement, securing the vote for women in the Pacific Northwest. Bridget Biddy Mason was a slave from Mississippi who trekked with her Mormon master to Utah, and then on to California, which was a free state, and secured her freedom there, and went on to obtain a considerable fortune in real estate in Los Angeles. Another American Indian, Sarah Winnemucca, of the Paiute tribe, located along the border between Nevada and California attempted to bridge the gap between her tribe and the white world. Lotta Crabtree was an actress who played gigs in the mining camps of the West and Alaska and the Yukon. Jacqueline Cochran was a renowned pilot, and pioneered the acceptance of women pilots (in support roles) in the American air force during World War II. Mildred Babe Didrikson Zaharias was an athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she attempted. Dolores Fernandez Huerta had 11 children, but also spent a lifetime organizing migrant workers and improving their wages and living conditions. Mary Jane Elizabeth Colter was a designer and architect who primarily worked for the Fred Harvey Company designing rest stops along the Santa Fe railroad. Some of her most enduring work is still at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Jeannette Pickering Rankin was the first female Congressperson, and the only member of Congress to have voted against America's entry into both the First and Second World Wars.Mulford captured a dazzling range of accomplishment by pioneering women in their field. There are a few others I did not mention, one being Mary Hunter Austin, whose book The Land of Little Rain I have placed on my to-read list. For Mulford's wonderful introduction into the lives of some American Western women who ""made a difference,"" 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VUOTXTLDS1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0873587839#wasThisHelpful","R28VUOTXTLDS1U","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samuel Butler was a 19th century author whose most famous works were the work being reviewed, as well as The Way of All Flesh (Dover Thrift Editions). I have not read the latter work; I first read ""Erewhon"" in college, and this was a re-read. My Signet Classic copy of this work, which cost 50 cents, has an afterword by Kingsley Amis, in which he says that Butler's novel, which was first published in 1872, directly anticipated Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984 (Signet Classics). Erewhon, which is ""No Where"" spelled backwards, with two letters transposed, is a society in which the rules are different, certainly different that the ones of Butler's Victorian England. In postulating different rules, and examining their ramifications, Butler is often satirizing Victorian society.Butler, in his youth, immigrated to New Zealand, within 20 years of it being established as a Crown colony. He established himself in sheep farming. The lure of the Southern Alps is readily apparent, and like so many others who have found the attraction of mountains compelling, the first 50 pages of this novel reflect this obsession. The protagonist decides to ""break on through to the other side,"" and finds the land of Erewhon.His initial encounters with the natives of this land are reasonable. Fair hair and skin have much merit in a land in which most people are darker Mediterranean-types. What is disturbing to the natives is the protagonist's watch. Seems like the society, after a very bloody civil war, decided to destroy completely any invention that was created in the last 271 years (a number arranged through compromise.) Thus, no one had watches; the fact that he did could mean that he was attempting to ""subvert"" their society. For a while, he is jailed, only being released through the intervention of the king.It is a society in which medical illness is a crime, and much effort is expended trying to hide illnesses. Other sorts of crimes, like embezzlement, are treated like medical problems would be in England, with visits from ""straighteners."" No shame is associated with such crimes. In Erewhon there are ""musical banks,"" a vehicle by which Butler satirizes the churches of England.The true strength of this novel is the section on machines. It is important to recall that the internal combustion engine had not even been invented, and certainly there were no computers. There were only steam engines (which Butler calls ""vapor engines). Yet the author is amazingly prescient in postulating how machines, though inanimate at one level, would take over, and enslave the human species. In Butler's words: ""But the servant glides by imperceptible approaches into the master...man must suffer terribly on ceasing to benefit machines."" ""How many men at this hour are living in bondage to machines?"" Hence the Luddites?There is much else. Butler explores the imperatives of vegetarianism, including whether or not milk and eggs can be consumed, a la the vegans of today. He performs a delightful spoof on the rights of vegetables. In terms of the famous lilies of the field, that neither toil nor spin, he says the same can be said of Solomon!Butler anticipates Paul Goodman (and many others) by a hundred years, with his ""College of Unreason.""  Truly ""academic"" exercises, in the worst sense of the word. As Butler says: ""...but it appeared to me to be a wanton waste of good human energy that men should spend years and years in the perfection of so barren an exercise, when their own civilizations presented problems by the hundred which cried aloud for solution...""The protagonist and his Erewhonian girlfriend will escape Erewhon utilizing a device that had only been used for such purposes two years before the novel was published, during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. And I wonder if Butler's work inspired Frank Baum to use the same device in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?At times, Butler can veer towards the turgid and pedantic in his prose, but like reading Shakespeare in the language of the Middle Ages, I found it still worthwhile for all the reasons indicated above. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU8CRLKCQ6587/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486420485#wasThisHelpful","RU8CRLKCQ6587","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mohammad Rehman ""drew me in"" with his Prologue. I immediately thought of Norman Finkelstein, and his book, The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering. Finkelstein, who lost numerous members of his family in the Holocaust, in the prologue recalled the words of his mother: ""But to make out moral distinctions between ""our"" suffering and ""theirs"" is itself a moral travesty...In the face of the sufferings of African-Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, my mother's credo always was: We are all holocaust victims."" Rehman expressed very similar sentiments, naming broad groups of people, as well as individuals to whom he dedicates the book, for those ""who have suffered, and continue to suffer, whether it be for their color, race, religion, or caste."" The parallels between the two authors go further: both primarily focus on the wrong committed by individuals in their affinity group who exploit very real, honest and worthwhile sentiments and beliefs for selfish purposes.The book is divided into three main parts: 1. Selected verses from the Quran, along with an analysis from the author which covers approximately 200 pages; 2. A history of Islam which covers 50 pages; 3. a survey of 50 countries which the author considers primarily Islamic, which covers another 200 pages. A dominant theme is that there was only one period when true Islam was practiced, and that was during the life of the Prophet Mohammed. It was a life of simplicity. Ever since, it has been all downhill. His teachings have largely been ignored and corrupted. I thought that much the same could be said for Christianity, with a ""golden period"" during the life of Christ, followed by power struggles over leadership, and ""doctrines,"" thereafter. And on a secular basis, don't many Americans want to harken back to what ""the Founding Fathers really thought""? Rehman concludes his survey of the 50 Islamic countries with the following statement in the Epilogue: ""There is not a single country in the world that can truly be called an Islamic state...Today, its truth has been lost...It has become a mixture of the original form of Islam, versions created by different sects, thoughts and practices, further corrupted and tainted by illiteracy.""I found the historical summary of Islam the most useful, and based on my other readings, largely accurate. Even in the so-called Golden era of the first four caliphs, Rehman correctly notes and emphasizes that the three of the four were murdered. However, I did have a number of problems with the historical accuracy of various statements. For example, the date for Columbus's first journey to America is wrong as is the date for when Algeria became a separate nation. While better editing might be called for in those cases, that is not the case with the following assertion: ""How did the Islamic armies, capable of destroying the might of the Roman and Persian empires, not defend an eighty-two-year-old caliph..."" Not only was their no ""mighty"" Roman empire, there was no Roman empire at all when the Islamic armies surged across all of North Africa. Furthermore, I found Rehman excessively opinionated, and biased in regards to numerous judgments. Take a couple of countries with which I am familiar with: ""The Sauds were ruthless people who connived with the British to take over power from the sharifs."" That statement is also largely untrue. Concerning the UAE: ""There exists no humility or kindness in the attitude of the public, and the nation is totally corrupt and hypocritic [sic] in government.""One of Rehman's btes noires are the Wahabis, the religiously conservative sect of Muslims in Saudi Arabia. (He is joined by many others, of course). So, I found it ironic that he never noted the congruence of his own central beliefs and theirs; to wit, that both harkened back to the simplicity of life in the time of the Prophet, and deplored the subsequent distortions and corruptions of his beliefs. I also found that by providing a scathing critic of the application of Islam in 50 countries, and how practices fall short of stated beliefs, without providing a comparative analysis of how ALL countries' practices fall short of stated beliefs, that he actually did a disservice to those countries, as well as those who do honestly practice the sound tenets of Islam. Overall, 3-stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1G6M18V2GAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990928411#wasThisHelpful","R3R1G6M18V2GAV","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...or more properly, happy ""staff,"" since, as the old aphorism has it, ""Cats don't have owners, they have staff."" Cats have been part of my life ever since my daughter, age 8, retrieved a ""free range"" kitten from a dumpster in Riyadh. She is now almost 30. We currently have three cats in our house; one appears to be on a long-term ""lend-lease"" arrangement from that aforementioned daughter. So, when I was offered these cat tunnels for review, I decided to set down my book, and give it an honest review, as they say in the trade.Starting out, they are colorful and attractive. The two tunnels, one of which is half the length of the other, are designed so that the smaller one will slip into the larger, thus making an even longer tunnel. The size is appropriate for moving them easily from one room to the other, or outside onto the grass. And they are easily collapsible, as they readily restore to their proper full length. As any cat owner knows, not all three cats have the same opinion about their utility. Doing a bit of anthropomorphic projection, two of them appear to appreciate it as a good place to relax. We put treats in the tunnels to lure them in the first time. We also found using the laser toy was an effective way to have one of our cats run through the tunnel. One of our cats... just like kids... sure enough... gobbles her food entirely too fast, and, no surprise, is soon regurgitating her meal. She ""initiated"" one of the tunnels this way, and we found that the tunnel material allows for an easy clean-up (much better than off our carpets). That same cat, due to her seeming ability to come out of no-where and blitz outside, where she refuses to be hemmed in, has been named, by one of her ""staff,"" in honor of a recently retired safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

"... or in the Hindu Kush of today.The subject line is a classic one that flashes across the TV screen when professional stunt-persons are engaged in a particularly dangerous activity, and the show's producers want to protect themselves from lawsuits from an outrageously ill-prepared amateur sitting at home who goes out and attempts the same dangerous activity. This is a delightful story of two outrageously ill-prepared amateurs, Eric Newby and Hugh Carless, impulsively pursuing a whim, and not only living to tell the tale, but providing this very well-written account of same.The year was 1956. Both men were in their mid-30's. Both had survived the Second World War (Newby as a prisoner for three years). Newby was working in the family business, in the ""rag-trade,"" that is, high fashion clothing for women. Newby needs OUT, and cables his friend, asking if he'd be interested in going to one of the more remote spots on earth, Nuristan, in northeastern Afghanistan, and climb a mountain. He receives a positive response, and the adventure of a lifetime - well, not really, seems like Newby in particular had several others - commenced.Though neither were the wimps that Wilfred Thesiger, who used a more politically incorrect word, would accuse them of being when they had a chance meeting in Afghanistan, still, neither had ever done any technical climbing (that is, with ropes, karabiners, et al.). (This is the same Thesiger who twice crossed the Rub Al Khali of the Arabian peninsula, and would live with the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq for a couple of years). Carless and Newby set off for Wales to learn the skills of mountaineering... ""belaying"" and all... in a couple of days! That would be their total training. They then drove to Afghanistan, across Europe, and taking a (familiar to me) overland route through Turkey and Iran, and on to Kabul. Carless was in the British diplomatic service, with his next posting in Tehran. Time was limited, so they never had enough to ""smell the roses."" He had been in this area of Afghanistan before, and surveyed much of the territory. They drove north from Kabul, and were soon in Panjshir Valley, walking, with horses and Afghani guides.Newby writes well. He is fully knowledgeable with the names of the flora and fauna. He lovingly describes the landscape (if Newby's words are not enough, I highly recommend some of the books of photography, produced by a French couple, Roland and Sabrina Michaud including Afghanistan and Caravans to Tartary who were there an approximately the same time). Newby's style is well-executed British understatement, as suggested by the title. (Hindu Kush means ""Hindu killer,"" purportedly because so many low-land Hindus who were captured by Mongol raiders, to be taken to the slave markets of central Asia, died in these mountains.)Neither Carless nor Newby had ever climbed on ice or snow before, but they attempt to climb Mir Samir, which is 19,880 ft.  The Afghani guides, who did not accompany them on the climb, never thought they'd see them again. At times, they are literally reading the how-to manual as they climb. How many times they could have died... but it truly was a case of ""beginners luck"", as well as some understated British fortitude.In the last third of the book they make it into Nuristan (which means country of light), and was renamed from ""Kafirstan"", (country of unbelievers) after their mass conversion - at the point of the sword - at the end of the 19th century.There is an introduction by Evelyn Waugh who wryly notes: ""For more than two hundred years now Englishmen have been wandering about the world for their amusement, suspect everywhere as government agents, to the great embarrassment of our officials."" On a whim and a lark, ""because it was there"" motivation, a wonderful impulsive journey well-told. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M4BZBCIM2LXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007367759#wasThisHelpful","R1M4BZBCIM2LXA","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even for the many who have never read Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time [volumes 1 to 7], they are still aware that at the commencement of his epic work, there is a moment when the protagonist longs for his mother's goodnight kiss. There is also a small French pastry, the madeleine which can evoke a flood of involuntary memories, particularly from one's childhood. In Saudi Arabia the most popular TV show, a social satire, is called ""Tash ma Tash."" The title is a reference to a Saudi childhood game of the 1950's, when a popular soft drink was introduced to the Kingdom, and the kids would loosen the caps of some of the bottles, releasing the fizz, and one would have to guess: Foam, No Foam. In Yousef Al-Mohaimeed's brilliant novel, one learns half way through that the title is derived from another Saudi childhood game, where the kids would have to state if a given item could fly. Could a feather fly, for example? Pigeons and feathers are two themes that Al-Mohaimeed weaves into the texture of his novel, repeating them in different contexts and with different significances.The novel opens with the protagonist, Fahd al-Safeelawi, on a train going to Great Yarmouth, in England. One soon learns that this ""green and pleasant land"" is a place of refuge, for Fahd, as well as his Saudi friend, Saaed. The year is 2007. The rest of the novel is devoted to why it is a place of refuge; a sanctuary from a land where the rules are so different that, yes, even the pigeons don't fly.One of the immediate catalysts for Fahd's exile was his arrest in Riyadh by the Religious Police, sometimes called the mutawaa, with the more proper name being the ""Society for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice"", an Orwellian name for sure.  He is having a cup of coffee, in the MORNING, in the ""family section"" of a commercial establishment, with his lover, Tarfah (she too is arrested). As the novel unfolds, the reader learns how many ""chances"" they had taken to be together, the many night time assignations, some told so well that I felt my heart racing, thinking of the consequences if they were caught. The irony then is well played out, over this ""innocent cup of morning coffee."" Al-Mohaimeed hits every note true when he depicts the scene, because the lead mutawaa is ""smooth,"" one who has been trained well not to make a scene... ""come my brother, just a few forms to sign... we just want to know the truth, and help you avoid sin"" and all that rigmarole that masks the essential violence of thugs in action, or, as the author puts it:  ""The guardians of twisted virtue, the guardians of the imprisoned breeze, leapt to pluck out my joy in its first year of life. I wonder, why do these severe and grim-faced men invade the precious privacy you have with your beloved?""The author reveals Tarfah's back story as well, her rebellious youth (naturally), and her two failed marriages, which provides that sense of: ""freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose."" The reader also learns of some of the other women in Fahd's life, one old enough to be his mother, and what has motivated them to adopt so many subterfuges for those moments of stolen pleasure.The seminal event in modern Saudi history was the taking of the Grand Mosque in Mecca (Makkah) on the first day of the Higerian year 1400, which corresponded to November, 1979. For an excellent account of this event, I'd recommend YaroslavTrofimov's The Siege of Mecca: The 1979 Uprising at Islam's Holiest Shrine. This event definitely impacted the lives of Fahd and Saeed's fathers, and Saeed was there (!), in his mother's womb. Naturally the children experienced the reverberations, and Al-Mohaimeed is a master at revealing, through ""back and fill,"" the motivations of those who took part, and the repercussions. Fahd was originally from Buraydah, the most conservative town in Saudi Arabia. Many from this area were part of the Ikhwan, fearless religious warriors who were an essential part of Ibn Saud's army when he created the modern day Kingdom. Fahd's father, Suleiman's childhood was a bit ""troubled,"" due to his overbearing and quite conservative father, Ali. It was the motive force that resulted in Suleiman handing out religious pamphlets that were just a bit too critical of the secular Saudi leadership. Saeed was a ""Southerner"", (from Khamees Mushyat), and I would learn that their nickname is the area code for the region.And there is so much more, including insights into the educational and medical systems, not to mention the enduring practice of sorcery, often by those who proclaim religious rectitude.I lived in Saudi Arabia for 20 years. As a foreigner, and in particular a Westerner, I was always on the ""surface of things"". The ""rules"" and motive forces of Saudi society did not particularly affect me, as long as I was nominally respectful in public, a 5% adjustment to my behavior. I gained numerous insights into the society, sometimes by quietly observing and ""connecting the dots,"" and at times being taken into the confidence of various Saudis who more or less decided I really wasn't in the CIA (or more perversely, hoping I was, in the belief that an outsider might change what they were unhappy about.)Reading this book was like eating an entire box of madeleines, evoking not childhood memories, but those of middle-age, as those memories intersected repeatedly with Al-Mohaimeed's not so fictional characters.  Almost certainly, I drove past Saeed's father, on that twisting mountain road in the Asir, between Abha and Taif, one week before the commencement of 1400. In my house today I have a fine carpet, purchased, nay virtually ""stolen"" from the souk in Buraydah, for 300 SR, since the style had changed, and the citizens wanted those new acrylic carpets, as they abandoned their mud homes and moved into proper cinderblock housing. I was associated with a country and western music band that played, ""on tour,"" in the Canadian compound, 10 km south of Buraydah, whose workers were responsible for the electrification of Qassim province. What would Ali, Fahd's grandfather, who had been warned to fix the squeaky hinges on his door, because they ""sounded too much like music"", have thought of our very real (more or less) music? I loved the author's depictions of Riyadh, including the ""big slide"", near the King Faisal foundation, just off the King Fahd expressway.Finally, there is that principal reason Fahd is in England: the religious police. All four members of my family had run-ins with them, one way or the other. Mine may have been the most serious, facing trumped up and false charges, but just like Fahd, with a bit of ""wasta"", a word that Al-Mohaimeed does not use, but means connections with those with power and influence, and I also was saved. And there will always remain the ultimate irony: those men, ""severe and grim faced"" who ""plucked the joy"" out of so many lives, almost certainly saved the life of my daughter. It's hard to say: ""I owe you one,"" but the realistic assessment is that I do. There are still a few flying pigeons in ""The Magic Kingdom.""For Saudis and non-Saudis alike, this is a marvelous 6-star, plus, read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D76SVK1IE29Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PH6QZCY#wasThisHelpful","R2D76SVK1IE29Y","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It is putting one's head, one's eye and one's heart on the same axis."" That was the essential insight of Henri Cartier-Bresson into the art of photography, and his was indeed an art. I have a British photographer friend who would quip: ""the best camera is the one you have with you."" And long before the ubiquitous cell phone, Cartier-Bresson always seemed to have his with him. Time and time again, he seemed to capture ""the decisive moment,"" a phrase that he coined.Cartier-Bresson lived almost a century, spanning virtually all of the 20th. A full and vital life. He is credited with ""inventing"" photojournalism. Capturing those spontaneous street scenes. During the Second World War he was captured by the Germans, in 1940, at St. Die, in the Vosges Mountains. He spent almost three years in forced labor, and many assumed he was dead. He emerged stronger, and with a sense of purpose; he founded the Magnum Photo Agency after the war. He also seems to have found his true love late in life, the essential ""zest"" in all things.A fellow Amazon reviewer recommended the first volume in this Aperture Series, on Paul Strand, which I have now reviewed. When I realized that Cartier-Bresson was the second volume in this series, it was another essential purchase. Both volumes are superlative productions by the premier publisher of books on photography. There is very little narrative. The pictures speak for themselves, sometimes ambiguously, as is the master' style. The Aperture series provides a representative sample of the photographer's work. In this volume there are approximately 40 black and white photographs.Some of his most famous photographs are missing, for example the ones of the authors Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead, I was surprised and delighted to see one of William Faulkner. There are also ones of the artists Henri Matisse and Paul Bonnard. By far though, most are the anonymous people from his street scenes. And these are located across Europe, as well as in China, India, Mexico and Africa. There is a haunting picture that captures the intense devotion of a young man as he kisses the hand of a cardinal in Montmartre, 1938 as well as a French working class picnic along the Marne River in the same year.The French have an expression (don't they always!) that conveys two bodies deeply intertwined: ""coll serr."" That also seemed to be a passion of Cartier-Bresson, whose most famous one in that regard is of the American sailor kissing the woman in Time Square, in NYC, at the immediate end of World War II. (there are some stories that have indicated some ""staging"" went into that photograph.) In this volume, on page 33, there is a photograph that I had never seen before, that seems to brilliantly capture the concept of ""coll serr.

"I have a British friend who has worked lo' these man years in the field of archeology. He introduced me to the concept that in archeology ""Provenance is everything."" Essentially it means that without knowing the surroundings and circumstances in which a particular historical artifact was found, it provides very little, or no understanding to the historical record. Also, in archeology there is a problem with historical artifacts that are faked, and even the provenance of real ones altered to fit a particular theory. Hum. Anthony M. Amore, in this delightful book, provides very similar insights into the wheeling-dealing that can be operative in the world of high-end (that is, expensive) art. The word ""Provenance"" must be used fifty times in his account.  It is a KEY element to determining if a given art work is authentic (fortunately there is also scientific analysis.)For me, the world of high-end art is a ""world apart."" I'll never be spending millions for an impressionist painting, for the most normal and obvious reason. And one story in this book underscores why I would not, even if I had those millions to spend. Amore draws the reader in with an anecdote which proves that art fraud is as old as the United States, and even involved the Gilbert Stuart portrait of our ""founding father,"" George Washington. Seems that ""trust"" is an essential ingredient in a fraud (there was a famous cartoon in one of America's leading financial periodicals that had two brokers walking down the street, one giving the other the following advice: ""You have to gain the client's trust before you can take advantage of them""). In Stuart's case, he trusted a sea captain, Captain John E. Swords. The sea captain wanted a painting of his beloved President, who had just died, and asked Stuart if he could buy one. Stuart's only non-negotiable demand: you cannot have copies made. Swords readily agreed, and just as readily took the painting to China where he had numerous copies made.The author follows with 11 well-told tales of fraud, some that fooled the best experts in the art field, and some involving the oldest and most ""reputable"" names in the business. Each is based on the documents and testimony that became available in court cases when the scam unraveled, and the perpetrators were caught. The aforementioned ""provenance"" had to be faked, and often that was more complicated and time-consuming than the production of the actual faked piece. Wars provide a good cover, particularly with the Nazis, who, conveniently for the modern-day fraudsters, DID steal a lot of art. And there is the hoary ""the artist gave my grandmother the painting, and we just discovered it in her attic.""  The aging of pictures and the wearing of fake period costumes for same, to include the fake paintings in the background was particularly ingenious. It does take ""two to tango,"" and Amore does not neglect the gullibility of those who want to believe a story that is ""too good to be true,"" all in the interest of getting an ""incredible bargain.""Amore's story of a Cezanne painting underscores why I would never buy one, even given the millions. I won't give the whole story away, but it involves the artist's painting ""Bouilloire et Fruits."" A man who lived a simply lifestyle inherited this painting, ""worth"" millions, and had it on the wall of his house in rural Massachusetts, where he seldom locked the doors. He truly ENJOYED looking at the painting.  It was stolen, and it took much effort, and much money, over 2-3 decades, to recover it. During that time period it was hidden away, and no one enjoyed it! And when he did recover it, it was worth so much money he could never simply place it on the wall of his home again - and had to sell it!I have found some of the works of Hubert Robert and Eugene Fromentin appealing. No doubt, ""minor"" artists, as many of the art dealers in this book would have ""sniffed.""  Now I am empowered, thanks to Amore, to ""sniff"" back, quoting from no less an authority than Malcolm Forbes, who was fond on the old axiom to ""Buy what you like."" I checked on the Internet, and there are numerous sources from which you can buy a ""legitimate"" reproduction (so stated) of the work, for $100 - $200. Having that on my wall would give plenty of pleasure, perhaps more than I deserve. And I'd even be happy to buy a reproduction of Cezanne's Mont Sainte Victoire in lieu of seeing it out of my bedroom window. Thanks to Amore for insights and tales from a world one step too far for me. 5-stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YWZT4D5P2CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279877#wasThisHelpful","R21YWZT4D5P2CI","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...is how H. Stuart Hughes commences his wonderfully erudite study of half a century of European history.  He continues the subject sentence: ""...was taken for granted at the beginning of the twentieth century. Nearly all Europeans - and most non-Europeans as well- assumed that this little continent would continue to play the leading role in world affairs, as it had during the four centuries past."" But in that half century, that assumption would radically change.I first read Hughes account when I was at university in the `60's. Realistically, I had learned so very little history (and therefore was bound to repeat it?), and most of that American, that Hughes literally opened the door to a completely different world, one that I was totally unfamiliar with. So many names, so many ""complex interacting historical forces"" that I could not possibly have imagined. I was most impressed, and therefore within five years of my first read, started visiting all those strange place names for the first time. I also tucked away a vow that this history required a reread.After another half century, I have accomplished it. I remain dazzled by the sheer mastery of the material that Hughes has. There are no ""little guys"" in this account. It is the ""Big Men"" (and yes, they were almost all men, as well as being white), along with those abstract historical forces which are so often rooted in economics and ethnic affinity. Again and again, I found Hughes providing carefully weighted and balanced assessments of the conflicting forces, and that these assessments have withstood the test of time.He commences his account on the eve of World War I; a period others have called The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914. Overall, the world was optimistic, with rising living standards and continuing positive breakthroughs on the scientific front, with wonderful practical applications. Then those interlocking and conflicting ""abstract"" forces, controlled, and not, at the same time, by a few men, unleashed the disaster that would be World War I. On the re-read, I know where the Somme and Verdun are, since I have been there. And his assessment resonated so well: it was there that ""The Proud Tower"" died, since so many of the European upper class were killed there (and how unlike more recent wars, that are carefully eschewed by the ruling class).  And speaking of which, another of Hugh's assessment concerning the role of Mussolini, in his shift from the political left to right: ""Italian corporatism stood revealed as little more than an elaborate engine of class rule.""Hughes account is far more than politics and war (though, given the period covered, much of both is discussed). There are chapters devoted to cultural developments, in art, literature, architecture, etc.  And in Hughes' style, they are succinct, crisp summaries. There are chapters devoted to the rise of both communism and fascism. Also, naturally, there is much on economics and the Great Depression. The final portions of the book deal with World War II, and the immediate aftermath. He ends his account in 1960.I found myself in the role of the ""Greek chorus,"" that is, knowing how the drama would turn out. For example, in reading about Robert Schuman, and how he was instrumental in creating the European Coal and Steel Community that would ultimately lead to the Euros I have held in my hand. The war in Algeria was not concluded upon publication, and now I have a much better personal awareness of its denouement. Likewise, the length of time to the denouement not only of Portugal's colonies, but communism itself.As a final note, I found a list of 60 or so great books that was given to me by that college professor in my junior year. I've managed to read about half of them so far... and if I really hurry, who knows if I can break three-quarters?  As for Hughes truly brilliant history, 6-stars.(Note: of the various versions listed at Amazon, mine is the one published in 1961, with 502 pages of text.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUDESU1Q4E6QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0131697633#wasThisHelpful","RUDESU1Q4E6QL","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... revealed.Ali Kazuyoshi Nomachi is an outstanding Japanese photographer who converted to Islam. Seyyed Hossein Nasr is Iranian-born, and a Professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University when this book was first published in 1997. They had ""access,"" which should probably be written in capital letters. You have to have ACCESS to take aerial photographs in Saudi Arabia, and they are most impressive. The ""access"" came from the Saudi Royal family, in the personages of the governors of Mecca and Medina. The other essential piece of this collaborative effort is the publisher, ""Aperture,"" perhaps THE publisher of photographic books, with my copies of their books on W. Eugene Smith, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Paul Strand, et al., readily coming to mind. The result of this collaboration is a very high quality, and in many ways unique book, that can be appreciated by Muslims and non-Muslims alike.Dr. Nasr commences with a historical explanation of the relevance of the region, starting with Adam and Eve, through Abraham, and then the origins of Islam, with the Prophet Mohammed. I have an overall familiarity with the story, and found the summary useful. The heart of the book, of course, is the photographs. Nomachi has a keen eye, and brings out the sheer diversity of those who consider themselves Muslims, and live over that vast swath of earth from Mauritania to Indonesia. For example, there are some colorfully dressed African women, probably from Nigeria, and other more uniformly dressed women from Indonesia. In another picture, Nomachi brings out the fact that the Muslim men and women from South Africa pray in a single straight line, which is not the norm. Although somewhat understated, some of the problems of the pilgrimage are indicated, including heat stroke and public health problems related to contagious diseases. And the ritual of stoning the pillars (Jumarat) that represent the devil is historically dangerous, due to crowding and stampeding. The only issue I found confusing is when Nomachi was actually there:  during the ""Haj,"" or during Ramadan, which is roughly two and a half months earlier, or both?The photographer grants ""equal time"" to Medina, the second holiest city. I have seen numerous quality pictures related to Mecca and the Haj; far less so for Medina. The aerial photograph of the Prophet's Mosque at sunset, with the mountains of the Hijaz is most impressive. All religions have their charlatans and ""believers"" who are only going through the motions. Nomachi had a knack for capturing those individuals whose belief seems most genuine. For many, this would be the highlight of their life. The last 10% of the book is composed of pictures from other areas of Saudi Arabia. I found the sunset pictures around the oasis of al-Ula stunning.I lived in Saudi Arabia for 20 years, and traveled extensively throughout the country. As a non-Muslim I was not permitted to go to these cities. That issue is the source for a couple one-star reviews of this book. One even charged that the cities are ""racist,"" which is irrefutably belied by these pictures. The exclusion is based on one's professed faith. If anyone really felt a visit was essential, they could always become Muslim, as the photographer did. Though I would have liked to have seen these cities in person, I ultimately decided that the exclusion is OK, since most religions have rules regulating those outside the in-group, including the Indian pueblos of New Mexico.As a final point, this was a wonderful ""impulse"" purchase. Amazon, in their ""wisdom,"" offered me the book based on my other purchases, for four bucks, and some change. As I post this, it is no longer available at that price. The luck of the draw... or, hum is Amazon moving towards omniscient status? Anyhow, I am quite pleased with my 5-star purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34E8M1QNK0MX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804843821#wasThisHelpful","R34E8M1QNK0MX9","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lies, deceit, treachery, poison, knives in the night, justified paranoia, guilt, revenge... it is all there, and more, in this classic story of how the lust for power can literally drive people crazy. It can also kill them. I first read this play of William Shakespeare as a high school reading assignment, the way the vast majority of people do.  Lo these many years later, Ive undertaken a project of re-reading a lot of those H.S. reading assignments, including the plays of Shakespeare, in part to determine how much I missed the first time around, which, in two short words is normally: a lot.The play is set in Scotland. The king is Duncan. His not faithful lord, called thane in Scotland at the time, is Macbeth. And he has a wife who has become a symbol of all wives who relentlessly push their husbands to be successful, and who is normally addressed with the misnomer of Lady. (Thats no lady, thats my wife...but I digress). As Cliff Notes will tell you, Duncan is murdered in his sleep, with those proverbial long knives. Macbeth skillfully diverts the blame to his body guards, who are conveniently also killed (a death man tells no tales) while also casting suspicion on Duncans sons, who have fled for their lives to further shores. How many times, throughout all the cultures and civilizations of the world, has this scenario basically unfolded?Throughout many of his plays Shakespeare utilizes elements from the ancient Greek plays, such as prophecy and a chorus that predicts future events, often esoterically. In this play, Shakespeare uses three witches around a cauldron, stirring, and if there is one line that most people remember from the play, it is the first line of their chorus:  Double, double, toil and trouble.A fellow Amazon reviewer noted a quip that Shakespeares plays are simply quotes strung together, a humorous way of noting that many portions of the play have entered the popular, albeit intellectual portion, of our culture. For example, after the first Iraq War (yeah, I know, it is hard to say which one was the first one now), the cover to the The Economist featured the line: When the hurlyburlys done.  My first high school reading failed me, and I had no idea this was a reference to a line in Macbeths opening scene, with the second line being: When the battles lost and won. And is that battle lost or won?  Proving the enduring relevance of Shakespeare in so many settings, later in the same scene he writes: Her husbands to Aleppo gone, master o the Tiger. I havent seen The Economist use that line to refer to its British citizens going to fight for ISIS.Another quote that I remembered, and life experience has proven to be so true: Sleep that knits up the raveld sleeve of care. Hum. Another quote that life experience proves true: Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him... makes him stand to and not stand to...  Finally, so that I literally dont quote the entire play, another classic scene that personally resonated, due to my travels, was Lady Macbeths efforts to wash the blood off her hands, and she proclaims: All the perfume of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.Another excellent, still so relevant play of Shakespeare, that needs to read more than twice. 5-stars, plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COETTDGUKE3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIAKOJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1COETTDGUKE3W","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alexandre Yersin.He was born a Swiss national in 1863. His father died when he was young. His mother raised him, and the letters that he conscientiously wrote her throughout her life provided a valuable source for reconstructing his fascinating life. He was fluent in German and French. His initial medical training was Germany, in the town of Marburg. But it was ultimately France that would attract him, decisively, and he joined the ""band of Pasteur."" These were a group of gifted ""disciples"" who studied under Louis Pasteur, who established the field of microbiology, and developed immunizations against various diseases, notably rabies.It was ""La Belle Epoque."" Much scientific progress was being made on many fronts, with notable improvements on the human condition.  Yersin made his ""mark"" early, contributing to the understanding of diphtheria. Scientifically, he is most remembered as ""Yersinia pestis."" During an outbreak of the plague - ""the Black Death"" of the Middle Ages - in Hong Kong, he was the first to identify the bacterium that causes the plague, which led to the immunizations against it.He was a polymath, and had the wanderlust. His ""hero"" was Livingstone, a fellow physician best known for his explorations in Africa. Before it was even known officially as ""Indochine,"" Yersin hired on as a ship's physician, and went to what we still call the Far East. For a couple of years, he was a regular on the ""Saigon-Manila"" run. He would eventually stake out his claim to a bit of earth (which he kept constantly expanding!) in Nha Trang, in modern day Vietnam. Like numerous others, the mountains of the Annamite Cordillera ""called to him.""  The achievement that I envy the most is that one day he left his home of the ""wooden shack"" in Nha Trang, and walked all the way across the Cordillera to the Mekong, and beyond, to Phnom Penh, in present-day Cambodia. In the process, he passed an area he realized would make an excellent ""hill-station,"" where Da Lat would ultimately be founded, through his vision (and political contacts).Patrick Deville tells the story of Yersin so well. He won the ""Prix Femina"" in 2012 for his efforts. He smoothly moves back and forth across time, with a key event being when he left France for the last time, in May, 1940. Deville also had to master a great deal of scientific detail (but does not convey enough to make the reader's eyes glaze over). He repeats some common themes (like how Yersin hated the ""filth"" of the political world, and usually stood aloof), with the appropriate frequency. Deville weaves into his story the ironies a long life can provide. Consider: It was Hitler and Goering's love of art that spared the Bourget airfield from bombing (since this is where Hitler would land for his ""lighting tour"" of Paris, in June, 1940). And Yersin would be on the last French plane that left that airfield in May, 1940... making the long journey back to his beloved ""empire within an empire,"" Nha Trang, and his extended agricultural estate, to die, at the age of 80, while it was under Japanese occupation, in 1943.I've read my share of books on Vietnam, and some have certainly been a ""trodden path."" Few books have provided so much sheer NEW information to me. In addition to the above, Deville relates Yersin's relationship with a host of individuals, like Paul Doumer, who, for Americans, was most famous for lending his name to a bridge in Hanoi we were trying to bomb during ""our"" war there. Doumer was ""the orphan of Aurillac"" who helped found Da Lat, and would eventually be gunned down by an assassin in France, in the 1930's. Yersin also knew Louis Ferdinand Celine, another physician who was in the ""band of Pasteur.""  Yersin would become rich, and was known as the king of rubber and quinine, for the production from the trees of his ""little empire,"" that he thrust into the hills above Nha Trang.Deville's excellent book resonated on so many points. For four months the aforementioned Annamite Cordillera called to me, and said ""come,"" walk through me, as Tim O'Brien captured in Going After Cacciato [Paperback] [1999] (Author) Tim O'Brien. Around 200 km from Nha Trang I was once a small cog in the process that Yersin initiated, and over the course of a year gave 200-300 immunizations for the plague and cholera, still remembering the dosages (.2cc and .5cc). And during a war there is that grave fear of communications lost - that helicopter that went down, et al.; in Yersin's day it was the loss of ships to German submarines, and he kept a log of them, with the first being ""La Ville de la Ciotat."" And there was Yersin, at the very end, studying Latin and Greek.Deville's book proves to be an excellent recommendation that should be shared with friends who still seek to know what is around the next curve in the road, at any age. 5-stars, plus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ME5TQ72J6J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2757836900#wasThisHelpful","R24ME5TQ72J6J7","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There isn't anyone to replace you.""It has been almost a decade since Hurricane Katrina destroyed large portions of New Orleans while killing almost 2,000 people there and along other portions of the Gulf Coast. The emergency response of the concerned governmental agencies and leadership was famously inadequate. A large portion of the population of New Orleans was displaced, many permanently, to other cities. Kaycee Eckhardt is a native of New Orleans, was teaching in Japan when the hurricane struck, and decided to be part of the effort to restore the much needed educational services to the students (optimistically called ""scholars"") of her hometown. On her first day of work, her supervisor admonished her with the subject quote, since her two immediate predecessors had quit after very brief stints on the job. And the reader will find out why.I'm not an education ""professional."" Most of the blurbs at Amazon are from people in the field. My interest in the book (and my way there, more of which later) are more abstract. Education, like agricultural and health care policy, is an important aspect of our society. Eckhardt provides a vivid report from the proverbial ""trenches"" of ""trying to make a difference"" and this book needs to be read by far more ""generalists.""Consider her first year, trying to help revive one of the closed public schools. Students are far below grade level, and generally quite rebellious. Some die, at times by a bullet. Eckhardt's bike is trashed, her purse stolen twice, and she receives very real death threats, all of which she relates in an amazingly low-key matter-of-fact manner. A fellow teacher, in her ""stiletto heels"" is having an affair with the captain of the football team. The ""faculty room"" is described as: ""There are three sofas, 50 odd-cardboard boxes filled with brand new textbooks too expensive to distribute for use, a filthy microwave, two wheezing refrigerators and, when many of the teachers were present together, conversations so poisonous that carbon monoxide would be preferable...the spectres of administration, rules, obstacles, and children were hung like verbal piatas, and bashed, bashed, bashed...I brought cold lunches and ate them, lukewarm, from my desk drawer, preferring a possible bacteria attack to facing this frigid venom."" In the midst of all this there are the heart-breaking tales of what students face, for example, Robyn, who, at the age of 12, when Katrina hit, pushed her diabetic grandmother for help, and watched her die. At 16, she is pregnant, and decides to have the baby in her grandmother's honor, or, as she says: ""Miss, Eckhardt, you're cool and all, but we gonna see this differently.""""Sci Academy"" is a charter school (and I am so much of a generalist, I am still ""agnostic"" as to if charter schools are the ""answer."") The author signed on at the beginning, and would ultimately spend four years there, both in leadership roles and as a teacher. And she describes education policy, team building, discipline, the success of raising reading levels three grades in one year. There remain the numerous heart-breaks, like a student who was so perceptive in analyzing stories, yet would place a gun in his mouth at 16.Eckhardt gave it her all for four years, working the 70-80 hours a week, being deeply emotionally involved with her mission and her students. The adrenalin can only last so long, and she did indeed have to ""fold"" to preserve the other aspects of her life. And I kept thinking what an awful shame that the work cannot be more evenly distributed, since there are so very many (like the telemarketer who just called me) who have no meaningful work at all. The mission of the school is for each ""scholar"" to be able to go to college. The school achieved some media prominence, and even obtained a million dollar award from Oprah Winfrey. But the author is wise enough to recognize, in a society in which graduates of Ivy League schools can still wind up being ""au pairs"" that college can also be a trap, particularly in New Orleans which is a city geared to the hospitality industry that values minimum wage workers ""...a city dependent on hospitality janitors, dishwashers, short-order cooks.""In conclusion, two tales of sweet serendipity. Eckhardt describes herself as being a bit rebellious in school, and was failing French in college, when the student counselor, during the allocated 15 minutes a quarter of talk, sarcastically suggested she study Japanese instead, which is how she got to Japan. Meanwhile, I swim my laps at the local pool. When leaving one day, I noticed that one of the new lifeguards was reading The Catcher in the Rye, one of the coming-of-age books of my youth. Surely, ""kids nowadays"" didn't still read it. But in the case of Kaycee's sister, Simone, mentioned in the book as ""the Lobo,"" at least ""one kid"" still did... and she is the one who told me about the ""sandcastles"" that were / are being constructed after Katrina. And I am ever so grateful for the recommendation. 6-stars for this essential read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0O9004H6RNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSSCL0Q#wasThisHelpful","RG0O9004H6RNY","A2YXRT2XIJIO57","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YXRT2XIJIO57?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The drill driver, weighing 2 lb 13 oz, features 20 torque settings, quick drill chuck change system, 531 maximum torque, and a durable ergonomic body.Compared to the DeWalt DC720KA and Bosch DDH181, the Metabo BS18 Quick is lighter weight, and more compact.  All three drills have basically the same basic features, although max torque is lower on the Metabo.  For simple DIY jobs around the house, all three drills will get the job done.Charging the batteries on all three drills is the same process.  However the Metabo charger has an internal cooling fan which runs while charging and can be heard.  The other chargers are silent.  The Bosch battery charger recharges a battery in 30 minutes while the Metabo takes 45 minutes to reach a full charge. The Metabo batteries include a charge level status button, which are not found on the other drills batteries.As an active DYIer, the Metabo BS18 Quick is more than powerful enough to get my to-do list done.  The significantly lighter weight feels better and is less fatiguing.  If you're looking for a durable Drill Driver to complete projects around the house, the Metabo BS18 Quick is a great option to consider.PROS:Weight balanced ergonomic design531 lb torqueDurable housingLong lasting batteries with a 45 minute charge3 year warrantyCONS:Noisy charger","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I02FSLGQFYWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159N7UBY#wasThisHelpful","R3I02FSLGQFYWX","A2PSD2R9A1CXG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PSD2R9A1CXG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The iLuv Collision wireless Bluetooth portable speaker, made in China, comes with the speaker, a carabineer, and a USB to micro-USB cable.  The 1800mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to 8 hours of play time.  The speaker is water resistant, shock and dust proof, and ready for use in the great outdoors.Ive tried water resistant Bluetooth speakers in the past, and they have all have had a muffled sound to them.  The iLuv Collision wireless Bluetooth portable speaker doesnt sound like the others.  The sound is pleasing to the ear, doesnt falter at full volume, and gets quite loud for its small size.The rechargeable battery lasts for about 8 hours.  There doesnt seem to be an advanced warning when the battery is drained; I heard a tone, then the speaker shut off.  I turned the speaker on when this first happened, and the process repeated.  Then I plugged the speaker in and the battery indicator shown red and normal play was resumed.  Advanced warning is common on my other wireless speakers, and would be beneficial in the iLuv Collision too.The black rubber buttons on the top of the speaker have black raised symbols to indicate what the buttons do.  They are simple to use and are visible in well lighted areas.  In dim environments, the buttons are extremely difficult to read.  A low contrast alternate color on the raised symbols would be beneficial while maintaining the speakers minimalist appearance.This speaker was provided to me at a significant discount in exchange for an honest review, however I would gladly purchase the Collusion at regular price for use around the pool or while camping.  If youre looking for a water resistant speaker for use outdoors or in questionable environments, the iLuv Collusion wireless Bluetooth speaker is a great sounding option.PROS:Hands-free callingWater resistantShock proof8 hour battery life90 day limited warranty, 1 year partsCONS:No early battery low indicatorButtons difficult to read in low light environments","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIITMSUWBSOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124V2I1Q#wasThisHelpful","RLIITMSUWBSOP","A2PSD2R9A1CXG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PSD2R9A1CXG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I am currently training to compete in a mens physique competition.  Lighter dessert recipes for the occasional cheat or when bulking is a benefit.  I would prefer some high protein options.  Additionally, I try to stick to natural ingredients.  Cool Whip is a common ingredient, I dont eat this fake food and find the thought of eating it revolting.  However Deb makes a solid case for her use in The Basics chapter.  Whipped cream is high calorie and Cool Whip is a low calorie replacement that make low calorie alternatives possible.There are several recipes I want to try and adapt for my current diet.  I am allowed to have a dessert each night as my final meal.  Ive eaten lots of Greek yogurt and berries over the last 18 months.  Ive been told I can have high protein pudding, so Im going to try adapting the rice pudding and panna cotta recipes and see if they work using my protein powder as an ingredient if my coach approves of the recipe.If youre looking to reduce caloric intake and dont want to give up on desserts entirely, Deb Wises Incredibly Decadent Desserts will help bridge your dietary goals with your desires.

"The Kody double dish, made in China, is made of two nesting melamine bowls.  The top oval shaped bowl measures 4.75 x 6 inches, 1.25 inches deep, and hold about 10 ounces of water.  The bottom bowl holds about 16 ounces and is about 1.5 inches deep with sides raised another 1.25 inches.  The bowls can be used separately, or nested.When nested, the top bowl can hold cherries, nuts, or something of the sort where there is waste from eating.  The uneaten items go in the top bowl, while the pits, stems, or shells are discarded in the bottom.The Kody double bowl set is kinda a novelty.  Its really too small for a party, and would work for two to three people while watching TV.  The bowls are not meant for use in the microwave either, although the type of foods this set is meant for dont usually get microwaved.  For the bowls purpose, it works well.If you enjoy snacking on cherries or pistachios, The Kody double bowl will keep the waste contained.

"The Stacy Adams Men's cognac Stratford slip-on loafer is a reddish brown color with a buckle strap on top.  The shoe is made in China with leather uppers and manmade materials.  The soles do not have any grip, except for the back half of the heel, and the interior bottom has memory foam cushioning.When I opened the box, I noticed the loafers had a strong chemical scent.  I dismissed the odor for being new shoes, and immediately tried them on.  I have a long somewhat narrow foot, so finding a good fitting pair of dress shoes can difficult.  These loafers fit my foot length wise, but feel too big since they are a little wider than I need.  The buckled strap doesnt adjust to tighten the fit either, the only option is to loosen the strap by one hole.  The sizing issue is workable though, I just wear thicker cotton dress socks to help fill the space.  However, I would prefer a better fitting narrow version.I decided to wear the loafers to work the next day.  They were comfortable, I had no problems remaining upright, and I even received a few compliments.  I kept thinking I smelt gas while sitting in my cube, as did a few of my coworkers in surrounding cubes.  They were commenting on the odor, and postulated the buildings heaters were probably started up for the first time.  Later when I got into my car to drive home, I drove a few blocks before the scent of gas hit me.  Thats when I realized the scent was coming from the loafers.  The scent has dissipated over several days, but the loafers still have an odor.If youre looking for a good looking pair of shoes, the Stacy Adams Men's cognac Stratford slip-on loafer may be a good option to consider.  However the scent is overwhelming and may be a deal breaker.  The scent does dissipate in time, and may be worth the hassle of defuming before wearing.  If it werent for the odor, I would gladly consider purchasing these loafers for myself.PROS:Looks sharpCONS:Obnoxious scentNo grip on soles","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPM0YZF4X9ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BKQ63Y#wasThisHelpful","R1JPM0YZF4X9ZF","A2PSD2R9A1CXG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PSD2R9A1CXG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Cakes Athirst Hilarity unauthorized Cards Against Humanity expansion packs, printed in China on premium casino-quality linen cards.  Each of the four expansion packs contains 80 white cards and 30 black cards.  Each card has Cakes Athirst Hilarity printed on one side, and a question or answer plus a yellow volume indicator on the other.The deck packaging indicates not to purchase the expansion pack without first obtaining the original Cards Against Humanity game.  The only necessary part of the original game is understanding game play.  Being an expansion pack, there isnt any instructions.  Otherwise the original game isnt really necessary.  Id still suggest having the original game, as there simply isnt enough cards in an expansion pack for a fun game.The Cakes Athirst Hilarity cards are printed on better quality stock than the original deck.  The original cards are basic paper cards, while Cakes Athirst Hilarity cards are linen which should last longer.  The fonts on both cards are similar, although the Cakes Athirst Hilarity cards use a smaller font size.  Plus both sets use a crass sense of humor, although the Cakes Athirst Hilarity cards seem edgier, more current, and just as disturbingly fun.Cards Against Humanity expansion packs are a necessity to keeping the game fresh.

"The E-PRANCE Heavy Duty Stainless-Steel Manual Lemon/Lime Juicer weighs 14.4 ounces or 405 grams and has a 2 3/4 inch diameter bowl.  Stainless steel makes the juicer heavier than aluminum versions, however will not corrode and is dishwasher safe.To use, I roll lemons on the counter under my palm to loosen the juices, then cut them in half.  Once cut the lemon is placed with the cut end facing into the bowl.  Pressing the lemon required using both hands until the hollow handles got close enough for one handed squeezing.  The process may sound difficult, however it was quite simple to accomplish.  Once squeezed, I opened the squeezer, removed the lemon half, and repeated the process for the other half.I previously reviewed a similar silicon handled lemon juicer.  This other juicer has a larger bowl, the pieces dont wiggle from side to side.  The E-Prance lemon juicer doesnt have silicon handle covers, a smaller bowl, and the pieces have more side to side movement.  These differences dont affect performance, both lemon juicers are effective.I received this juicer in exchange for an honest review.  If I were in the market for a hand juicer, I would purchase the silicon handled lemon juicer since the current prices are similar.  However if there were a pricing incentive, I would have no problem purchasing E-Prances lemon juicer.  If youre looking for a quality stainless steel lemon/lime squeezer, look for the best value.  If it turns out to be the E-Prance lemon juicer, you will be making a good purchase.PROS:Simple to operateMade from 316 stainless steelEasy to cleanCONS:Some side to side movement","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZF2IIVCSXKZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S5SWY2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZF2IIVCSXKZB","A2PSD2R9A1CXG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PSD2R9A1CXG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The WINOMO wall mounted broom/mop rack with four positions and five hooks, made in China, hangs on the wall using the two provided anchored screws.  Once hung, cleaning tools such as mops and brooms can be stored using the quick grip position or a hook.There are basic mounting instructions on the box; however they dont indicate what size drill bit to use for the pilot hole.  I apparently went too big, as the anchor fell behind the wall as I was attempting to the rack into place.  I went to the local home improvement store and bought a $1.69 bag of flanged pop-toggle anchors with screws to use instead.  This style of anchor worked with the supplied flathead screws, is far more forgiving without adding significant expense, and should be supplied.Once the wall mounted broom/mop rack was installed, I began organizing hanging our floor cleaning tools.  Each item went into place easily; however it felt somewhat like completing a puzzle.  The positions and hooks can slide a bit, but cannot be reconfigured.  I have a Gladiator wall system in the garage which can be configured as needed, although the WINOMO wall mounted broom/mop rack is more economically priced.Even though I received the WINOMO wall mounted broom/mop rack in exchange for an honest review, I would gladly purchase one.

"Ive been taking the premium tribulus terrestris dietary supplement, made in the USA by Peak Performance Nutrition, on and off for a couple months.  This product, provided in exchange for an honest review, is designed to promote testosterone production, plus boost libido and stamina.While I recommend consistency with nutritional products, my inconsistent use has helped me to see the difference between taking this supplement and not.  I take one 1000mg capsule a day with 10 oz. water while eating breakfast.  I dont notice any immediate effect from taking the capsule.It would be easy to question whether this product does anything at all.  I cant really tell if my testosterone production has increased, and as an active person Im not even sure I get a stamina or libido boost.  However, when I take the premium tribulus terrestris supplement, I consistently wake with a raging firm stiffy.

"The Aroma AWK-165DI glass and stainless digital kettle with tea infuser, made in China, comes with the glass kettle, stainless steel tea infuser, corded base, and instruction manual.

The base includes a 30 inch cord which can be wrapped up underneath to eliminate excess.  An easily removable water filter rests at the inside of the drip free spout.The stainless steel tea infuser is a 5 inch tall thin walled fine meshed container.  Once the water is of the correct temperature, press the lid button to open, slip the filled tea infuser into place, and let steep for the recommended amount of time.  With water at the maximum level, only a couple inches of the tea infuser is submerged; plan on making a kettle of tea and not one or two cups.The warming feature brings cold water up to the desired temperature ranging from 105 and increasing in 10 degree intervals up to 195.  We occasionally purchase loose tea from Teavana, where recommended temperatures and times are provided.  Rooibos, mate, and herbal teas require 5-6 minutes at 208, a temperature without a setting.  The best one can do is boil and add the tea once the temp drops enough.  The kettle isnt insulated, so the temp may drop over the required steeping time.  The remaining teas are either at 175 or 195 degrees, which works with the kettles temperature settings.I have used water kettles for years, as they are a convenient way to have boiled water for tea, oatmeal, or anything else.

"The Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous adventure card game base set can be played by 1-4 players over 13.  Character card sets may be added for 5-6 player games.  Everything needed is provided in the base set, plus the first adventure deck is included.  Although, accessories such as the adventure mat, character mats, card sleeves, and the pro dual deck box can be purchased.The base set includes dice, cards, organizer, instructions, and tokens, plus the first of six adventure decks.  The cards and tokens are of good quality and the organizer effectively organized and assists game play.  The organizer even includes a storage location for developed characters to keep everything ready for the next game night.  All in all, the base set is well thought out.The box indicates a game can be played in about 90 minutes.  Perhaps a group of individuals familiar with the game can do so, but that wasnt our experience.  Four of us, one familiar with Pathfinder games, sat at the table and started preparing the board.  This involved answering questions, shuffling decks, arranging cards on the table, choosing characters, etc.  90 minutes later, we were ready to start playing.After choosing who went first, we began game play.  Our board included six locations which we closed one by one.  Ive played D&D, this game has a similar approach, players develop their characters, assist others in their team, and progress on a journey.  Although a good dungeon master can weave an interesting story into game play.  With this card game, play seemed more mechanical and less story bound.  I can see where the game would be more fun once one knew the intricacies of game play though. After playing for a couple hours, I felt like this game was just dragging on.  Our first game lasted for 3.5 hours.The character cards are basically a single use item.  There are boxes to check when attributes improve.  Once checked, these cards are no longer useful for the next player.  Using a sleeve makes sense so the character cards can be used multiple times.I can see the appeal to the Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous adventure card game.  Our experience is based on inexperienced players.  Im certain experienced players can get through adventures with more efficiency and better understanding.  Everything is provided to get the first game started, and five additional adventure deck can be purchased to expand the campaign.Experienced Pathfinder adventure card game players will likely enjoy the Wrath of the Righteous base set.  New players will experience a steep learning curve unless they can find experienced players to interact with.  Otherwise expect to spend time learning game play and referring to the instructions often.

Stopping the generator is much simpler and only requires pressing the stop switch.While the generator can be used for recreational or worksite purposes, we have occasional power outages. Between the low runtime and wattage, Im not sure how advantageous using the generator would be for use on the comforts of home. It seems like this lighter weight portable generator is more ideal for recreational use. Although, I can swap out powered items as needed to prevent overloading instead of having everything connected at once.If I were to purchase a portable power generator, I would consider one of the higher powered units. However, the PowerStroke 1100-watt PS901200D gas-powered portable generator is easy to maintain and use. If youre looking for a portable generator, the PowerStroke is a good option, just consider how much power you need.PROS:Up to an 8 hour runtimeLow oil shut down2 year limited warrantyCONS:Short run-time","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMV12Q4YRJ8DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQCMHKI#wasThisHelpful","RMV12Q4YRJ8DJ","A2PSD2R9A1CXG7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PSD2R9A1CXG7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Parasheet beach / picnic blanket by Gecko Active is a large lightweight blanket meant to shade or spread out on the ground.  Each corner of the 7 by 6.5 foot blanket has a sand pocket and a tie-off loop.  The loops can be used to hang the blanket as a sun shade or to stake down to the ground.The 362 g / 12.75 ounce blanket, which includes a belt clip and locking drawstring closure, folds into a 6 x 9 inch bag made from the same material.  The compact bag is great for storage and packing into a day pack or picnic basket.  The blankets compact and light weight features is the result of using the thin parasheet material.  Dont expect any level of padding, although padding wouldnt necessarily be needed on the grass or a sandy beach.While I received this Parasheet beach / picnic blanket by Gecko Active in exchange for an honest review, I would be willing to purchase one for my own personal use.

The package contains the Vtin Dew Bluetooth 4.0 wireless stereo headphones, a 32 inch USB charging cable, 6 ear cups, and 6 ear hooks, with the medium cups and hooks pre-installed.  Charging takes about 2 hours and provides about 185 hours stand by or 4-5 hours use.The sport earbuds required charging and pairing before use.  The audio is clear and pleasing to the ears, whether listening to music or talking on the phone.  It's been reported back to me that those I am conversing with can hear me clearly as well.The only issue I've had is with the ear hooks.  I have a rook piercing in my left ear which caused interference.  I swapped the medium ear hooks for the smaller ones.  The smaller ear hooks feel a little small, however they keep the headphones in my ears without discomfort.The design works well for working in the yard, going to the gym, or heading out for a run.  These headphones were provided to me in exchange for an honest review.  They have become my go to headphones and I would purchase them if I needed a new pair.

"The Foxnovo FP10 10400mAh lithium polymer dual-port power bank charger, made in China, comes with the power bank, storage pouch, a multi-connector USB cord, and documentation.  The multi-connector USB cord can be used to charge the power bank, or to charge apple and android devices.  The port end of the 8.6 ounce or 245 gram power bank includes a 5V/2.1A USB output port, 5V/1.0A USB output port, micro USB input port, a power button, and 4 LED charge level indicators.The weight of the power bank is expected for the amount of power it provides.  Occasionally I use power banks on hiking trips.  While only weighing 8.6 ounces on its own, it feels heavy for use on a hike with a pack full of gear.  I would probably opt for one of my less powerful lighter options for such a trip.When the extra power is the priority, this is my go to power bank.  Not only can I charge my device multiple times, I can charge a couple devices simultaneously.

"*NOBODY* currently makes 256GB micro-SD cards. Even if they did, they would be SDXC cards, not SDHC. The SDHC card standard is valid up to a max capacity of 32GB. And even if it were SDXC, the price would be well over $100.  FOr under $25 you are guaranteed a fake.You risk losing some or all of your valuable data If you buy this card. Read on...Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as ""SDHC"" (not ""SDXC"").

Good cards are out there, but anything 64GB and up will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q4 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards.

This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient.You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

"There are precisely two genuine 512GB USB flash drives on the market - the Corsair Flash Voyager GS and the Kingston HyperX Predator.This drive is neither. It is a hacked drive that will destroy your data.They come in a wide variety of styles - brand-name look-alikes (like this one), plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty drives. They advertise huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What else do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals *AND* they all have fake capacity.Read on...Beware fake capacity flash drives.

They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data unusable when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.Only a few manufacturers such as Kingston and Corsair make legitimate 512GB drives and those cost several hundred dollars (as of Q4 2015). The lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 512GB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.

If you look inside, they have the same internals and (at these prices) they all have fake capacity.You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive.Beware of fake capacity flash drives. This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties will work normally under low usage.  However, once their true capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your documents, photos, videos and music will be irretrievably lost.Good 128GB drives are out there, mostly brand name drives plus a few generics, but their cost is about $35 and up (as of Q4 2015). The lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars. The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips.Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is less than $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is less than $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.Search for ""fake capacity flash"" using your favorite search engine for more information.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCXDHYC2FWZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WB1VI6#wasThisHelpful","RZCXDHYC2FWZO","A2UBD4V6AMH6MO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UBD4V6AMH6MO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity.

First, it has no yucky fragrance like some do that irritate your senses and collide with your fragrance.The keratin is for smoothing and repair and it seems to do that. My hair had bad split ends (still does, I'm sure) but this has a soft feel that seems like the ratty edges are smoothed down. Feels full too, with volume.I like buying in pairs so they're always handy, and I like this brand, having used it before.There's not a ton of lather, which is fine for me.

"When I first got this, I wasn't sure how to use it.  I didn't have any suspicious nannies to keep an eye on, and my pets are not that entertaining. I didn't want to use it outside as it is far too nice and I didn't want to risk the elements getting to it even if I had it in a covered place (I thought fog might be too dangerous).But I find the genius idea:  since my house is going up for sale, and lots of people will be going through my house on open house days or caravans.  There's been numerous thefts in the area when these events happen. So I set this up in the large room in my house where the only things of value are (I hid the most important things before the Open House days).  I set it up to be able to watch later what people were looking at and saying about my house. It was an amazing idea. The realtor didn't like it but I made it subtle. I figured, it's my house so I can film if I want.Nothing was stolen and it was interesting to hear what people were saying: they liked my windows and blinds and exterior, and hated my fireplace!  Good to know.  And would be great if someone were prowling around when the realtor was out of the room.I can't seem to get the video uploaded from my computer but I assure you it was crisp and clear and within forty feet it was flawless, you could practically read a book.I rec'd a sample for comment and feedback from manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0NHWNN0X86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145OQTPG#wasThisHelpful","R1S0NHWNN0X86","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On my patio I have some wood strips that go across to a pergola style beam.  I used two sets of these to criss cross across the side strips so that it made a starry ceiling like effect on my patio.  With chairs underneath and a glass of wine, it looked elegant, like I needed to have a party. I can see if I buy more of these I will be able to add more lines to fill in and that will look even better.The way to get the most length out of these is straight pieces and not wrapping around too much or you lose length.  This method made me get quite a bit of starry lights for overhead.  I was thinking of doing the same on a handrail that we have outside in the yard that has no exterior lights.

"I've been obsessed with fairy lights now!  I've used them indoors and around trees and shrubs.This set I used differently. I have a big eave on the front of my older house and my house doesn't have many outdoor lights. So I used this (VERY CAREFULLY) with a staple gun to run the length of the eave.  Then I tucked the solar panel on the side of the eave that doesn't show from the street.  I put them way up where the eave meets the wall.Now for curb appeal, when you drive up, you don't see the lights, you just see a lovely glow, like strip lighting, under the eave. You don't see until you are right under the eave. This makes my house look like something in a magazine or a fancy new home: from the street the glow is substantial and isn't enough to keep you up at night but makes the front look glowing. You don't see the individual colors on this application.  If you look at home magazines, many have this style.  Driving up to my house at night, with the lights around a big tree and on the garage, as well as wrapped around a big ceanosis bush, it looks very elegant.This is a way to get that look that is cheaper than strip lighting, no wiring, and easy to do.  Removable too. I just HIGHLY suggest to be careful with the staple gun so it doesn't pierce the wires.I rec'd a sample for feedback and comment from manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WE3Z3BU23FI5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0135O1FLU#wasThisHelpful","R2WE3Z3BU23FI5","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Super cute dragonflies that didn't get to fly outside!  Why?  I got creative. My son has a room inspired by bug decor of all sorts.  I saw these and wanted to figure out a way to incorporate them.  First problem: they are solar.  Then I realized, that's great, no worry of him getting shocked!So I took a big glass bottle (sort of like a huge Mason jar) and wrapped these inside (like a bug collector jar).  Then I put it on a very high bookcase in his room. It was a piece of cake to open the screen just a bit and wind the LED solar panel outside and on to the sunny facing roof. You could hardly see the cord going outside the window. I then closed the window gently.The result?  At night he has a nightlight up high that goes with his bug decor, shuts itself off, and is unlike any other nightlight you can imagine.  It really does look like a bug collector jar, so next to it I put a little picture of a magnifying glass and a stuffed dragonfly plush he had.  Looks super cute. I hope it shows in the photos well.He loves it, and also how the lights reflect up to the ceiling.  I'm going to try and put it on Pinterest.I rec'd a sample set to try for comment and feedback to manufacturer.  Be sure to think outside the box this year because these lights are versatile ALL the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZRDG39MDSGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013FHAOC8#wasThisHelpful","R3VZRDG39MDSGU","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure if other places have this, but in CA people are using these sorts of lights year-round. Mostly in the yard wrapped around trees and shrubs. Especially restaurants and stores.I have rec'd some of these to try and I adore them.  I have first started with wrapping one set around an old oak tree, It was easy to do as they are wrapped well to unwind (some other brands come in a tangled box!).  I just rolled around each limb and up to the leaf line. I used two on one big tree, and made sure the solar panels (little flowers) were visible in bright light (I tucked them on top of a rock beneath the tree and secured with rubber bands.That night, after a full day of light, it was gorgeous. Not so much Xmas light style but just a glow that went up into the top of the tree and looked fantastic.  I like that it's not electricity and I don't have to remember to turn them off!I rec'd a sample from manufacturer for comment and review. Huge like.

"I had completely given up on screen doors.  Let me tell you why.We live in CA with Santa Ana winds that come and basically feel like tornados...they are hot winds that come on at night. With metal screen doors like we previously had, we'd find them twisted and bent in the morning.  You could tell when the winds were coming but not much to do about it unless you wanted to completely uninstall a screen door, which is a nightmare.Next, we had little kids with our last metal screen door.  Literally ten minutes after installing it, my husband stood back proudly (having spent most of the day working on it, leveling it, etc) and our 5 year old rode down a hill and right into the door, dinging it inwards and forever ruining it. Sad face daddy.When you use installed metal screen doors you have to screw into all your trim boards around the door.  So when those doors are gone, you may find your trim is full of holes that need patching. A series of doors over the years have left my front door trim look like an agitated giant woodpecker went nuts.  So I had to putty them all and paint and you can still tell something was bolted in.So we gave up. Forget it, keep the doors shut, even when there's a breeze.Until I was offered a chance to sample this.  Wow.  First big deal: installing it involves NO bolts or hardware that will tear up your wood trim around the door. Second big deal: Easy to remove if you have big winds coming.  Third big deal: It shuts itself, even after my dog runs in. There's more than 20 magnets that just instantly connect. The flies don't have a chance to come in.  They are in awe.Also, if you are a renter, you won't be tearing up the door area or trim.It's very sturdy and installed with thumb tacks and velcro.  Not a security door, but if your kids are going in and out all day and leaving the door open, then it's perfect.  It's black so it goes with any decor.  It comes in other colors but for me, this was perfect. It comes with everything.It's also so nice to have a cross breeze coming in.....our CA summer has really made this an ideal benefit.I rec'd a sample at no charge. Will buy more, including one for the garage, since it gets so stuffy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFO5F950LW35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU38738#wasThisHelpful","R2BFO5F950LW35","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this entire product line I think. I love STX for so many reasons.  Here we go!1. The silky poly and mesh pieces (shorts here) are super soft and loose, so that my son with sensitive skin is comfy in them.  He can barely wear jeans because of the contact friction.  These are long and loose and great for sports, but also every day.  In fact, he's taken to sleeping in his favorite pair.  I guess when your skin doensn't hurt, it matters even to a kid.2. These wash really well and dry fast.3. The elastic waist is folded wide and strong with various seams so that it stays put and will not come undone after several uses.4. The colors in their product line all coordinate: limes, yellows, oranges, etc.  It makes it easy for him to dress.5.  The price is very reasonable compared to other athletic brands like UnderArmour for kids and Nike and Adidas.  I believe it's the same mesh/poly but the price is right. You can often get a shirt/short combo for less than one piece of a higher end brand.Very pleased, and highly recommend","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q77IZLYYJEHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YD7HMP2#wasThisHelpful","R3Q77IZLYYJEHF","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been trying this with a whole bunch of curiosity.  All of us in the family have been sick and one of things we were told was that probiotics help immunity. Since three of us have been hospitalized with pneumonia, I'm going over anything that can help with immunity.These are a simple gel that even my young son can take.  The first thing I looked for was if it would upset my stomach as Activia and other probiotics have done.  I realize it is meant to work on the ""digestive"" areas and that some upset and unpleasant occurences may happen upon initial use. But so far, taking two per day, at different times (total of 2), I haven't been sick in any way.Another big criteria for me with any supplements or vitamins is if they have an aftertaste, make me burp, or make me nauseated. That happens with many.  So far, not with this.I will update this review if I find in four weeks that we're doing better.

"I have a bunch of STX products and like them all (except the cotton shirts). This is a poly spun ""performance"" shirt which means it is softer and lighter, more for an athlete as it dries fast and allows a wide range of motion with larger arm holes.The color combo is great and it fits perfect. My son has skin sensitivity issues and this feels good on his skin. I used to do all cotton for him but some cotton, cheaply spun cotton, often agitates his skin to the point of a rash.  For example, he can never wear madras or twill and even a polo shirt at times (that kind of interweave) feels terrible to him and leaves a rash.These are loose and super soft. I wish they made these in Mom sizes.  I've heard that they tend to hold BO in when you wash them, but he's not at the BO stage yet so no worries.From here on out, it's this type of fabric for him.  If you're not familiar, it feels like a swim rash guard fabric with a lighter fabric and less slickness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RULH6YDOPWBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDKZELS#wasThisHelpful","R1RULH6YDOPWBC","A2LAS014NSRW72","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LAS014NSRW72?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous. Beyond gorgeous.  The ultimate coffee table book, except that this should be looked at and coffee table books usually just gather dust and coffee cup rings.It's an oversized hardback and it's split into different continents with the natural wonders of each.  No text, other than the location, which is great.  Some are landforms, others are animals, and some are weather phenomenon.  All are stunning.I have a young son and we don't travel like we did 20 years ago before he came along. Much of these pictures reveal a world he'll likely never get to go see.  I love for him to see how gorgeous the earth is, so he'll want to care for it.  The fact that you don't see people makes the images magical (people screw things up so much!).After this, Slovenia is on my list of places to go, at spot #1.  The rivers are too beautiful.

"This is an item I'd expect to see on Shark Tank. It's so simple, but so cool. Sunflower seeds are my weakness, but it looks pretty gross eating them and putting the shells on a napkin (or worse, spitting them!).  If I'm curled up with a book and seeds, I can lose all track of time and end up with a mess.So I saw this and first was, ""HUH?"" because I really didn't understand how it works. I thought it was a deformed chip and dip dish.  Once I saw a picture though of the pistachios in it with shells being put underneath, I thought it was awesome.  My first reaction was SEEDS followed by how great this would be when we play cards.  Everyone likes nuts when we play poker and cards but it's a messy table to do all that. If you buy one for each person, they get their serving and their trash can, all in one.  Of course, you can separate them too if you wish, but there's no need.Versatile too though, if you need dishes for another reason.  My son made miso soup and used this to drink the soup out of it, leaving the lid container off.I got the green one, and it's very cool. I plan to get one for each in our card club.

Except for fit people, I mean.I'm using it in the most ordinary way possible, hooked on to my backpack.  I can use it and leave my phone in my pack and have this playing music right from the carabiner clip attachment.  I am confident it'll handle rain, but I live in CA so that's not really a big risk.  And I'm not willing to throw it around to test it because it just looks great and I don't want it dinged up. I'm confident it would survive, as I've used other Soaiy products before.

"So I had this a few days but hadn't had the opportunity to test it out. My son wanted it for his bicycling but I actually wanted a flashlight by my bed for winter.  There's never one when you need it!Last night, my neighbor's teenage kitten got outside in the dark. It was FREEZING cold and the kitten was acting very teenager-ish, she did not want to come in the house.  She was apparently looking for a party.  So I took this out and tried everything but she'd scamper out of sight whenever she could. Finally I played with the adjustments on the front, the way you can narrow it and widen the light.  This interested her enough to come closer. My husband threw tiny rocks into the bushes while I put the light on them and she heard the noise and was eager to either meet a big mouse or Mr. Tomcat because she headed right for the light and noise. And then ran away.So then we tried the strobe effect. This too caught her attention, and I basically used it to walk her closer to the front door where she finally sat down and decided she was cold and wanted in RIGHT THAT SECOND.  She's a brat. Good thing she's cute.Anyway, it comes with a rechargeable battery so you can use it immediately. Has the bike clamp and adapter to recharge in the wall.  The whole kit is ready to go.

"This is something I've wanted for a long time.  I've had trucks spill gravel out and break my windshield TWICE in less than six months.  So I was eager to try this out.  Now, I'm not a tech savvy person, so I needed my sons to help me get it hooked up.  All you need is a SD card, it comes with everything else.  They had it up and going and testing it in fifteen minutes.The suction cup is really secure and doesn't vibrate like you'd think so you get an even picture.  The size of your SD card matters, so go big if you can.  I like that each image is date stamped so the next truck that does it, I will have their license plate AND the time so I can get my windshield replaced free.It's also very small, which makes it nice if you see something weird. I have crazy neighbors and one day they were up to something (I could see from far back on the road) by the side of the road. I leaned over and just tilted it a bit to view a bit more to the right. As I got closer, they weren't doing anything, but I did get a nice vision of all of them flipping me off.  I'm sure they didn't know the camera was there (and I'm a nice person!).You notice more on playback when you hook it to your laptop (see picture 2), and you see more details.  With anything, I think the detail would be helpful. These are required in Europe, it's about time for us.

"We are homeschoolers and having clipboards around is SO helpful for taking notes outside, in the car, on field trips, or even in front of the TV. I buy the longer legal size because I can write instructions below where the bottom of the paper would end. For example, on one I put Capitalize and Punctuate with a sharpie underneath, just as a reminder because those get forgotten.I also find that younger kids, when writing, have a hard time holding down a page with one hand so it doesn't move and then writing with the other hand. This simplifies it a bit, holding the paper still so they can focus on writing.I also use household twine and tie a pencil to the loop on top with about 24"" of length so that there's always a pencil handy.

"I have a Big Dog Comfortmax Treestand.  I wanted a safe and secure harness.  The harness is comfortable and the different points are easy to adjust in size (chest, shoulders, waist, legs).  This accommodates for ammunition.  There is a pouch that allows the user to rest his or her legs if suspended.  The back pouch allows tangle free storage of the harness.Attaching the harness to the tree is very easy and secure, and it can be done quickly.

"I have a dark brown oiled Latigo Orion leather belt.  Because I liked the other so much, I purchased a second model in black.  For a different look, I decided to get the double strap version.Background:  You would think that belts by big name brands such as Polo, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Alexander Julian, or such would be good.  They're usually not.  I have owned belts by more ""rugged"" makers such as Columbia and others, too. This, being my second belt, makes the best brand and make of belts I've ever owned.  I will no longer settle for anything less.This belt design conforms to the variety of aftermarket belt buckles that you will see in Country and Western Apparel stores.  This is the reason I like these belts.  I have a few buckles that I like to interchange based upon the occasion.  Interchanging buckles is an advantage for variety and not having to purchase many different belts.  It is the Lego equivalent of belts.What I am amazed by is the thickness and weight of this belt.  It's a heavyweight belt that rivals belts designed for carrying holsters.  The color is natural and the tanning is high quality.  I also liked the high gloss buckle, though I replaced it with my own Cowboy buckle.Unsnapping the snaps for replacing the buckle takes effort, which is a good thing. It is secure in its mechanism.This is a solid and well constructed belt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQ3H3HZ15P1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PUEO3C#wasThisHelpful","R3MQ3H3HZ15P1T","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful, yet simple, designed charm comprised of an interlaced, symmetric weave pattern, framed by circular ring.  The front part of the charm is convex and the back is concave in design.  The charm is supported by a thick teardrop shaped attachment that keeps the charm from rotating backwards or tangling up the chain.The chain, although delicate, is well made.  The clasp is easy to open and close, and it is quite secure.The material of the charm and chain are rhodium plated upon sterling silver. It has a shine that gleans well in light, and to my eye, brighter than my white gold wedding band.  Rhodium is a precious metal more expensive than gold which gives a bright shine.  However, because Rhodium is sensitive to abrasion, it should not be polished with silver or gold polish or an abrasive polishing cloth.  A microfiber cloth is all that is needed.  I have been told by a local jeweler that the finish will last 7-10 years with proper care.Overall, it is a simple design that will give the user many years of service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FR8B1YEV0R3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ86TO#wasThisHelpful","R2FR8B1YEV0R3E","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a gift pack with full sized varieties of pancake batter, sample sized bottles of fruit preserves and two sample sized bottles of honey.The batter is a high quality product.  Pancakes are light and fluffy, and the different flavors capture the nuance of each respective flavor.The honey was not as fragrant/aromatic as other maple syrup that I have tried.  Taste was good but not as robust as I'm accustomed to experiencing.  It is also with a more watery consistency.The preserves were excellent.  You can see the chunks of fruit and they're all very tasty.  I tried them on the pancakes without and with syrup.  Definitely a high quality product.As a gift, this would make a great idea.

"I love Popcorn from the movie theater.  A popcorn popper like those in the theater take up a lot of space.  They're also a lot more effort to clean up.  The airpoppers work fairly well but the taste is not quite the same.  The butter doesn't always uniformly coat the popcorn.I read the reviews and compared the designs of the different stove top popcorn poppers on the market.  This is one of the simplest designs of popcorn poppers on the market. First of all, this is a 5.5 quart stainless steel pot.  It is a high quality pot.  The lid is a clear glass lid with small peripheral gas openings, and there is a 4 centimeter port with an unfitted silicone cover which allows the user to pour melted butter, caramel or other desired toppings.OperationI use a gas stove top on medium to high heat.  It heats the oil and when it begins to boil, the kernels will begin to pop.  In a matter of a less than 30 seconds, the entire 1/3 cup of kernels will pop and the popcorn expands. As the size of the quantity of popcorn gets bigger it gets harder to turn the crank one handed.  I had to stabilize the pot by gripping the handle, turning the crank and listened for the popping to stop.After lifting the lid off, you simply pour the contents into a serving bowl.  Only 4-5 kernels went unpopped.Cleanup is a breeze.  The entire setup is dishwasher safe.Overall, it is a high quality product without too much effort to operate, assemble or clean.This gets two thumbs up for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWAKUOIK36WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PFRRA0Q#wasThisHelpful","R2MWAKUOIK36WN","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What comes in the box?Premium carrying caseSmart cord with mute functionDetectorSticky cup and mounting bracketThere is an Escort Smartcord Live that allows Bluetooth connectivity between the phone and the detector.  As of this writing, the street price is $94.23 through Amazon Prime.  This allows connectivity with the Escort Live App.  The app costs $5 per month or $50 per year.  Since my commute is only 15 minutes one way, it is not worth the investment.  I checked out the app, and I found a lot of nice features such as the speedometer and direction.The menu is easy to navigate and the added bonus of the mute button on the Smart Cord makes operation very simple.  The recessed screen in the housing minimizes glare and washout of the display.  The sticky cup is much easier to mount than other suction cup mounts, though I prefer a dash mount over window mounts.Use.I was impressed with the city function. I didn't have quite as many false alerts as in my older models of radar detectors.  A nice feature is that it learns false alarms, also.  Monitor colors can be customized to the user's liking.ConstructionA plus and minus is the size.  It is bigger and longer than the Escort counterpart.

"I have used many radar detectors ever since I started driving many, many years ago.  One of the biggest gripes I have is with false positives which put most users on edge.  Additionally, I have found many radar detectors to be blocky and too heavy for mounting on a window.  On a hot and humid day, the suction cups have almost always been less than adequate for me.  There are a few things about this model that have made life a lot easier.What comes in the box?Premium zippered caseMini USB DC adapterRadar detectorVelcro mountsWindow mount (Velcro)Window mount (suction cup)What you will also need?Smartphone with Bluetooth capability (I have an iPhone 5)FeaturesScreens for X, K, Ka and laser speed detectionAlerts for red light and speed camerasCobra iRadar app (must be downloaded) giving additional capabilities over the unit-SpeedMute : Mute alerts when traveling below a selected speed-AutoCity: Detects city or highway based upon GPS data and speed-AutoMute: reduces alert volume after 4 seconds-Voice or Tone Mode-QuietDrive: Mutes audible feedback-Phone Mode: allows alerts to be transmitted to phone or your Bluetooth output-iRadar Community: Network of users who have confirmed legitimate threats in the area.The App is easy to navigate. The menu system is intuitive.  When connected, the display on the detector will indicate direction and speed.  There are additional functions that the application allows that are not accessible through the detector itself.Alerts are given in color codes based upon threat level and the type of threat detected. It does not, however, indicate direction of the threat, unlike the Valentine One.  There are three types of visual alerts: 1) Signal strength (1-5 based upon signal), 2) Frequency Display (indicates type of radar and specific frequency), and 3) Frequency advanced (height of bar indicates likelihood of threat). All Laser threats are deemed to be positive, in general.In my experience I have noticed intermittent episodes of a low lit indicators, followed by a nondetected alert, followed by a gradual crescendo in terms of a true positive.  With false alerts on the highways, it is infrequent that I have experienced that phenomenon.  The regions I have driven have not used a Laser.  I have also not been in an area where aircraft have facilitated speed detection, either.  It has almost invariably been with State Troopers for the majority of our violators in the region.Given the smaller size, I have found it much easier to just remove and pocket the detector in a small camera case.  Because I have chosen the option of a top of the dashboard mount, it has not been a target for thieves scoping out what to steal, unlike other window mounted devices (e.g. GPS, radar detectors).  The Velcro has been more stable for me, and it is more inconspicuous than window mounting.I love the premium case but wish there were a smaller carrying case just for the detector.  Even a drawstring bag would be good just to prevent scratches and dust.The Unit, itself, is quite compact. It is about the size of my palm. The front has the display screen, and the rear has the detector window. On the back righthand side of the case is the Mini USB port.  The top reveals the speaker and the control buttons.  The mute button is luckily at the front center of the detector which is the most important button, apart from the Report/Menu button. The report button uploads the data to the network to confirm threats. It is the most import duty that you have to make the iRadar Community work.  The Dim and City buttons work for stepping through the menu systems. The City button toggles between city and highway.  The power button serves as the volume, also.Overall, with the integration of the iRadar community, this is a hard system to beat.  Taking into account the smaller size, yet effective internal algorithms, it is an excellent system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R379R5941M2GCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B6EJQS#wasThisHelpful","R379R5941M2GCZ","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What attracted me to this particular stand was the seat.  I have a similar design for some patio chairs, and I knew how comfortable these seats would be.  I like the shooting rest which moves up and down, helping with stability.  The foot rest is an added feature (which folds out of the way), that helps with comfort, too.  The footing is wide and deep which helps with stability.  The ladder is fairly wide and it feels stable once it is secured.  It's best to have the foot rest retracted with egress and entry to prevent yourself from falling 18 feet.The finish is just acceptable.  There are parts that are chipped off from transit and they didn't package it very well.  It doesn't affect function but that is attention to detail that is a turn off.  However, in the scheme of all things, it doesn't matter.Putting this stand up against the tree really needs three people.  We did it with two, and it was a major struggle.  I have a hilly terrain in the back of my property with rocks, bushes, and large stones.  We found a nice Poplar to set the stand up against it.  These straps to hoist this son of a gun up worked but it wasn't fun or very easy.  The stand is wide and tall, and she is quite heavy.The accompanying Harness is just a bunch of straps that wrap around your waist and hips.  They're not comfortable and once taken off, it will be like a Rubik's cube.  Tip: Throw them into the trash where they belong and buy yourself a good harness.The instructions and setup are the biggest pain in the ""you know what"".  It's a photocopy of instructions and you can't distinguish what the lines for the legend are trying to identify.  I looked at the PDF and they were marginally better.  What is most annoying is that the parts are not labeled with any stickers to say what is what.  Just as annoying is the instructions for assembly and the marginally helpful illustrations.  You actually need an English Standard and metric ruler to work with this since they have used a combination of the two (which is beyond me); for example, 1 3/5, 8 mm.  Who does that?  Insane!Tip: lay out all the parts and count them up.  It's likely you'll be missing some parts.  Call the company to ask for those parts or you'll be in for a bit of frustration, as I had.  It took exactly 7 days from when I called to get the parts.Assembly of the seat was the biggest headache.  They supply you with 1 1/4"" screws which are not long enough to pull the mesh chair supports close enough to tighten the bolts.Tools recommended:Rubber malletRule (ENGLISH STANDARD and METRIC)Open end wrenches and ratcheting driver.PatienceOnce set up and assembled it's a great stand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFYEK2NCCZRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5U5IRO#wasThisHelpful","RXFYEK2NCCZRR","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a moderate to severe blockage in our shower drain.  The Zip it Drain tool was not adequate. I had a more serious problem.  This has two different length rods.  I only had to use the 18 rod.Whereas the Zip it took about 1/4 of the drain burden, the Weasel took care of the rest.  A hairball the size of my fist came out despite the Zip it giving me 4 empties with 4 passes (after an initial decent haul).  The second pass was a smaller volume of hair, but then the third and fourth passes hauled out additional disgusting gobs of hair and debris.  One big tip: when doing this disgusting evolution, I recommend having the shower on to clean off your hands.  It was disgusting but ""fruitful"".The crank attaches to each rod by a fitted slot.  Then you slide the guard over the connector, insert the rod into the drain, and then turn the crank.  This is a most highly effective way to clean out a shower drain.  I do recommend running the shower so you can see and hear the progress of how much more you must explore to rid yourself of a high grade drain stenosis.

Progressively, practice exercises build upon learning principles to help the student develop the skills necessary to understand how to read conventional notes, as well as tablature.

Anything less than that with just move the spinner.  It has high visibility stickers that are easy to see at 25 yards, the minimum safe distance.  It's a much easier target system to hit than my Gamo resetting system, so I would place this in an intermediate to advanced category for skill to hit these.No issues with this product's ability to withstand pellet rounds, as it didn't even have a dent on the target face.

I was using a Stoeger X20 suppressor 22 caliber.The targets hold up well, and there is no dent at all.  The impression of the pellet is all I see so they hold up to impact.The stand is stable in the ground, and the setup was frustrating without documentation, though I figured it out.Great target for an advanced/expert shooter.  This is not for beginners or novices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17C4AAHNGKWGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002APHBT6#wasThisHelpful","R17C4AAHNGKWGW","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I practice martial arts and we do a lot of pivots and rotations which can be a strain on the knees.  I found these, as recommended by a friend.  Now, I find myself wearing these all the time for support.  They're very comfortable and stay right where they need to be.  The fit is exactly right for me and it doesn't feel like it's too tight.I have full mobility without excessive strain on my ligaments and tendons.I will purchase a second one for the other knee.

"This is an ambitious system whereby speakers are integrated with a personal trainer. There are two programs that are downloaded from your respective App Store, The Jabra Sport App and the Music app. For the system to work, you need the Sport app. Use of the app requires registering an email. The use of the app can track your position by GPS, even when it is not operating. You also enter biometric data, such as your age, height, and weight, as well as your birthday.Selecting an activity is limited to cross training, running, hiking, biking, walking. This is not a waterproof system but it is going to work when you sweat.The initial menus test your fit and ability to hear a quality sound. There are several sized ear gels that fit into the ears, as well as ear wings that attach to your headphones for a snug fit. I wore the standard set which worked very well. The Menu system is intuitive, and they're easy to navigate. Each workout is tracked and a log/journal is kept.I used this for boxing, and karate. No issues with the headphones shifting or coming out. The fit was perfect, and quite stable. The lightweight makes them almost imperceptible. The headphones fit specific to each ear and the cable wraps around the back of your neck.There are three buttons: Power on/pairing, volume up/forward, and volume down/repeat. A micro USB port charges the headset. It is red when charging and turns green when it is fully charged.As for sound quality, these are above average. I tried instrumental, classical, vocals, rock, country, bluegrass, jazz, Opera, Hip Hop, R&B, rock, and Pop music. The various ranges are covered very well. It also, keeps a lot of environmental sound out which could be a danger so one must be careful.Overall, this is a solid set of headphones, and the integrated software is solid.Two thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2JXTPHZNJW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X144EMM#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2JXTPHZNJW6","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been learning to play the banjo for about 4 weeks, and I have made rapid progress through the techniques in the book.  The DVD helps the learner by playing segments of songs in progressively faster speeds.  Each song in the first half of the book describes the proper techniques and allows the student to learn parts of each song, before proceeding.The video is high quality and easy to understand.I had to buy a music stand to play while reading the notes.  It's a great book on techniques, though it's short on music theory, such as specifics of the Fretboard, scales, and such.

"Living in the South, it gets hot and humid.  When I saw this item, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The documentation was sparse.  The package says it doesn't need batteries and I was not sure how it was going to work.The principle by which it works is that it works by a pressurized chamber.  The pump at the top increases pressure and pushes the water through a mister at the end of a silicone tube.  The pressure is controlled by a stopcock.  Essentially it functions like a chemical garden sprayer.There is a clip that allows it to attach to clothing or strap.  It holds 16 ounces of fluid.  The reservoir or chamber is secured in a nylon bag with a strap.  One flaw that I see is that the nylon bag doesn't allow pumping when it is zipped up.  The pump has to be exposed for the piston to work.  Maybe it was designed that way.The more you pump, the higher the pressure.  However, the pressure dissipates after a few minutes so you have to pump again.  For sporting events, playing sports, gardening, shopping outdoors or picnics, this works well for staying cool. Great invention.  It works well enough for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S80N0GJIJJWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005727DHE#wasThisHelpful","R1S80N0GJIJJWQ","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being new to learning a stringed instrument, I wanted to make sure my equipment is in tune, at all times.  I have two banjos:  Deering Goodtime Special and a Recording King Starlight Open Back.This tuner clips onto the banjo without marring the surface.  The angle can be adjusted and the display can be rotated to suit any mounting position.Turning on the tuner involves a button on the side of the unit.  It is a small button and hard to remember which one it actually is unless I look right at it, but that will come with time.  I changed the key to G which is where my banjos are tuned.  Once set up, it detects the sounds and indicates on a chromatic scale where your instrument is set.  As you adjust, the colors indicate whether you're sharp / or flat.  When in the appropriate pitch, the indicator shows a green ring.  The operation is simple.  The indicators are responsive.The beauty of this is the energy conserving features where the screen goes dim after a certain period and it will automatically shutdown if no tones are detected.  Accessing the battery is through a slide cover and battery is a CR 2032.Prior to this, I had been using a tuner App on my iPad.Overall,I couldn't be more pleased with the size, convenience and responsiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFW9VJ0B6D30S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4L3F9E#wasThisHelpful","RFW9VJ0B6D30S","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Destruction derbies have been a great past time for decades.  This system takes that game one step further, Weapons mounted vehicles.  The goal is cause massive destruction to your opponents vehicle, and anything goes.  Collisions, shots and combinations of the two.  So how does this work?  Each vehicle is able to keep track of where the other one is, and the cars are App driven in the arena of your choosing.  The cars can operate on hardwood floors, ceramic tile or carpeted surfaces.The App, which I downloaded from the Apple AppStore, pairs your device to one of the cars.  If you have another bluetooth capable device, you can pair it with the other car.  However, if you're alone, it's ok, since you can have artificial intelligence battle against you.  You can pit yourself against varying levels of skilled drivers, one more ruthless and brutal than the other.Pairing just involves holding your device right over the car.  No synching through the Setting and doing pairing mode.  I wish more devices paired this quickly.  Resetting the cars is just as easy.Each car is powered by 4 AA batteries.  The batteries are secured by a Phillips screw head.  The battery compartment is a removable tray.  The only switch is the power switch on each vehicle.Once paired, it will update the firmware.  I suggest doing so for each car.  They have to be done separately.  Playing as individual involves pairing the vehicle, then clicking onto the AI menu on the app.  Highlight the vehicle and then select your opponent, followed by clicking the VS icon.You can go into the My Car menu which allows you to choose different weapons which have different levels of damage and rate of fire.  So, not only can you crash into the other car, you can shoot at them.  Damage levels are shown on the app, and are also reflected by the indicator light on the top of the car.There is virtually no lag from one selection screen to another.  Controls are, well, very responsive to the lightest touch.  You can fire as many virtual weapons but the indicator light turns red, and then there is a latency period for your weapons to reload/recharge.If you had more cars, you could even have a more extended variety of opponents.Operation of the cars takes a learning curve.  The vehicles are loud.  The AI will indiscriminately crash into obstacles such as furniture or walls so be careful.  The AI becomes more ruthless as you go up in levels.Overall, this makes an excellent system.  It has a high replay value.Two thumbs up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3ZDGHXP3G4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVGIBX0#wasThisHelpful","RS3ZDGHXP3G4","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pedometer, calorie tracker (based upon activity) and sleep tracker.  Running on the latest iOS, I found the App in the App Store.  As I did this, I used the USB charger to charge the device.  Pairing the device took no time at all, I was off and operating.  I cannot for the life of me, figure out how to get it out of sleep mode.  So I shake it or touch the electrodes and it comes on randomly.  If it actually stayed on all the time, I'd give it another star.  The sleep mode was useless since this sleeps itself.The setup comes with 2 silicone watch bands, a Velcro enclosure for sleeping and a belt attachment.  It measures movement in three planes so I will guess it has its own accelerometer.  It is not waterproof or water resistant so it has to be taken off.  The read outs are clear but getting this out of sleep mode puzzles me.  It went through a few iterations of syncing with the tracker when I went to see the readouts on the iPhone app.I was still puzzled, personally, on what button they're actually talking about.Regardless, it's a handy device if you can get beyond the quirks but I'm not entirely sure it's ready for prime time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22Y0899YWSNZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","R22Y0899YWSNZB","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Resonator Banjo with a tone ring (Deering Goodtime Special) which I am using to learn the Scruggs style of picking.  I have decided that I will also take up the Clawhammer method of picking which is popularized in my region of the country (Southwest Virginia).After reading the previous review, I was excited to try this particular model.  The banjo is well constructed for an import.  The head is a Mylar type of cover.  The yellow color of the head is close to natural maple.  The neck is finished with a rosewood fretboard.  The edges are done in a tortoise colored plastic or Formica. There is a steel tone ring which adds to the richness of sound.One minor issue was that when I received mine, the bridge was not set up.  I had to loosen the strings to fit the bridge.  Mind you, that I purchased an open box special and whoever used it did not properly set it up.  There were more grooves than what were needed so I didn't hold this against my own rating.  However, regardless of that fact, the bridge is very low quality.  I installed a Golden Gate GB-3 Deluxe and it made a world of difference for maintaining the tuning.  I have considered upgrading the strings but I will hold off until I break the current ones in to see how they perform.The action is good and doesn't require a great deal of effort to play a chord.  The strings are much closer together than my Resonator Style Banjo.  The configuration is more suited to Clawhammer over picking with a Scruggs style approach.  With respect to sound, the volume is lower than a resonator style.  The pitch is a little higher, and the tone is brighter/higher.The very light weight makes it great for a traveling banjo.  This would work great for a youngster or beginner.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase apart from a minor issue with the bridge.For the price it is hard to beat.  Another similar model to try would be the Recording 1930s style banjo, or you can go up to the Deering Goodtime (Open Back) which is much more money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15AK4YW81UU1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HXE4KAW#wasThisHelpful","R15AK4YW81UU1C","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allergens at home are becoming a widely known issue for those suffering from Allergies or Asthma.  Sloughed off skin serves as a food source for dust mites and their excrement contributes to some degree of this particular health issue.The Dyson V6 Mattress is a handheld vacuum and Hepa filtration system that works on upholstery and mattresses.  Our couches are actually vacuumed on a weekly basis.  Well, to my shock upon using this vacuum, there was a lot more hiding in the couch than I cared to know.  There was a great amount of dust, dander and debris that likely sits just under the upholstery surface.  I was completely disgusted.  I ran this on maximum suction and it only runs about 5-6 minutes per charge.  Charging takes about 3.5 hours.I ran this also on one of our mattresses and again, the same result.  A lot of skin particles, predominantly, and more than I care to think about.  I ran it in high mode which gave me much more time, about 15-17 minutes on a charge.  It didn't work for me, while plugged in by the way.The Vacuum is a handheld variety with a trigger mechanism.  If you're doing a prolonged job, then it's best to hold it at the handle and along the nozzle, as this still gets heavy and tiring.  The pistol like shape over a DustBuster design allows the user to get a lot better control as there are a lot of angles and directions that you're positioning the nozzle to clean.There are a few accompanying attachments that also allow cleaning between the mattress and box spring, or between cushions on a sofa.Bear in mind it is not a vacuum designed to pick up large debris, so it is not a vacuum designed to pick up huge spills of dirt, broken glass, or potato chips spills.  It would damage the primary purpose which is for microfiltration.Maintenance is a bit of a chore, as there are three components to clean, monthly.  These pieces must be out to dry for about 24 hours, as again, this works on microfiltration.  Any moisture or remaining water will likely minimize or offset any effectiveness of its design.The vacuum is relatively lightweight and ergonomic.  Given the power, I cannot see how something this powerful can be realistically much smaller.  Indicator lights indicate the charge remaining or if the battery much be replaced.Surprisingly, this has a 2 year warranty.  Other handhelds I have owned have only had 6 month or 1 year warranties.I do wish it had a storage case to put the parts away without having to use the factory box.  That would have been a nice touch, especially since there is no ""on board"" storing of attachments.Overall, I'm glad I have this.  I was amazed at how much a conventional cleaning is really ineffective at cleaning.  There is a lot more than meets the eyes under those covers and upholstery.  If you have allergies or asthma, this is something you most likely need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DM5ZCNULAU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FQ4STC#wasThisHelpful","R1DM5ZCNULAU2","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The George Foreman lineup of grills/griddles has finally gone portable.  This uses a self contained propane tank (similar to those that you take camping).  Ignition can be started with the integrated igniter or a match through the right front match hole.Looking like a briefcase, when closed, this is relatively compact with the exception of having to carry the propane tank.  When open, you fold out the wind guards to minimize the chance of flame ups.  Just like the standard or indoor George Foreman grills, you have a drip pan to drain the grease and oil from meats.  The nice advantage of this system is the ability to use it like a grill or a griddle.  So it is great for camping, cookouts or when the power goes out at home; however, this is a device for outdoor use only, and it is not recommended inside a recreational vehicle or boat, either.Cleanup is easy and having the draining bin for grease and oil makes it convenient.  Overall, it's an innovative design for a compact/portable grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H4623498Q67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUVQ#wasThisHelpful","R29H4623498Q67","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried every pillow from foam, to styrofoam filled to air inflated pillows.  I never found one comfortable or portable as this set.First and foremost, the memory foam adjusts to the shape of most users.  It is very comfortable when supine or seated.  I have used this for road trips, sleeping in a waiting room and obviously, when flying.  It has a higher support around the back and sides that other pillows lack.  There is a nylon cord that improves the fit around the front.  A small pocket for a standard sized smartphone without a case, allows the user to sleep to music.  As others have mentioned, this works well for ear bud type headphones but not full sized headphones.The pillow is compressible and easy to store.  It's a very compact size that can fit into a backpack, carry on back and can easily just be attached to the outside of your bag, also.  A nylon bag with a Velcro fastener allows for additional compression.Great pillow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YNB7QC2RWND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VFCFFY#wasThisHelpful","R3YNB7QC2RWND","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been starting to play banjo at home.  We have an open floor plan and the acoustics is optimal for a concert.  However, the sound of my Banjo with Tone Ring and Resonator is quite loud.The sound of the banjo projects throughout the house.  Getting complaints from the wife and daughter has lead to me resorting to desperate measures.  1) I bought an open back banjo 2) I bought one of these mutes.I read the reviews, and based upon what I read, it was what my house needed.  This is a brass U-shaped frame with nylon bristles.  Because it is OPEN on one side, it has to be placed with the curved end upwards.  The bristles will hold it to some degree.If you notice a light or loose fit, then clamp down on it more.  I noticed that my Brass Mute was still pretty loose for a fit, so I placed it under a carpet/rug and pressed down upon the hinge which gave a more snug fit.The volume is reduced by 1/3.  Overall, I am happy to have purchased this.  On my open back banjo, I place a sock or knee brace inside the pot against the rod, and it mutes the banjo a bit more. The combination of the two allow me to use my picks as opposed to strumming with just my fingers.Very good item, but Mike's Banjo Mute works better since the assembly screws onto the strings and bridge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFN7PUK4JOYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041T4DK4#wasThisHelpful","RKFN7PUK4JOYO","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those on a budget, this makes an excellent choice for a laser rangefinder.  I have been primarily a Leopold and Nikon laser rangefinder customer in the recent past.This has one primary function: instantaneous distance only, as opposed to a scan feature.  The response time for a reading is very accurate and fast with a couple of caveats. Targets in the shadows may not give me a reading, and neither will darker objects in shadows despite a relatively near distance.  Realistically, you can expect true limits to be about half that of manufacturer specifications.  The closest target that I can reasonably range is 5 yards.  The furthest realistic distance was a large oak at about 300 yards.  Additionally, the Region of Interest is large so objects partially covered within the rectangular reticle will not give a reading or give and errant reading.The body of the rangefinder is relatively larger than average.  The contours are great for retention and operation, even with gloves.  There are no rubber adornments that aid in a non-slip grip.  Additionally, there is a lanyard hole without an included lanyard.  The nylon case is a good fit, though, I prefer to hang these devices from my neck or within closer reach.One major flaw is that the battery compartment is secured with a flathead screw.  It can be opened with a dime but not without some sort of tool to access the compartment, unlike other brands.  As for the battery needed, it is a 9 volt battery and there is an LED indicator to let the user know about remaining power left.Last, there is no backlit display.Overall, though, it is a responsive and compact entry level rangefinder that will more than adequately do the job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1803HITBY7Y08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX7JPMG#wasThisHelpful","R1803HITBY7Y08","AGGAQLXPVGM5D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGAQLXPVGM5D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to travel and watch travel documentaries, so I was excited when I was offered a copy of Extreme Treks: Sacred Mountains of China for review.  The title, Extreme Treks appealed to me even more, so I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately I do not have a Blu Ray player, so it took awhile to watch it.This was the first time I had heard of Ryan Pyle, a photographer and host of this series who sets out to travel around four of the sacred mountains in China.  These are in the remote Tibet region, so this is not your regular tourist info guide.  This is a hard-core climbing adventure that could be very dangerous to an inexperienced adventurer.The disc consists of four episodes, each dedicated to a different mountain.  The format is basically the same for each one. These are roughly 45 minute made-for-TV episodes without the commercials (which I love). He begins each climb by giving us the background of this sacred mountain while preparing for the trek. Then we watch him and his crew, as they encounters obstacles ranging from weather to exhaustion and hints of altitude sickness. Along the way, we get breathtaking shots that few people will ever see in person.This is one of those adventures where the viewer thinks, I dream of trying something like this, but I never would actually do it.  These treks are really grueling, but his spirit is inspiring.  Im glad he did because the shots are absolutely beautiful, and I doubt Id ever learn about this region any other way. The shots are in HD, and the scenery is truly amazing.Ryan has a lot of passion for what he does, and he is a true adventurer.  He includes a support crew made up of locals, which adds to the flavor of the region.  Along the way, he talks to us in the camera or with voice over so we get a feel for what he is going through.I certainly learned about these mountains and the culture surrounding them while I was watching.  If you like true life adventure with fantastic scenery, this is a great show to watch.I was sent a copy of this Blu-Ray in exchange for my honest review.

"The first thing to know is that this shower head does not come with a hose.  It cannot be connected to your shower without a hose or some type of flexible connector.  It is made to be a hand held shower head, so most people will use a hose.Connection is very easy and only takes a minute.  It looks a little space-age with the clear section and the little balls. Another thing to be aware of is that if you open the filter (Im the curious type), the balls will fall out of the top section.I have heard from Dr.  Oz and others that the skin absorbs chemicals and you should have a filter on your shower.  I had a filter on my shower before, and had to change it every 3 months. The amazing thing about this is that it lasts for a year or more without changing the filter balls. Im not sure how this actually works, but I did so some research and it is a great concept..The shower head does a great job and seems less restrictive than my old one.  The settings are great and actually create different effects.  I really like the Mister setting and the Rain setting.I have to say, I was a bit skeptical before using this, but it really does just what it says.

"I have tried and listened to several portable speakers over the past couple of years.  Some are really amazing for the sound they put out in a small size.  The problem with most is that you still sacrifice true high quality stereo for the convenience of size and sometimes Bluetooth capability.My favorite speaker before this one was my Turtle speakerOutdoor Tech OT1800 Turtle Shell 2.0 - Rugged Water-Resistant Wireless Bluetooth Hi-Fi Speaker (Black).  It is larger than many, but has very good quality sound and is very durable.  The problem I had with it were, lack of true stereo sound, due to lack of separation in speakers.  Most small speakers use either one speaker for both channels or two speakers right next to each other.This speaker is a bit larger than many others (still compact in size), but the sound quality is well worth it.  The two channel speakers are placed on the ends of the bar, with a sub woofer in the center.  The sound is the best I have heard from a small speaker like this.Of course, it has Bluetooth, and other capabilities plus an FM radio and an SD card slot. It connects easily to my mp3 player with a jack and Android phone with Bluetooth.Many others have some of these features, but what sets this apart is the sound.

"I lost my son 7 years ago, and it was hard at time to really keep my faith.  I questioned so many thing in life, including God and why thing happen the way they do.  I think the reason I was so attracted to this book is because it started with the first chapter asking, ""Can God be trusted?""As the first chapter unfold, it suggests that the reader may even question if God exists.  I felt like the author was talking directly to me.This book has a way of helping you think about your life and your place in it, rather that just telling you to blindly follow the crowd.  Of course, there are several references to the Bible and other sources, but they are more guiding than directing.  I think everyone has to find their own way and their own beliefs.

"I have to say that this is not exactly a heavy duty mop.  It comes in pieces and assembles easily in less than a minute.  The handle screws together and has a soft rubber cover at the joints.  The bucket system is light weight materials as well.The mop itself does a good job.  The microfiber head is full and absorbent, and it comes with a replacement mop head.  The mop heads snap on easily.  This is a larger mop, much like the old fashioned kind.  It holds a lot of water, and the hands-free wringing system does a decent job.The neck has a 360 swivel system to allow it to get into tight spaces.  I found the swivel to be a bit too stiff to work as well as it should.  Perhaps a little more use or a shot of WD40 will help.If you like this style of mop, this is much handier than the traditional bucket with the wringer.

"I have been exercising all of my life, but I have never tried kettle bells before.  The instructor, Lorna Kleidman is the creator or KettleX and instructs classes and private sessions nationwide.  Lorna is a 3-time World Champion in Kettlebell Sport, so who could be better to learn from?The tutorial was really nice for me, since my wife and I are new to this.  Lorna does a very thorough job of explaining what each exercise does and how to do it safely.  The video is professional quality, and Lorna is an excellent presenter.  There is a menu with each exercise, so you can select the ones you want or play them all.The video suggests 10  15 lb. kettle bell for women and 15  20 for men. We followed this advice and got a set of three.  I am really impressed with what a great workout this gives you.  I am becoming a fan of kettle bells and Lorna Kleidman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDV2VVTQH8YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU8B6OW#wasThisHelpful","R1DDV2VVTQH8YZ","A4V35W9XNM4X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4V35W9XNM4X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to admit that when my wife first put these gloves on, I had to laugh because they look like the hands of a cartoon character.After a good laugh, we tried them out and we were really impressed.The main thing they need to do is protect you from burns, and they do that very well.  The silicone strip provide a great gripping surface to avoid dropping large trays when removing them from the oven.  They are big enough to use them like hot pads for removing hot pans or to protect the table from hot casseroles.I have big hands, and I wasn't sure if they would work for me.  They are a little snug to pull on, but they do stretch enough to fit almost anyone.  Once I have them pulled all the way on, I can move my hands just as though they were cotton gloves.  They are surprisingly flexible for the protection they give.They are fantastic for the grill because they allow me to move hot pans around while still being flexible enough to flip my burgers and dogs.  No more singed hands.

"I have been using this case with my Samsung Galaxy tablet for 3 weeks.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review to test it's durability.  So far, it has held up pretty well.  The fabric is heavy nylon, much like what is used for suitcases.  The zipper is sturdy, and has a nice big handle.The size is generous enough for most 7 inch tablets.  I have a cover on mine and it still fits in perfectly.  The inside lining is soft and will not scratch the screen.  The mesh pouch on the front has a Velcro closure, and is big enough for my Galaxy II phone.The lining has a surprisingly dense (and thin) foam cushion.  It is probably more protective than it first appears.  The one improvement I would like is more padding for protection from drops.

"I have been devouring books like this since my son died seven years ago.  I think we all want to know what the dead have to tell us, if just to know that our sprit lives on.I have enjoyed other books by Mike Dooley and I really wanted to love this one.  Unfortunately, it didnt happen for me.  It starts with credibility on the subject.  People like John Edward and Rebecca Rosen have demonstrated their ability as mediums.  What is Dooleys demonstrated ability?  He starts by asking and answering that question: How do I know?  I just do.  In the same way you know you are loved without hearing it.  I was hoping for more.The writing style is a cross between entertaining and annoying at times, as I caught myself thinking, Please stop rambling and get to the point.  It seemed much different from some of his other works.  I thought it would be more of a scientific approach to death and dying, but I didnt really see anything new that I havent seen in so many new age books on spirituality.I can understand why the reviews for this book are all over the board.  The author tells us that there is a God, but not like religious teachings traditionally tell us.  God is part of everything including us.  There is a heaven but no hell.  For people who just want to believe that we live on and want a feel good read, this will do it.  For people who are looking for more scientific proof, or people who have strong religious beliefs, a lot of what the author says will seem a bit empty and unsupported.What I did like about the book is the positive, upbeat approach to a sometimes sad subject.  It offers hope and faith about what lies ahead for all of us.  There are also good suggestions on how to live our Earthly life while we are here.  In the end, we are probably all looking for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G4U2ZJLV0Q42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401945562#wasThisHelpful","R1G4U2ZJLV0Q42","A4V35W9XNM4X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4V35W9XNM4X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using Armor All on my cars for years, and I wanted to try this to see how it compared.  I sprayed one side of my dash with Armor All and the other with Chemical Guys.  I have to say it does a great job - better than Armor All.  The Armor All leaves a nice shine, but it can also create a glare when the sun hits it.  It can also be uneven, because some parts of the dash do not shine as well as the others.This leave a nice matte finish, and has a nice smell to it.  One thing I like is that it does not leave the surface slick like other products.  It does cost a bit more, although not that much.  If you like the shine, try other products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGWKBHPO4VW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LPEZ6Q#wasThisHelpful","R2QGWKBHPO4VW5","A4V35W9XNM4X4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4V35W9XNM4X4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He used them and told me I was wrong, that they worked just fine as regular headphones. So I began to use them and they work great. They are also attractive, in blue, and the ear pieces are very well cushioned. I have even slept with them on as I often listen to audios as I go to sleep. So they are quite comfortable.

"This show was very promising in its pilot episode.  The lead is very good as a bachelor who is still on the prowl who suddenly finds out he is both a father and a grandfather. He is not even 50 and has never gone steady, been engaged or, perish the thought, married. He was just looking for his next good time when this was all dumped on him. He is carrying this whole show on his shoulders and his comedic timing and delivery is impeccable. The rest of the cast is good but at this point did not deliver the laughs. They were clearly supporting the lead as his straight men and women. Besides this new family of his, there is also his restaurant, which is for the hip, trendy and littered with A-listers here and there. Usually some other strong characters need to emerge to make a sitcom a hit but it is too early to tell who that might be. I think it is too early to tell if this can make it all the way to becoming a long running hit sitcom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHUZFHZOTB2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014HQFQOC#wasThisHelpful","R3UHUZFHZOTB2Y","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This season shows the most startling changes in all of the characters. First and foremost, our two female detectives are not getting along. They both want the same job. They both are sick of one another's private lives and problems. There is no actual cat fight out in the street but it is a close thing. Next, their superior officer, a woman who has always been tough as nails and totally competent, has progressively become an alcoholic. It is seriously throwing off her ability to do the job. The two detectives have always admired her greatly so are they going to have to be the ones to turn her in to the higher ups? Romance blooms off and on for these two as well but one gets the feeling that long range it will always be more off than on. This is totally realistic for being in the police force as is their superior's alcoholism. This show is immensely gutsy for not ducking these issues just because our leads are all women. As usual, they are excellent at solving their cases since that is the one area of their lives where they do excel without fail. I have always enjoyed Lesley Sharpe in everything she's done for the BBC (the blonde on the box).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5X0JPHYOW2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMDF33O#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5X0JPHYOW2I","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm running into a problem with tv viewing. There are so many shows which are excellent that I can't take on anything new unless it is also excellent. This did not used to be true before tv got so good with the entrance of all of these new providers, especially top film makers and writers now making tv shows. I also saw the movie version of this and liked it extremely well. That got 5 stars. This show does not compare favorably with the film. It especially does not have any of the deeper concerns that the movie version had.I love all of Philip Dick's work. If you read it, it is very intellectual. He never intended any law and order procedural to come out of his work. His eye was always on the bigger picture. That is what this show is missing. So the people behind the camera are the ones who really did not understand his books.This is a so-so rendition of a law and order version of the original movie. It has gotten the special effects down, which the movie had too. But everything else about this is not of same caliber. I suspect Spielberg needs to actually be the one in charge of this show in order for it to be special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ITISBAH5L9GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OPV1CG#wasThisHelpful","R1ITISBAH5L9GI","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of my favorite Scandinavian series. I've read all of the prior books and enjoyed them all. This one continues the excellence level. This time the Department Q investigators go to an island to investigate why a policeman killed himself when their department said they couldn't take his case.This sets off a long journey into the past. The starting point is the title, the Hanging Girl. The dead policeman was obsessed about a case from 17 years ago involving a young girl who was murdered by a snow plow like vehicle hitting her and throwing her body up into a tree. She bled to death there. The people and places this story goes from there is in every intriguing direction possible. There are cult members and ex lovers of a charismatic hippie from back then named Frank and alternative medicine practitioners. And so much more too.Although this is Danish instead of Swedish, the two countries have a lot to do with one another and the police have to cooperate a good deal. Department Q is located in the Copenhagen Police Department as is its cold case unit. I recommend reading this series in the order it was written. You can follow the mystery if you read them out of sequence but you really won't understand the personalities of the characters who make up Department Q.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUHBP12EBL23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525954945#wasThisHelpful","R1LUHBP12EBL23","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most ambitious and original shows I've seen in recent years. It deals with issues which are not usually seen in series tv. There is the judge himself, played by Ron Pearlman. Normally he's law and order type but when his son went into an irreversible coma, all sorts of different things began happening to him. He began having visions, speaking in tongues, having liquid trails to follow to lead him to the guilty, a defendant who became his right hand man. In the hands of a lesser acting talent this could have been a complete disaster.But Pearlman is great in this role. He also walks a line between someone whom you might despise ordinarily yet at other times he elicits empathy. Dana Delaney plays his wife and does her usual solid job. The ""pastor"" is someone who has turned to this line of work after being an actor in a soap opera who was written out of it. I thought that was a hilarious touch to the series.Amazon seems to be bringing some solid tv series to streaming viewing and I am really glad to have these streaming alternatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z2Y1M4TLFLFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR9XOM8#wasThisHelpful","R2Z2Y1M4TLFLFM","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There has been a scarcity of good sitcoms recently. This did not sound like a particularly fresh idea but its script was excellent and the delivery by its actors perfect. Thus, the concept of two people who were ""just having fun"" while he's visiting London ending up having a baby together works. There are some scenes which appear in the first episode that immediately engage you. These are:There is a pre cancer condition involved. The doctor explaining this mangles it up so much telling the couple that all anyone can think of is having cancer itself. She doesn't have cancer. She just has cells that bear frequent testing.There is acquaintance from hell who has them over for dinner. It turns out her husband is even worse than she is. For anyone who has ever had a nightmare of getting to together with another couple, this one really tops them all.When he finds out she is pregnant is when he is back in the USA, blithely having a first date with someone else. He takes the call from her at the restaurant and pretends it is his mother calling him.Rob Delaney who plays the guy is especially good at deadpan comedy which is not easy to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHE6H9SMZJDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8UID6C#wasThisHelpful","RDHE6H9SMZJDU","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What happened with this show is that it was cancelled by AMC at the end of the third season. It was picked up by Netflix for the concluding and fourth season only. The third season had left us hanging off a cliff. Since the talent behind this show went in with this idea in place, everyone was focussed on bringing this show to a good conclusion. This is unusual in series tv because typically no one knows if the show will have another season or not.If you do not already know this: this show was initially an english language remake of the Danish show of the same name. When this version began, it followed the Danish show scene by scene. Gradually they started deviating from the Danish version. By the time we got to this final season, the only thing the two had in common was a woman detective. The best invention was of her male partner, Holder. He was a great addition to the show and the Danish version could have used him. There is also a lot of magnetism between these two leads.So these two have to finish off their murder stories and then find some kind of personal lives to resume or begin anew.Just to show you a key difference between the Danish show and the American: in the Danish show the woman starts off with a rather obnoxious male partner. To call him a male chauvinist pig would be to upgrade him.Anyway, because these other police people are not as in to guns as we are, the are tracking a killer one night and he has no gun. He, of course, ends up dead early in the show. So much for the males on that show.The American version is completely opposite. Holder is the feeling one of the two. He is compassionate and understanding. BUT he certainly carries his gun! So Holder is an equal character in this show, which is why they are shown together on the poster. In fact, most viewers are going to relate to Holder as their favorite character. Considering he didn't exist in the Danish show, this is quite a leap.I liked the third and fourth seasons best because by that point the show was its own and the viewer could forget about eh Danish version. So I think seasons 1 and 2 are good but seasons 3 and 4 are terrific.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLTCHHN9YLSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013B3CQHW#wasThisHelpful","R2MLTCHHN9YLSQ","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this film. I know a great deal about this case so I was also curious to see how graphic the content would be. I think overall they were probably as graphic as most of the Lifetime cable tv audience can handle. So I can't really fault Lifetime for that. It gets across the basic tension between the killer and victim. She wants love and marriage. He does not or at least not with her. He wants to marry a ""nice Mormon girl."" Even though Jodi Arias converted, it wasn't enough.Travis actually does a lot of very crude and obnoxious things in his real life self but that is not shown here. For one, he sent out pictures over his phone of his states of arousal which were very specific. These had to be shown in court and the courtroom was stunned. The way he talked about her to everyone was also crude and offensive but that has been very toned down too. I would not have wanted to know him because of his very damaged way of perceiving women.The film accurately shows that he was primarily interested in a sexual relationship while she was interested in his being ""the one."" She became increasingly obsessive and compulsive about this. His fatal mistake was that he kept going back for more sex even though he knew there was something wrong with her. She was slashing his tires, stalking his new girlfriend and became more and more obsessed about their (non-existent) relationship.Did he use her? Yes and if you go through the evidence, he used her in much worse ways than shown. He was not a beater or batterer but he was emotionally abusive to her. The film could have been a little more ruthless in its depiction of him and bring it closer to the truth. But I'm quibbling. I think it got the essence of their problem down fairly well.The law in this was not fully presented but I doubt the movie audience would be interested in hearing the arguments expounded upon at length. Essentially her defense tried to expand the battered wife or girlfriend defense to emotionally using someone and using someone for sex rather callously as a good enough reason for justifiable homicide to apply. The argument that won was the prosecution's, i.e., we cannot start excusing people from murdering others when they get into bad relationships and are dumped or are used over and over again...but give their consent to being so used. This was not a rape case, not a domestic violence case. It was a case where the man wanted sex and the woman wanted marriage and neither would budge. It is too bad that neither one of them got the psychiatric help that they both could have used. They were sane but they were really damaged people in their concepts of relationships.All in all this was a good job but if you want the full graphic nature of the two of them you will have to read about it. It is fascinating reading as they were absolutely toxic people to one another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TSKXR6XM3WCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DK4801Y#wasThisHelpful","R2TSKXR6XM3WCV","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Brits are very good at changing their casts around in their series tv. It is a tricky thing to do and mostly series close when cast members are substituted. This show is one of the successes in series cast changes. There have been only two Barnabys and this second one has been quite good. I've lost track of the assistants there have been so many. This new assistant is perhaps the most attractive of the bunch although we've had some funnier ones. This Barnaby also has a darling Jack Russell dog which I've appreciated too.There are four episodes and, as usual, they all revolve around grisly murder(s) in the most bucolic and lovely English villages. It is the contrast which makes this show. There is the prim and proper villager going about his or her duty with a stiff upper lip--and one of those folks is murdering someone with outright abandon and glee. Our detectives have to catch this wolf hiding out in a Burberry. Here are some quickie summaries of the episodes:A murder by a toy roulette wheel sent to an illustrator's home. She operates it and is killed. Her writer partner was the late George Summersbee, writer of the Jed Dagger novels. Fittingly enough, a village crime fiction festival is going on run by the crime writer's sister-in-law. So we have murders going on while a crime fiction festival is going on. It is very tongue in cheek and thus hilarious.A Pub landlady is crushed to death whilst assisting a magician. The magician has been linked to Satanism by the village's curate, who is also murdered on a pagan altar where seemingly midnight rituals occur by robed Satanists. This show never has a supernatural element so the answer has to be yet another traditionally clad Brit living the life of an English villager.Another episode involves a folk festival in a village. What has enraged villagers is that the festival organizer is planning to move it. This will also remove the money it brings into the village. So, of course, this organizer is found dead, his head held down in a bowl of water containing eels and eggs, something only the Brits would consider eating.Finally, there is a winery in a Midsomer village winery. It holds a launch for its new wine while a ruthless wine critic is present, Nadia. Several guests at the party end up poisoned by the wine but not fatally. Turns out the wine critic is the suspect in chief for the hit and run killing of a little girl by a presumably drunk driver. Certain people have not forgotten that she was never tried for the killing.These are all immensely enjoyable, just like their predecessor episodes were.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBSMILAJHNJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDBMBVO#wasThisHelpful","RVBSMILAJHNJ4","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a spin off from ""Waking the Dead"", about a cold case unit. The lead here was the pathologist in that series. However, she was not a strong character in that show. I was rather surprised to see her step into the lead in this series as she seems far more capable of supporting actor work. I did not appreciate, until seeing this spin off, how important it is to have a strong, almost overwhelming actor in the lead. Trevor Eve was that lead in ""Waking the Dead"". He played one of the most obnoxious people imaginable. Yet he was very effective as the leader of the unit. With his not being in the spin-off, it was as if the air had gone out of the show, like a balloon.  Trevor Eve juiced up the show and made it compelling. Sometimes you wanted to throw the set at him but you never wanted to turn it off. This spin-off never had anyone like that in it. So I learned something: nice characters without that strong personality have a hard, almost impossible time, getting series tv off the ground. I fully expected it to last only one season and that is all it did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROB6IYAV9UJ1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S237CA#wasThisHelpful","ROB6IYAV9UJ1N","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was about to give up on this show. I have hung in for all of the other seasons. But at the last minute I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did because I find myself enjoying it. The first challenge was using fabric from Mood which had been draped all over Madison Square Garden. Several of the designers managed to turn the yardage into great looks and there were some terrific bombs as well.The second challenge was the unconventional materials challenge. This involved going to a Hallmark Signature store in NYC and letting the designers load up on cards in a mad dash. They then had to construct a garment out of the cards. There were quite a few really great outfits in this challenge. Almost all of them used entirely cards and nothing else. Several were quite sculptural with a wedding dress made out of cards the most sculptural. That wedding dress was out of this world. Since it is only going to be worn one day, cards as material actually makes sense.Zack Posen and Nina Garcia do the hard core judging as they really understand how fashion is put together. Zack Posen can actually spot ANY detail on the garment which isn't right. Out of all the judges, he is the king of garment construction. Heidi and Tim are best in their respective role of Heidi as host and Tim as helper to the designers. Of all the people who have tried on his role in the spin offs of this show, no one comes close to being as effective as Tim is at it. Another reviewer here mentioned she thinks she's gotten used to Heidi. I think the same thing has happened to me.  The guest judges are hit and miss. Some are quite good whereas others are barely in the fashion design world.Tim also has his ""Tim Gunn Save"" again this season.One thing which changed on this show is that there is no more designers fighting over models. They have the model they are going to use at the start of the show. That never changes. So there are no more distractions over someone ""stealing"" someone else's model. The models seem roughly equivalent to one another as well. I can't say the model ever was the one who managed to win the show for the garment or got the designer kicked off. Besides, these judges know how to look past the models to the garments.It is still the same formula and the same show, which 14 seasons on is not as fresh as it once was. That said, I am enjoying it way more than I expected to be enjoying it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30VP29L4FZ3NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WIKBXW#wasThisHelpful","R30VP29L4FZ3NH","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't give this a bad review but I also have to admit that I eventually gave up on it. You may do the same if you have some of the same issues I have. If not, this may be five stars for you.First problem: Clive Owen's doctor character has a drug addiction. This problem begins to take over the episodes. This happened for one season of ""House"" and I almost gave up on that show because of it. I know drug addiction is bad but as a 66 year old person I don't need that hammered home to me constantly.Second problem: The surgeries in here are absolutely grisly. Medical practices compared to the ones we have today are downright barbaric. I am not usually squeamish but people are lost under hideous surgeries. I am so glad I did not live then. No wonder life spans were so short. ""House"" was antiseptically modern, clean and ""state of the art"" in comparison. If you actually like grisly surgeries though, this show will appeal to you.These are my two objections. As to what is right: Clive Owen is always a wonderful actor. I have never seen him in anything where he wasn't great. He is the Number One asset of the show. If you need a Clive Owen ""fix"", you will probably love the show. The writing and direction are also quite good. If you can get past my two objections, then you probably have a good viewing experience ahead of you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MR4U9VHMU2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122UEVMI#wasThisHelpful","R5MR4U9VHMU2H","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one really keeps you guessing. The lead character has a fling with a guy while on vacation in the Florida Keys. She returns to New York and arranges to meet him again at his apartment. The man who opens the door at that apartment though is not the same man, although he is the one who actually goes by the name she was given. She discovers the guy she met in Florida was using this guy's name and identity. He was someone else and she has no idea who that could be.Meanwhile this new guy gets in an uproar about he has been the victim of identity theft. He insists she talk to security at his brokerage firm as this other guy may wreck his career. She does so and the entire firm goes into a tailspin over this identity theft. Then she tries returning to her normal life but things begin happening to her. She believes the guy from the Keys is back in New York and now set on harming her.That is the premise and you will not be able to put it down until the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FWTP1I9405Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006235065X#wasThisHelpful","R3FWTP1I9405Q0","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film was under appreciated at the time of its release. Unfortunately, just about anyone who was doing an homage to Hitchcock was in for it critically as Hitch's work was still very fresh in their minds. Also, Meryl Streep's being the Hitchcock type blonde enigma was at that time considered a bad choice since she did only ""heavier"" work. We now know that she delights in trying just about any role once and being the Hitchcock Kim Novak or Grace Kelly or Tippi Hendren alternative must have been quite the lure for her. She was certainly up to the challenge. She does her usual excellent job in the role of the enigmatic woman. Is she a murderer? Did she murder her father? her lover?The late Roy Scheider plays the dead man's psychiatrist. That's is how he and Brooke come together. She was his lover and returns his watch to his psychiatrist so he can give it to the widow. That she and the dead man worked in an auction house is fascinating too and something Hitch himself had used. Remember Cary Grant's having to get away from James Mason and Martin Landau during an auction in ""North by Northwest?"" Certainly director Robert Benton must have remembered that.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and mood it sets is wonderful. Unless you've taken a vow to never see any substitutes but the real Hitchcock himself, this is certainly well worth your time.note: This review is here to help you decide whether you want to view this film in ANY format. This is not a review of the disc but of the film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAXZ24J47L4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQTCJEQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JAXZ24J47L4F","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are terrific shoes. I recently had total knee replacement surgery. I had a serious complication with my foot where my toes did not move for months. The toes have finally been coming back and I have been able to get into regular shoes again. I got these to protect myself from falls and other perils of my moving about. They have been wonderful. I just bought a second set. I usually fit a 7.5 shoe. That's what I ordered these in and the fit perfectly. These are also very attractive shoes. They are very bright and colorful which I like. I have been able to move around quite well in these and that is saying a lot. They cushion and support my foot and leg very well.

"I enjoyed this book so much that I promptly read an earlier one of hers and now have started a third book of hers. The other books are set in Washington, D.C. where the lead character is a prosecutor. However, in this book she returns to her home town in Michigan because her sister Jody is being questioned by police as a person of interest in the murder of the town hero, a football coach. The police believe Jody was carrying on an affair with the married coach. However, there are conflicting stories about the coach as to his preferences as to partners. There are rumors that he might be a Jerry Sandusky type, interested in the underage.Anna believes strongly in being a prosecutor. She came from a domestically violent home with an abusive father. Incredibly, she finds herself stepping up to become her sister's defense attorney. She hates criminal defense attorneys! The bulk of the book then is a complete reversal of Anna's usual role which is as a prosecutor.I frankly will be surprised if I like the other three books as well as this one. I've already read Book 3 and liked it but not as well. Seeing Anna forced to act as a defense attorney back in Michigan was very interesting to me. I also liked her relating how the people in Michigan were coping with all of the economic fall out which has taken place there. I also liked the cast of small town characters better than the big city ones which I just read about in Book #3. So if you have decided to try this author, this is the book I'd pick for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YLVQPYLU4LPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476760993#wasThisHelpful","R2YLVQPYLU4LPJ","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been enjoying watching some of these shows.  The recreation of the crime with stand ins is ok but the better part is the actual evidence which nails the killers. This type of evidence has a tremendous range but, as you'd expect, the big gun is a DNA match. I particularly like how some of these cases have laid dormant and only now the science is making it possible to prove who did it and convict that person. There are also cuts to detectives and pathologists to get their views on the case. If you are worried about a gruesome factor, there really is no blood and guts as part of the show. You are never shown the real crime scene or body. Although, I suppose that it is softened down to this extent, might hamper someone who is really trying to increase their skills. I'm a lawyer and I wouldn't mind being taken through some real life crime scenes, with blood spatter and everything. I doubt that will happen though. This has been made as palatable as possible to pull in the widest range of viewers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9EQDUN9GE9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JABRQDY#wasThisHelpful","RF9EQDUN9GE9Z","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel has an interesting premise and thus it moves very quickly. It is set in Miami where a surgeon murders his wife and children. This doesn't seem in much doubt, which is why he uses the insanity defense instead of not guilty. The lead prosecutor for the case is the biggest political opportunist imaginable. He is first chair and the lead character is second chair. It turns out she has a history herself of suffering damage from a murderer. This is why she became a prosecutor but it begins causing her serious problems in handling this case. The lead chair is having a fling with her but does not know about this history of hers. There is a more sympathetic male in the plotline. This is the lead detective on the case. I found it very engrossing. I'm frankly unsure about the ending, how well I like it. Many reviewers have called it predictable here. That's one way of interpreting it and perhaps that is the valid way. There is an alternate way of interpreting it ,which is more interesting. I think the author needed to be clearer about which interpretation was the accurate one. I can live with the ambiguity but some will not like that aspect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QNYL5A6SDOFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYWOUJI#wasThisHelpful","R3QNYL5A6SDOFL","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Susanna Clarke's research into this facet of England, the fairy and magical lore of it from centuries past, is formidable. That she has turned that research into fiction is all the more remarkable. How well you like this book compared to her novel, ""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell"" will depend on how you feel about short stories vs. novels. This mines the same material as the novel, fairies and magicians in England past, but it does not build in a huge interlocking story. If you like short stories, you will love this and you can speed right through it. I read it very quickly. It is very entertaining. Her fairies especially are enormously well delineated. Any prior conception one might have had about beautiful young women in long gowns with wings are upended. Clarke's fairies are nothing like that popular conception of them. Clarke is quite the academic. That she can give us the academics behind her stories while still vastly entertaining us is an incredible talent.  Unfortunately, the two books are ""it"". Clarke's research takes so long that her fictional output is that limited. I read online that she had suffered from bad health in more recent years too. So this may be all we get but it is magnificent stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CSXIY9CMFK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596913835#wasThisHelpful","R24CSXIY9CMFK4","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with another reviewer that the calorie count of this product puts it on the do not buy list for the future. When we eat soup, we are typically eating it for nutrition in part. If we want calorie laden food, I'd rather have a nice juicy burger.  A single 8 ounce serving has 150 calories and there is no way either one of us going to eat just 8 ounces. The calories got jacked up by adding heavy cream and other caloric additives. There are a bunch of similar tomato soups available which are less in calories and higher in nutrition. These soups are carried in almost identical packaging by Trader Joe's, Aldi's and Walmart. They are very good and I am sticking with those. Aldi's is actually called ""Tomato and Basil"" and is a terrific bargain.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Z5TPF1GKGNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5WYVCG#wasThisHelpful","R17Z5TPF1GKGNI","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good woman's fiction novel of romance, suspense and paranormal mixed together.  It is not the hard boiled crime thriller for which the reader turns to Harlan Coben or John Sandford. That only means that I doubt there would be many men interested in reading this, unlike the Coben and Sandford books.The book has a very solid paranormal aspect to it where the heroine is able to see the ghosts of children. The mystery does involve a child, one who disappeared in Bayou country in Louisiana. She moves down there and stays with the family while researching the case as a journalist. It has come to her attention from the family who now want to write a book about the event. While staying with this family she runs into romance as well and that too is a very strong aspect of this book.

"We now have this stored in the center console of our car so either one of us can get to it quickly from our front seats. I have worried in the past about cutting that seat belt off or smashing my window open. Having this product along now has given me some peace of mind on these two issues. Our possibility of needing those functions are low so the manufacturer gave us some other features which are nice extras and means we don't have to wait until an emergency. These are:  a tire pressure gauge, an LED flashlight and a red map light. We're already using those functions even though we picked this product for the emergency uses. I really like that I can use the AAA batteries with it. I am very well stocked with those and prefer them over other options.

"The only detrimental aspect to this product is the price. It is very expensive and I am not used to paying this for shampoo or conditioner. I don't buy cheap shampoo but over $30 is up there in the stratosphere shampoo wise. That said, the product is very nice and does do what it claims to do. It does both shampoo and condition your hair at one and the same time. So one shampoo and you are done and ready to go. But Is it better than the Nexus product line, which I also use? I think they are roughly comparable and the Nexus, while not cheap, is not over $30. So the product is superior but I can't say that I won't buy the cheaper and probably as good Nexus the next time I need shampoo. I should add that my hair is very short and not damaged which lessens my need for constant conditioning. If you have damaged hair, that might make the price more palatable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXIL6ZZTVLFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKLKNJC#wasThisHelpful","R3JXIL6ZZTVLFU","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Julia L-D does my favorite season of VEEP so far here. She is President this season but it will only be for a very short while as she is up for reelection very shortly. Her staff, as usual, is always on the edge of disaster in handling both her presidency and her reelection campaign. Her most competent staff member is her secretary.Every season there has been a surprise guest star. This season it is Hugh Laurie from ""House."" He comes in about half way through until the end and is terrific. Many viewers don't know he spent most of his acting life as a comedic actor before he got ""House."" So he is up to handling the quicksilver comedy of Julia L-D.I first became a fan of Julia's on SEINFELD. There was nothing inept about her character on that show. However, she got to really go to town on the characteristics of shallow and self absorbed. No one will ever forget her yelling at the ""Soup Nazi"", ""Next!"" as she finally got the upper hand with him.Thus, VEEP always falls to her as to whether it will make it or not as a tv show. She is VEEP. Her medium has always been tv. She has done movies and been ok but they never seem to work out long range for her like tv does. Lucille Ball had a similar history in films vs. tv as did Mary Tyler Moore. TV is definitely more tolerant of the aging woman and all three comic actors have richly benefitted from that perspective.As for her staff, Gary is my next favorite. He is the one most devoted to her. He has such huge screw up potential, which he realizes regularly. He and Selina even square off for a heck of a fight this season. But they back down after a sharp exchange because no one else is as devoted to either of them.I also watched the English series upon which this was based. They are very different even though they are both political satires about the ineptness of politicians always trying to satisfy their fickle voters.  I like both series and recommend both series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS093FPQBVK84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVOJTKC#wasThisHelpful","RS093FPQBVK84","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this Linwood Barclay book with the expectation that I'd be meeting characters I'd known before who were engaged in another very fast paced mystery. I was not disappointed. I ripped right through it. We met the lead character in this story in an earlier book. That book all revolved around the woman he was married to at that time. I could barely put it down. This time David Harwood is helping his cousin Marla, who is trying to get over a devastating loss, the birth of her stillborn baby. He goes to her house one day with some food from his mother for her and discovers that Marla has a ""new"" baby. He immediately suspects she's stolen the baby, calls his mother and finds out this is the second baby she's stolen since having the stillborn!With this set up we are off and running because there are twists galore after that. Finding the baby was only the opening salvo in a plot that takes one big twist and plunge after another. That is this writer's strength: plot and pacing. You might find other works which have better developed characters or a more thought provoking theme but that is not why one chooses this book. I picked it for entertainment value and that's what I got.There are some other characters who repeat in here. Derek is the college student who was the baby's father. In an earlier book, Derek had a leading role because he was stuck hiding in a house where a whole family got murdered. He had stayed behind and no one knew he was there. That was also a pretty thrilling book. I would recommend the books he's been writing in this last decade as all pretty good reads in this genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GTRS7LOYI9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472675#wasThisHelpful","R6GTRS7LOYI9Q","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big Denis Leary fan so just tune in to anything he does. As usual, he exhibits great talent here as an almost down and out rock and roller who used to be the front man to the major group. He is now dying on the vine and he can't do anything else. His former bass player who now works with Lady Gaga is better known than he is. He has a great scene with his agent whose clients are all D List. Denis is bringing up the rear on even that roster of clientele.Leary has made it a specialty of his on tv to play obnoxious guys. This is the third series to use that type of character. The first two were ""The Job"" and ""Rescue Me"" as a cop and fireman respectively. He was always the bane of his squad on both shows, the king of misbehavior, albeit talented at what he did. This is that same kind of role. I will say that I miss the days when he was allowed to do vehicles like ""The Ref"". He did not have to play the obnoxious character in that. He was a thief worn down by Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey as his hostages. He's also played some other great roles in movies. In one he was in a mental hospital as a patient yet there was a sci-fi aspect to the tale.And of course his stand up comedy act is always a prime thing but he probably is tired of doing that.Give it a try as Leary is a heck of a talent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZQ0WWDGU99U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GNZWUI#wasThisHelpful","R10ZQ0WWDGU99U","AW3VZ5O895LRK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW3VZ5O895LRK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not watched Martin Clunes play Doc Martin so I saw this without making any comparisons between the two roles. This is a romance between these two characters but there is nothing cloy or sentimental about it. They have their difficulties getting this romance off the ground and they have some considerable misfires. One considerable hurdle they need to face is that he is in the business of death, funerals, whereas she is in the business of life, nurse midwifing. These two are also quite ordinary looking which lends credibility to the series. The acting by both is top notch and they do an excellent job of catching the many nuances of a relationship's taking hold for two people who are deciding to go the long route. If you need this type of show to be glamorous, it may not be for you. Anyone else should love it.

"I love this play and have also seen the stage and tv versions. They are all excellent. But it is hard to beat Walter Matthau and George Burns as the leads, which is what is available in this movie version. They show how truly funny two old codgers can really be. They play two old Vaudevillians, who were comedy partners who cannot get along in their last years. They are in an instant at one another's throats over just about anything. Matthau here is as strong as he was in playing Whiplash Willie (Fortune Cookie) or Oscar Madison (The Odd Couple). Although we got used to seeing him paired with Jack Lemmon, George Burns proves as worthy an adversary in this film. Burns was the former straight man for his ditzy wife Gracie Allen in the early years of tv and radio comedy. He is just as effective with Matthau.

"I was offered a discount on my purchase, and only asked to write a review.  So here it is!I ordered the 42 inch to be a gift for my nephew.  I have a 38 inch waist and it latches on the last hole when I wrapped it around my waist over a sweater and pants.  There is about 3-4 inches of a tail making the 42 inch belt.  I think this is true to size.It feels pretty nice and has solid stitching.  Looks like it will last a while. I will update this review if he says it does not fit or what he finds wrong with it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNK2IJKN0D2O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R9XTJM#wasThisHelpful","RNK2IJKN0D2O8","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered the XXL because I have a 38 inch waist.  It is a snug fit but the main belt does fasten with the velcro.  The extra smaller wings add extra support and snugs it up well.  The images I posted as showing how it really pull in!  The extra curve is actually my lower back view [left picture]; the right picture is mostly the belly angle but you can still see the extra curve it gives.  These pictures are with the band rather snug.  It did not cause any pain and I have full motion while wearing it.  It gives me great support.I did receive a discount to purchase this belt but it does not affect my opinion.  I receive discounts because I write so many reviews, that is all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SCDGPQ9UTZ72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YHRYD6#wasThisHelpful","R3SCDGPQ9UTZ72","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been having a few issues with my ankle as of late -- every now and again when I step on the foot I get a sharp pain in my ankle.  I was offered a discount coupon to get this Aegend wrap and happy agreed to test it and write a review.This wrap is easy to put on as it uses hook & loop [velcro] to secure it when we put it on.  As the images provided up in the product description show, you just fit it on the foot [heel into the hole], wrap and secure on foot, wrap and secure on ankle, cross wrap for added support.  Thats it!I wear a size 8 womans shoe. I think this wrap would work fine for smaller and larger alike. Not sure you can see it in my photos but there is plenty of material to wrap around as well as the cross over straps are long and can secure to themselves if for a smaller foot.It is lightweight and does not hinder me wearing my walking shoes. Oddly, to my surprise, when I wear it, I have not experienced that sharp pain.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  I will keep wearing it and let you know if stops being helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20POCTGVLQF7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016JS3WNI#wasThisHelpful","R20POCTGVLQF7Q","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sort of bags are designed for our convenience in mind and this one seems to do the job it was made for. I was offered this pouch in exchange for a review.  I find listing out what I Like and Do Not Like gets straight to the point.What I like and do not like [ in no particular order] :Like... no zippers... I have had several versions of these sort of pouches and it seems the zipper usually breaks well before the pouch ever does.NOT...  You can see into it!!!!!. I do not like knowing others can see what cash I have around my waist line. So this requires me to use yet another wallet inside of this wallet pouch.Like...Velcor and Zip-loc Technology!  Seals up great!Like... belt has an adjustable Adult size and it is easy to snug upLike... it says it is PVC material... it sure feels good and it looks like it will last a long timeLike, I put it on and stood in the shower... kept the paper inside it dry!Overall, Like this pouch!  I would give it 5 stars if at least part of it was opaque so that I could tuck some cash or credit card without it being in plain sight.

"I received a discount coupon and was asked to try it out and write a review when I was done...so here it is:Simply put, this is a great hose.  If you have never tried an expandable hose you HAVE GOT TO TRY ONE!  They are so awesome! You pull it out, hook it up like other hoses, turn on the water.  Stand in awe as you watch the hose fill up and grow into a full grown big hose!  Use as any other hose.  When done: Turn off your water, depress the water hose handle to let out the water in the line [as any hose] and stand and smile as you watch the hose shrink back into a Baby Hose.  Uncouple from your faucet, curl it up and store it away!It is super light and easy easy easy to use and manage.This hose comes with a spray nozzle, which is a bonus as many hoses do not.  I have been using the hose for couple of months now and it is great!  No dripping or leaking from the nozzle.  No issues with the hose either.My experience with expandable hoses is that... you CAN NOT leave them out in the sun.  OKAY?!  Just do not do it!  And DO NOT step on them when full of water!  haha I busted my previous hose that exact way!!!  Please learn from my mistakes.I have high hopes for this baby that it will be around for use for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TMQOW1YTKME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146CCCPS#wasThisHelpful","R30TMQOW1YTKME","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great headlamp!The headband is easy to adjust but holds well.  Now...this is NOT a fashion statement; however, if you need light in the direction you are facing and need your hands free for other things...this is pretty darn cool!I work on computers from time to time [used to be my main job] and when I need light... boy oh boy is it difficult to get light just where I need it when both my hands are elbow deep in a chassis!I tried to show in the photos the range of light as well as where the batteries go. By turning the dial on the light you can narrow the beam.  Batteries are easy to put in and it is easy to turn the head light on.  One press is ON, Two presses is Flashing, and Three is OFF.Overall a great little light.  I am tucking mine in my tool bag and plan to use it when working in dark spaces as well as when I need extra light when I paint minis!I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

"Simply LOVE IT!Arrived in one HUGE box.  Pulled the seat part out and then the few attachments [ two arms and the screws to hold them on, and the base the chair sits on with its couple of parts].I was able to assemble it in under 30 minutes by myself.  With only 6 steps it was pretty straightforward and you do not need any tools [allen wrench / hex key included].The seat is decent.  It is not a fluffy couch but it is not a back breaker like some chairs.  It does not rock forward but it does go backwards.  I am 54 and I like using a foot stool [ottoman] to help me stay in a relaxed backwards lean [that sounds weird...].Setting up the sound was easy for me.  There are several image diagrams showing various ways to hook up your devices. Since I want to sit farther away from my TV, I chose to set it up wirelessly.  Super easy since they include cables in the box.The chair does REQUIRE POWER... so have an extension cord handy if you are not putting this near a wall.  The ON / OFF button is easy to press; all the controls are on the right side of the seat.After setting it up I just had to put in my Borderlands 2 and play and check out the sound quality.  AWESOME!!  There is even vibration in the chair!  I am THRILLED at how much better my games sound and I feel more immersed! The sound seems to be right there around me...even my cat looks around fast when there are foot steps and other sounds!  So COOL!!!Are there any CONS?  uhhhhhhhhwait....mmmmm  okay, it needs power at the chair?  lol  if that is a con...I mean how else would it get juice?I see some do not like the handles...I have not noticed it as I do not rest my arms while gaming...and if leaning up and put my elbow on it it feels fine to me.  No there is no padding on them, but it is not an issue with me.mmm... okay they could make the seat more yummy to sit in... as in sink down into it like a yummy couch...BAHHAHHAH  well come on, right?  But seriously, I do not experience any discomfort sitting in it for several hours.OH I GoT OnE...... bare legs stick to it!  yes... that is a con... I have to go put on sweats or pants or... cover the seat with something to sit on so my thighs do not stick.  Of course... I think that is common with chairs like this...I mean look at it all shiny and sleek.And OnE MoRe.... the wireless box that transmits the signal to the chair is powered by batteries and does not include an AC adapter... dudes really???  I really think they should include a way to keep the juice flowing freely from the get go without requiring us to hunt down an adapter on our own.Overall.....I am VERY Happy with this chair and look forward to several hours of gaming in it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146QKKTCO70U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031LKYMY#wasThisHelpful","R146QKKTCO70U3","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work great!  Easy to install and hold small TVs and Monitors well [we use them for 24 size].We use them to install commercial on our job sites (AV installations).Since it is just shy of 2.5 inches off the wall, consider that if you need to access ports. This might not be the mount you are looking for.  Also... it only tilts and turns...it is NOT Free Movement.I think this is best for what it was made for...static holding of a VESA mountable monitor/TV close to the wall.If you need something more dynamic [changing the angles a lot or need to access the ports in the rear of your monitor/TV then this is not for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R155580MCA1S3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1FMBQ4#wasThisHelpful","R155580MCA1S3S","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had the pleasure of trying several of the Luseta Sets of shampoos and conditions.  They are ALL heavenly!!!!This Coconut retreat leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.  The smell is soft and faint -- no over-powering aromas, which is wonderful to my nose.  I have very long hair [over 3.5 feet] and I only need about 2.5 - 3 pumps of each to cover my hair.  Any more than that and it seems like a waste.I have struggled a long time trying to save money and used to purchase other cheap hair products from local stores.  I always ended up adding lots of other products to try to get shiny and soft feeling hair.  Overall, I think I have spent more $ over time because of the extra products I have needed to use.  With these Luseta products I find I only need to wash and condition--no additional hair creams or masques needed.

"I have only owned a few vibrators over the years; this is the best one by far that I have experienced.The boxing that it arrived in is discrete and classy--making it a great gift to yourself or someone special.As for its ability, it does the job well! Great stimulation!  Press the button on the end once for low, again for medium, again for high, again and again and it will vary the stimulation pattern.  To shut it off, just press and hold for about 3 seconds.The vibrator has a nice feel to it: not too soft, not like a solid stiff plastic, it is just right. I have tried one that was super soft but it was so sticky everything stuck to it...gross...but not this one!  This one stays clean after washing and does not hold the fibers from the towel.

It was virtually silent from the vibration and barely moved compared to another standard case, which rotated in a circle and made that ""zzzzzzzzzzz"" sound.I think this case would be great for professional who need to keep a phone within sight on a desk but need it to be silent [such as in a meeting].I ordered the Pink; it looks pretty much like the Pepto Bismo pink you see in the stock image.Overall, I like the case as it feels nice in the hand, easy to put on and off, and silences the vibration of the rattling on the phone on hard surfaces.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GC3FTS4YHT9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161WWOX6#wasThisHelpful","R2GC3FTS4YHT9X","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer:  I received these earrings at a discount without obligation, but was requested to write a review if I were so inclined.They came in a nice blue earring box, which includes a small cleaning cloth.  Would make a nice gift box.I put them on immediately and am happy to report that there was zero irritation or inflammation from the posts.The backing to the studs are secure; they have a wide plastic rim that helps balance the weight of the cube stud.I wore them for about 10 hours without any discomfort or irritation and I received a couple of complements on how pretty they were.Overall, I really like these earrings and give them 5-stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RONO1ACG4HRRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA02OJS#wasThisHelpful","RONO1ACG4HRRG","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very impressed with this shaper.  I ordered the 4XL which according to the size chart fits my waist as expected.  Stitching is excellent in my opinion and the material feels wonderful.  The outside feels like Latex and the inside is soft cotton.This one does seem to snug up my waist a bit and looks close to the product images (gives a bit of hourglass going on).PROS:No rolling upNo muffin rollsBoosts up the BustSmooths the back rollsLooks sexy onCONS:It is hooksalways a challenge for me to do upIs a workout to hook up!  haha I guess I really struggle with the hooking part!Frankly, I think it feels great on (once I get it on) and looks GREAT and Sexy!Disclosure: I received this corset without any obligation and without reward.

"WOW AND WOW!I never knew wearing something like this could feel so good.  I have to say, I was impressed when I pulled it out of its bag.  The texture is great to touch and fees just as great to wear it.  This surprised me as I expected it to feel stiff or too restrictive.  This is not so.  now, I did order the 5XL ... I was about a 39 inch waist upon ordering.  I am in my menses at the moment, and just got the corset.  My waist is now 41.  Looking at the chart they provide in the images... I should wear a 5XL or a 6XL in my current state.  But....  i think I should have went down a size to a 4XL.  See, I can easily get the corset on the smallest/closest hooks and there is room to snug it up. So... it is comfortable, but not really ""snug"".  Of course, I am not complaining!  I am just saying, as I lose some weight the 5XL will be too big and I will need a smaller size.  So, for me... I would prefer the snugger 4XL on the largest setting so that I could snug it up tighter as needed or wanted.  And I cannot do that with the 5XL.So, to me, this is a bit larger and I suggest you go a size down if you are on the low end of the size [example you have a 38 in waist and 5XL is for 38-40, that you go with the 4XL, one down, so that the 38 is the wide and you have room to snug it up].  Of course, if you like a relaxed fit... ignore everything I just said!!!  [smiles]PROS:I love the craftsmanship of this corset.Material feels great.Feels good on.CONS:Does not seem to pull in the waist as much as images suggest.Sizing is a little too big for me, I suggest go one smaller if waist is on the small end of the sizing increment.Hand wash only.**I received this corset to test without any obligation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WJJG2CKYIWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R27Q8Y#wasThisHelpful","R8WJJG2CKYIWM","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I seem to need more and more charging cables, I was very happy to be offered a discount to review this one.I really love that the cable is LONG... 10 feet long!  I can now have my iPad or phone charging while I sit on the couch or in bed with ease.In my opinion, every home should have a 10 ft charging cable for their device... there is no way to understand how the extra length can be beneficial until you have one. We do not need them at every USB port as often 3 footers or less will do the trick at the desk or the stand where you walk away and maybe use the Bluetooth so cable length may not be an issue.

"I received this product free of charge with the request to write an unbiased review.First off, watch the sizing as listed in the product description.  The Large wraps around 43 inches, the Medium fits about a 39 inch girth and the Small fits about a 37 inch.  I was happy to get the product to test.  It is really nice material:  feels soft yet has support.  The extra band really helps secure and really can pull in a bit more.  Even the hook & loop part is easy on the skin and is not scratchy.  There is nice strong stitching and overall it is a wonder quality.The label is not in English, but I think the symbols say to wash cool-warm water, hand wash, line dry or lay flat, and do not iron.Overall I really like this support girdle but remember to order the right size for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L9X0PF941O9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGLD5IE#wasThisHelpful","R1L9X0PF941O9K","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer:  I received a discount in exchange for the request of an honest review.What can I say about a washcloth?!??  First off, the are soft but not ""ultra soft"" until I had washed them.  Not a deal breaker...I usually wash towels and bedding before using them anyways.  It measures 9 3/4 inch x 9 3/4 inch after washing and is perfect for both baby and for us adults.  As advertised, the clothes are not scratchy.  There is a silky tag on each washcloth; I do not think they are scratchy at all.I do not notice any smell or any dyes.  The packaging is nice and would be nice as a gift.The only negative is that one of the clothes, after washing, has developed a few threads that look like... a snag.  They might catch on finger nails and thus, I give it a 4-Star, as I think they should not snag.I gave one washcloth to a friend of mine.  She said that are nice, but after washing, hers also shown snags.  She said she liked them being bamboo but would also rate them as a 4-star for that Snag...as she did not like the idea it would catch on the baby's finger.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CVRQLRJNXOG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011J9BYC8#wasThisHelpful","R3CVRQLRJNXOG2","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I find with these, only the piggy and the one toe next to it do not fit fully but at least they are not fully following out either like with other socks.The little grippers on the bottom work well when stretching and doing yoga and I have not slipped yet.Overall I really like these yoga socks.

I use it for my tea as well as for my Bullet Coffee; I am sure you can use it for any beverage that needs mixed.I rinse it off immediately and let it air dry.

"Overall this bag is great, does what it claims, so I give it a 5 Star!There was a learning curve for me.  At first, I thought the bag did not work as well as it stated but after I tried again, I learned how to use it to keep my stuff that is side nice and dry.The Right WAY to use it:Fold it down (roll) it about 3 or 4 times, then... bend that top back away from the direction you rolled it and press together (snap) the .When I do this, air is trapped in the bag and it keeps the water out.  My paper and towels that I used to test it with remained dry.The wrong way:Fold it 3 times or less and or bend the rolled top ""into the folded side"" to snap/clip it closed.I did this first.  Then I laid the bag in my shower.The result of how I had folded and closed it up caused some water to seep in and get the top of my tester paper wet.Now that I know how to fold it up, I am convinced it will work well on my next trip to the beach.Note: I received this bag at a discount and was asked to write an review with my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVG2PDBU1619X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDMZ55W#wasThisHelpful","RVG2PDBU1619X","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hope my pictures come out for you so you can see these them.  The colors are bright, the size is as described.  They are easy to clean and easy to store.  Compared to other collapsible dog bowls, these have a nice solid, sturdy feel as well as a solid plastic rim.  They sort of ""pop"" when you collapse to each level.I have several dogs: large (90 lbs), medium (35-40 lbs) and some puppies that are about 15 lbs. I strongly recommend not leaving these bowls unattended with puppies.  HEHE  I am sure you know why!  As for the medium and large dogs using the bowls, there are no issues that I see. Just as with any bowl, it can be tipped over.  The collapsable element adds to the potential that a side might be pushed down by a nose or paw; however, these bowls compared to a couple others have a strength to them so they hold up pretty well and do not collapse easily.I personally keep two in the house and use them for snacks.

"Great oil diffuser with a small footprint.  Came in a great box that can be repurposed easily (no branding) to be a gift box or used to store other items.  Really like that it has minimal waste.The diffuser looks like the product images.  A warm, soft light is emitted.  I found it odd that is powered via a USB cable...but then I think that is pretty cool as that is becoming more and more my main plug! The plug goes under the unit and there is a small channel on the base so that the cable can run out to the plug.I love that you can gently press the Light button to lighten or turn off the Light as well as you can press the Mist button to alter the set of time it will mist.  The opening for the mist is in the back of the unit on the lid.  I also love that the lid twists on and locks, which helps greatly to reduce possible mess if you bump it while it is full of water.  Another cool feature is that while it is lit, you see the waves of the water within the unit as it mists.  I find that quit soothing and relaxing.Overall two thumbs up!  I found it easy to get out of the box.  It is already assembled with the exception of the power cable being plugged in.  I never bothered to look at instructions.  Just flip it over without water in it and you will see the hole for the power adapter to go into.  Run the cable through the small channel so the cable does not make the diffuser teeter while sitting.  Then twist the top off.  Fill with water.  I used Filtered or Distilled.  I did not measure it but it seems like 1/2 up or so.  Add your Oil if you want aromatherapy. Put the lid back on.  Sit it on a solid stable flat surface near a USB power port (I have mine about 3 feet from my iMac).  Tap on the Light to desired setting.  Tap on the Mist button to desired duration.  Sit back and enjoy!!!!!I did receive a discount for this product without obligation. My review is my genuine, unbiased opinion. This diffuser is solid, well constructed and I like it a lot!  It merits 5-stars as it does exactly what it says it does as well as it is a well-made product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26047VLINYJ1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78XLTW#wasThisHelpful","R26047VLINYJ1B","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love it!Love them, both the roller as well as the hand mitt.  I have small hands, 3.5 inches wide. I have no issues at all with using these.  The nubs are a perfect size for massaging.  The plastic does not feel rough and does not cut into or scratch.  It really massages!I love using it at night time or whenever I want extra circulation in certain areas... thighs, arms, back-boobs, tummy, etc.It feels great to use and I see blood circulation immediately.  Feels wonderful while using it too!I have tried a couple other mitts in the past but they seem to leave a scratching sensation or feel too plastic-y in the hand.  In the end they have stayed in the box under my sink.  This one, i like so much I have it within easy reach and use it daily.I think this is a wonderful set!

"Love these things!Large enough to hold at least a tablespoon of substance such as powder.  Holds small shards of stones or other items well, just need to be small enough to fit into the mouth of the bottle.Cork is strong.  Do not press too keeping into the bottle until you are ready to leave it alone. The cork may chip off if not careful when it is seated snuggling.  I broke off a piece of the cork being too eager to re-open the bottle.  Learn from me, take your time... be patient and gently lift and twist / wiggle.  It will come out without breaking but you have to go slow.The corks hold little eyelet hooks well.  Again, twist the hook in carefully, do not be aggressive or super fast.  Think of it as Art and take your time and you should not damage the cork.  I did not damage any corks; however, I learned my lesson from twisting too aggressively on smaller vials.Ordering another set.  I only bought one set of 24 but after filling them...

I like the plain box as it makes for easy repurposing.Inside you find the ear phones, extra buds and hooks, a short micro cable, and a manual (with multiple languages).  It really looks just like the product pictures.  The green is attractive.As for functions:  Pairing is easy. Came with some charge as well, so it was ready to pair and use for a while.  I paired it to my iMac.... I work from home and am on my MAC most of the day.  I like how I can use these to focus on my music and have the environment noise reduced.  I still can hear what is going on around me, but with the headset it makes it less distracting.On the right ear, you will find the Function Button and the Vol +/-.  I seem to always struggle with ear headsets and their buttons.  I really think it is me...not the device.  I do find the Function button easy to press and it is quick to react.  The Volume buttons work great for changing tracks but... I cannot seem to get the actual volume to change using the buttons.  Not a big deal as I can use the device to change it.  I know it is me... me and my 40-something brain.  heheheCalls are okay and works when you need them to. My friends say they hear me well but it is not like my Plantronics Headset (and I hope not... these are not dedicated for phone calls...so I do not expect them to be as good or better than my $100'ish phone bluetooth earpiece with a boom mic).Overall, I really like this headset. It is pretty comfortable in the ears, pairs quickly, has a long battery and look pretty cool on too.  My review is my genuine opinion.  I received a headset for the purpose of reviewing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NV7JTLR9EWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013QTKCK4#wasThisHelpful","R17NV7JTLR9EWL","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, funny thing, I received the package and after opening it up I was like, uh where are the lights?  hehehe  Silly me!  As you can see in the product images, this strand of lights are super tiny lights!  Super Duper Tiny!  I literally stood there and stared at the coiled up wire and thought, ""wait...what?  These are the lights?"" With conviction that LuckLED was not leading me a stray, I peeled off the plastic from the solar panel and set it outside on the porch.  There is a button that needs to be pushed to turn them ON/OFF.  They worked the first night out of the box and only after a few hours in the sun!LuckLED offers several decorative, solar powered light strands.  I like the extra uniqueness of this strand as it stays in place well (copper cord is bendable) and they are more like stars to me as they are so small.  Love that they are solar powered so I dont have to run electric cords everywhere. Received for an honest, unbiased review. I really like these lights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRCG7EAKQ8SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOOQ09M#wasThisHelpful","R1VRCG7EAKQ8SP","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Super cute and work anywhere you have some sunlight to charge up the cell.  I love that we do not need electricity.  No Daisy-Chain needed with masses of cords where you do not want them.

"Super cool!  I was surprised when I opened the box to find that this globe is quite beautiful. Another amazing thing is how quickly and easily it charges. I have taken pictures to show you the various colors it cycles through.I keep my house on the dark side, so I figured I would have a challenge getting this lamp to recharge.  However, to my amazement, the indirect light that comes into my room is sufficient to charge the solar panel.  However, I think it will be easy enough to move the solar panel to more light if needed.As you can see in the product image, there is a solar panel mounted in a ""lid"".  The lid is a separate piece so you can take it off and set it in the sun.  Also of note, the light has the opening at both ends so you can flip it over to whichever side.This solar powered light is beautiful and would make a great gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SD2GYI3MYKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPJ4M2#wasThisHelpful","R28SD2GYI3MYKF","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solar powered lights are a wonderful design.  Love that I can put them anywhere where sunlight is and not worry about needing an electrical outlet.  Love that they are indoor/outdoor hearty too.  I have not had these long enough to know how well they hold up to the cold or to rain; but they look and feel well built.My pictures do not do them justice, I apologize. The lights look like the images on this page, I was trying to show them lit.  In my test for this review, I like how we have an option to set them to blinking or to be solid.  There is also an OFF setting in the event you do not want them on at all.Super easy to set up and get working.  I left mine out in the sun one day then turned them on.  They worked immediately and perfectly.Discounts for lights provided by eTopxizy for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RALH2YMZ7NFBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011QHLZXG#wasThisHelpful","RALH2YMZ7NFBE","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very surprised to receive the package with the red Ruban wallet inside.  It comes in a very nice gift-giving box and looks very classy.I love the dual color with Red as the main color and white as the accent.  The stitching is well done and feels like a well crafted phone case.  No, it is not leather. It has a magnetic front closure that is easy to use.  Simply push and pull it to get in to hold closed or to open. The wallet does not interfere with the camera, the power port or the audio port.It also comes with a pen stylus.  Pull the cap off to review a ball point pen.  It also includes a screen protector for the front and back of your phone.

"Easy enough to use:  just pee in a  cup or even on the strip (direction on package shows using a cup), Dip the strip in the urine in the cup and then wait 5 minutes, read the results.  No lines at all = Invalid, so redo.  One line = the Control Line is Positive, and Two lines = Negative.I agree with others that it seems more intuitive to see that a Iine on the strip would indicate a positive...that is what a pregnancy test does... line = positive.  So to see that this test uses no line to mean Positive means we need to learn the new interpretations.  And seriously, it is not the end of the world... just re-read the directions and the result indicator.  And when it is important to know if you might register as positive....I think you will take the time to read the instructions and double check the results.Overall, an easy to use test.Given a sample for the purpose of a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KSKF9BXA5TPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYFAKYW#wasThisHelpful","R1KSKF9BXA5TPZ","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update:  Been using the Screen protector for a couple weeks now.I notice that I am ""ignoring"" the bubbles as I no longer focus on them and look past them.  So, I am adapting and adjusting. With additional consideration, I think the main reason to have a protector is to help prevent scratches...as our screens are subjected to possible sliding across things...such as when I put it in my purse or if using it, or it may fall down when the kitty decides to get on my stuff and freak out...causing everything to scatter!I adjusted my review from 3 to a 4-star rating................................................................This is my first iPad screen protection Glass and I am not sure where I stand on it.  Look, I am not about to hit my iPad with a hammer to test this screen for you.  I know... selfish of me...but seriously, I would not ask you to either!  So I wonder, I have survived all these months without a protector screen and then I wonder....just what does one have to do to NEED one of these indestructible things? I mean...what the heck are you doing with your iPAD?????Still on the fence, I got this in an awesome looking display box that says the box contains the ""glass film, a cleaning cloth, a card planning tool, a home key, and a professional screen wipe to welette"". ... uhhh... okay, so no.... as we look at the product description here...we only get what I got .... the screen and a wet and a dry towelette.To install, it seems simple enough but I have to tell you... I have no clue how to NOT get BUBBLES under the screen.  I personally am disturbed by these thumbprint sized air masses that look like smudges...which drive me nuts!  I took the screen off and repositioned it but alas even more bubbles.  I pressed and pressed... and still bubbles.I do like the idea of a screen protector in the event I .... well... I can imagine maybe dropping my cup of coffee ...well wait...no I can't.... okay how about.... I accidentally use my ball point pen on the screen instead of the stylus... nope... I can't see that either... honestly guys... why do we need these???  Are we really not taking care of our stuff?So, I give this protector of the screen a 3 star.... it is ""okay"" because well... it is okay but I personally do not see much of a need for it and I really do not like the bubbles.  My nephew told me bubbles are normal...but I really, really, really do not like them on my screen.I will update my review if I grow to liking in more or find it beneficial.I was given this Screen Protector in exchange for an unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPDRXGQ4PV7CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHSYBRC#wasThisHelpful","RPDRXGQ4PV7CU","AGAJCSST783ZP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGAJCSST783ZP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking forward to using these leg sleeves since my calves have been cramping a bit and I had also received another pair from another company and wanted to see what the difference was.  I thought I ordered large but there is no indication on the sleeves themselves nor on my receipt.At  first I thought, there is no way my huge leg is fitting into those.  As you can see in my photos they are snug on my arm. I was not even going to try to wear them but changed my mind when I sat down to write this review.  I was going to tell you that they are small and tightbut . I decided to give it a go and see how bad it would be to see if my leg would even squeeze inside.To my amazementand I mean surprise they pulled right on!  There is a bit that stays under my heal though, I think that is due to my leg not being that long.  In the stock product image they snow it fits from knee to top of ankle.  It fits me from knee to below ankle. and unfortunately even though it feels pretty good on the calf as you can see in the photo, it makes my feet all swollen up.Sadly, this sleeve does not do well for me.  it may be due to me receiving the wrong size but I cannot confirm what size I ordered (which is very strange).  They do wash well I used cold water and line dried.  The stitching is excellent too!They are strong, flexible, and made of breathable material.

"Crayolas Color Alive Easy Animator Studio app has been a big hit at my house over the weekend. My daughter has spent over 10 hours in the last two days coloring her characters, animating them, and making the scenery in which they live. So the iPad Crayola Easy Animator app gets a 5 star review. The problem is that I will give this product on Amazon a 3 star review, not primarily because of deficiencies but because it adds only very little to the free iPad app.Let me explain why you dont really need to buy this at all to play with it. The box contains the following items>1.A coloring book with characters and backgrounds2.Retractable crayons3.a stand for your iPad4.A character to do stop motion animation in the appItems 1-3 are really pointless. You probably already own crayons. You can print the coloring sheets from the free iPad app. The stand to hold the iPad adds very little. We just hold it.So basically you are buying the character which you can mold to do stop motion animation. The app itself has a bunch of pre-made movements for the characters (either imported that you color or remade) can do. With these pre-made movements you can string together a movement series and provide voiceovers.The stop-motion mannequin is a great ideaand remember it is really all that you are getting in this package that you cant get for free. However, it is very buggy. If the lighting isnt perfect the different markings to indicate which block is which and how it is oriented do not register on the iPad appropriately. And even still with much help given to my daughter, the iPad still cannot accurately ascertain the position of the mannequin far greater than 50% of the time.In my opinion, just download the free app, print the sheets, and play. I would not recommend spending the money on this physical set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T3C6BX95EQZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V101JDU#wasThisHelpful","R1T3C6BX95EQZC","A22S7D0LP8GRDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22S7D0LP8GRDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a juice alternative this is pretty good. There is a subtle and not overwhelming fruit flavor. However, in my opinion it is far too sweet. It is sweetened with erythritol and stevia.

I personally do not like it but everybody else in my family really does, so I'm giving it four carbs.When I dilute it 2 parts PACt and 1 part water it is better as the flavor and sweetener is muted a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ULX3KEU6FDJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSC3B4O#wasThisHelpful","R2ULX3KEU6FDJG","A22S7D0LP8GRDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22S7D0LP8GRDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is classic battleship with a Star Wars twist. Instead of hunting ships on the sea, each side is either the Rebel Alliance or the Empire hunting enemy starships. The concept is a winner in our household where my daughter absolutely loves Battleship and all the kids (and adults) are huge Star Wars fans.This should have been a homerun. How could you go wrong with Star Wars and Battleship?Well, the implementation is cheap and pretty poorly thought through:1. The starships sit above the peg holders. This makes it so that it is really hard to put the pegs in place. We are always knocking over the ships. It's pretty frustrating2. Many Battleship games include two separate boards so that each player can sit it on his/her lap. In this one there is only one game board, so you have to actually work hard not to accidentally see the other player's ships.3. The stickers to apply to the board are difficult to apply correctly. Forcing us to put these on just adds to the ""cheap"" feeling.This game could have been awesome. Surely Hasbro has figured out how to perfect Battleship through the years. I've played versions of Battleship that are very well done. In comparison, this version is frustrating to play and feels cheap. The only reason I'm not giving it two stars is because Star Wars is so cool. For implementation of the classic Battleship game this deserves one or two stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VFQSVWUQ379/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCL6#wasThisHelpful","R39VFQSVWUQ379","A22S7D0LP8GRDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22S7D0LP8GRDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chocolates of this quality are not an everyday treat. These are incredibly high quality, well-presented, and super good chocolates. You probably already know the Cailler name, and these live up to the name. Opening the box is an elegant experience, which would certainly make this a well received and special gift. Once you get through the wrapping paper to the main box, you encounter an airtight plastic seal that certainly contributes to the super fresh taste and feel of these chocolates. And once inside, the chocolates look, feel, and taste gourmet.We were able to avoid the melted-chocolate plague (even in Arizona in October) that has plagued so many others. But we also were able to get the box inside immediately upon delivery. I would not recommend you order these to a place where the box may end up sitting outside or in a mailbox.

"You know when you wrap a towel around your waist so you can walk around without showing everybody your nakedness after a shower? Then you know how just when you pick up something with both your hands your towel inevitably comes lose leaving you standing their in all your glory in front of God and everyone? Well, with this, those days are no more.Basically this is a waist wrap. It has velcro and holds securely around your waist. I use it after taking a jacuzzi or swimming in my back yard. I can slip my shorts off and let them dry outside. Then I can continue to dry off with a towel or clean up outside without my swimsuit or walk inside without dripping all over the floor and not have to worry about holding onto my waist towel with one hand. For me, for this purpose this is perfect.This is NOT a towel. If you are expecting to use this as a towel and then wrap it around your waise you will be disappointed as it is not designed to nor does it function well as a towel.But then again, a towel never functioned super well as a waist wrap. So this lettle thing fills in the gap in between, letting a towel be a towel and not have to leave you naked when you try to use it as a waist wrap. The amazon page should not say ""super absorbent"" as if to communicate that this thing is a towel. It is not thick enough to be an effective towel.I honestly do not understand the bad reviews.

" 0:19 MinsMy kids and I have been having a blast with these Bag Toss boards and bean bags. They are truly well constructed. My 50-pound, 4-year-old son has stood on them a number of times without them breaking (I do not recommend this and am actively working on training him not to as I'm sure it will eventually break), so the boards and stands are not flimsy.The game itself is simple and you probably know it: Throw the bean bags into the holes (or at least try to get them on the board). It's a fun backyard game for kids or adults just for fun, but particularly at bbq's, carnivals, or family get-togethers. I've included a short video of my kids playing with it so that you can get a sense for what the game looks like and how the bags interact with the boards.I'm not sure if I got a newer version of this but my experience is very different than many of the reviews:  1. The kickstands are made out wood and seem plent thick and sturdy for long-term use.  2. The boards velcro together and have handles for easy transportation and storeage. This is very nice as even the bean bags are stored between the boards making this a self-storing, easy-to-transport set.  3. There are 4 bean bags of each color (blue & red). There are some reviews that say that the bags just slide right off the boards. This is not my experience. My kids play from pretty close but I've thrown from 30 feet. In all scenarios I end up with plenty of bags on the boards. The holes are just the right size to make it hard but not impossible to get a bag in the hole.In my opinion the price point that it is currently selling for on Amazon is appropriate. They are well designed, well made, easily transported. Highly recommended","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZYQBEZ5GGRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EAU9Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1WZYQBEZ5GGRM","A22S7D0LP8GRDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22S7D0LP8GRDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is a word game that is simple enough for an early speller to figure out (great for 3 and 4 letter words) but that can be complex enough for a Words-With-Friends, Scrabble addicted logophile like me to get into.Basically it is like a simple scrabble, build words sideways and up-and-down, but you can stack letters ontop of other letters changing the words.If you've already played Upwords, you know the game is fun.

"These paper towels are very similar, if not the same quality of the Sparkle paper towels that are sold at the grocery store. The sheet size is about 3/4 of a large sheet. I actually prefer the paper towels that are perforated at 1/2 the size because there is less waste. Regardless, these are a good value and the packaging is great for a business. If you are using them in the bathroom for hand drying I'd stil recomend finding a different brand, like these viva paper towels, Viva Vantage Paper Towels, Choose-a-Size, Regular Roll, 6 Count (Pack of 4) because I think most people would only use one of the half sheets to dry their hands = less waste and less trash can emptying. If these are for clean-up the packaging may proove to be convenient. I really appreciate that each paper towel is wrapped seperately to keep them clean.

"Super fun game. Kids can use this just to play catch by bouncing the ball to themselves or others. But adults can have an absolute blast with this especially on the beach with sand, playing a sort of volleyball/catch to one another. It's flexible in use and unique.When not on vacation, it can be stored pretty compactly, but even used inside or on the grass. Our kids (4 & 7) can play with it without assistance indoors without making a mess, but it is best outside where you can run, jump, and dive for balls.Setup was a bit difficult, sort of like setting up a trampoline, which involves getting the net attached to all the bars and then stretching it tight. This limits the ""storability"" in that it can take 5-10 minutes to set up each time you'd want to play it after taking it apart to store.The worst part however, is that the plastic is pretty flimsy. In less than 2 weeks, one of the plastic pieces cracked and the set became totally unusable. It just went to the dump this morning. It's sad because with a little higher quality (better plastic or metal) this would be a very fun set. I don't suspect that anybody will get much more than a few months of use out of this.

"If you have atrial fibrillation (or really any other regular cardiac arrhythmia) you should probably own this monitor. Instead of just looking at your heart rate, this is a full ECG monitor to guide your doctor's treatment of your atrial fibrillation.I specialize in anesthesia for electrophysiology focusing on the treatment of atrial fibrillation. When patients have an AliveCor and make regular use of it, it helps us so much to know what we are trying to fix. Any time a patient has the symptoms they feel, they can take an EKG on their own and we can see if the source of the problem is the heart rhythm or something else. This guards patients from getting unneccessary ablations and medications, and it can also guide our clinical decision making on what treatments to provide.I've had several family members and friends with arrhythmias (irregular rhythm). I have recommend the AliveCor to every one of them. And I have one of my own just in case I ever have any questions about my own heart rhythm.This device is so easy to use. It pairs up to your cellphone (Android or iPhone) and can take as many EKG's as you want, and you have the ability to save them or email them to your doctor. You can also have AliveCor send the EKG to a specialist to read for you.

"I've put these all over my home for whole-house audio and perfect wifi throughout. When I built my new home I ran cat5 cable to most rooms. The airport express can easily hook into those CAT5 cables (all running from a switch at the Network Box) to extend the wireless network. Furthemore, each of these rooms can then have it's own Airplay speaker. So now, I have 12 different airplay speakers throughout my house, allowing full house audio from my MacBook (or just play the audio to whichever room I want).The Airport Express sets up in less than 60 seconds using an iPhone or iPad (just look for it on the wifi setting screen) and autoconfigures to match the main base station. Setup could not be easier. And once it is setup it extends the wifi network so that the wifi connection is just as fast in that room as it would be if you were standing next the base station. Basically I have full power wifi throughout my home. If you don't have a CAT5 (ethernet) connection in the room you want to put this in, it can just as easily function as a wifi extender. This isn't quite as fast, but works quite well as long as it can get a good signal from the basestation unit.

"This three pack including 9 gels total is the best value I'm aware of for purchasing replacement gels. It is possible, as other reviews have indicated to prolong the life of your gels with alcohol-based cleansers. Nevertheless, you will eventually need to replace the gels for maximal results (recommended is 20 sessions).These replacement gel pads work well. I haven't experienced the problems that the other reviewers speak of with the gels not adhering to the belt appropriately. I purchased direclty from Amazon.com.

"The Slendtone alone will not make you ripped, give you a six-pack, or make you skinny. However, as I have looked at the research it seems pretty conclusive that at the very least, regular use of the Slendertone will give you more abdominal muscle strength, endurance, and tone. I base this conclusion on my initial results from using it and published research. If you want to read for yourself, search for at least the following 3 articles which clearly demonstrate that this is a legitimate method to strength and tone abs:  -""The effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on abdominal strength and endurance and core strength"" (Olsonl) -""The Effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Training on Abdominal Strength, Endurance, and Selected Anthropometric Measures"" (Porcari et al) -""Electrically elicited minimal visible tetanic contraction and its effect on abdominal muscles strength and endurance"" (Alon and Taylor).I use the Slendertone each night. It is not painful to wear, but when used appropriately, I know it is working. I intentionally set the output pretty close to my maximal tolerated, and at times I have to stop what I'm doing as my abs contract vigorously. I end each session aware that I ""worked out"".  I have had a few hard cramps especially initially or if I do a double session. With each stimulation, it is easy to see the abs tighten. In short, this actually works my muscles out. I have found that I can tolerate and benefit from two sessions each day, one with the belt placed lower on the abdomen and another with the belt placed higher.Unlike the studies cited, I do other abdominal exercises, yet I have noticed that since started the Slendertone my abs do feel more toned during the day (my wife agrees) and I have more endurance for ab exercises. That said, just as no single abdominal exercise will give you six-pack abs, this could be one part of an overall diet and training regimen to help increase ab strength, endurance, and tone.The pads can be placed on the belt to accomodate a variety of waist sizes. My wife and I share, so for my the pads are probably a bit more medial than is optimal (losing some of the lateral stimulation) and for my wife they are just a bit too lateral. But we can both feel contractions throughout. The only downside to sharing is that if you want to progress through the recommended regimen, you will have to change the settings manually. But this is not a problem, and even if you don't adjust settings between people, it will only mean that you increase strength a bit more quickly than you otherwise would.The belt has 99 different strength settings. I have found that as time has passed and I got more used to the contraction sensation and less prone to cramping, I can tolerate a higher level of stimulation corresponding to both more discomfort and a harder contraction. The buttons are very easy to learn and control. The manual is well written and easy to follow.The stimulation pads need to be replaced about every 20 sessions or so. The best deal I have found is buy the three pack of pads on Amazon: Slendertone Replacement Gel Pads for All Slendertone Abdominal Belts, 3 Sets (9 Gel Pads). Each set at the time of writing this review is about six bucks, which makes each session about $0.30 if gel pads are changed at recommended frequency.Overall, I am very very happy with my Slendertone and plan on using it for as long as it works. This is a proven way to increase abdominal strength, tone, and endurance. I enjoy and have benefitted from using it. Thus, I recommend it.  If I get any more insight as the months go by I will update the review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6DC3TSTCFA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9M76A0#wasThisHelpful","R2K6DC3TSTCFA1","A22S7D0LP8GRDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22S7D0LP8GRDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had my AeroPress for a couple of weeks. Here are my impressions off the top:WHAT I LIKE:1) The tactile element. I start out by grinding the beans with a hand grinder, then press them through the AeroPress, using muscle power to control the speed at which the water is pressed through. The design makes me feel involved in the process.... like the difference between opening a can of soup and heating it up in a saucepan, and making it fresh from your own ingredients. The main appeal of the product to me is actually that it's fun to use.2) The price. Most people would find it affordable.3) The filters. Coffee filters can be one of your main expenses if you make your own coffee every day. AeroPress filters are about a penny apiece, and if you rinse them out (as the manufacturer recommends), you can reuse them a dozen or more times. I use mine five or six times before swapping them out.WHAT I DON'T:1) I grew up drinking piping hot coffee that was almost too hot to drink (yup, I drank coffee as a kid), and still like having it that way once in a while; you won't get that with an AeroPress. You can do things to make it hotter (press out a very distilled batch then add boiling water), but it still won't be super-hot, or as high quality. Then again, real coffee connoisseurs wouldn't have thought much of the super-hot coffee I drank when I was a kid.2) If I'm having some friends over and want to make them all coffee, it's not going to happen with an AeroPress. It's really a one cup at a time device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17RZDCEX2CQ0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GXZ2GS#wasThisHelpful","R17RZDCEX2CQ0Q","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use blenders mainly for making butter coffee, also known as bulletproof coffee (blending hot coffee, MCT oil, butter, cream and a little vanilla extract).  I bought this blender to replace an old Black and Decker model that had given me a few good years of use before giving up the ghost.When using my old blender, I would fill the glass food container nearly full, push in the top to secure it, and push a button to start the coffee blending.  I figured this one would work the same way.Well... not quite.I noticed when I took this one out of the box that they had made two design changes:1) in my old blender there was a replaceable rubber gasket in the blade assembly, which could be removed for cleaning. In the new design, the gasket is built into the blade assembly and can't be removed or cleaned. This is fine, it actually seems like an improvement, because the old style gasket could get moldy easily, or could get lost after disassembling for cleaning.2) I also noticed that the black plastic top (which covers the glass food container) seemed much flimsier when I pulled it out of the box.... not like the top of my previous blender, which seemed more solid and durable.So, I tried it today. Here's what I experienced.1) I put in the ingredients as usual: hot coffee, coconut oil, MCT oil, butter and cream and vanilla extract.2) I put on the lid.3) I pushed a button to start it blending at low speed.4) The top of the container went flying off, spraying oily coffee all over the kitchen.  The hot coffee, steam, and force of blending was too much for the friction holding on the container top.The solution is obvious, now that I know about the problem: Hold the top on with one hand while pushing ""go"" with the other. (Or leave the hole in the top open, covered by some napkins, so the steam can escape.)  The main point though is that the new top is not as secure as the old one, because I didn't have to take either of these measures with my old Black and Decker blender.. the stayed in place come hell or high water.  The top of this one is noticeably cheaper and flimsier, so does not stay in place as well.Still, the other design change (getting rid of the gasket) is a good one. So I'm happy all in all, so far.  I've used it for about a week, and have not had any problems yet.

If I buy it again I'll give it a good shake before using it.The ""DHEA for Men"" product contains saw palmetto; I'm not sure that this is a necessary addition.

"Most vitamin C nowadays is made in China. Considering China's frankly horrific quality control and history of product contamination, many people are understandably cautious about buying products from that country.Quali-C is produced in Scotland, by one of the longest-established manufacturers of synthetic vitamin C.  It's a good alternative for people trying to avoid Chinese products.  It's the L-ascorbate form, which most researchers recommend taking instead of the D- form used in cheaper supplements.I'd like to close by addressing a couple of questions that people often post in response to supplement reviews:1) Quali-C is synthetic. Isn't it better to take natural vitamin C?  Answer: Generally, yes.  To get natural vitamin C, just eat an orange or some berries. But if you're taking a large amount on the advice of your doctor or naturopath, you will by definition be taking a synthetic product. (Genuine ""natural"" vitamin C can cost FIFTY TIMES MORE than synthetic!)2) Isn't it better to take ascorbate, than ascorbic acid?  Answer: Yes, but unfortunately, most manufacturers use the two terms interchangeably on their labels.  (Those selling ""ascorbate"" will often label it ""ascorbic acid"" as if there were no difference.)  So you can't necessarily tell what you're getting from whether the word ""acid"" appears on the label.  The important thing is to ask whether you are buying the L-form, or the D-form.  Synthetic L-ascorbate acts just like natural L-ascorbate in the body. The ""D"" form is the one you want to avoid, whether the label calls it ""ascorbic acid"" or not.In sum: Quali-C's vitamin C supplements are the L form of vitamin C. They are free of contaminants. Quali-C is a highly respected company.  If you need to take more vitamin C than could be found easily in food, I recommend this product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KM4DSI2XMVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNS1E0W#wasThisHelpful","R8KM4DSI2XMVX","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Part of the problems with ""Assassin"" is that the premise (a killer robot hunting down humans) has been done much better, many times, in the years since the movie was made. It's pre-CGI, and low budget, so you can't blame it really for having poor special FX.  But even as a period piece, bearing in mind what was and wasn't possible when it was made, it's a major flop.The production values are poor. The resolution is very low.  The print is so dark in places that it's often hard to tell what's going on.  It was made for television and it shows: the scenes seem designed to be viewed on a small television screen, with a preponderance of closeups and medium shots.  The audio sounds like it was made for television too, from the days when TV sets had poor sound systems and tinny speakers. Assassin was made in the 80s but has the feeling of early 70s television, like an overly long episode of some show like Six Million Dollar Man.If the story was interesting it might still be worth watching, but it's dull and lackluster, a thriller with little or no suspense.  Scenes come and go without advancing the plot.  The robot wanders around killing people we have not had a chance to get to know or care about. Or trying to kill them.  The ones it does kill are such bland bozos that it's not sad to see them die.  In one scene it picks up a woman and spends the night with her.  She giggles and implies they had sex all night.  But the scene, the sex and the woman have nothing to do with the story and none of them are ever referred to again.  They appear to be filler to make the movie last the required number of minutes.The narrative is predictable and gives us no real reason to care about any of the characters.  Even the fact that it's a robot turns out to be irrelevant. It's a robot that shoots people. But so what? Is it worse to be shot by a robot than a person?Here I should stick in a ******** SPOILER WARNING******** for anyone who keeps watching all the way to the end:SPOILER 1: The robot dies at the end. (Surprise.) However, the hero doesn't kill it.  In fact he doesn't end up doing much at all. I couldn't really figure out, by the end of the movie, why he had even been in the film.Spoiler 2:  After killing a bunch of boring guys and trying to kill some other guys, the robot  gets stuck in a room but can't leave because the door gets stuck, so it's locked in.  That's all. It gets locked in a room.  This apparently is too much for its high tech sophisticated humanoid killing machine brain. It does not do anything a human might do in that situation, such as finding something in the room to break down the door (or break it down itself... it was shown punching through a few walls and breaking through a locked door earlier.)  Instead, it gets wigged out and starts spinning around in circles making an irritating high pitched sound, then blows up. (It may have just felt like exiting the movie, and blowing up was the easiest way to do so.)If you can watch Assassin for free as part of Amazon Prime, just to blow some time when there's nothing else to do, Assassin should work for that; otherwise I'd skip this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRL29EHNF7EF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00534XT0G#wasThisHelpful","RRL29EHNF7EF0","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a box of these out of curiosity because they were on sale.  I like a number of Mercola's products, including the Cocoa Cassava bars (which are fantastic, though high in carbs), so I thought I'd try something new.  I was looking for a snack I could take with me on the road, that's healthy ready and in an instant; these do fit the bill.Having tried a couple of bars, I would say: They're pretty good. I gave them 4 stars, but my actual rating would be 3.5, if that were an option. They're better than okay, but not spectacular.WHAT I LIKE:1) They're not too sweet. I don 't like the overly sweet taste of a lot of protein bars (and breakfast cereals and other odious snacks).  The sweetness here is like that of a mild wafer such as a scone.2) They have a good balance of protein and carbohydrates (14 grams of protein, and 21 grams of carbs, minus 5 grams of fiber). Oh, and they have 9 grams of fat.  The macronutrient breakdown is similar to that of a glass of milk. If you like the 4:3:3 balance of carbs, protein and fats recommended by regimens like the Zone Diet, these are close to ideal.3) The ingredients are mostly organic, another plus.WHAT I DISLIKE:1) The taste.  The peanut butter flavor is mild and in the background; the main taste, as far as I can tell, is tapioca.2) The texture. They're dry, not moist, and actually kind of hard to get down. The problem may be that since they're not appetizing, they don't stimulate much saliva.  So I'd recommend having some water or another beverage on hand ready to help wash them down.SUMMING UPIn sum, I'm not crazy about them, and likely won't buy them again, but I do like some things about them.

"Like a lot of kids in the sixties, I grew up reading MAD magazine. My parents bought Newsweek, Time, and the Saturday Evening Post; I bought MAD.  I liked how it poked fun at and deflated everything from movies to Madison Avenue.  I recognized even as a kid that MAD (the magazine) was a tad formulaic and predictable, but it was still worth buying and reading.I learned later that MAD (the magazine) was the descendant of MAD (the comic book), a wilder and more freewheeling publication which had broken ground in the 50s, and had played a part in changing both comics and the world beyond comics. The first few MAD comics had a frenetic energy and a dark and sometimes violent undercurrent that were only hinted at in the magazine it would develop into over the years.  MAD the comic was not ""safe"" like the later magazine; it was crazier, more subversive and more revolutionary.  The early stories seemed fearless, and even a little scary.  They were funny and incisive and anything but polite.  I read them years after their original publication as reprints, admiring and enjoying the crazy energy of the satirical comics and articles, and appreciating the hints of social commentary under their acerbic veneer.I didn't realize till years later that the stories I was enjoying in reprinted form, drawn by some of the most brilliant comic book artists of the period, were expressions of the creativity of a single man, Harvey Kurtzman.  Kurtzman's work in MAD transformed comics in the early 1950s; and in this well-written and well-researched book, Bill Schelly makes a case that Kurtzman's influence went far beyond comics, to have an influence on popular culture in the United States.  If you like Lenny Bruce (and his progeny), or Woody Allen, or Saturday Night Live, or almost any contemporary comedian, you can thank Kurtzman -- because, according to Schelly, he created, or popularized, the style of humor most modern comedians rely on.  It's a provocative thesis that's explored and reinforced nicely in this book.Harvey Kurtzman: The Man Who Created MAD and Revolutionized Humor in America is a detailed and fascinating account of Kurtzman's life, struggles, and creative ventures.  It's an incisive portrait of the the man and his work which includes, but goes far beyond, his involvement in the early MAD comic book, and is rightfully receiving attention from reviewers far removed from comics. It's a genuine work of scholarship that works on several different levels, and explores both Kurtzman the person, and the connections between Kurtzman's creative impulses and the transformations that were occurring in both popular and personal culture in the United States in the decades following World War Two.Bill Schelly's book is both a good read in its own right, and an important work of scholarship detailing the life, battles, and working methods of a man whose work had a profound influence on popular culture in ways that may not be immediately obvious. I recommend it for anyone interested in history, comics, popular culture, or the creative process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLONBHHYSIJV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1606997610#wasThisHelpful","R1WLONBHHYSIJV","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find it astonishing that Madison Avenue has convinced people that products like this smell ""fresh"" or ""nice.""  They have a terrible chemical stink.  I opened one of these bags in my car and had to open the windows while driving to try to air the smell out.  Products containing synthetic perfumes are bad for the people who use them and terrible for the environment and human health.  They will stink up your house if you use them. In my case, just a few-minute exposure was enough to trigger a migraine. The scent clings to clothing, hair and furniture.  There are web pages devoted to brainstorming solutions to get the horrible smell out of items that come in contact with them. (Do a web search for ""Fabric softener Begone"" or ""Removing horrible Febreze smell"" or ""Febreze Carcinogenic"".)

"First I should say, I like PS. I find it relaxing, and it helps my short term memory.  There's evidence that it may protect the brain and keep it working well as we age. When I'm stressed, it's a blessing to have around.  I've tried several brands (NOW, Jarrow and Country Life), and like most of them.I also like Jarrow's products as a general rule. Their soy-free PS in gel caps is my favorite kind.So when I saw that Jarrow PS was available as ""Yum Yums"" (gummies), I thought, what the heck, it sounded fun...  I was running low anyway... why not buy some in this form, and see if I liked 'em.  I know they're aimed at kids and parents - at least the design on the bottle seems to be.  But they could be a fun way for adults to get their daily PS, too.WHAT I LIKE:1) They're effective.2) They're fast acting (I can feel the effect a few minutes after chewing them (or letting 'em melt in my mouth)... faster than I do when swallowing them then waiting for the gel caps to digest).TWO CAVEATS:1) My first caveat is that they're too sweet for my taste, like biting into a liquid sugar cube.  I know this is how most gummy supplements are, but  I'd be happier if they were about 1/10th the sweetness.  It also bothers me that the sweetness comes from sugar, not all that good for the teeth.If Jarrow's reading this, I have a request: come up with a PS gummy made with stevia or xylitol.  (Lots of people avoid products with this much sugar because they're high in sucrose and high in carbs.)2) Since some people are buying these for their kids, I would recommend caution. I can picture a little tyke eating a bottle full of these because they taste like candy.  If you buy them for young children, don't leave them out where the kids can get into them.  One or two a day might be beneficial, but I doubt that a whole bottle would.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTOUVX2HW2WW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG5BSZI#wasThisHelpful","RYTOUVX2HW2WW","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The X-Men have had a number of incarnations.  The first was in the 1960s, when Lee and Kirby came up with the premise (a school for fledgling superheroes who had been born with unusual powers), and created the original characters. The series ran for a few years then fizzled out, and was replaced with reprints for about 1/3 of its print run.Several years later, Len Wein, Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum collaborated in reviving the book, which was retitled Uncanny X-Men.  They threw out several of the original characters, brought in some new ones, and took the narrative in exciting new directions.A couple of years later, Cockrum was replaced by John Byrne, who helped shape the book visually and was instrumental in co-plotting the series through some of its most seminal issues, including the original Dark Phoenix storyline.Byrne is a skilled writer and artist, as he demonstrated in his work on several major comic books over the years, so I had high hopes for X-Men The Hidden Years, which he had almost total control over.  So I have to confess that I was a little disappointed, not by the art or storytelling, but by the writing, which is not Byrne's best.Byrne's artwork is wonderful, clear, beautiful and vibrant, on par with his best work on Superman/Man of Steel.  Tom Palmer's inking, assisted on some pages by Joe Sinnott, is also wonderful.  But the stories in this book feel like a kind of pablum compared Byrne's work on titles like Fantastic Four and Superman, which he also wrote and drew.Those stories were compelling and had depth; the characters felt real and three dimensional. The ones in this book are fast-moving and have some clever elements, but by and large are not in the same league.The main problem is that things drag.  There's a lot of action but very little character development -- a problem that plagued the original X-Men series, because the characters and their relationships were inherently dull.  Uncanny X-Men had the tension between Cyclops and Wolverine, and the troubled love story between Scott Summers and Jean Grey/Phoenix to make it compelling; this book, like the first X-Men series that fizzled, has a lot of nice characters being nice to each other issue after issue.  That's all well and good but it means any drama has to be external, and not affect the characters on a core level.Of course Byrne was constrained, restricted by the (already published) stories on either side of the continuity gap this series tried to fill.  But he could have revealed more about the characters' lives, pasts and personalities.  It's hard for a reader to stay interested when there's not even a remote possibility of character development or change.Another problem is that the dialogue is a little stodgy.  The characters tend to stand around talking about and explaining things we've already seen.  We see Iceman leave the team for a while, and we see why.  We then see other characters talking for a page or two about the fact that he's left, and speculating about his reasons for leaving, which were made clear at the time.  We see the Angel fly a dying character up into the sky; the character thinks he's taking her to heaven.  All well and good, but then the other characters have a little conversation remarking on the fact that he's just flying her into the sky, not really taking her to heaven. Which we just saw. It's not that the scene is bad, but the dialogue is redundant, tells us things we already know, and should have been trimmed.  Byrne could have used a more active editor to deal with moments like these, because they do drag the book down after a while.The result is what I'd call ""X-Men Lite""... stories with a lot of action and color, but a dearth of emotional substance.  If the series had continued I expect Byrne would have realized this, but it ended after the 22 issues reprinted in this volume and in Volume 2.On the plus side, both books do work as an homage of sorts to the previous writers and artists. The layouts remind me of some of the most innovative page and panel compositions of Neal Adams. Tom Palmer's inking is still extraordinary after all these years. Even Joe Sinnott drops by to lend a hand.If you don't mind the repetition and lack of character development, these stories can be fun to read, and nice to look at.  John's come a long way as an artist; his work on a visual level in this series is extraordinary. I hope he'll return to comics soon with a series where he can show his strengths as a writer again.  He is a wonderful one, on the right series, when he's free to surprise readers and make changes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROTWOR44QZTNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078515969X#wasThisHelpful","ROTWOR44QZTNN","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT I LIKE:Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a supplement that more and more people are becoming aware of.Tests have shown that it helps with memory and cognition, making it particularly useful to those of us in our middle years or older.It's important to note, however, that the tests showing its effectiveness were done years ago using bovine PS derived from cows' brains, which are naturally high in DHA. Patients with memory problems showed dramatic improvement when taking it.Unfortunately the kind used in the early tests is no longer available in the U.S. due to fears of  mad cow disease.  The kind found in supplements is derived from plant sources, a similar but not identical product.  Most supplemental PS has two problems: 1) It's made from soy, which is high in phyto-estrogens, and 2) It's missing DHA, because it's made from plant sources rather than bovine brains.This product (Conjugated Phosphatidylserine with DHA) solves both problems:1) It's made from sunflower seeds, not soy.2) It's been bound to DHA from fish oil, making it much closer to the type that occurs naturally in the human brain.  In theory this should make it more easily absorbed, and more like bovine PS in its effects.I've been taking it for about a year and a half, and have found that it helps my mood and memory, and is also effective against inflammation.  Of all the DHA products I've tried, I like this product and one made by Jarrow the best. (I usually take them together, actually.)CAVEATS:I sometimes find myself feeling a little sleepy after taking PS, particularly with large doses. If you do take large doses (more than 200 mg/day) I recommend spreading them out over the day (or taking it in the evening, when you're getting ready for bed.)ADDENDUMS: The manufacturer (Swanson) sometimes offers this product at a substantial discount (such as two for the price of one) on their website. I'd love to see the two for one price available on Amazon. You can take Swanson conjugated PS by itself, or for even more benefit, throw in a couple of fish oil capsules, another excellent source of DHA.  Salmon oil or krill oil are both excellent additional sources of DHA. Side note: PS is also available from food sources, including egg yolks, lecithin, some types of mackerel, and navy beans. If you're on a budget,you might try first adding more egg yolks to your diet.  But if you can afford it, supplementation is also a good way to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMXXG5KJ4J5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEPYXSC#wasThisHelpful","R1GMXXG5KJ4J5B","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT I LIKE:It's organic... no chemicals, no sprays, no toxic junk.It's comfortable. The material is soft.It's affordable: ten bucks for an organic cotton shirt. (The price varies by size; that was the price of the one I purchased.)I normally buy ""L"" (not XL) shirts. I ordered this on in XL because ""large"" was not listed as an option.  It fits fine... a little loose, but again that's because I normally buy a size smaller.All in all my impression so far is that it's an excellent product.  I'll be looking for other products from this company.WHAT I DISLIKE:If I run into any problems with this shirt down the road, I'll update this review. But at this time they're nothing to dislike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5VP4ZSAG0LG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C228IG2#wasThisHelpful","RL5VP4ZSAG0LG","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I avoided watching this for a few months because I didn't expect to like it.  I expected a campy and pointless remake.  I was surprised at how good it was.The 1980s version was fun, but made little attempt to be believable.  The action in it had a cartoonish quality, which was appropriate at the time.The 2014 version is grounded in this century's political and social realities, as well as a few decades of advances in robotics. I wouldn't say it's a realistic view of the future, but in some respects it may not be far off. The lead character's reaction when he finds out his human body has been replaced by something inhuman is one of the more disturbing moments in the story -- he wants ""out"" but there's nowhere for him to go.The writing, acting and directing are all excellent. The characters' emotions are real, and the character development as the movie moves along is thoughtful and low-key. There's  a undercurrent of political satire and social commentary which many viewers will appreciate.So why so many negative reviews? I think it may be because a lot of people tuned into the movie hoping for a mindless action/adventure, a live action cartoon with cardboard characters like the original.  If you're looking for that, this version will seem a little slow in places. But if you're looking for a thought-provoking story, I expect you'll like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ELNX9M199Q9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQFXODY#wasThisHelpful","R1ELNX9M199Q9T","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What I like about this product:1) The softgels are small and easy to swallow.2) The company has a good reputation for quality control.3) I find that when I take astaxanthin, my eyesight improves and I can spend more time in the sun without burning. (Astaxanthin alone doesn't improve my eyesight, but taking it along with lutein, another natural antioxidant, does.)4) The bottle came with a coupon for a second (smaller) bottle of astaxanthin.  I know this is a promotion, but it's a generous one, and I do appreciate it.What I don't like:1) In addition to astaxanthin, the softgels contain two ingredients that I normally try to avoid: carrageenan (an emulsifier which a lot of people have become wary of recently) and sorbitol (an artificial sweetener).  I'm not sure why the sorbitol, in particular, is needed, since we're not chewing the capsules, just quickly swallowing them.  I would encourage the company to phase both additives out in the future.2) The plastic bottle.  This isn't so much a complaint about this company, but about all of the supplement manufacturers who've gone in this direction. I remember the days when all supplements were routinely packaged in glass, which is becoming rarer and rarer. Plastic, even hard plastic, is semi-porous to air, so supplements packaged in it won't stay fresh as long as those in glass bottles.  And plastic can leach into food products including supplements over time.  So if anyone from the company is reading this - I and many people I know would gladly pay a little more for glass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E64S8JFAM67G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2GBIU4#wasThisHelpful","R3E64S8JFAM67G","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been taking B12 shots for the past few weeks, and found them to be beneficial.  I started looking for an alternative because:1) Shots are expensive.  (The ones I've been getting from my naturopath are $15 each. That adds up!)2) B12 may be ""natural,"" but needles aren't.  Something bothers me about the idea of trying to fortify my health by jabbing a sharp metal tube under my skin and giving myself an injection.3) They can hurt, if you inject them in an area that has a lot of nerve endings.3) With needles, there's a possibility of infection or complications.4) Many injectable formulas contain cyanocobalamin, not necessarily the best kind of B12 to take.SO WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?If you don't want to take B12 shots, you might consider:(1) B12 capsules and tablets (typical ""vitamin pills"" designed to be swallowed and digested)(2) B12 tablets (sublingual; designed to dissolve under your tongue)(3) B12 liquids and sprays (sublingual)(4) B12 patches (transdermal; the vitamin is absorbed through your skin)(5) B12 creams (also transdermal) (such as this one)The problem with item 1 (typical B vitamin pills) is that if you're not absorbing B12 from food, you're unlikely to absorb it from a tablets and capsules which, like food, end up in your digestive tract.Items 2,3,4 and 5 are all intended to bypass the intestinal tract (like injections)  so in theory could result in better absorption.My experience with item 2, sublingual tablets, has been uneven.  When I feel anything, it's a quick burst of energy that fades quickly.  The ones I like best are the B12/folic acid/B6 tabs from Trader Joe's.  But again, they're made from cyanocobalamin. And their effect doesn't seem to last.I've also tried item 3, sublingual liquids and sprays, but have not felt the same benefit I get from shots.B12 patches (item 4) are a popular alternative to injections. Some people like them a lot.  But they can sometimes come off as they rub against clothing, or when taking baths or showers.  And they're pretty pricey -- over $2 per patch, on the average. This is less than the cost of an injection, but still adds up. The cheaper ones have a reputation for not staying on, and for staining clothing and skin.This leaves item 5, B12 cream. Creams, like patches, deliver their product transdermally, through the skin. They're not patches, so you don't have to worry about them staying on.HOW THIS PRODUCT WORKSThe cream goes on pretty much like any hand lotion. The insert recommends rubbing it into the wrists, so I've been doing that that way. I roll up my sleeves, apply the cream to one wrist and rub with the other. There are visible blood vessels in the wrists, visible just under the surface, so I assume it's going rapidly into the bloodstream, when applied this way.The cream is a light pink in color (all B12 products have some ""red"" in them), and has a very faint fragrance, almost undetectable.  Initially it's very visible on  your skin, but if you rub it in again a few minutes after applying it, it won't be visible anymore. It feels a bit like applying a thin film of soap to the skin.One nice thing about this product, Vita Sciences Maxasorb B12 cream is that it contains methylcobalamin, which many people prefer to cyanocobalamin.MY EXPERIENCEMy first impression (on day 1) was of a jolt of energy.  It felt as effective, and even faster acting, than the shots I had been giving myself.  The second time I used it (day 2), I noticed a milder energy boost.  It may be that my body was lower in B12 the first time, so the cream had a more noticeable effect. Still, I did feel something.  All in all, my impression is that it works well, works quickly, and is an effective product.  For those looking for an alternative to injections, it's worth trying.CAVEATSThe first time I pressed the dispenser, a tiny chunk came out. Apparently this is what was stuck in the dispenser.  The second time, I got a large ribbon of cream. The third time, a big blob. The next couple of times, more ribbons of cream. It may be because the container is new; hopefully it'll settle into giving the same amount in each dose as the days go by.  If I run into any other problems, I'll update this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S5090OPD9J7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2THMAW#wasThisHelpful","R3S5090OPD9J7K","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these out of curiosity. (They were cheap, and I was looking to increase my B vitamin intake.  So I figured, what the heck.)LIKES:* They're sublingual. They're designed to dissolve under the tongue, which bypasses the digestive tract.  In theory, more of the vitamins could end up in your bloodstream.* They're affordable (though of course, the cost of shipping also needs to be considered).  Many supplements nowadays are prohibitively expensive. These are a great price.* They include a good dosage of most of the key B vitamins people people are looking to supplement.DISLIKES:* They're low in vitamin B12 (they contain only 6 micrograms per tablet). And the B12 they did include is in the cyanocobalimin form, which, according to some sources, is not well absorbed.  These would NOT be a good choice for people (such as vegetarians) wanting to increase their intake of B12 (unless you also take the B12 product, as mentioned above)* The taste isn't very pleasant.  (I'm not saying all sublinguals need to be sweet, but these are pretty harsh.)NOTE:* The company that makes these also makes a ""no-shot"" vitamin B12 supplement, which is also sublingual, and has 1000 micrograms of B12.  So if your goal is to increase your B12, you might buy it along with this product.In sum, I'd say these are a good idea, and I appreciate the low price, but they would be improved by working on the taste and adding more B12 to the formula.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNEZGJYQK4SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VR6XV4#wasThisHelpful","RYNEZGJYQK4SZ","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHY I TAKE ASTAXANTHINI've been taking astaxanthin on and off for the past few years.The first thing I noticed was an improvement in my eyesight.  When I'd look up at trees (without my glasses on), I could see the individual leaves clearly and distinctly.  Usually they'd be a blur.  The same is true about reading fine type in a book or on a computer screen. When I don't take astaxanthin, my eyes can get bleary after working at my computer all day, making it hard to read sometimes. If I take astaxanthin when my eyes get bleary, the words and images on the screen or in the book are clear and easy to read again.  The effect is particularly striking when I take it along with other eye nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthinThe second thing I noticed was that I wasn't getting sunburned. I have a history of burning easily. When I take astaxanthin, I can work shirtless in the hot sun for a couple of hours without getting anything than a mild reddening. Without the astaxanthin, I'd be burned to a crisp. This wasn't an immediate effect, I'd been taking astaxanthin for about a month before I noticed it.HOW TO TELL IF THE ASTAXANTHIN YOU ARE TAKING IS REAL OR FAKE.Fake supplements are a big business. Some companies make counterfeit products and sell them online.  Astaxanthin is easy to fake -- some companies just put red food coloring in the capsules!  Here's how to tell is your astaxanthin is real or fake. This information is rewritten from an article on the Algae World News website:1) TEST IT IN SOME OILAstananthin is lipid soluble (i.e., it dissolves easily in fats and oils). Cut a capsule open and drip some of the liquid inside into a cup with some cooking oil in it. Stir it gently. If the oil in the cup turns red, as the product diffuses out into the oil, it's likely real. If it doesn't, it may be fake.2) TEST IT IN SOME WATEROil and water don't mix. So if you're trying to find out if it's really oil in the capsule, cut a capsule open and drip it into a glass of water. Real astaxanthin will spread out on the surface of the water like an oil slick on the ocean... i.e., it will NOT mix into the water. If it diffuses easily into the water it's probably fake.3) TEST IT ON SOME WHITE PAPER. Does the color change?Drip some on a piece of paper and put the paper in bright sunshine. If it's real astaxanthin its color will fade  in about 24 hours, and may get slightly greenish (from cholorphyll). If it's fake (red food coloring in a capsule or gel cap) it won't fade and won't turn green.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R252PXGWNIYZ8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006X1DCVO#wasThisHelpful","R252PXGWNIYZ8K","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover of this volume is beautiful; it's a classic Wally Wood drawing, nicely colored and beautifully printed.  It's what made me decide to buy the book (just as Wood's covers used to induce me to buy the Thunder Agents comics when I was a kid).  I'd love to have an oversized, full color poster of the cover image without the lettering.... I'd buy it :)The interior artwork is nice, though I had mixed feelings about the story choices.  Wood worked with lots of pencilers, some of whom (like Dan Adkins) were a little static.  I would say that's true about most of the layouts in this edition; the characters' poses are static, without a lot of life. (Pencillers like Ditko had more dynamic compositions, but were not included in this book.)  I loved Wood's artwork when I was a kid, and was somewhat in awe of it, so it was a nostalgic rush to see it again in this volume.  But it also confirmed my feeling that Wood did his finest artwork in the 1950s, about ten years before the ""Thunder Agents"" days. I'd love to see more volumes of his artwork from that period.I expected this book to be shrink-wrapped. It wasn't.  I'd have been happier as it was, as shrink-wrapping can protect items from scuffing and other damage during shipping. It actually arrived dented, because it had been shipped in a padded envelope with no further protection. I called Amazon, thinking I might return it, and they offered me the choice of returning it, exchanging it, or a partial refund, which I accepted.The printing in this edition is nice, a step above the printing in DC's Thunder Agents archives. The pages are about 10 percent larger than the pages of the original comics they came from.  The paper's durable and slick. Wally would have been pleased, I think, to see his artistry showcased in this manner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZSWD15GLWPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613779542#wasThisHelpful","RVZSWD15GLWPJ","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this product, and like Starwest's approach.  It's an innovative idea to sell pure powdered enzymes in bulk, in sealed airtight bags, instead of putting a tiny amount into a capsule or tablet then selling it for a greatly inflated price.I bought two products from this company: Bromelain powder and Papain powder. Both ae high quality. They arrived packaged in airtight foil packages.

"I take powdered papain along with powdered bromelain -- a teaspoon of each in a glass of water  in the morning, a half hour before meals -- because both enzymes have been shown to be effective against intestinal parasites.I bought both from this company (Starwest botanicals).

They don't have any taste at all.I like the powders (such as this one) because they're pure, and are much more affordable, for the amount you're getting, than most papain supplements. Most ""chewable papain"" supplements are mostly sugar, with a little bit of papain, so it's hard to imagine them being very effective either in helping digestion or clearing out parasites.

"Dietary collagen and gelatin products are said to be good for:- firming the skin, and reducing wrinkles, when taken internally (evidence of this is mostly anecdotal, but many people swear by it)- strengthening hair, toenails and fingernails- healing UV skin damage (this claim has been verified in studies in which mice were fed gelatin, rich in collagen, then exposed to UV light).- killing candida and restoring gut health, when taken internally.  (Recent studies have verified that gelatin is 100 percent effective in preventing candida from adhering to the intestinal lining, thus preventing candidadiasis -- and that collagen, a gelatin product, is 68 percent effective at preventing adherence.)  (Amazon reviews do not allow links to external websites, but to read about the studies, Google the phrase, ""Gelatin fragments block adherence of Candida albicans to extracellular matrix proteins.""Some people don't like using collagen because some brands smell like gelatin (which, to some people, smells like wet leather).

"I like this product. I've been taking it for a couple of weeks, and will likely buy it again.I like the wide range of health-promoting ingredients, though it would be nice if they'd indicate how much they're including of each one.  The way the label lists them, it's impossible to get a sense of relative quantities, because they're broken down by category instead of ingredient.  Still, I like what's in it and what's not. Unlike some ""greens"" powders, it's not stuffed with cheap filler ingredients like ground flax seeds.I love that the product is packaged in glass, rather than plastic.  Kudos to the company for that decision.Some people have commented negatively about the taste.  I actually kind of like it.  I should clarify though that I don't like sweet foods.... I find sour and bitter flavors more palatable than overly sweet ones. My favorite foods are plain, unflavored yogurt and kefir, and ""bitter"" vegetables like like broccoli and curly parsley, eaten raw without flavorings. This product has kind of a harsh taste that some people (like me) like, but others have a hard time getting down.If you have a hard time with sharp or bitter tastes, I'd recommend starting with a small amount of this product till you get used to it.  I would NOT recommend mixing it into sweet smoothies, at least not in large amounts, because it overpowers the taste of the blander ingredients.  You might try putting some into a little cup of water, gulping it down, then chasing it with more water. Or  try mixing it with a little tomato juice or mixed-vegetable juice (instead of sweet juice).  I personally like it plain, mixed into some water, but again, I kind of go for the bitter taste.While I like this product and will buy it again in the future, I was bothered by some of the text on the label. The point of the text about organic seems to be to make people doubt that the ""organic"" label is valid.  Instead they've come up with the word TruGanic. Their website states that ""...all TruGanic sourced ingredients are either certified organic, wildcrafted, or naturally grown, without pesticides/herbicides.""I appreciate the intent behind this, but it's odd and seems a little disingenuous that they don't indicate which ingredients are which.  It's simple enough to put a little asterisk or something beside the name of each ingredient, to let consumers know whether it's certified organic (which has a very specific legal meaning), or ""pesticide free,"" (which, again, is a very specific claim), or just ""naturally grown"" (which is vague, and has no legal meaning).  I wouldn't buy a product labeled ""naturally grown"" in a supermarket (because the term has no meaning), so I'm surprised to find it used here. Still, this is a minor issue. I'm happy with the product and do like using it.I found the label difficult to read.

"IMPORTANT NOTE: BUY THE KIND IN THE WHITE BOTTLE, NOT THE BLACK ONE.Amazon recently intermixed the reviews for two different PS (phosphatidylserine) products. Both are made by Jarrow, and Amazon sells both of them.  I can see why Amazon was confused, because the labels are virtually identical.  However, the products are NOT equally effective.  Combining the reviews has confused a lot of people, and has also resulted in some people ordering the wrong product. (I did it myself recently, and had to call Amazon to cancel the mistaken order.) The labels look the same, and the reviews are intermixed, but the product inside is very different.The only way to tell them apart is from the color of the bottle.The Jarrow PS100 in the BLACK BOTTLE is  NOT the one I am recommending. It's from genetically modified soybeans.  The capsules are large and hard to swallow. They contain a brown powder which is not very effective. I have to take three or four of them to get the same effect as the other product, described below.The Jarrow PS100 in the WHITE BOTTLE is made from sunflowers, not soybeans.  It is  NOT genetically modified. The gel caps are small and easy to swallow.  The product is easy to absorb, and very potent.  This is the product I am recommending below.WHY I TAKE PS* I started taking PS a few months ago, when I was dealing with high stress and had high cortisol levels, making it difficult for me to relax and unwind.* Taking it made an almost immediate difference.* Months later, I still find that when I'm stressed, I still find that PS relaxes me.  I feel like it calms my mind without sedating me.* When I take it, I feel better; I sleep better, and my short term memory seems better.* When I miss a day or two, I start noticing the same old short term memory problems:  I'll go into the kitchen, then forget what I went in there for.  When I take it, this seems much more rare.  It's not that the PS caused the problems; I was experiencing them before the PS; it's that the PS seems to make my memory sharper and clearer, on days when I take it.* When I take PS at night, I tend to wake up the next morning feeling more refreshed than usual.* It's one of the few supplements I consider essential.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS FORMULA:* This formula (in the blue/gold container) is made from sunflowers, not soy (so, no GM residues.)* It comes in soft gels, not capsules.  They are smaller and easier to swallow than capsules.* I feel the effects sooner when I take the soft gels, than when I take Jarrow's other PS formula (or other companies' products) in gelatin capsules.* Because it's so more effective, I need less of it to get a beneficial effect. So the gelcaps are more economical also, in the long run.CAVEATS AND CAUTIONS* On Jarrow's website and elsewhere on the web, it says that this product (in the gel caps) should be kept REFRIGERATED after opening, to prevent it from spoiling.  I wish this was made clearer in the Amazon ads. People who buy a bottle and stick it in a warm cupboard for a couple of months are probably taking a lower potency product as a result.* PS (of whatever type or brand) is most effective when taken with a source of DHA.  PS was originally found in cows' brains, where it's naturally conjugated with DHA, and the lab studies that showed how much it helped with memory, were done with that type.  But then due to fears about mad cow disease, it stopped being sold in that form.  Unfortunately, most PS supplements, including this one, do NOT add in the DHA.  My recommendation is to take a gelcap of PS with a capsule of fish oil or krill oil, both of which are high in DHA.  Or you could take it along with a product like Conjugated Phosphatidylserine with DHA (my second favorite PS product). I like taking the Jarrow and Swanson products together for maximum benefit.Though normal amounts shouldn't have this effect, taking a large amount of PS may make you sleepy. For a while I got into taking several PS capsules a day... we're talking 7 or 8 caps of PS ... and found myself feeling ""dozy"" during the daytime hours and needing to lie down a lot.  This improved when I cut back on the dose.  My current approach (which is working better) is to take a gelcap in the morning with a little fish or krill oil, then take a couple of gelcaps at night (when it may possibly help you get a good night's sleep).IN SUM:Great product, highly recommended. Just make sure that if you're buying Jarrow's PS, that you get the kind in gel caps, not the powdered stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRS070KKU331I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013OXA90#wasThisHelpful","RRS070KKU331I","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, I love these.  Sardines are a near-perfect food, naturally high in CoQ10 and animal-based omega 3 fatty acids. But not all ""sardines"" are created equal.  Some are large, and higher on the food chain. The ones in this product are small and very low on the food chain, which makes them very low in pthalates and other pollutants that accumulate as we move up the chain.  Besides which, they're delicious. I love them sauteed with a little white rice and some vegetables.One reviewer wrote that the ones he bought were dry; this has not been my experience.

"I've bought tower ceramic heaters before from other companies; I thought this one would be similar (just pull it out of the box, plug it in, turn it on, and enjoy the heat). It wasn't. The box should say ""assembly required.""For starters, the base is not attached and the awkwardly designed pieces, which do not snap together cleanly, need to be held together with one hand while screws are inserted then screwed in with the other.  This sounds easier than it turned out to be in practice.I suppose if I had assembled a few of these previously, it would have gone faster.  But it took a good 40 minutes to find all of the pieces, figure out how they snapped together (they don't fit neatly or easily), find a Phillips screwdriver with a small enough head, line up the plastic parts with holes that needed to be felt rather than seen, and screw the cheap, brittle, easily damaged screws into cheap, brittle, easily damaged plastic.The screws warped and tore when I tried to turn them with the screwdriver. I wasn't turning the driver with great force; they are just very poor screws, like ones you might find ""100 for a dollar"" in a dollar store.  The plastic on the product's base also tore where the screws went in crooked.When I finally got the base on and the screws in, I stood it up and turned it on. It emitted a strong unpleasant small, and made a rattling noise as it worked.  Usually that happens because the fan is seated poorly or has come loose during delivery, a problem that can't be fixed the the consumer.In sum, this product is:- poorly designed- unusable out of the box (assembly is required, which is not the case with most heaters);- difficult to assemble- and the one I bought had a bad smell and a loud distracting fan sound.It's hard to see why anyone would want to buy it.I have to wonder, did Duraflame test these at all with consumers before selling them?  If so, it's hard to believe they wouldn't have tried to fix the problems, or start over from scratch.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RGOBO0VF7UEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4CASEC#wasThisHelpful","R2RGOBO0VF7UEW","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is well-designed, easy to use, and works well to control moisture.  It also helps control odors related to humidity and moisture.  As moisture is absorbed from the air, it drips down and fills the bottom of the container.  When it's full, it's time to throw it away.I have one in my living room, one in my office, one in the bathroom, and one in my van (braced so it can't tip over when the vehicle is in motion).Not surprisingly, the one in the bathroom fills up with water fastest.  But even in the other rooms, and the van, a great deal of moisture is sucked out of the air.The only thing I didn't like about the product I bought was the old orange/blue label, which was, well, ugly (bordering on fugly).

"SERRAPEPTASE - 120,000 SPU CAPSULESDAY 1: 10/12/14I have chronic sinus congestion, and noticed this morning, to my surprise, that my breathing cleared up about 20 minutes after taking this product.I was surprised by this effect, because I've taken serrapeptase before without noticing anything similar.  When I took it in the past, I usually took one or two 40,000 SPU capsules (for a total dosage of 80,000 SPU). Today I took two 120,000 SPU capsules (for a total dosage of 240,000 SPU.) The larger dose is what appears to have made a difference.I should mention that I was not taking serrapeptase alone.  I took it in water along with some other enzymes, on an empty stomach.  (I don't take proteolytic enzymes with food, I take them an hour or so before eating.)  I take the other enzymes regularly, but have not noticed them helping my breathing.  It was the addition of serrapeptase that appears to have made a difference.After noticing the clearer breathing, out of curiosity, I typed in ""serrapeptase mucus"" in my browser, and found some web pages and videos saying that others have experienced this effect.  One Youtube video by John Gray talks specifically about the effects of serrapeptase on mucus and congestion.  Just google the name of the video if you'd like to watch it: ""Serrapeptase reduces inflammation and mucus in the body""As Mr. Gray points out, ""When you have mucus in your gut, fungus can grow in your gut.""  So clearing out mucus could have beneficial effects for people trying to clear up fungal infections.I'll keep taking it and report back in a few days, but my initial response is, I like this product.ADDENDUMS:1) I took more serrapeptase later in the day, and did not notice  the mucus-thinning effect, maybe because I'd eaten some food not long before.2) I noticed this at the end of the day that my vision suddenly seemed dramatically clearer.  When I look at the edges of letters I'm typing on a computer screen, they appear crisp and clear, not blurred as they sometimes do.  This totally surprised me.  I like reading in bed but sometimes have a hard time doing so because my eyes aren't up to it.  At the end of Day 1, I found, to my total surprise, that I was able to read fine print with less light. I'm typing this on my computer.... I would usually blow up the lettering to a large side to read more easily, but I can read it fine using a very small font.  The serrapeptase is the only thing I'm doing differently.So -- two effects so far, both of them unexpected and remarkable.(Later note: DAY 2: my vision is still crisp and clear, and I'm reading a very tiny font with no problems on my computer screen.)(Later note: DAY 3: my vision seems back to normal today. (I can read small print but it's not as crisp/clear as it looked on Days 1 and 2)I should emphasize that (1) I am taking serrapeptase with some other enzymes (NOW Super Enzymes); and the clearer breathing and eyesight did NOT happen when I took serrapeptase at a lower dose.  Some people, like Ray Sahelian, recommend taking a very small dose; but when I took a small dose, it didn't have any noticeable effect.SIDE EFFECTS:On Day 1, I noticed some itching on my arms about two hours after taking it in the morning.  It lasted ten or fifteen minutes, then faded away.  When I took serrapeptase later in the day, it didn't have this effect.I also noticed some belching in the evening on Day 1 ... a by-product of the digestive process I guess. I think it was because I hadn't drunk enough water during the day.  With the enzyme doing so much inside of me, I'm going to need to remember to increase my water consumption.DAY 9: 10/21/14I've been taking serrapeptase for the last nine days. I usually take a couple of capsules of SP along with olive leaf extract and another enzyme supplement with water in the morning, then once or twice during the day.  I still feel that it's beneficial, and, I think, it's gradually clearing up a chronic sinus condition.  My breathing is clearer. I was exposed to a cold a few days ago, but didn't catch it.  I believe the supplements I'm taking are helping.DAY 32: 11/3/14Still taking serrapeptase, and I still feel like it's helping me.  I'm not I can explain or justify why I feel that way  I usually take 6 or 7 capsules a day on an empty stomach, (2 or 3 in the morning before breakfast; 2 or 3 at night; and sometimes a couple during the day.)As an experiment, I tried dissolving the content of a capsule in my mouth once.  I do NOT recommend doing so.  After about ten minutes, I had a burning sensation in the back of my throat.  I'm not sure why... serrapeptase is only supposed to dissolve dead tissue... but it felt like it ""burned"" my throat, which felt a little raw for a couple of days.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YSZ749QBOOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QW3GCI#wasThisHelpful","R24YSZ749QBOOP","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT I LIKE:* It's more natural than most vitamin C supplements. Most are synthetic; this one is derived from food.* Because it's more natural and is made from acerola berries, the vitamin C is presumably in a more absorbable form.* I like the idea of taking supplements in powder form, not tablets or capsules, and like that you can just mix this in juice or water.* The glass bottle. It's a high quality dark brown glass which protects the product inside from light, which can damage supplements.* The taste is okay. Not terrific, but not terrible either.WHAT I DISLIKE:THE LABEL:Products should be labeled clearly in a way that is easy to read and understand. This one is not.  Most of the print on the label is small and white against a multicolored background, making it a challenge to find the simplest information. I needed a magnifying glass and lamp to understand it, and even then there were parts I couldn't read.THE PRICE:What matters when buying powdered vitamin C isn't the price per bottle, but the price per gram.According to the label there are 302 mg of vitamin C in each serving, and 31 servings per container. The serving size is 1.5 teaspoons. This means there are only 9.3 grams of vitamin C in the entire bottle.  The very cheapest I've found this product on Amazon is $17.17.  $17.17 divided by 9.3 means you are paying $1.85 per gram.Let's compare it to another product available on Amazon: Nutribiotic Ascorbate Bio-C Powder  (which is pure vitamin C, no acerolo berries).  A 16 ounce bottle costs of Bio-C powder costs about $22.00.  Each teaspoon contains 3000 mg (3 grams) of vitamin C. There are 181 teaspoons in the container, which equals 543 grams. The cost of Bio-C powder is $0.04 per gram.Would you rather pay $1.85 per gram, or $0.04 per gram? Healthforce may be a wonderful product, but you are paying almost FIFTY TIMES MORE for it than Bio-C.I can understand natural products costing more than synthetic, but the price difference here is astronomical.THE INGREDIENTS:This product contains maltodextrin, a sweet-tasting white powder often used in processed foods as a thickener or a filler. (Maltodextrin is a partially hydrolyzed starch used as a bulking agent in artificial sweeteners.) Opinions vary about whether or not it's healthy for the human body.NOT FOR MEGADOSESIf you're goal is to take a large dose of vitamin C at an affordable price it's not going to happen with this product.  Some people, for example, like to do a periodic vitamin C ""flush"" in which they clean out their intenstinal tract periodically by taking large doses of vitamin C. I do this myself at least once a month. I usually end up taking 20 grams of vitamin C when I do a flush. This costs about 80 cents when I use Bio-C, and I only have to take a few teaspoons full.  It would cost almost $40, and I would have to take TWO FULL BOTTLES of Healthforce Truly Natural Vitamin C to take that much vitamin C using this product.CONCLUSIONSFor people who just want to add a little vitamin C to their diet, the amount they'd get from a glass of orange juice,  this product should be fine.  But for people who want to take large doses of Vitamin C, it's not a good choice.  So whether it's the right choice for you would come down to why you're taking it and how much vitamin C you want to take.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLJO9N76JRO7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EYPSB8#wasThisHelpful","RLJO9N76JRO7A","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Dead Like Me came out, I liked it so much that I set aside time to watch it every week.The first episode was great.  The concept was promising. The casting seemed perfect. It's still hard to imagine anyone else playing the lead character, the slacker reaper, George.As the weeks passed, problems became apparent.  There were interesting elements in every episode, but other elements that  dragged the show down.  It's odd that the writers couldn't see the problems, because viewers could, and bailed on the show in large numbers as a result.What worked about the series were the relationships among the ""undeads,"" particularly George and Rube. The actor playing Rube brought an intensity that was the perfect counterbalance to George's apathy.  The revelations in the final episodes about his character and his family, particularly his daughter, were nicely crafted and beautifully acted.What ruined Dead Like Me were the seemingly endless interludes dwelling on George's family.  In a typical episode, we might see George's mother argue with her sister about what to wear or what to have for dinner; watch George's mother be caustic and nasty to her father; watch George's father look morose and wander off; watch George's mother sell her house; watch George's sister steal toilet seats and deny that she was stealing them; watch George's sister make lunch; watch George's sister try on makeup for the first time; watch George's sister stop using makeup; watch George's mother have an affair; watch George's father have an affair; watch George's mother and sister move into a new house; watch the family's dog get sick; watch the family's dog get hit by a car; etc., etc., etc. Most of this had little if anything to do with the episode's main story arc. It became a tedious kind of filler, truly difficult after a while to keep watching.It's one thing for the characters to be trapped in an endless kind of purgatory; it's another thing to ask the audience to endure it, week after week, when it's clear that it's pointless and going nowhere.  Audiences bailed, and I'd say this was the reason.  So Dead Like Me died young, like its protagonist. So it goes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1XHA80A1X4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JF02QS#wasThisHelpful","R3A1XHA80A1X4D","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT I LIKE:* Some reviewers wrote that this product wasn't sweet enough for them.  I have to say I was surprised, because in my experience, if anything, it's overly sweet.  I used a whole teaspoon in a smoothie, and it was waaaaay too sweet for my taste.  Even a half teaspoon is sweeter than I like. I'd recommend starting with 1/4 teaspoon of this product, as the bottle suggests.  You can always add more if that's not sweet enough for your taste.* It does not affect blood sugar.  Again, some people have disputed this, but my experience has been that it's safe in this regard.  This is important to me because I'm hypoglycemic. Sugary foods (high in sucrose or fructose) can literally kick me into insulin shock. I've never had that happen with stevia.WHAT I DISLIKE:* There's something about the flavor of stevia that puts me off. It's nice when I want to add a little sweetness but I'll never be a big fan.* Stevia is often promoted as a health food, but I'm not sure this is accurate.  (Even soy was once thought to be a health food, but most people have now realized it's not.)  It does have effects that go beyond adding a little sweetness.  In some countries stevia is used as a form of birth control. This isn't an issue for me - no plans to father a child - but if a food affects your reproductive system that dramatically, it's worth asking if it might also be having other effects you're not aware of.  In any case, you should use it with caution if you're trying to get pregnant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYVC38PO7N1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E5E3LW#wasThisHelpful","R2GYVC38PO7N1D","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's odd to find someone selling AppleWorks 6 in 2014. It hasn't been updated since 2004, and is not designed for today's Macs. It's a shame, because it was reasonably good software in its day.If you bought your Mac in the last year or two, don't bother buying this software. But if you have an older Mac you *may* be able to use it.Case in point: I have a Mac Pro which can't run Appleworks.  It's an older Mac Pro, circa 2009, using the Snow Leopard operating system. I was able to install Appleworks on it but it crashes frequently and creates conflicts with my other software. So I've found it by and large unusable on that machine.  This was a little irksome because I have thousands of files written and formatted in Appleworks, and had no way to open them after it stopped working on my Mac.Interestingly though, I was able to install it and use it without problems on my Macbook Pro laptop, which I bought in 2010.  The MacBook Pro is also running Snow Leopard. I'm still using it successfully on that machine.If you do decide to take a chance on it, before you will be able to install it, you would first need to install Rosetta (which used to come as part of the older Mac OS.

The child actor who plays Ethan was particularly well cast.The second episode was pretty good.After that, it went downhill rapidly.The concepts are good, and the production values are excellent.

"An excellent product.It has a good balance of l-ascorbate and electrolytes, from a trusted company.  It dissolves nicely and tastes okay - i.e., it's not overly sour like some ascorbate powders.Some buffered ""C"" powders taste like chalk, because the calcium in them is literally made from chalk.

"I bought a case of these on sale, hoping and expecting to like them. They're coconut water, and are USDA organic... what could go wrong?Well... sorry to say...1. These are not pure coconut water.2. They are reconstituted. The question is, what kind of water is used to dilute  the concentrate?  Is it ordinary using tap water, which tends to be full of fluoride, chlorine, and dozens of other contaminants. If it's filtered or distilled, I expect they'd say so, since that would be a selling point.  I don't drink tap water at home; why would I want it in my coconut water?3. The small print says the flavor is ""enhanced"" with ""natural flavors"" which the Coco Libre website says are from ""fruit and vegetable sources."" Which fruits? Which vegetables? Why not identify them?  What if they're ones people are allergic to, or trying to avoid? Are the fruits and veggies used to make the ""natural flavors"" organic, or GMO?4.

"The directions said to take 1-1/4 droppers full to get 50 mg of zinc.  But what's a dropper? Each time I tried filling the dropper that came with the bottle, it filled to a different level. Sometimes it filled almost to the top, other times it only filled 1/4 of the way.I finally ended up taking a nearly-full dropper, which I poured into a spoon and swallowed. I have a cast iron stomach and rarely get sick from foods, but in less than three minutes I was in the bathroom leaning over the toilet, sure I was going to vomit.  I almost did, then the feeling passed. I still feel queasy (twenty minutes later, as I'm writing this), but I don't think I'm going to throw up.After this experience, I got out a magnifying glass and read the (very) small print on the label. The very-small-print instructions said that because it's so concentrated, you should:1) NOT take it on an empty stomach (I had done so)2) Take it diluted (I hadn't done diluted it at all)3) Break  up the dose into several smaller doses during the day (I had taken it all at once, but again, with the dropper filling to different levels on every try, what's a full dose?)4) The directions also said to shake well, which I hadn't done.So in the company's defense, they did advise the above safeguards when taking it. But the print on the bottle is very tiny, light print on a very dark blue label. I really did need a magnifying glass to read it.So I can't say my first experience was good.  But I'll give it a few days then try again, following the directions this time. If it works out better when I follow the company's directions, I'll revise my review and upgrade the rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372NUCJ0YUPHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GCU0HY#wasThisHelpful","R372NUCJ0YUPHD","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I like about DE (Diatomaceous earth):1) It kills bugs.  (It works best on large ones.)  It does this not by poisoning them, but by dehydrating them.  They walk on it, and it works its way up into their carapace (the outer body wall of an insect) and punctures it. This makes them dehydrate and die.)This has led some people, who misunderstand what's happening, to claim that is ""dehydrating,"" as if taking it would dehydrate a person or animal. This is not the case. The dehydration in insects occur because the diamond-sharp shards of the DE cut their exoskeletons.  (The reason it harms insects, rather than people or pets, is because to an insect, a shard of DE is large enough relative to their body size to do damage.)2) It kills worms and parasites inside pets and farm animals. Farmers have used it for decades to safely deworm horses and other livestock, and flush parasites from their systems.3) Many pet owners have used it successfully to deworm and de-parasite their dogs and cats.  It does this without causing any harm to the animal. In fact it benefits the animal by scrubbing debris out of its colon.4) It kills worms, eggs and parasites inside people (pork eaters, take note... you probably have worms.  If so, try taking DE for a couple of months.  Just make sure it's food grade.)5) Some people have claimed that that taking DE killed their candida infections or other fungal infections.  I'm not sure if this is accurate, but considering its colon cleansing properties, it makes sense that it could help against such infections.What I dislike about DE:1) I inhaled some a couple of times and it made me cough. I believe those who say it's not harmful when inhaled, but it is a dry powder, irritating when inhaled.  If you're pouring some into a container, try not to make a dust cloud when you do so or breathe it in.  And don't get the dust in your eyes.2) While it kills large bugs effectively, it does not work as well, in my experience, for tiny little bugs like kitchen ants.  To kill and repel tiny insects, I would suggest white (cleaning) vinegar as a better alternative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371995UUC8WX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00025H2QS#wasThisHelpful","R371995UUC8WX3","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like any fish product, this one has some pluses and minuses.PLUSES:* This product has a light, pleasant flavor.  I just ate a tin of them with some sauerkraut... delicious!* One tin has 19 grams of protein, and zero carbs.* Chub mackerel has 1000 mg of DHA per 100 grams, which is tremendously beneficial to the brain.  (Our brains are largely made of DHA, and we need some in our diet throughout our lives)* Chub mackerel has 900 mg of EPA per 100 grams (another natural component of fish oil), which helps bolster mood and thinking.* To me this is the best point: According to Wikipedia, a 100 gram serving of chub mackerel has over 400 mg of PS (phosphatidylserine), which is also wonderful for the brain (and works best when taken or eaten along with DHA.  DHA and PS are naturally complexed in this product. (PS needs DHA, according to some studies, to do its positive work in the brain.)MINUSES:* It comes in those little tins sardines come in, which I believe are still made of aluminum.  If I could have a wish magically granted, it would be to have products like this available in glass. (With that said, since it's packed in oil, rather than an acid base like tomato sauce, I doubt that much aluminum is transferred to the fish.)* It's expensive. (But then again, consider what it would cost to supplement with EPA, DHA, CoQ10, and PS.)* There is also the  question of mercury.  I've read some reports that mackerel is ""low in mercury,"" but what does this really mean? According to wikipedia, chub mackerel has .088 ppm of mercury (not particularly low.)However, I suspect the fish in these tins may have less, because they are smaller (lower on the food chain) than some chub mackerel.  They are close in size to sardines, which have only  0.013 ppm of mercury. (The size of the fish matters because large fish accumulate more toxins; small fish are generally much safer to eat.)  Pregnant women should check with their doctors before eating fish; the rest of us can probably eat this sort of fish safely.IN SUMTo me the benefits of eating Chub Mackerel to me, far outweigh the risks.  And this brand has a mild and pleasant flavor.  I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LB0JK5KXEITJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B03XO5E#wasThisHelpful","R2LB0JK5KXEITJ","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DISAPPOINTING.I tried this product hoping it would open up my breathing, which was stuffed up due to pollen and allergic rhinitis.  I bought this particular formula because I was hoping to avoid the artificial coloring in the regular product.  I took two 24 milligram gel caps with water.I'm not sure why, but it didn't help.  I had taken it once before, a few years ago, and it had helped clear my breathing.  I'm not sure if the formula has changed, or I got a bad batch, or if something else was going on. If anything, the benadryl seemed to make some some head/neck inflammation I had been experiencing, worse.SO I TRIED...After trying this product with no result, I ordered a different product I'd used previously to clear my sinuses, Jarrow sustained-release NAC (N Acetyl Cysteine).  It worked better for me than the Benadryl.P.S. Several reviewers have said they find this product (Benadryl gel caps) hard to open. I'm not sure why they're having problems, unless they're forgetting to remove the backing. Here's an easy way to open them:1) Pull out a perforated sheet with 12 capsules on it2) Tear off one of the 12 squares (holding one capsule)3) Bend back the indicated corner (marked with a black arrow), and tear off the paper backing.4) Then just slit the foil with a fingernail or thumbnail, and pop out the capsule.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W2MKERY1B0QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ALUJBY#wasThisHelpful","R3W2MKERY1B0QW","A20NVE1U6G8C7N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20NVE1U6G8C7N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not quite a high fidelity system. It's a bit too boomy. But for when you need a portable boom-box, it does quite nicely. It paired easily with my iPhone and iPads, but I can't get it to pair with my Windows 10 Asus tablet, or Samsung Note tablet. In which case, there is a mini-jack style auxiliary cable which works quite well, although plugging it in automatically disables any Bluetooth connection.Controls are simple. There is a ""handle"" built in in the center of the back panel which makes grabbing it and going easy.Sound is pretty loud but not deafening. Sound quality is pretty good. I plugged it into my MacBook Pro, and let it play while I worked and it didn't run out of battery power, so it's at least 8 hours per charge. The power cord is shorter than I would like.

"To a user, a tablet is mostly screen, and this convertible has quite a nice screen. An IPS display with excellent viewing angles and nice color reproduction. It's reminiscent of the similar panel in the original iPad and the iPad 2, not a Retina class display, but nice.Unfortunately, that's about it when it comes to competitive features.The box is sluggish. To the point my son asked me about why Netflix navigation was so slow. So, I bought a copy of Geekbench 3 and ran comparisons for raw 64-bit performance against my mid-2014 Retina Macbook Pro, my aging iPhone 5 S, and the iPad Mini 4 at my desk.Asus Transformer: Single Core 957, Multi-core 2892Retina Macbook Pro: Single Core 3942, Multi-core 15326 (this is the 4 core i7 variant)iPhone 5 S: Single Core 1346, Multi-core 2297iPad Mini 4: Single  Core 1712, Multi-core 2944So for single core operations, a 2+ year old phone is beating this PC! And for Multi-core it's getting about the same marks as a device that weighs about 1/3rd as much and has half the cores. That is just not right, and it shows as it tries to keep up with the demands of a desktop operating system.Single core performance makes web browsing in particular unpleasant. Many times a page will start to load, I'll tap on a visible link, and then the page will finish reformatting itself and process my tap as if it were on a different link and load a page I didn't want to visit. On a faster computer, like my phone, the page would have reached a final layout faster than I could tap. This is annoying and makes visiting heavy Javascript sites like Yahoo sports a chore.The keyboard joins nicely with the tablet, but the keyboard itself is mediocre. I've reviewed several iPad Bluetooth docks with more satisfying typing experiences. For someone coming from using Apple trackpads, the integrated trackpad is abysmal. I can't believe they thought this trackpad was up to snuff. Luckily, the tablet digitizer is well done, so you can bypass the trackpad for navigation.When you unpack your convertible, be prepared to wait. The battery comes fully discharged and it takes a half hour to get enough charge to boot. The charger uses a mini-USB plug, but the charger itself is 9V instead of the standard USB 5V. USB-C would have been a more modern choice. Battery life is quite good; it had better be given the weight of the device and the low performing Atom processors used. Available storage at the beginning is only about 36GB once Window's needs are taken into account. Bloatware is fairly minimal for a PC. The stickers on the palm rest are easily scraped off.I purchased a 128GB micro-SD chip to supplement the integrated disk store, and that was easily added via the built-in SD card reader.The Windows 10 experience is hobbled by the Atom processor, but Cortana works well and is my favorite feature of the computer. I installed Chrome and Netflix, and that's much of what I use a tablet for. There doesn't appear to be an included camera app, but I found one on the Windows Store. Both cameras are awful with horrid color reproduction and a lot of graininess.I don't know why anyone would buy this machine.[Update: since the comments seem to think it is unfair that I'm comparing this convertible to a phone, I ran the Kraken 1.1 Javascript benchmark on both this box and my aging 2011 MacBook Pro which is an i5 dual core. Safari on the 2011 MBP completed the benchmark in 1.5s, my phone does it in 4.2s, and Edge on the Asus in 8.9s. The older box is nearly 6x faster at running JavaScript which would show up in dealing with the ad encrusted sites of the Internet. This computer is really slow by modern standards.Update 2: A commenter indicated my measured Kraken times were unlike his, so I remeasured. This time I got a half as terrible 4.7s so this box is only 1/3rd as fast as a 4+ year old i5 laptop. I guess there must have been a hungry background process running to interfere with the benchmark run.]","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH561PEM65QSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RGK#wasThisHelpful","RH561PEM65QSO","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These days, I will settle for a product that isn't overly clever, but just executes the basics. This is a thermometer so it's most basic task is to quickly record a person's body temperature. Does it do so? Yes, in about 5 seconds if you get it properly placed under the tongue. Is it accurate? I don't know, if it is, my son runs a bit hot, and I run a bit cool.It has an app, does it execute on making a competent iOS app? Yes. I make my living as an iOS dev, and I'd say I'd be reasonably proud to have written this app. It's a bit more cluttered than I'd have gone with, but presumably they hit the style they were going for. Also, it does have a bad case of featuritis, and could have been a much simpler app.  It paired quickly with the thermometer and I was storing temperature measurements for my family members within seconds. I don't know what the privacy implications, or why the app wants my actual birthday, you'd think month/year would be medically close enough.As for issues. It was hard getting my son to get an acceptable reading under his tongue, but we eventually got one. That could just be lack of focus on his part.

"I'd rather not have the corner of my kitchen be a mess of chargers and wires. With this 4 port charger, it is at least only a mess of wires.Using a USB Ampmeter, I am able to see how much current it delivers to plugged in devices. And it varies a lot, wherein a fully drained tablet, which in my case is either an iPad Air 2 or a Samsung Galaxy Note 12.2, can pull in 2A or more from their own chargers, I've never seen this charger deliver more than 1.6A and often seen it practically idling at .8A. It seems as there is some difference between the individual ports they can deliver or how much Amperage the charger negotiates with any given device. So, I don't think this delivers as well as a dedicated charger, but I use it anyway for overnight charging when it doesn't matter much.Overall design is good with a long power cord which I hide behind my kitchen side cabinet.I've used this with an iPhone 5 S, my tablets, a cheap Kindle, a battery pack, my Apple Watch, and an old Apple Watch.

"The world is filled with different designs of water bottles. Everyone, it seems, has run down to their local patent attorney with some new mechanism for making a more complicated water bottle. So, it's nice to see someone execute a fairly simple design that satisfies my basic needs for a water bottle.Does it seal in the water when closed? Yes and no. When you first close it, there are a few drops of water caught on the outside of the seal, and those can be shaked out, but everything else is snug in the bottle.Can I grip it easily? Yes, it has a gradual, and elegant curvature which allows even my smallish adult hands to comfortably grasp its middle. This allows for more insulating void at the top and bottom.Is it easy to clean?  Yes, very and unlike a straw design, I'm reasonably sure it's clean.Other, less critical features also come up. It's insulated so there is no sweating of condensed water all over my stuff.

"As a router, this is a nice, simplified system for getting online. The previous router in that corner of the house was an Airport Express which does not support ac style WiFi. Of course, the only device in the house that currently supports ac is my iPad Air 2, but as time goes on and old iPhones and computers are switched out for new ones, this will change. Nor can I determine whether the Air 2 is even taking advantage of ac networking. Unlike the Airport Express, with its Airport Utility, I don't have control over what network standard is used. That level of configuration has been simplified out.I went about taking some quick measurements of speed. In the same room, both this router and the Airport Express were giving me 30 Mbits/sec downloads and 15 Mbits/sec uploads with either my iPad Air 2 or my iPhone 5 S to the Internet. When I went 60 feet away to the opposite end of the house, through a brick wall, there was a more substantial difference I'm going to attribute to the larger, more antenna filled space of the OnHub, I was able to still get 27 Mbits/sec with the on hub with my Air 2 and the OnHub. My iPhone 5 S had much more variability, getting 5Mbits/sec on one run and 15Mbits/sec on another. When I switched to the Airport Express, my throughput dropped substantially to 21 Mbits/sec on the Air 2. Again there was more variability with the 5 S, but it had about half the average throughput when using Apple's router.That was for connecting with the outside Internet. I also tried transfers within my home network using my trusty 2011 MacBook Pro, that was able to transfer a 257MB folder in 32 seconds when connected to the Airport Express and 16 seconds when connected to this OnHub. Both in the same room as the router. Quite an improvement.This is not to say that you couldn't get the same performance in a lower cost hub, but beyond the raw numbers, this hub has value. Because of its Objet d'art aspirations, I can put this hub in plain view on a shelf or side table where it will work better and not have it ruin the esthetics of my home. It comes with narrow dark grey Ethernet cables, and a thin dark grey charging cable so as to be inconspicuous as practical when disguised as a statue. I wish the cables were longer so allow for discrete installation on higher shelves. As it is, I ended up putting it right in the middle of my house, proudly displayed on the side cabinet in my kitchen where only the most curious guest will figure out it's something more than an abstracted cylinder.The associated iPhone app is cleanly done and non-techy. There are a few high end features buried in it like port forwarding and dynamic DNS, but in general, it keeps things at a level appropriate for the non-expert. It's also interesting to be able to remotely see what devices are connected, so when I was off in Chicago on a trip, I could open the app and see which tablets were connected back home. I can use the app to set the brightness of the colored LED glow. In a bedroom, I'd set this to zero, whereas in my kitchen, I set it quite bright to act as a night light.So, in general, this is a simple premium router. Whether you'd want to pay the premium is up to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRQTMLWI3FSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ALA9LA#wasThisHelpful","R3RRQTMLWI3FSM","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They've managed to make its metal shell look like cheap plastic, but scrape it off and there is some metal inside.There are sliding plastic covers for the prong holes. They are to keep dust out, but in a non - dusty environment, they are just a hinderance.My greatest concern is the shortness of the cable. I tried it in a couple situations where it was too short: lying on the floor while plugged into my bathroom outlet, and lying on my work desk while plugged into a floor level outlet. Another couple feet would have made a big difference.Anyway, if you need an inexpensive non - junky power strip, this will do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4IM5UE9M544D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMN6U#wasThisHelpful","R4IM5UE9M544D","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'd been meaning to get a bench vise for the longest time. I remember my dad having one when I was a kid, and it doesn't seem like a proper workshop without one.This is very much a no frills model. Well, there are two fills, you can rotate it, and the area covering the main screw is armored up as a small anvil.  Both are useful features. I can rotate the vise out of my way by loosening two clasps, good. And I can hammer on, and therefore shape, thin, small pieces of metal. I demonstrated this to my daughter by taking a deadbolt strike and making it L shaped, and then flattened it out again.Installation took 3 longish 5/16"" boltsprovided by me. 8mm ones would have worked too. As my bench has a fairly thin top, I reinforced it from underneath the table top with a large piece of wood (half a stair tread, but any wide, thick scrap would have done). There is no fourth bolt hole on the vise as that would have gone through the corner of the table. Once tightened down the vise isn't going anywhere without the whole table.  I took care to place the vise close enough to the edge that it's sliding handle wouldn't hit the tabletop, while still being far enough in that the washers around the bolts wouldn't hit the inside of the table's trim. So, in my case, the vise had to be 2"" from two edges of the table top. Remember, it rotates. At this position, there is about "" to spare when fully closed. The base jaws are quite severe. The instructions comes with a list of magnetic jaw caps that you can purchase to change the texture of the clamping surface. So, someone doing gunsmithing, for example, might want to purchase a plastic or rubber coated jaw cap so as to not mar components. Amazon sells 4"" jaw caps, which sell for a large fraction of the price of the vise.  After buying mounting wood, bolts, washers, nuts and a jaw cap, you can easily double the price of the vise itself.I like this vise. It might not have a high gloss finish, but the screw turns easily and the grip is solid. I guess I now have a proper workshop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RERTLLVVL356/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YS40AVI#wasThisHelpful","R2RERTLLVVL356","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These headphones are really quite nice. While I still prefer the wired Quiet Comfort model, these have much to recommend them.First, they are optionally cord free. So they don't get entangled with my chair and rip my computer off my desk. Or alternatively, they are corded, but the cord pulls out of its socket before breaking my neck. And the batteries are long lasting. I can go an entire workday and go from 100 to 90% with my usage pattern. As an added bonus, the batteries are rechargeable, a big advantage over the Quiet Comfort which eats AAAs.I'm quite happy that I can simultaneously pair with both my iPhone and my MacBook Pro. I was also able to pair with a Samsung Galaxy Note tablet, although that took a couple tries. Much more convenient than pairing, unpairing and pairing again.Sound isolation is good, as my wife can attest to when I can't hear her speaking, but is, of course worse with noise than the active noise canceling of the Quiet Comfort. Sound quality is good enough; I can't hear the unavoidable recompression errors with what I've been using it for, and there is always that cord.The media controls are small and take getting used to reaching. They should consider putting really big buttons on the side. They work with my Apple devices although the inconvenience make me more likely to just use the device directly.As for comfort, it is only just OK due to weight issues. I was able to mow my lawn using these, and sweating like the ocean the whole time because these are pretty good earmuffs. Still better than wire headphones which would have tangled up whenever I bent down.I'm happy with these as work/desk headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFXU4XF6W3KIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RGG8E#wasThisHelpful","RFXU4XF6W3KIN","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When clasped, no water escapes, however sometimes it takes a few tries to get the top all clamped down.I was able to fill the bottle full of a half ice mixture and still get the straw through the icebergs and close it up, but 100% ice is not going to allow passage of the straw.

"I constructed a new longer dryer vent path out to the front of the house, so I needed a new inline fan for that extra oomph. As I didn't want lint clogging the fan, or cluttering up my front yard, I purchased this lint trap. I had seen it used on the TV show Holmes Inspection (available on Netflix) and thought it a great idea. My previous system of venting into an external water trap in my 3 season porch had resulted in an horrible accumulation of lint all over the place, not to mention the fire hazard of flexible ductwork filled with lint.So, I'm happy to report that this does a very good job of stopping lint from progressing through my ductwork. I have not seen so much as a thread get all the way through to my front yard.To get it offset from the wall, and give room for the fan which I placed immediately above it, I mounted this on doubled blocks of 2x6 that I rounded off a bit and painted white before attaching with deck screws to my wall. Then I put screws right through the corners of this trap. It isn't going anywhere. I had a bit of trouble getting a decent seal to the 4 inch flexible ducting from my dryer, and it does whistle a tiny bit, but it looks OK and is functional.My one real issue (and I don't know if this is solvable) is that to clean the trap, I have to jerk the cover out of the box, and this action invariably brings a spray of dryer debris (little bits of hardened paper, etc.) which I have to wipe off my washer--which is immediately below this trap. As others have pointed out, the cover does not fit quite square in the box, but this might just be to allow the cover to come out at all. It doesn't appear to leak hot moist air into the room, which would be an actual problem.I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone willing to listen to my epic story of installing a 30 foot dryer vent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E09Z4AESIKW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJPHJVK#wasThisHelpful","R1E09Z4AESIKW4","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife loves this huge pan, but it has its caveats.First, it's big. This is about as big of a pan as you can fit on a homeowner size stovetop. So this will be great when making shepherd's pie.Second, it's easy to clean. Wipe it off or throw it in the dish washer.Third, it's good looking.Now, on the downside, and for what you'd expect in an inexpensive pan, it has a small hotspot. So, if I heat it up over my gas stove, the center will be at 320F (as measured by my infrared thermometer), while the edges will be at 250F. Contrast with a more expensive all clad pan that has a big hunk of metal under the bottom which might vary by 10 or less in the same situation. You aren't going to be able to make giant pancakes in this thing, not unless you like pancakes with raw edges and burnt centers.  Presumably you can cook around this, but this is not a premium pan. Cooker beware. [Update: I actually cooked a pancake and it wasn't that bad, so feel free to use it as such.

"My children have been using this a lot the last couple weeks, and for what they use it for: watching Netflix and YouTube it has been great. They love the huge screen, which can be propped up anywhere convenient. It's fit in nicely with our iPads, which are also mainly portable TVs to the children.I'm more of a Web browser, so I miss Safari and other iOS apps. I should mention that I make my living writing iPhone and iPad apps, so I might be expected to be unimpressed by this upstart. But, Samsung has made a compelling product in a very Samsungy way. They mainly just threw whatever features they could conjure into a box with really nice specs and hoped enough of it worked out to make people like it.So it's a big wide screen tablet, which makes it mainly a video watching machine. But, you can use split screen multitasking which makes better use of the space. So I can have Chrome and YouTube on the screen at once. It adds something useful. It's rough and feels hacky, and isn't quite as nice as the same feature in IOS 9, but it makes this huge wide screen practical. I've found myself browsing the web in the awkward portrait mode, but it shows a lot of content and works better than landscape.The stylus isn't quite as useful as I would have hoped, but my 8 year old daughter took to drawing with it, and when in use, it is smooth, responsive and quite capable of creating pixel art. I am not a fan of styli, so I haven't done much with it. But, it is much nicer than any stylus you can buy for the current iPad, yes even better then the 53 Pencil. The tablet was designed from the ground up to use one, and it shows.The camera is OK. I am not one to mock people who take photos with tablets. It takes pictures, front and back. There are numerous options. You have the world's largest viewfinder.Bluetooth devices work pretty well. I took a few tries to pair my Bose headphones with it, but once paired the audio quality was fine.  Same with WiFi. I've had no troubles connecting with the various brands of WiFi hubs in the house; it even connected easily to my iPhone's hotspot.Construction is semi-decent. The ""leather"" back is comfortable and warm. The chrome ring is cheap and old fashioned. The seams are a bit wide. I'm glad there is a mini-SD slot, because 32 GB is not a lot these days. The stylus is a bit cheap feeling. The worst part of the tablet is the home button which an unreliable and creaky.Other than the split screen feature, I would probably have preferred stock Android, and I really miss the keyboard from my iPad. Also, TouchID and good battery life. This one comes with that ridiculous big USB 3 plug, and the next version with the USB C connector will be much improved. As it is, charging takes too long even though Samsung ""cheats"" by making the charger a bit over (5.3V) the standard  voltage. You will probably want to only charge this with its original charger.In general, an interesting and useful device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I14GZB5P8ZQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWMPSK6#wasThisHelpful","R1I14GZB5P8ZQZ","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bose did an excellent job with these headphones. They are comfortable, convenient, keep out noise, don't leak sound and sound good.Comfort. I'd say these are as comfortable as in-ear headphones are going to get without a specialized fitting. In the past, I've noticed that other in-ear headphones tend to rub against the ear opening making a noise and irritating the skin, but these seem OK. I can wear these for hours without much issue. (I still prefer over the ear headphones, but for compactness these are good.)Convenience: These work perfectly well with my Apple devices. Apple devices include my Mac Mini which can make use of both the media controls and the microphone via its headphone port. The cord is a good length without being extra long. The controls are easily accessible hanging around collarbone height. For some reason the controls are on the right cord, whereas in my Bose QuietComfort headphones they are on the left. You would be hard pressed to put the wrong bud in your left or right ear as the buds are very asymmetric.Keeping Out the World: My wife had to yell at me this morning to get me to breakfast. She was quite impressed.Keeping the Sound In: Bose is very good at keeping the sound directed at your ear drums and not leaking out to know what you are listening to. Very Private.Sounding Good: The sound is nice and flat. Not as good as my active QuietComfort headphones, but clear and without noticeable distortion.  The microphone does a good job of picking up your voice and doesn't pick up much noise.Some nits: The clip looks quite cheap and brittle. The insulation on the wires is sort of stiff and rubbery in a not-quite premium way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJQ335A4K8I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYDW#wasThisHelpful","RRJQ335A4K8I6","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If all I need from it is to loosen screws and drill narrow holes then it can do that, easily enough.With the lack of weight, comes the lack of power. Whereas I can use a paddle bit to drill "" holes into a log with my DeWalt, and go until the battery overheats (maybe six inches deep), this drill won't go "" into the log. Same deal with a 2"" hole saw into composite planking; this drill won't drive it more than "" before stopping, while my DeWalt zips right through.This is not a premium tool. The case is not formfitting. The bits are sticky out of the box. The LED light goes immediately off with the trigger instead of waiting a few seconds. The battery takes care to slot into place, so you can't just casually snap it into place with the palm of your hand. The flashing pattern to indicate pre-charging is the same as the pattern for charged.  The chuck cover is cheap plastic.I'm also not a fan of tool manufactures labeling 10.8V tools as 12V, but even DeWalt did that with its 20V Max series, so I'll let it pass.The grip is nice enough, soft and a bit tactile. You can remove the belt clip, or switch it over to the other side for lefties. The included bits are a decent steel.If you need a drill for lightweight around the house use and can't afford the really good stuff, then this would be OK if you know what you are getting into. I think I'll get a lot of use out of it myself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N90NCFEP1HKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O1WODJM#wasThisHelpful","R3N90NCFEP1HKK","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't think this product is for everyone. I, for one, don't have a problem putting a nail into my walls should I need to hang a piece of art. But renters might prefer this, and it works easier and with more stability than the traditional steel wire on the back, or the dreaded loop or ring in the back. The integrated level makes it easy to align, and once the frame is pushed into the velcro it isn't tilting, or leaning. This is the metaphorical better mousetrap.I was sent a series of monochrome photographs for my artworks, which would probably be appropriate for a caf or other place where impersonal, inoffensive decoration is needed. I would have rather tried a chalkboard or whiteboard facing, so I could have gotten my ever crafty daughter to make a statement. That would be great.  There was one extension piece, so one of the pictures could be mounted further from the wall, to break it up a bit and give some 3D effect; it works reasonably well, but does expose the frame which would otherwise be hidden.Installation was as quick and errorless as they claim. Just make sure the wall is clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27HX19KB91KLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9Q7MOM#wasThisHelpful","R27HX19KB91KLE","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewing cereal is hard. Most of you reading this are probably already Special K enjoyers, and just want to know if anything is wrong with the packaging or whether the addition of dried strawberries or yogurt detracts from the original. I'll try.The portions are too large. I'm an average sized male; (5'11"", 182 lbs) and I have a hard time eating all the cereal in a cup in one sitting; and of course, you pretty much have to eat it all in one sitting for it to have the convenience you bought it for. And once the milk is poured on, the clock starts ticking; my daughter filled a cup up with milk, then forgot it on the counter; this stuff turns to mush fast, you can't just put it back in the fridge.Of the three varieties, I guess the Red Berry version with dried strawberries is the best; I like strawberries. I don't think the yogurt version is any improvement, chunks of dried yogurt that settle to the bottom of the cup with a flavor that isn't so much tangy yogurt as it is emptiness.The packaging does deliver everything fresh, crisp and well preserved. So if you are a Special K lover and just need a convenient way to keep a single serving this will work out for you. Although I'd imagine it would be cheaper and more resource friendly in the long run to get a securely sealable bowl and fill it daily from a bulk box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QU1Q5R8RBVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHYE802#wasThisHelpful","R1QU1Q5R8RBVP2","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ever since our children were babies, we've used a heavy rubber mattress cover on one of our beds and while it definitely kept fluids from penetrating, during summer it was horrible as it just did not breath at all. We put a mattress pad on top of it which alleviated that somewhat, but I was not happy with it. That is why I'm so very happy to take delivery of this much lighter weight cover. It's much more clothlike yet it does a good job of keeping fluid from penetrating. I poured water on it, put a piece of paper underneath, and let it sit for 20 minutes, nothing came through, not a drop.As for comfort, while I wouldn't want to sleep on it directly, it isn't quite cotton-like in its texture, it isn't bad at all. Put a sheet or a sheet and a mattress pad over it and you are good to go.

"I was sent two Brinks Push Pull locks; the other one had a privacy lock on it, and a nickel finish. I liked the other one better, but this is a nice latch, if you are lucky enough to have a door it fits. I tried this lock first on the door leading out to my garage, but unfortunately, neither the 60 or 70mm bolt modules this lock ships with fit; I needed around a 65mm one. So there went that idea. I subsequently tried installing it on a closet door, and that went much better; the 70 mm bolt fit perfectly, and I had the old latch off and this new one installed in under 10 minutes. The mechanism was pre-set for my standard interior door, but adjusting it for a thicker size can be done in a few minutes of mainly reading the instructions.Once installed, I have a fairly smooth mechanism that can be opened by either pulling, pushing or twisting. I will be mainly pulling because the door opens towards me. I'm concerned that the finish will scratch; that's why I prefer the better aging nickel surfaces, but it hasn't scratched yet.  It is certainly an improvement over the old fashioned door knob it's replacing and will make it easier to get into the linen closet with my arms filled with sheets and towels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R91PRKD5P164I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRD9EO#wasThisHelpful","R91PRKD5P164I","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This door lock is for those who just need to get into the bathroom NOW! Come barreling up to the door and pop it by pushing into the handle and it opens up all in one smooth motion. Really clever. So probably best for doors that open in, but still functional if pulling the door opens it, just not as fun. Unless, of course, the lock is actually locked in which case a Three Stooges bit ensues.Finish and decorative detail work are OK, if not fantastic, and construction is all metal. I'm curious about the mirror finish on the bolt, it seems as if that can't last. The handles are a bit loose, and I think the set screw on the inside handle is likely to require periodic retightening. The lock takes a little work to engage as you have to reach around the inside handle, but unlocking is easy: just twist the handle. Emergency unlocking, which is sometimes a daily occurrence around here with the kids is accomplished by a bit of included stiff wire.Installation was done in a few minutes, and most of it was done by my 9 year old, so even novice handymen should have little trouble.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AYXT8ISL4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYRR6U2#wasThisHelpful","R7AYXT8ISL4H","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recently offered a variety pack of Tacwise staples to review; along with it came a cousin of this Z3-140 model. I liked the staples, but loved the stapler and I jumped at the chance of getting another. Even though my house now has 5 hand staplers and my wife will look at me like I'm insane should she find out I took delivery of another one. Regardless, this is an excellent stapler. It fires firmly and evenly, it's comfortable in the hand, and the detachable guide makes stapling along a line easy.I would say this is a feature-rich model. You know that they threw in the kitchen sink when they put in a little window to put your initials inside. But the gimmicks do not make a stapler gimmicky if it does its primary task easily and without error.  The only thing I can say against it is that the staples they throw in are quite short, and you will likely want to buy a more varied pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M1E76KT52T66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406WX1O#wasThisHelpful","R2M1E76KT52T66","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent read. The main character is mostly pleasant if self-rightious, and it seems like she could quickly dispense with her main problemthat folks won't believe she can talk with magical creatureswhich should be easily and irrefutably provable. Regardless, I took a liking to the idealistic girl.The most unsatisfying part of the book is the antagonist, who takes the role of the voice of reason. The town is being invaded by a magical pest, which threatens the lives and property of the inhabitants, and the antagonist is forcefully advocating for the town to vote for erradication of said creatures. This is not Cruella de Ville, the antagonist is just using the democratic process to do what is sensible: eliminate harmful creatures. Imagine reading a book where the protagonist was fighting to protect malarial mosquitos. If my kids read this book, I will be sure to point out the softheadedness of Pip's point of view.One of the philosophical quandries about this book is that Pip finds that almost all magical creatures can speak. Thus, they are intelligent and I would think more deserving of protection than everyday mindless things. So imagine mosquitos that can talk, would they be just as swat-table? For that matter, would creatures capable of intelligent conversation be appropriate as subservient pets?I had thought there would be more clippings from the imaginary 'Guide to Magical Creatures' and this would have been an opportunity to add something special and diffentiating for the book, but the clippings are short and far between. And could have more imagination.I'd say this is a decent book for young people, not a great one, that many will enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUG81CLI7Q0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545709261#wasThisHelpful","R1KUG81CLI7Q0X","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a horrible monitor. At its native resolution1080pit is quite crisp. However, it is what is, an inexpensive LCD monitor, and for a lot of people it will be sufficient and maybe even a bargain. But make no mistake; it is not as good as pricier models.For example, I have it sharing my Mac desktop with a Thunderbolt Display, which has a quite good LG panel. For the life of me, I cannot get the HP panel to calibrate where the standard Mac gamma of 2.2 looks good. I'm not talking some purist's calibration, just set it so that colors look the same, and I can watch TV shows without it looking either washed out or way too dark. Contrast with the great panel on the ViewSonic monitor hanging over my printer. Also there is a lot of changes in brightness as you change your position so that from my normal seated position, the top of the HP looks like the solid background color is a completely different shade of blue.I can see where someone could need a monitor on the cheap, or have a little-used workstation which just needs a monitor. For this, it would be fine. And maybe, the user hasn't been ruined by using a good monitor, thus my advice to keep it away from a good one. As for me, I'll just keep it here and use it to display auxiliary windows when I program, and it should be OK for that, at least I won't have to stare at it.For whatever reason, it shipped with a VGA cable instead of a more useful HDMI or DVI cable. And of course, it doesn't have a Display Port, or any audio out. Onscreen controls were a bit confusing but you get the hang of them. The face of the display is a bit under 6 inches from the back most part of the stand, so it will jam against the wall pretty tight. The status light is a pleasant white dot and there isn't anything in the way of HP branding on power up, so it isn't deliberately annoying in any way.It seems to take longer than most monitors to negotiate a resolution with my Mac, so awaking from sleep takes several seconds longer and involves my desktop going black twice. And if I restart my Mac Mini, it will flash many times and I'll end up cycling the monitors power in order to get it back in sync. My advice here would be to avoid using this with a Mac.If your budget is larger, I've found Samsung's SD590 series to be more praiseworthy at about the same size.Just know what you are buying and not to expect more and you should be fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N7DR2CLI8CBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFB13UC#wasThisHelpful","R2N7DR2CLI8CBL","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this a nice case, and it would make a good gift; as it comes with an extra nice box and comes with fancy accessories such as a transparent bubble scraper with an owl logo. I am not convince, however, that it is a great case. I think there was some compromise in fit when it was crafted to also fit the iPhone 5c, so it's a bit loose on my 5S, and it doesn't give much of protection on the speaker grill. But these compromises can be turned into strengths as in: too loose = easy to remove, scant speaker protection = can use any lightening connector including Apple's bulky 30 pin to lightening adaptor plus the sound is less muffled.I didn't have great luck with the screen protector, getting a couple of trapped bits of dust, but it does have the advantage of coming with both top and bottom protective sheets, so you can scratch up the sacrificial top sheet to your heart's content with the bubble scraper and when you are satisfied peel it off leaving the unblemished protector. I'm not so sure about not having a front facing camera opening on the protector, but it has good clarity, and neglecting the dust bubbles looks great.Hand feel is good, and it's neither overly cold or slippery. [Update: I've been using this case for few weeks, and the texture is its best feature, and gives a lot of comfort.] [Update again: unfortunately after several months, the leather is starting to peel away from the frame, making for an unsightly mess.]So, not the most protective case in the world, but stylish enough and sort of fancy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SMHVDKUUAVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUYVX7W#wasThisHelpful","R23SMHVDKUUAVU","ATS2855497V0I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATS2855497V0I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This appears to be a quite decent watch albeit a bit large for a lady's watch. My wife prefers a smaller dial for one, but some like a more easily read face. My one problem with the watch is that the texture of the underlying mother-of-pearl face of the watch fools my eyes into thinking there's some sort of imperfection in the crystal overlay.Out of the box, the band was way too big for my wife's slender wrists, something fixed for $15 at a jeweller's kiosk at the mall. This still left the watch a bit loose, but rather too loose than too tight.As for being a watch, it seems to keep adequate time, not losing a second over the course of a week.This is plated gold, you can see the underlying steel if you look at the normally hidden parts of the links and looks fine.

"This is a exceedingly large mouse pad made out of wetsuit material. I'm not quite sure about why you'd want either quality. I had to shift several accessories on my desk to make room for the pad, and then I didn't actually make use of the area. I could have changed my mouse's acceleration but then I'd be moving my hand farther to get around the screen.It's made of wetsuit like material, which allows it to be compactly rolled up without crimping for shipping, and is a nicely even surface to roll over. On the other hand, it gives padding and more damping than a harder surface would making for more effort in moving. Which may be what you want, a mouse on a frictionless surface would never come to a complete stop. The question is one of balance between too much damping and too little, and I'd say this pad gives just a bit too much, but it's close.As for other qualities, the backside grabs my desk well so it doesn't move. It's thin enough that the lip doesn't bother or impede me.  The artwork is not my kind of thing, too much affectation.

"I unintentionally ended up using an unusual technique for testing this mat's durability. My daughter loves playing hot lava so she grabbed one end and hopped all over the basement curling, pounding and twisting it. Absolutely no visible damage from even this unusual abuse. It also doesn't show any marks from my rolling my office chair over it all day.As for the mat's comfort, one's feet sink gently into the foam rubber. It seems like they calibrated this compression so while it will uniformly distribute the force of gravity along the surface of the average shoe, you don't quite feel like you are sinking into quicksand. It succeeds at making standing noticeably less fatiguing.The mat has a faux diamond plate pattern across its surface with the apparent intention of minimizing slipping. I don't think one would slip very easily on the surface anyway, what with your feet pressed  a centimeter below the surface, but it probably helps a bit.I think Stanley has a winner here, but it's quite possible that some people will find the mat too squishy.

"This is my first selfie stick style monopod. One thing that's now apparent is that these things are not just for taking selfies. Anytime you need a longer arm or to make a quick, stable shot, this thing becomes useful. It's useful from all the way collapsed to fully extended (about 2.5 feet of arm) and will hold any position in between with friction. I'd be a bit worried that this slide out mechanism will wear out and lose its grip, but at least for now it's fine. I have an iPhone 5S in a case and it popped right into the bracket, but if I take my phone out of its case, I have to put in an included rubbery piece to hold it tight into the stick's bracket.The most satisfying part of the monopod is the shutter release button integrated into the grip. I paired it with my phone via the Bluetooth settings panel in a few seconds, and it was immediately able to trigger my phone's camera shutter. I find I can take much more stable photos than I would if were tapping the screen or pressing the volume down button.Conversely, the least satisfying part of the monopod is the shutter release button as it is covered by a rubber sleeve and that sleeve can easily rotate or pull out of position making the bump that is supposed to be over the button in the wrong place, and leaving me pressing nothing.

"I used to think that people that referred to their pets as their ""Furbaby"" were a little bit crazy...until I got my dog. Now I get it. They are a part of your family! We got our first family dog Odie around the holiday season last year so it seemed appropriate to get him a companion for the holidays this year!We like having small dogs because of the limited space for them in our backyard. We got another Chihuahua named Belle. Belle of course needed all the doggie gear including a dog collar. We were really happy with Odie's dog bed from Blueberry Pet so it instantly became a name I trusted when it came to pet products.They have a really cute Christmas collection for the holidays.I liked the snowflake one best even though I loved all the patterns in the red, green and gold color scheme. What I immediately noticed when I got it was it's huge! I got the small size since I have five pound Chihuahua's and even on the smallest setting it's big on her. It doesn't come in extra small so if you have a small dog it probably wouldn't fit. I would guess smaller than ten pounds it would be too big.The second thing I noticed was the incredible quality. I have only gotten the cheap collars from Walmart before so I didn't even know they came this nice! It's much thicker and more solid then any I've seen before. The buckle part is really solid and probably won't ever break.I thought the bow was absolutely adorable! This would be so cute to put on a puppy that's a gift for Christmas! Imagine seeing that under the tree Christmas morning!DSCN2519I'm disappointed in the fit and that these collars are designed for bigger dogs but they really are adorable and well made. This Christmas dog collar would make a great gift for a Fur baby!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJTS3Y00FW3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ES6XYY#wasThisHelpful","RDJTS3Y00FW3G","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is great for keeping baby out of trouble, or in my current situation, keeping puppy out! ! There are things and places you don't want them accessing, touching, playing with or coming into contact with at all! But babies and puppies alike are determined and skilled at getting into places they aren't allowed. So what's a mom to do? Meet my new best friend: the 3 in 1 Play Yard from Dreambaby!I really should have invested in one of these seven years ago when I had my first baby. It's one of those items that are pricey and you put on your baby registry and hope you get it but then don't buy for yourself if you don't. In hindsight and after using it for just a week, it would have been so worth the investment! Even having for just my third child, and second puppy; I think it's worth it!I was a little worried about the setup but luckily it comes 90% put together! I had visions of attaching all of these separate pieces but the panels fold in opposite direction to each other so that they can completely collapse for easy storage and transportation. You simply unfold and then stand it up where you want it.As I mentioned we just got a new puppy and wanted her blocked off in the kitchen until she's completely potty trained. This covered the area I needed perfectly!The best feature is the gate! It's a swing close gate so even if the little ones forget to close it; it closes on it's own! You do have the option to push all the way to prop and leave open. I do this when the dog has already gone to the bathroom and can be free for a bit. I close it when she can't.It's an easy squeeze lever to move quickly through the gate but hard enough so that my toddler can't open it on his own.Since this is a temporary situation, we didn't secure to the walls. However, if I had gotten this sooner OR have another baby in the future, I will put it in front of the fireplace and entertainment center area. We already lost one TV to a baby throwing something at it!Included are directions and hardware to secure to the wall. The best part of this is there's a pattern included that you can tape to the wall and install the hardware first instead of trying to guesstimate where exactly the screws go. This will save some extra holes in the wall!The other option for this is to make it a playpen; again perfect for babies and puppies! I think we'll be taking this camping with us. Since Jax is still a toddler he tends to wander off. This is a great option to let him play outside with his siblings without me having to worry if I have to run in the trailer for something.This whole set is top quality and I was really impressed that it could be free standing without having to secure it down.Whether you have a toddler, a newborn or a puppy; this 3 in 1 Play-Yard is a great option to section off areas you don't want them accessing or just to give them their own safe play area. It's one of those things on my ""should have gotten this years ago"" list!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BI69E9UOP6PF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2VR3RS#wasThisHelpful","R2BI69E9UOP6PF","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I searched high and low for the perfect wallet phone case for my iPhone. What I realized is that there aren't a whole lot of options for good quality leather cases! Sure there are thousands when you search but as I narrowed it down there weren't a whole lot.I wanted the drivers license window which was really hard to find and one of the reasons I chose this one. I also liked that there were three additional slots for credit cards and then a slot behind them for money.My phone fits very snug inside. I have a bad habit of dropping it all the time and cracking the screen so it was really important for me to have something secure. I've already drop tested it (not on purpose of course) and it has survived! The soft leather protects it and it doesn't come out. In fact, I have a hard time taking it out when I want to put it in my running armband. But that's probably a good thing.I love the coffee color. It looks nice for fall and matches most everything I have.It gets kind of fat with three credit cards and money it but it seems to have expanded nicely and it's not hard at all to close it. The magnet is obviously good quality and it snaps and stays shut.

"My kids now have nicer sheets then me! Seriously - I didn't expect much from sheets with characters on them. Whenever I buy my kids these kinds of sheets they are scratchy and not the best quality. But they're kids and they don't know the difference so they don't complain.When I got this set I was quite shocked at how soft and silky they are! I got them for my youngest son and as soon as my older saw them, he asked for a set! Now they know the difference between cheap sheets and quality sheets so it's quality only from now on!The design is pretty awesome. I love the clean, classic batman symbol on the bottom sheet and the top sheet has all the different years and models of the Batmobile. The pillowcase has two different designs on each side.Now I'm going to have to see if they come in California King size because my husband wants them! They are on the pricey side if you compare to others. I bought them for the design but now I see the higher price is for higher quality.

"Life is full of possibilities and opportunities to help others. Unfortunately, not everyone fully appreciates or takes advantage of this fact. What I have found when trying to bless others through volunteering is that I'm usually the one that's blessed! At this point in my life with my children at the forefront of all my activities, I like to volunteer in areas that involved them. Helping in the classroom or at the nursery at church are some of my favorite things to do because they involved my favorite little people.It is never lost on me how much of a difference you can make and how much other people appreciate it. When you hear their thanks, it's all worth it! After losing my dad this summer and seeing him spend the last year of his life in a nursing home, I have a whole new appreciation for anyone that volunteers with the elderly. Since I've seen how few people do it; it's been on my heart to find a way to volunteer once my last child is in school and I have more time.Reading Volunteering & Giving Back brought me to tears, as all the Chicken Soup books do, and inspired me to want to do more. It's such a huge opportunity to bless someone and in turn to be blessed.There are ten different topics with stories in each including my favorites Who's Helping Whom, The Spirit of Christmas and Filling a Need. I have a bad habit of jumping around in these books. I always open to the index to see what the topics are and start with the ones that interest me the most. I always end up reading the whole thing in the end so I don't know why I don't read it cover to cover. I just can't seem to do it that way. I get too excited about the topics and want to read them first!One that that helped me in all my flipping about that I believe is fairly new is that the page numbers are sideways on the bottom along with the section title. It's perfect for those of us that like to flip around and want to easily find things!I loved The Spirit of Christmas probably the most and it's a great reminder with the holiday season approaching that there are many opportunities to volunteer this time of year and so many that are less fortunate than us.I really enjoyed Where do Those Toys go that was about the Toys for Tots program. This is one I always do with my kids and have them pick out a toy for a child their age to donate. But I always wondered too; where DO the toys go? This one was informative as well as touching and a great reminder that there are people on the other end of giving who are receiving a much greater gift than the toy itself.People tend to get depressed around the holidays and are lonely and sad if they don't have happiness in their life. Volunteering & Giving Back made me want to reach out more to those in need and volunteer wherever I can. There is no greater gift to give!I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HR5PE4GDOFQO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611599512#wasThisHelpful","R1HR5PE4GDOFQO","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thanksgiving is just around the corner and what better time to remind our kids to be thankful! I know it's something that doesn't come naturally to most children so they have to be taught. I have one child that always remembers to say thank you and frequently says ""thank you for making me dinner"" or ""thank you for taking me shopping."" This thanks is music to my ears as it was the way I was raised. I have another child, however, who it doesn't come naturally to and has to be constantly reminded. I think it's a good thing to instill in them at a very young age.Thank you, Lord, for Everything is a great book to help do that! It's a board book so it's designed for the younger crowd. I read it with my 21 month old today and he absolutely loved it. It instantly became one of those books that you have to read to them over and over again. What better message to drill in his head, over and over!I like books that rhyme for the little ones. It makes it more sing-songy which Jax tends to listen and pay attention to more. Since he's just a toddler, long books and uninteresting words don't go far with him. The repetition also helps as each page ended up with the same statement ""thank you Lord for everything!"" He's just putting together words and phrases now but I'm hoping this is one of the first sentences he remembers and says.The thing I like about this message is that it's a great reminder to be grateful for even the little things. Sometimes we forget to be thankful for food and shelter and things that we take for granted when there are those that do without. The little things to us are the big things to other and I think it's a great message to give our children as we approach the holiday season.The pictures are adorable and I think that's part of what kept Jax in tune. The first time through I pointed out some things I thought he'd like and remember since he's also learning to talk. I pointed out a ball, rabbit, bees and flowers. The next time through he pointed at them and said their names. Early reading is also a great tool for learning to talk and it's such a joy to share this with him.Thank you, Lord, for Everything became an instant favorite with my toddler and is a great book to read for the holidays and a message to reinforce all year!I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

"Odie is our first family pet so he might be a little bit spoiled! I admit I went overboard when we got him last year buying him everything I thought he would need. Of course, like my kids, I got it wrong the first time! I didn't know what to buy so often when left with a decision I just went with the cheapest option being the practical person that I am! When it comes to a dog bed, however, cheaper is not better; especially when you get what you pay for!I got his bed from a local store for around $10. It was cute but I noticed that the cushion went down pretty fast, especially after a few washes. When I ordered this bed from Blueberry Pet, I ordered the smallest size since Odie is just a five pound Chihuahua. I was literally shocked by it's size when it came! And it's not just the size I was impressed with; it was the quality.I couldn't get over how fat and fluffy it was! Odie wasted no time checking it out, and never did my one year old! He thought it was comfy enough for nap time! I guess I've been doing it all wrong with his sleep training too!Seriously though, the quality, amazing! My absolute favorite thing is the dog bone pillow. I mean how cute is that? It even has a little squeaker inside so it can double as a chew toy if they are so inclined!One side drops down so they can easily step inside without having to jump. I loved the colors and how it is two toned. The beige part happens to match my carpet perfectly, and my dog! It looks stylish but will also hide any hairs. It comes in other pretty colors and fun pattern options.The microsuede material is super soft and I've noticed when he gets up, it feels super warm where his body was. Chihuahua's are notorious for their shaking because they're always cold. Odie is short haired with no body fat so he needs all the help he can get staying warm! There is a zipper where you can remove the padding to get the outside cleaned and it's machine washable. It's a little hard to get it out and back in but luckily it's not something I'll need to do often.I figured I would keep his old bed in one room and this one in another since he tends to follow me and stay in whichever room I'm in. I noticed those days are over though because now he stays with the warmer, comfier bed every time!The Blueberry Pet bed is honestly a little bit pricey and more then I would want to pay. However, after seeing the extreme difference in quality I've realized that dog beds are one of those things where you get what you pay for!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13O0AFAWSXE8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MZ7VZC#wasThisHelpful","R13O0AFAWSXE8K","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hello sleep my old friend! I've been waiting for you! Ever since I had my first baby seven years ago, sleep has been a thing of the past! Just when I get one sleeping through the night, the next one enters a new stage or phase where sleep is once again a thing of the past.Jax is just twenty one months old so ideally he would still be in a crib. Unfortunately, he learned how to conquer the walls of his crib at seventeen months old! Next was the toddler bed that he would never stay in. Needless to say, I was desperate! Desperate for a sleep solution!Last weekend we got the boys bunk beds to save space in their shared room. I hoped that putting Jax in a ""big boy bed"" with his favorite character sheets might do the trick! The only problem was how to stop him from falling out of bed since he's still so young. I have seen a few different options but decided to go with a traditional bed rail.Reed had his for years and it seemed to be the best solution for a twin sized bed with a toddler. Unfortunately we got rid of it when we were ""done having kids!"" The Dreambaby Harrogate Bed Rail appealed to me because of it's ease of use and the fact that it's extra long and tall. With it's drop down sides it looked like the easiest way to be able to still change sheets and bedding without having to remove the whole thing.It's all one piece so there's no assembly. I just followed the easy directions. One thing that Reed's old rail didn't have that I really liked about this one was the straps that extended to the other side of the bed for added stability and security.I first put the two long rails under the mattress and then pulled the straps out to the other side and adjusted for a good fit. I liked that I could easily drop down the side by pulling up the two adjustments at the same time. It easily dropped down so that I could make the bed.It was easy to work the sheets and bedding around the rail without it getting in the way much.Once the bed was completely made I just pulled up and it clicked into place. This is my favorite feature! You hear the click and you know it's locked. With some other kinds you have to slide things around and line up until the red lock turned to green. I always struggled with our old one and this one is easy peasy!While I'd love to be able to say that he sleep through the night, he didn't. What I can say is that he didn't fall out of bed so the bed rail worked! I'm really happy with it's ease of use, quality and effectiveness! Now to work on the sleeping through the night part!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTG6X7G6JLUUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VVOSEMA#wasThisHelpful","RTG6X7G6JLUUU","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been way too long since I read a good book and The Girl Without a Name reinvigorated my love of reading! I read it cover to cover in a day; thank you for the day off Labor Day!This one had my hooked from page one; clearly since I never put it down! I always know the first couple pages and usually even by the first page if I will like or hate a book. This one got the love nod immediately.I have always been interested in Psychiatry so the main character Dr. Zoe Goldman immediately had my attention. The fact that she worked in a psych ward set the tone for me. It seems like such an interesting place to work and the colorful cast of patients confirmed that assumption! There is one patient that stands out and that is our girl without a name and so dubbed Jane Doe.Jane Doe seems to have come from nowhere and in her catatonic state, she isn't going to be helping to solve her mystery anytime soon. Zoe doubles as an investigator of sorts as she picks up on and follows clues that might lead to her identification. The story has many twists and turns as she unravels the clues, only to lead to more mysteries.I have to admit, I didn't see the end coming and I LOVE that about this book!

"While I received this product for free, the opinions and thoughts included in this review are my own.I have tried many different car and booster seats over the years between my three kids and I have finally found ""the one!"" I'm happy to say this is the last car seat/booster I will ever need since it's a 3-in-1! I never even knew there was such a thing before now and I am in love!In all honesty, I was initially attracted because of the colors! I know it's superficial but hey, if you have to look at something every day, you want to like it right?When it arrived I was thrilled at the quality. It is so solid and sturdy and really pays attention to detail. For me it's really the little things that shows a company cares about their product. For example, there are directions right on the seat in case you lose the separate ones it comes with (and don't we all?) I also love the little cushion that goes behind the seat belt. I have pinched every one of my children's sweet little thighs buckling them in a car seat. Those days are gone! Finally someone realized that something that is supposed to protect your child shouldn't injure them in use! There are also little cushions that go on the two arm straps for added comfort.Other details I love include the cup holder that's deep enough to support a sippie cup and the two pockets under it on each side where he can store things like a snack, pacifier or small toys like action figures! It's such a huge help for him to have all these things right at his fingertips!My son is well passed the infant stage but I still want him in a five point harness for safety as long as possible. This seat is good from 20 - 100 pounds and he's on the low end of that scale at around thirty pounds so the timing is perfect.The best thing about this seat is when he outgrows the five point harness, I don't have to buy the next seat. This transforms to a belted booster with a back and then a backless booster in a few easy steps! No more trading in and upgrading. This can be his last seat! The harnessed booster is good up to 65 pounds and I'll keep it that way until he hits the limit before converting. There is a one hand adjustment on the headrest to change as he grows taller.With three different reclining positions you can find the one that's just right for your child at the age and height they are and then change as they grow. This also easily reclines with one hand adjustment.I always like to play with my new ""toys"" when I get them so I did the conversions just to see how easy they are even though he's not ready for them yet. You can convert between the stages in a matter of minutes. I'll admit I had to look at the directions the first time but now that I know how it'll be easy when it comes time.I have always been sad to say goodbye to baby stages but now that I'm on my third, it's exciting to watch them grow, not sad! Even though Jax is my last baby and this will be the last seat he'll ever need, I'm thrilled with the seat itself and watching him grow through these stages.The Graco Nautilus three in one will supply all his needs until he outgrows it. This is by far my favorite seat so it's appropriate that it's also the last!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S174JHQPA98N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y285W8G#wasThisHelpful","R3S174JHQPA98N","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have all seen photos and videos of babies pick up their food and throw it across the room. Before becoming a parent, these were hilarious to me. Now, not so much. With three kids, I have had more than my fair share of messes to clean up, especially when it comes to food.Sometimes it really is the little things in life that can make things so much easier like this suction bowl and spoon. Why has no one thought of this sooner? We all know kids like to throw their food, so let's make it as hard for them as possible!I like that this bowl set has everything that you need to. The bowl itself is nice and large so you can put a whole meal in it. The suction ring at the bottom sticks to their tray or table, preventing the dreaded lifting and throwing the bowl. It also comes with a lid if you are on the go and want to bring their food with you and a spoon that snaps quite handily right onto the top. My only complaint is that the spoon it's self is a little bit narrow. It might be good for younger babies but it's a bit small for my 20 month old.Jax is no different than any other toddler/baby in that he likes to throw his food and whatever container they are inside of. It's such an age of exploration and discovery. While I encourage this in most areas, playing with their food and throwing it is not one of them! This suction bowl set nicely puts an end to all of that!It is dishwasher and microwave safe, as all things nowadays should but aren't. You do have to remove the suction ring before putting in the dishwasher which is kind of annoying but I prefer to just hand wash it quickly since it is now my favorite go to bowl anyway and I don't have time to wait for the dishwasher! But the option is there if you prefer the dishwasher.Jax is not happy about the inability to play with his suction bowl but I am and in this instance, that's all that matters!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFBH7OS642F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S15GUNM#wasThisHelpful","R2AFBH7OS642F4","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who remembers the magic of a simple sticker book? I remember when I was a kid that stickers were the most magical little things and I loved to collect them all! From puffy stickers to scratch-n-sniff, they were one of life's simple little pleasures.These are the kinds of things that are so fun to do with my own children because it makes me feel like a kid again! The Beginners Bible now offers up Sticker & Activity books! The latest are All About Jesus and Wild About Creation. They are both themed sticker and activity books that will keep your kids busy and happy for hours!With puzzles and activity pages in addition to the stickers, there are lots of fun Bible themed things to do! My six year old daughter dove right in and didn't come up for air until she had gone through most of the book. Some of her favorites were connect the dots and drawing her own picture where she added the included stickers.Since we are familiar with The Beginners Bible and all it's characters, this is a fun tie in to what we have been learning from them.The Beginners Bible All About Jesus Sticker and Activity Book is a fun and affordable thing for kids to do from Zonderkidz to emphasize what they have learned!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271B2WCUIK0OI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310746930#wasThisHelpful","R271B2WCUIK0OI","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yesterday I wrote about The Berenstain Bears Storybook Bible for Little Ones and today I have another fun title from The Berenstain Bears: Harvest Festival.Fall is my favorite season and I can already see the light beginning to change bringing the promise of the season! What better way to get in the mood that to settle in for story time with our favorite bears!The book begins with one of those things that always makes me think of fall and my childhood in New Hampshire: raking leaves and then jumping in the pile! I love that the harvest festival the bears attend involves many of my favorite things about fall including pumpkin pie, apple picking, visiting the pumpkin patch and a good old fashioned hayride.This book is chalk full of all the wonders of the season and while reading to my children, they recalled some of our own experiences with these same activities. Most people when asked will say that Christmas is their favorite holiday season but not in my house! We're about to enter my favorite!The end of the book has activities and questions from Brother and Sister Bear. I like to ask my kids these questions to make sure they were listening and to hear the way that they interpret things. In first and second grade they both have nightly required reading so this was a perfect book to read as well as to check their understanding of what it was about.The Berenstain Bears: Harvest Festival will get you in the mood for fall.

"This is such a fun set for little girls to enjoy! Actually, my little boys have been enjoying it too - shhhh - they don't want people to know they like something ""girly."" But seriously it is so nice to see things that involve building that aren't just blocks or things for boys! It's about time! The Learning Resources Sweet Shop Building Set is perfect for my six year old little girl. She loves to build and she loves sweets!The set has 82 pieces which is a good amount but not too much. It comes with fun stickers as well so that they can design their set.As I have discovered with all Learning Resources products we have tried, this set is really well made. I wasn't sure how well the gears would actually work but they turn amazingly well! Even though this set is designed for PreK+, it has withstood my rough and tumble toddler who loves to watch those gears spin! He bangs on them and they hold on pretty well!I love all the vibrant colors and watching the wheels turn in my daughters mine as she designed and put them together. She has asked to do this together several times. Once we opened the box I realized a bunch of pieces were missing and I discovered them in her play kitchen! She loves the little cupcakes and ice creams and so they double between this building set and playtime in her kitchen. I love things that have more then one use.Little girls love to build and play as much as boys do so it's really encouraging to find sets like the Sweet Shop Building Set that they can enjoy!This game was provided to me for review purposes.

"I have adored The Berenstain Bears since I was a little girl so it always makes their books extra special for me to share with my kids. The Berenstain Bears Storybook Bible for Little Ones is created for 2 - 4 year olds so I read it with my almost two year old son Jax.This is a board book which is always good for the little hands that tend to tear delicate pages. Jax likes to hold the book in his cute, chubby little hands and turn the pages himself.This isn't typical of the Berenstain Bears books because while it shows the bears as the characters in the illustrations, they are appearing as characters in the Bible, not as themselves. This is basically a Bible storybook but everyone in it is a Bear!This isn't the entire Bible but some of the main stories that kids usually learn first as little ones such as the story of creation, the birth of Jesus and his Resurrection.I like that the illustrations are just like the regular Berenstain Bear books so people who love them and are fans will appreciate the illustrations. However, they are not those typical of Bible storybooks. As I mentioned, they are all bears as the characters and they are kind of light and muted in color whereas most storybooks are brighter.As a fan of the bears, I loved sharing The Berenstain Bears Storybook Bible for Little Ones with Jax and that he is now a fan of the bears and has started pulling them off the shelf to read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OW8XEMV12Q4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310749417#wasThisHelpful","R1OW8XEMV12Q4P","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you like your beverage hot or cold; the Ozeri Serafino double wall insulated beverage and coffee glasses hold it all!Lately I've been really into iced coffee but I'm always worried about glasses breaking when dealing with hot and cold beverages. For iced coffee I filled these with ice, then put it under my coffee maker where hot coffee went directly onto the ice. There was no cracking or breaking and I feel like something that starts out cold and ends up hot is the ultimate test!These glasses are beautiful to look at with their double layer and have a very unique appealing look to them. My kids are obsessed with these glasses and want to use them for their juice but they are a mommy only item!They are definitely delicate though and should be treated with care. I had one break in the dishwasher just from going through a normal cycle so I decided these should be hand wash only. While they are technically dishwasher safe, they should be separate from anything else if you are going to run them through.I love that these Serafino glasses hold both hot and cold beverages and are so nice to look at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7E2ZWFTAZEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TA1IUW#wasThisHelpful","R1N7E2ZWFTAZEH","A30X9M0J5WOVAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30X9M0J5WOVAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids love to do their own experiments, even if it means they don't have any official equipment or direction! It's fun to play with these things and educational insights helps do it safely with the Stir-it-Up Chemistry Lab.This set comes up most things you need to complete the experiments but not everything. Other things needed are usually household items you will have on hand like baking soda and white vinegar. I do wish it included every single thing so that when the box was opened it was good to go. We had trouble locating a few random things like a balloon (only around for birthdays) and candle (I go flameless). However, the kids had fun playing with the little vials and pretending they were doing things while we were on the hunting for the needed items.The guidebook tells you step by step exactly what to do and what you will need for each experiment. It also includes a pair of safety goggles so that their eyes are protected. Safety first! I happened to have a spare pair on hand so that both kids could do this together.Daddy helped out with the experiment while I gathered everything we needed so it was fun that the whole family could do it together.Since we didn't have everything on hand the first time we just did the experiments we did have things for like extinguishing the candle flame by creating our own gas. The kids thought this was the coolest thing ever and wanted to do it over and over again.Since they are also huge Star Wars fans they were obsessed with the idea of making their own lava in a bottle!The kids loved doing these experiments and ask every day if they can be scientists! While I do wish that the kit came with at least some of the required elements, I do see the appeal of being able to do multiple experiments using household items.The kit comes with all the scientific items required including the beaker, test tubes and rack to keep them in, graduated cylinder and lab glasses and more!

It has the classic Batman Logo on front and the inclusion of the cape on the back is adorable. I like the zipper pocket on the bottom where I can put an ice pack or additional food.However, that's there the positives end. I ran into a major problem when I went to pack it. It is way too small! I can't fit a normal sized water bottle or thermos in it without laying it diagonal and taking up too much space.

"Unlike another silicone muffin pan I have that is so floppy I can't really use it except for very stiff doughs, this one has stiffer sides and holds up well for making mini egg-based quiche muffins that I freeze and use for portion-controlled breakfasts. I like the straight sides a lot, which make it very easy to remove the contents. The pan is still flexible, but not too much. It cleans up well in the dishwasher, and any spots that the dishwasher might leave are easily removed by rubbing a very small amount of coconut oil onto the pans surface. I can't use it with the turntable in my microwave because of its shape, because it is too long to rotate freely, but that is true of any pan like this.

"I got these to go with my Presto percolator, and they are perfect for it. The filters cover up the little holes in the bottom of the basket so no grounds get through. However, there is a slightly bad off taste to the coffee when I use these, and all I can figure is that it's because they are bleached. I pulled the stainless steel screen off my little-used 32-oz. French press and that fits great, gets the same job done, and no more bad taste. If you tend to be sensitive to slight differences in flavors, you might want to try that instead.

"I'm an original Pebble watch user (the white one in my photos), and I've also tried several fitness-type bands (Fitbit, Misfit, etc.). I have an Amazon Fire Phone that I use to port music to my hearing aids via Bluetooth; I don't have a cellular service on it because I'm slow to the whole smart phone thing and can't justify the cost, but one day I'll get one. I did go through the motions of pairing this U8 smart watch to my phonepiece of cakeand installing the BT Notification appwhich requires sideloading because it's not available in the Amazon app store for the Fire Phone. I couldn't test the specific phone-related features (e.g., answering and making calls), but the phone book import feature seemed to work well. The Bluetooth, when enabled, interferes with the reception of my hearing aids from my Fire Phone (naturally), so I disabled it, disconnected the U8 from my phone after testing, and uninstalled BT Notification. That's not why I wanted to get this phone smart watch.What this watch is GREAT for as a standalone is all kinds of health tracking activities. All of the features I've posted in my photos work without connecting to an external device except for the pedometer; the U8 doesn't have its own accelerometer like the Pebble watch does. I track my steps and mileage using the Endomondo app on my phone strapped to my arm, so I don't need that feature, but if step-counting without having to use something else is important to you, this won't do it. The altimeter works by measuring altitude from the point at which you click the reset button, which can be useful if you climb a lot of hills. The stopwatch counts up in seconds/milliseconds increments; I wish there were a countdown timer/alarm feature as well, because I would use that more, but it's good to have the stopwatch.But reminders! Oh MY! There are so many different ways to configure this watch, and they all work together: Vibrate every hour on the hour; five different alarms you can configure independently to work once, every day, or on days of your choice; a ""Rest"" feature with four separately configurable times and day(s) and a funky Beethoven's Fifth alert (da-da-da-dah...); the same thing in a ""Drink"" feature but with eight instead of four and a glub-glub alert to remind yourself to drink more water. You can use these as intended or for other forms of tracking, like for taking supplements and meds. And, unlike my Pebble, I can actually read the screen to set these things up.The settings are all done the same on the different reminders and the time setting could not be easier or more intuitive. (Good thing, too, because the printed instructions that come with this watch are impossible to read and understand.) You can actually put together some pretty sophisticated Tabata or Pomodoro-type sequences using a combination of all these timers. You have a choice of five different ringtone types, three of which are really dorky but two that are kind of uplifting (1 and 4), plus the ability to choose ring-only, vibrate-only, or ring and vibrate modes. I have my morning wakeup alarm set to both vibrate and ring, my ""go walking"" alarm set to just ring, and my ""go to sleep"" set to vibrate only as a gentle reminder that I'm supposed to be going to sleep without waking me up if I'm already nodding. I haven't yet played with the sleep monitoring feature because I always forget to start it.It would be extraordinary if there were a way to add in a short notification for each of these reminders (""walk,"" ""lunch,"" ""morning meds,"" etc.), but for the price of this watch, what it does just cannot be beat. You'd have to be able to load apps onto it, like you can with the Pebble watch, for this added functionality, and that would add cost to the watch. I keep a calendar in Taco on my ""New Tab"" window with what I have to do, so when my U8 vibrates or rings, I can always glance up and see what I'm supposed to be doing if I forget.The biggest ""con"" is that I cannot choose to keep the screen on for longer than 3 minutes max. I would like to be able to keep the time visible while I'm out walking for an hour so I can just glance at it without having to press a button. (I thought that by turning off Power Saving, it would leave the screen on, but this is not what happens. I have no idea what that setting does, actually.) Another ""con"" is that, while you CAN select 12-hour or 24-hour clock settings, you cannot select imperial instead of metric measurements for things like height, weight, and pace (pedometer). You are stuck with centigrade for the temperature setting in the barometer. I would very strongly recommend to the manufacturer that they give American users a way of selecting the measurements they are used to. (Yes, I know, we should get with the rest of the world, but many of us have spent our entire lives using the ""wrong"" system and we're too old and set in our ways now to be able to cope with the alternative!)Anyway, I'm pretty pleased with this watch, which I was given in exchange for my unbiased review. It's just an incredibly useful little tool, even without being connected to a smart phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTQO430ZA7F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158CCLFG#wasThisHelpful","R2CTQO430ZA7F1","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this exact same percolator about ten years ago and made the mistake of following somebody's advice to wash it by putting dishwasher detergent in it and running it through a perk cycle. This served to pit the metal piece on the bottom that the percolator spindle seats down into, and metal started flaking off into the coffee. I stopped using it because I was afraid of being poisoned and was thinking I'd try to find the parts to replace that piece at some point.I finally broke down and just bought another pot. It's the exact same pot I had before, and it works exactly the same way. I read somewhere that percolators burn your coffee, so this time I took pains to measure the temperature of the water both immediately after perking and after it has sat there for a while. As soon as I was able to remove the lid after perking, meaning the water had cooled somewhat, my reading was 188 degrees F, and then it hovered around 186 thereafter. This seems about right to me, because I figure the water is probably perking through the grounds at a little higher temp but not by much. The coffee sites recommend to brew from 195 to 205 degrees F, so that's pretty darned close for something you don't have to do anything to.I did invest in a package of those disk-shaped coffee filters, and I have no trouble whatsoever with coffee grounds in my coffee. The first few pots of coffee I made in it (after washing the pot out first as instructed, of course) didn't taste very goodthen it dawned on me that maybe it was the bleached filters. I put the screen from my little-used 32-oz. French press into the basket instead (fits perfectly!), and the taste problem disappeared so that must have been it.We make 8 cups (which is actually 40 oz. of water, not 64 oz.), and that's just right for the two of us to have two full mugs of coffee in the morning. Using the ""1 coffee scoop for 2 cups"" method, with ""one for the pot"" on top of that, the coffee strength is just right for us. (I use a 1/8-cup scoop, which is 1 oz. or 2 level tablespoons.) After we finish our coffee, I immediately dump the grounds and rinse out the pot, then leave it unassembled to dry out during the day. At night, I prepare the next morning's pot, which is on a timer so it'll be ready when we wake up. But it doesn't take long to perk a pot; figure about one minute per cup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ9OLLGU9DRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IV0Q#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ9OLLGU9DRA","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very special tea, an experience that I really was not expecting. I don't know a lot about teas, only that up until recently I haven't really wanted to drink much tea. I have to cut back on coffee because of my osteoporosis, so I've been exploring lower-caffeine alternatives like green and herbal teas.

Unlike the green tea, which is bagged loose, this tea is packaged as 20 ""sachets,"" pre-measured amounts of the little pearls of tea suitable for a serving (which can be refreshed several times). You can see from my photos how much one sachet is, both dried and brewed for a minute or two.I was unprepared for how marvelously scented this tea is. What starts out as interesting little balls unfolds into very fine end tips of tea with the most heady jasmine scent you can imagine. This is not a tea for gulping down while you're doing something else. No, it is to be lingered over, to disappear into, to take a flight from the everyday into a peaceful, blissful space. Think a long, slow soak in a fragrant bath...a mindful walk in fresh air after a cleansing rain...a meditation on all that is beautiful in this world. That's what drinking this tea is like.If you are entertaining and want to give your guests a special experience, you can't go wrong with this tea.

"I am not a tea conossieur, but I've got osteoporosis and have been told by my doctor to cut back on the amount of coffee I drink and caffeine I consume. I was buying your typical bagged green and herbal teas from the grocery store and was not thrilled about the taste. I found myself not drinking any at all and craving more coffee.I know green tea is touted as being very good for you, health-wise, so when I was offered a bag of this green tea in exchange for my honest review, I thought I'd try it and see if it was any better. Boy howdy, is it. The grocery store bagged green tea has a bitter flavor no matter how long or short of a time I steep it and the color is more brownish-green. This loose green tea brews to a beautiful light golden-green color with a delicate, non-bitter, somewhat grassy taste. I brew it in one of my nice little tea infuser cups, and I can fill the infuser three times on one 3- to 5-gram serving of the tea. That's more than 24 ounces of water plus the tea, both of which are good for my health. It's an enjoyable habit to get into every afternoon.The bag is large and the tea will last a long time even if imbibed every day. I really like watching how the flat lengths of dried tea reconstitute in water to show the tea leaves and stems. It's a decidedly more pleasurable experience than the old yucky teabag one. Less trash, too. I may even try eating the spent leaves in salads or throwing them into smoothies because the leaves will still have nutrients even when spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26G6I3P2DI2XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011WP57U4#wasThisHelpful","R26G6I3P2DI2XK","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Exactly what I needed to be able to use an outlet on a kitchen wall that's low to the floor and behind shelving. I've got two Origami square shelves along that wall that we use to keep our large-quantity Costco products on, on the lower shelves, and rarely used pots, pans, etc., up high on the top shelf. Because the kitchen is small with not very much counter space, and only two outlets there, I wanted something that would allow me to plug in things like my rice cooker, crock pot, and water kettle on the remaining working-height shelves so they aren't cluttering up my counters.The problem in the past has been that those big surge-suppressor type strips are just too big and bulky and we can't really mount them on the wall up where we can reach them because this is an apartment that prohibits that. But this extension cord hangs tidily from the top shelf by a hook and gives me three grounded plugs for my appliances. The only thing that could make this better is if it had a rocker switch to turn off the power, but it's easy to unplug things when they are not in use and replug them in when I need them, so I am quite happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GK7QR89474D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZON7Y6#wasThisHelpful","R2GK7QR89474D","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not worn makeup in years, but when I got new tortoise shell glasses, I realized I needed a little something to brighten my skin because the contrast of the dark frames against my sixtysomething skin is pretty intense.This kit is large with a number of colors that can be mixed or used individually for various effects. The effects are subtle, which is a good thing for me because I detest the look of most heavy makeup. The kit does not come with its own brushes, so you need to have makeup brushes to use it. I like that I can twirl a brush into the different ""pots"" and brighten up my skin when I'm going out. The powders are not drying, and they feel smooth on my skin. Again, subtle. I don't know how these would combine with the usual liquid foundation many women use because I don't use it, but I would think  the different colors could be used for some nice subtle contouring.

"I love this beautiful stainless steel spice bowl. Some might want to use this for sugar, but we don't really use sugar in our house. What I plan to use this for is salt beside the stove. The little spoon holds exactly half a teaspoon, which is the perfect size for adding salt to foods. I particularly like the weight of the lid; it's a good heavy stainless steel that's a pleasure to use. It's stable and elegant.

"I've been seeing these Pure Komachi-type knives in the stores and online and have wondered about how good they are. I have a set of Victorinox kitchen knives (chef, paring, and slicing) that I like, but the slicer and chef's knife are both a bit big for me (I'm under 5' tall and have short arms), so I wind up using the paring knife (also a pretty big parer) for most cutting-board tasks. When I was offered this set of Kai Pure Komachi HD knives in exchange for my honest review, I thought I'd give them a try.What can I say? I love them. I've never owned a Santoku knife before, and I really like the balance and feel of this one. It's lightweight but very sharp, and it glides through whatever I'm chopping with ease. I didn't realize I'm more of a top-down chopper (which is what the Santoku is designed for) than a rocker-chopper (chef knife's forte), but I am. So the Santoku is much more comfortable and less stressful to use for me.The purple multi-purpose knife is the one I will probably use the least. I don't do a lot of boning or scaling, but that is what this knife is mainly for. It has serrations on half the blade, closest to the handle, allowing for a steady, strong grip, plus a very sharp point for getting into joints and slicing tendons.I think I may like the paring knife the best of the three. The shape is wider and a little shorter than my Victorinox parer, so it gives me a lot of control. It can also be used to chop with a rocking motion for things that I tend to chop often (celery, herbs, carrots, onion halves), and it matches my silicone cutting board. I just leave it out, in its silicone sheath, so it's always at hand for food prep. My magnetic knife strip is full of other knives, so the other two Pure Komachi knives will be kept in a drawer, but they do stick to the strip. I'm more likely to reach for the Santoku now than my chef's knife, and my other parer will likely be used by my partner instead of me.I used to think the colored coatings on Komachi knives were kind of gimmicky, but they serve two purposes: (1) they cause food to glide off the blades instead of sticking, further reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency, and (2) they are color-coded so you can keep them for separate meat- and vegetable-cutting tasks. The silicone sleeves are great for protecting both the knives and your fingers. I highly recommend these knives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R174BIU4WM4SCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016N6YVFE#wasThisHelpful","R174BIU4WM4SCF","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few drops of this muscle relief essential oil blend is marvelous in a bath after a workout. I also find it very helpful to knock back the itching and pain of a tibial tuberosity (""bump"" on my kneecap) that plagues me on occasion. I blend a few drops into some coconut carrier oil I have, and it goes a long, long, long way.

"I was really excited for the opportunity to be given a sample of this multi-functional automatic breadmaker in exchange for my honest review. It has 19 different programs for all kinds of things, not just different varieties of breads (including quick, sweet, and traditional loaves of all kinds) but also jams, rice wine, yogurt, and ""stir-fry"" (which I gather from the instructions really is for roasting things like peanuts, not stir-frying as most people think of the term). The yogurt setting, especially, is what I was most interested in, although I was interested to see if you can roast canned garbanzo beans to make a healthy, crunchy snack.This is a very sophisticated breadmaker, but you need to have the space for it. I was disappointed that, in my typically small apartment kitchen, there is just no place to put it to be able to use it. First, it doesn't really fit underneath the cabinets because you can't open up the lid enough to get the baking pan into it. Even when I move everything out of the way and pull it out all the way to the edge of the countertop, turning it sideways so I can get into it better, the lid still hits against the bottom of the cabinet and I have difficulty getting the bread pan in and out. Too, the little rubber feet tend to come off when sliding the appliance out, which is a pain. I tried moving the whole thing to a large Origami shelf I have in a corner of my kitchen, but even with a substantial amount of room between the shelves, the lid won't fully open, the shelf really isn't level enough, and I have to crawl underneath the shelf practically to unplug the unit after each use, which is just too much.Because I'm under five feet tall and this breadmaker sits up so high on the countertop, I can only look at the digital readout from a side angle, and you really need to be able to look down on it to see the readout well. I have had this trouble with other digital displays. Unlike other breadmakers I have owned in the past there is a lot of extra space around the bread pan when it is inserted, which is a good thing for allowing for air circulation, even baking, and good color; it does make for a bigger appliance, however.The instructions caution you not to add ingredients to the pan while it is inserted in the machine to prevent dropping ingredients onto the heating coils, but it's very hard to put the pan into the machine properly with ingredients already in it, especially if you are trying to keep the yeast dry. If you are careful, I see no reason why you couldn't just add the ingredients to the pan when it is inserted into the machine.Two things bother me, but they are more cosmetic than anything else: The hinged lid has a good bit of float to it, so when you close the lid it oftens closes off-kilter and has to be repositioned. If I weren't trying to work with it in such a crammed spacewhich is the fault of my space, not the breadmakerthis probably would not be an issue. I do find the ""Quality Life of Petty Bourgeois"" emblazoned on the side to be weird. Maybe it's just because I'm American; maybe in the rest of the world that slogan would not seem so dated and odd.This breadmaker really is better suited for a large kitchen with plenty of open countertop space and no cabinets overhead. It needs to be placed in a dedicated spot where it doesn't have to be moved and where you can get to the plug to unplug it easily. The cord is amply long, which is really good, so if you've got the space and if you're tall enough that you can stand facing directly down over the digital readout and not have to look at it at an angle, this might work well for you. For those who are trying out using a breadmaker as a cooking utensil (and I know that's a trend these days), this may be just what you're looking for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23ES1EJEFL7BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XHRMB0U#wasThisHelpful","R23ES1EJEFL7BE","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was not quite prepared for how DIVINE this moisturizing oil smells. Do you work someplace where your hair takes on smells that aren't that wonderful (e.g., cigarette smoke, food) and want to spiff up before a date? Just a few drops of this stuff run through your hair, and you will be instantly refreshed. It's got lavender and sweet almond oil scents, but it doesn't smell like lavender (which I tend not to be fond of), not really. I don't know how to describe it. It's just awesome! It also feels great on the skin. I have very dry skin on my arms, and I rubbed just a few drops into my palms, then rubbed them over my forearms. Without any greasiness, my skin feels softer and smoother, and of course I smell fantastic. One drop on a tissue in my underwear drawer...instant freshness. The scent is absolutely intoxicating.

I had an old ratty square pillow I got at the thrift store that was the perfect size for this case, and it immediately transformed the corner chair that it was placed on.

"These silicone spoon rests are really big, big enough to protect your countertop no matter how large of a kitchen utensil you try to rest on one of them. The well holds about 3/4 cup of liquid, that's how big they are. I was actually thinking I might be able to use these for poaching eggs in a skillet, but they are really too floppy for that purpose. I would like them better if they were a little less floppy, but they work fine for their stated purpose.

"This is a very nicely designed and packaged fingertip pulse oximeter. The included lanyard works either with the oximeter itself or with the included carrying case. The carrying case has both a belt loop and a plastic keychain-type ring. The oximeter works with two AAA batteries, which are included, and gives a quick and easy-to-read reading. The reading doesn't freeze, so you can see real-time fluctuations, which will be handy for anyone using one of these while exercising.When I first received this and tried to use it, I thought it was defective because I could not get a display. The battery case has the springs that I associate with the negative ends of the battery aligned together on one end, and at first I put the batteries both in with the negative poles on the springs. No love. But then I looked in the case and saw that the +/- were inverted, as on many battery cases, so I reversed one of the batteries (thinking it wouldn't work because of the spring being in the wrong place) and it then worked just fine. So be aware of this. Don't let the spring positions fool you, in other words.I will use this oximeter to take readings when I am biking on my indoor cycle. It is not designed for medical use.

"I was given this product in exchange for my honest review. I want to point out, first, that the company has been fantastic to work with. The first unit I received was defective and had to be replaced, which they did quickly. They gave me a shipping label and RA# to return the defective product so they can return it to the manufacturer, which turned out to be a bit of a hassle because I had to take it up to the UPS store, but the new one arrived quickly and worked fine out of the box. I had to uninstall all the software and reinstall it. The person I worked with made himself available 24/7 to help me get things set up. The company gets five stars.I have an Amazon Fire Phone, and the Amcrest View Lite app WAS available for it. (This is not true of a lot of apps; often I have to sideload apps to the Fire Phone, and sometimes they just won't work.) However, scanning the QR code did not work so I had to try manually entering the serial number. This did not work either, so I moved on to my MacBook Pro, thinking it was a Fire Phone issue. I don't have a disk drive on my Mac, so I downloaded the configuration software and installed it that way. Again, I had to manually enter the serial number, which is tiny and hard to read, but I managed to get the camera installed. It was recognized immediately. Not only that, the Fire Phone app then recognized the camera. Go figure!I stood in front of the camera with my Fire Phone and discovered there is a slight lag in recognition of movements. This is not a big deal. When I turn on the sound, there is feedback, but that might be because the phone was so close to the camera. (I don't have a cellular service, so I can't check the phone/camera interface from a distance, so I'll have to wait until I do get service before I can tell how well it's going to work for distance monitoring.) I was pretty impressed with how the camera can pan the whole room, and it's a stable, tidy camera and the images are high resolution and sharp. The app can toggle between a single full view and a view from four different cameras (if you have that many).Before I can really put this camera through its paces, I'm going to have to spend more time with the user manual. Fortunately, you can download the full manual from the amcrest website. I don't particularly like the fact that I have to use Safari or Internet Explorer instead of Chrome; this is a deficiency, in my view. (I mean, who uses Internet Explorer? And I don't use Safari because I have a Chromebook as my second machine and I want the experience to be seamless between the two of them.)But the camera is well made and versatile. You have choices of how you want to store your images and video recordings, if it's important to you to be able to save them. For me, my intended use will be as a pet monitor and a way of reassuring my nutso dog if we go out without him. I see no reason, now that everything is installed and operative, why the distance viewing feature won't work well. I just have to get a cellular account so I can take full advantage of it.

"The best part of this set, which I was given in exchange for my honest review, is the spatula. It is the perfect size for turning eggs in an 8"" skillet: not too big, not too small. The soup ladle only holds about a third of a cup, which is a good size for portion control, and the slotted spoon and noodle ladle are good for a number of uses. I really like that these are silicone molded over plastic, which lends strength to the utensils that you don't get with silicone alone. The only thing I don't like about these is that I wish the plastic over which the silicone is molded were more of a bright white. They look at little yellowish, and I would prefer that they not be so. But other than the color, this is a very sturdy, useful set.

"If you are used to strong chemical fragrances, you might think there's nothing special about this Luseta Coconut Milk Shampoo and Conditioner for dry and normal hair because you aren't immediately knocked out by perfume. That's a GOOD thing! Especially for people who are chemically sensitive, but those who appreciate less chemically concocted products will benefit too. I love the gentle scent of coconut, and I really love the fact that there are no parabens in this formulation because I am allergic to them.I have short, curly, salt-and-pepper grey hair that has a tendency to do the ""rooster"" number on me. This shampoo tames the spikies and frizzies while leaving my hair soft and shiny and my hard-earned grey shimmering in the light.

"These reuseable chalkboard labels are great for labeling smooth surfaces.

However, because the jars have raised markings (the name, the measurements, and decorative touches), the labels don't lie flat and so do not look as good as they do on a flat surface.

"I have been researching both manual and electric ceramic burr grinders for some months now. The electric ones that get good ratings are frightfully expensive, and even the highest-rated manual grinders are costly. I had to return a cheaper electric grinder because it failed within a few weeks of buying it, and I've been coarse-grinding my whole beans in Costco's grinder for my French press until I could decide what else I can do. When I was offered this iNeibo stainless steel manual coffee grinder in exchange for my unbiased review, I leapt at the chance to try it.My only experience with a manual grinder is an old brass Turkish coffee grinder i picked up on eBay years ago when one of the chef shows recommended it for grinding pepper. It was impossible to grind coffee with because the handle was only about 3"" long and it took literally forever to grind coffee. (Back then I was trying to grind for espressono way!) The handle on this iNeibo grinder is much longer, so grinding is not such a chore. I turned the adjustment screw (easy because it's got a plastic thumb-screw on it) counter-clockwise to adjust the grind coarser and just ground a few beans until I got the grind like I wanted it; for finer grind, you turn the screw clockwise. I was then able to fill the grinder with beans and get a grind that was as consistent as the Costco grinder gives menot perfect, but adequatebut it was fresher and the coffee tasted better.I'll be honest: although grinding goes more quickly than I expected with this grinder, it's still a relatively slow process. Anyone who wakes up first thing in the morning staggering around until they get their caffeine infusion is not likely to have the patience to manually grind their coffee. But for the purist who makes coffee ritualistically and appreciates freshly ground beans enough to put the work into itand who, like me, can't afford hundreds of dollars for a top-quality electric ceramic burr grinderthis grinder will be appreciated. It is well made, the handle fits solidly onto the turn bolt at the top but removes easily for storage, and the whole thing stays reliably together while grinding no matter what angle you hold it. It is also comfortable to hold. It's a little tricky at first to figure out how to get the coffee receptacle off because it fits so snugly, but once you've done it a time or two, it's a snap. I recommend this grinder to anyone wishing to experience a really good cup of coffee.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4RPKPOBQ47H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015E6WBTC#wasThisHelpful","R1I4RPKPOBQ47H","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After having worn so many plastic and pleather watch straps that irritate my skin, what a pleasure it is to wear a watch with a real leather band. This is billed as a man's watch, but after wearing an original Pebble watch for a while, I find it's no bigger than that and the larger size would not bother me. But I won't be wearing it because it's going to be the perfect gift for a certain guy in my life. The watch comes beautifully prepared for giving in a nice gift box with puffy pillow inside and even a gift bag.It's a beautiful, minimalist style watch, definitely suitable for business attire. If you're used to digital watches, especially atomic ones, you may find setting it and keeping the day/date windows lined up with the calendar a little fiddly, but start with the instructions and you'll be fine. (Don't do what I did and try to set the watch without reading them first. I did this, and wound up having to turn the crown repeatedly to get back to the proper date because that setting only advances in one direction.)For the day-of-the-week setting, there are selections in (I think) French that might be seasons, but I have no idea what they mean. There was nothing in the instructions about this. The days of the week are in English. The face is clean and modern but with a traditional feel, and the whole thing exudes elegance. The Swiss movement seems very precise, snapping through the seconds like your grandfather's watch used to do. A very clean, very elegant, stylish watch at a price that cannot be beat. I was given this watch in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZX0ZTPVE99Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153IMS7G#wasThisHelpful","RZX0ZTPVE99Z","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I design book covers for a small independent press (futurecycle dot org) on a frayed-shoestring budget. I'm completely self-taught, so I'm always on the lookout for two things: inexpensive (i.e., free) art and incentives to be more creative and learn new things. Let me say right up front that I know precious little about how to take good photos, although I can appreciate good ones when I see them. For this reason, I have been timid about shooting my own photos. But I have a Fire Phone with a 13MP camera with high-def capabilities, so when I was offered this 3-in-1 lens kit at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I thought I'd try it and see if it might seduce me into doing more shots for use as backgrounds on my covers.The attached photos are my very first experiments with this lens kit. I was sloppy with it, but I was able to get a feel for what these lenses can do. Although the fisheye lens has potential for some thingsnow that I see how it bends the image, I want to try doing some deliberately distorted shots for further croppingI was mainly interested in the macro lens for taking shots, then applying effects and enhancements in Perfect Photo Studio. I've included a few examples using ON1 and Photomorphis presets.As you can see, you have to be careful to clip the lens on so as to clear the edge of the lens or shadows in the original shot may be magnified in post-processing. I took these photos without benefit of a stabilizing tripod, so some of the blur is not the lens' fault. I look forward to playing with this kit to see what kinds of effects I can achieve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CIJKDDN8EWNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148046K2#wasThisHelpful","R3CIJKDDN8EWNZ","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to get terribly excited about a hydration bladder, but this one seems well-made and durable. It is of the non-pressurized type, which many find preferable because they are less complicated to use than the pressurized ones. Other bladders on the market have wider openings that you can get your hand into for cleaning, but this bladder's opening is large enough and it's not as expensive as those other bladders. (The main thing when using a hydration bladder is not to leave it with old water in it shut up; when finished with it for an outing, rinse it out well with some water and a little baking soda and hang it up open to dry. Be sure to flush the tubing, too.)

"I'm a sixtysomething woman who is supposed to be exercising more, and while I'm planning to take a yoga class at the community center near me, so far I'm basically just trying to get in the habit of doing floor exercises at home. This mat works well on my cheap apartment-style carpeting (which tends to burn my skin during workouts), stays flat and put, and rolls up easily to tuck behind a chair or under a table when I'm done. It's solid but not heavy. I like the two ways the straps can be positioned for carrying, too, so when I do get my act together to head out the door, I'll be set.I was given this mat in the Purity style, along with the matching towel that fits it perfectly, in exchange for my honest review. I've looked at various yoga mats and haven't known which would be the best to get, but I very much like the fact that this is made of natural tree rubber, which is a renewable resource. You're supposed to be able to flip this mat over to work on the black side for ""hot"" yoga (whatever that is), but I prefer to use the towel-surface side for body contact. You don't have to use a towel with it, but if I'm doing something to make me really sweat, I do. Also, I have a mild latex allergy, and I'm assuming ""natural rubber"" means latex. So far, I have not had any problems with a reaction but, again, I have not worked out with the black side facing up.Anyway, what can I say? It's pretty. Anything that helps me have a positive feeling about exercising helps me develop the habit to do it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PAFOZN79S247/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZG25L4M#wasThisHelpful","R1PAFOZN79S247","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty bright light with a nice hanging loop and, if you need it, an included hook with adhesive for hanging it up. It plugs into the USB port of a computer or power bank, and this is where it gets its power. It has an on/off switch on the cord, but it doesn't hold any kind of charge.

"These white mulberries are really tasty! Too tasty, actually...so be sure to portion control them. I'm always trying to find healthy, nutrient-dense foods to incorporate into my healthy clean-eating diet to give myself some variety and a bit of naughtiness without going completely ape and off-diet so I gain back the 83 lbs. I've so painstakingly lost. I don't have much of a problem with sugar, and these mulberries are naturally sweet but not too sweet, so I like that about them. They have a subtle, complex flavor that's satisfying just rolled around on the tongue. I will most likely use these as tide-me-over nibbles and also as a sweetness booster for green smoothies. The only thing I don't love about them is that some of the berries still have stems on them that I have to removebut, come to think of it, that actually serves to slow me down. Which is a good thing!

"Well, whodda thunk it? With all of our technological gizmos and battery-hungry everythings, this simple solution is really the best. Put your items of clothing inside one of these bags, zip it up at the top about 95% closed, then roll up the bag. This presses the air out through the tiny remaining opening, which you then seal down when all the air has been pressed out. You can leave the bag rolled up, or you can flatten it back out. It looks like you've taken a vacuum cleaner to it.I'm not giving these five stars for the simple reason that the little tab thing at the top seems to be useless and acts more to confuse you than anything. I thought at first it was like one of those zipper-like tabs on ziplock bags that help you make sure the bag is being sealed. However, by gliding this tab back and forth, it did nothing. To actually seal the bag (which has two rows of strong but easily sealed-down surfaces), you have to press down with your thumbs, just like you'd do with a standard ziplock freezer bag. This is not big deal. I thought maybe the clip was supposed to be used to keep rolled-up bags rolled up, but if that were what that plastic tab is for, there should be two of them per bag.But, anyway, I like these. I got them in exchange for my honest review; otherwise, I doubt I would have tried them. But now that I have, I'm glad I've got them. I don't travel, but I do have to pack up things for the winter. I can't stand the smell of mothballs, so packing sweaters in these will not only save space; it will help keep the moths away. In the summer, I'd think one of these bags could be use to keep wet bathing suits from dripping all over your car or even to keep the smell of yucky dirty cloth diapers at bay (although you'd need to dedicate any bags used this way to just that use). If you are in a situation where you need to remove most of the air for a good long while, like when you're trying to kill insect eggs, these bags should do the trick. Just don't let your kids play with them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NBLK5P57N59X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SONHMY#wasThisHelpful","R2NBLK5P57N59X","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a very small head and faceso small that I've been known to look for sunglasses in the kids' departmentbut the way the ear pieces subtly wrap around my head keeps these snug on my face.

"Here's my experience with the 8-pack of vinyl weekly wall planner stickons, which I received in exchange for my honest review. This is an excellent value for the price, and I would have bought something like this six months ago when I was looking for something for my home office to help me visualize the big picture of tasks I was tracking in Taco. (Instead, I shelled out $$$ for a big laminated thing I've got pinned to my wall with push pins.)I live in an apartment with a prohibition against tacking up stuff on the walls, and it's your typical bland ivory cheap paint. Very hesitantly I peeled back a portion of the backside of one of the times and stuck it up on the wall to see (1) how hard it would be to get on straight, (2) how well it would adhere, andmost importantlyhow hard it would be to remove and if removal would cause damage.(1) Not hard if you don't peel off the entire backing at once. Those who have installed screen protectors on their phones already know what to do: peel back the edge and get it going straight and positioned like you want it, then slowly pull of the rest, pressing to apply and remove any bubbles that might form. I had no trouble in my test with bubbles.(2) It adheres quite well. I did not test it over many hours to see if it would loosen or the edges curlI will update you if that should occurbut in the initial test, it sticks very well.(3) Yes, it can be removed without damage. But only if you are careful to pull it off slowly. I expect if you tripped one of these off quickly, it might take the paint off with it, especially cheap paint.Because I don't need these for my original purpose, I'm thinking of doing something decorative over the head of my bed with these. My color scheme in my home office/bedroom is taupe, cream, grey, brown, and black, so the black chalkboard material will balance my 40"" TV screen on the other side of the room. The set comes with one stick of that really porous chalk like they use in schools, but I have some much-harder fine-point chalk sticks that came with this nice little chalkboard canister set, and it works great for doing fine detail work.Oh, and a tip: When measuring your space to position these, do not bother trying to work in Imperial inches. These are exactly 20 x 30 mm, so use the metric side of the tape measure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QVM06IIUGIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014THF5YA#wasThisHelpful","R21QVM06IIUGIL","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the chance to review this really nice VicTSing Android TV Box in exchange for my honest review. Let me say at the outset that I didn't give this an ""I love it"" five stars only because it does not have Bluetooth. It's not advertised to have Bluetooth, but without it I can't use my hearing aids with this box, and that's what I really need: this box with Bluetooth! But simply saying ""I like it"" should not detract from your impression of this product.This box has more capabilities and features than I am likely ever to understand/use because I'm not terribly technologically savvy and don't really know how to take advantage of them all. But I can give you my experience with the product as somebody who normally has a lot of trouble installing sophisticated electronics like this one. The instructions are better written than some, but they are fairly sparse. (I'd like to see them put a manual online that goes into more detail about how to use the product once it's initially installed.) Even so, and even with me not being a techie, I was able to pretty much plug it in and run with it. If you want to access more than what's operative at the plug-in stage, you have to go through the settings and get everything set up properly for your system and wireless network (although the ethernet port is an awesome inclusion!).Trying to go through setup with the remote is not a pleasant experience. I could not for the life of me figure out how to dismiss the popup virtual keyboard so it wasn't covering up important completion buttons (Next, Continue). I had a very frustrating half an hour until it dawned on me that I could just plug any old USB mouse into the box and work far more quickly and reliablyplus mouse-clicking outside of the keyboard dismissed it. Magically!!! (...) Once I plugged in that mouse, everything went smoothly with the setup, and it was far easier to explore the apps and see what everything does.After the initial entry of your network connection info and such, you can unplug the mouse as long as you don't have to do a lot of typing on the remote to do what you want. Which is a royal PITA. The remote has a button that can be put into mouse mode, but without good instructions on how it works, I don't know how it works. I did plug in the dongle for my wireless Logitech keyboard after I got everything set up, and it works flawlessly. So, too, does the SanDisk flash drive for saving apps, and the system recognizes the extra space automatically.So at the home screen, you've got 10 apps that you can change (Kodi, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Aptoide, and Chrome and a blank box that is for adding new apps, I think), plus five icons at the bottom: Apps, Browser, Media, File Manager, and Settings. In the settings, among other things, there is a System Update button that, when I click on it, shows a screen with Version Detect, and it shows that my version 1.0.0. is the most current version. I don't know what will happen when they have an update available. The App Manage and Developer buttons offer a lot of control. I was able to install my Smart Connect (hearing aid) app, but because there is no way to pair my Bluetooth control device, it doesn't work for me.Anyway, I'm taking my time discovering all this box can do because I have to wait until my roommate is out of the house so I can turn the TV up loud enough to hear it without my hearing aids. But if you have an Android tablet, you already know how to use this. And, yes, it's like turning your crummy not-smart TV into an Android-based computer with a big screen. It will definitely make ditching cable TV easier to do, if that's your aim, but I've got my cable box on one HDMI port and the Android TV box on another, and they live together just fine.Little things mean a lot: I was able to plug the power supply into the last slot of my surge suppressor and still all the other slots open; this would not be the case if it were plugged into a middle slot. But I need every one of those slots, so I was glad this VicTsing box could live with the rest of the stuff on that wall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FY2ECRJ7OVG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWE8GTE#wasThisHelpful","R1FY2ECRJ7OVG0","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This EverGreen grinder is a little thing of beauty. It's extremely well machined, has two super-fine mesh screens that will screen out the powder (which can be used for other purposes if it's your uber-expensive spice), and perfectly calibrated magnetic closures: not too heavy, not too light. It's definitely better for grinding dry materials, but you can also do fresh ones. I won't do things like fresh basil leaves with this because they are delicate and tend to get stuck in the teeth of the grinder; but tougher fresh herbs like rosemary grind great. And there's just something very nice about seeing the company name, ""Evergreen,"" on the cover. It doesn't give the impression of being a branding; rather, it serves as a reminder to live clean and green.

"The concept behind this spray is one I would never have thought about, but for some people who either have dreadfully stinky poop that embarrasses the heck out of them or for people having to live or work with people who think their poop literally doesn't stink, I think this might be something they would have use for. People who travel a lot on planes, especially, whether passenger or crew, could do each other a favor by carrying a bottle of this with them into the john. (Although I don't know if it would get through screening. Maybe the airlines could provide bottles to keep in the john.)To be honest, I wasn't wild about the smell, and that's why I didn't like this Mask spray very much. I associate ""clean smells"" in the toilet with Pine-sol, not a rose fragrance.

It can be worn as a one-strand necklace or wound around the wrist as shown in the product photo. The stretchy thread on which the beads are strung seems to be pretty strong and so far is not unraveling on the outside like some of the cheaper products do.

"Okay, look, don't even bother buying the one with the handle. Go get the other one that comes without the handle, then go to your local Lowe's and buy a Quickie Cobweb Remover. (They look like this one but I was able to take my Ball washer piece with me to test the fit. They had them in standing displays all over the store for $10.38. )When I first got this washer, I could tell it was going to revolutionize my life, but I was infuriated that the handle (wooden with metal casing for the screw end) would not stay tightly screwed on and kept falling off. Also, the handle that comes with it is really too short to be able to do the washing without bending over. I mean, it really did suck. I started to glue it on with Gorilla glue so at least I could get some use out of it, but I'm so glad I didn't. Had I bought the cheaper version without the handle, then used the Quickie handle with it (saving the cobweb duster end for the handful of times a year I might use it), I'd have what I have now: a dependable, highly workable, color-coordinated handle and washer end that I can hang up when not in use. I can even telescope the handle if I want to, but I don't need to. The lowest setting makes for a good full-length handle that's easy to hold and wash with. Seriously, they should package that exact same handle with the Ball washer head.I'm washing all kinds of things with this washer. I didn't think it was going to work trying to wash a full-sized microfiber comforter in the bathtub with it, thinking I'd need to put it in a ten-gallon bucket for the Ball washer to do the job, but it's fine.

He hates going to the laundromat and lets his dirty laundry pile up into huge mounds. I've been doing the hand-washing almost two years without benefit of anything but my hands and a few tub trugs and a strainer basket, but ringing out the clothes is really rough on me and I can't do the best job. DP wanted to get a small portable washing machine (which we aren't supposed to have in our apartment because of problems with leaking), but the more I read reviews of what's out there, the more I knew I did not want to spend that much money on what seem to be, today, largely inferior products. So I got this Nina dryer and one of those breathing washer things. (The latter item is a disappointment because the handle keeps falling out; it'll work great if I glue the handle into it.)But this dryer! I am so knocked-out thrilled with it that I wanted to wash all the dirty laundry in the house, not only mine but DP's. He had 2 sets of full-sized sheets (one mismatched with a queen-sized flannel top sheet), two shams, and a pillowcase that I said I would wash for him because I was having so much fun with this Nina dryer. After the aggravation with the loose breathing washer handle, I just slopped those sopping-wet sheets into the dryer. I didn't even try to balance them much. I did them in three loads and just threw the sheets in. The one flannel sheet I did by itself, and that was the only one that gave me some balancing problems that I had to rectify. The other two loads (a set of sheets in one, one bottom sheet and the shams and pillowcase in the other) settled into smooth spinning quickly after closing the lid. I just held the sides until the spinning got going good.Everything went from sopping wet to spun out really close to dry in a minute or two. I didn't time it; I just watched for the water coming out to reduce to a bit of dribbling, then opened the lid to stop the dryer. I threw the load I'd just spun onto the bottom shelf of my dryer rackno dripping!started up another one, and then hung the first one. It was so EASY! Jiminy, if I had realized how wonderful this was going to be, I would have bought one of these Nina soft spin dryers two years ago! And the clothes came out smelling so fresh and clean (thanks in part to the breathing washer thing, ECOS HD instead of Tide, and a touch of vinegar in the rinse water), it was like clothes hung on the line in the breeze and sunshine when I was a child. I used to run through the sheets, and doing this laundry was a pleasant remembrance of the past.I washed two pairs of my Costco Gloria Vanderbilt denim capris and spun both pairs at the same time. I spun them until the dripping stopped, then hung them to dry. Five hours later they were almost completely dry and wearable, with only a tiny bit of moisture at the thick waist band, and it was pretty humid. I also washed a particularly nasty thick reversible white cotton rug and spun it dry in the dryer. It got a lot cleaner than it ever has in a washing machine; the threads didn't unravel more like they would have it a washer; and it was fully dry about a day later. The six bamboo T-shirts were a breeze to wash and dry; I could have put one on right out of the Nina. I'm just knocked out...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TJZGPU60HWLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDWTQKI#wasThisHelpful","R3TJZGPU60HWLB","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can put this pitcher in the freezer and the microwave! You just have to be careful to sit it on a towel and give it a minute for the temperature to equalize so you don't risk breaking it. When I first got it, I filled it up with room-temperature filtered water from my Berkey and put it in the freezer. A few hours later it was nice and cold for dinner.I love that it's a good, heavy, lead-free glass and that it's square. Round pitchers take up more real estate than necessary, but the square shape of this allows for sitting alongside boxes of drinks in the fridge or on a shelf with dry ingredients stored in it. I absolutely love the very wide mouth. The lid will seal tight with a turn of the handle, but I found it too aggravating to unscrew it to pour so I just leave it loosened but nested down into the mouth. This keeps it sealed well enough against odors without making it hard to get into. To pour, I don't fool with trying to get the pour slots lined up; I just pull the whole lid off, then plop it back on when I'm finished.One thing I really like is that this holds two full 32-ounce blender cups from my Nutri Ninja. I freeze 4-oz. smoothie balls (in ice ball makers) in quantity to have on hand as the frozen part of morning smoothies so I don't have to calculate out the portion for My Fitness Pal. I love watermelon smoothie balls, so I'll go get a big watermelon and blend it up with the NN, but that makes for a lot of watermelon juice. This pitcher can hold two big blender cups full, which I can then stick in the fridge until I'm ready to do the ice ball maker thing. This pitcher holds enough for 16 smoothie balls, exactly how many of the ice ball makers I've got, so I can line them all up and pour from this pitcher. (The reference to this holding two pints in the description is not accurate. It's twice that size.) Little things mean a lot!I was given this product in exchange for my unbiased review. I'll buy another one or two, I like it so much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235GHZ0FZ0PF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131EKHO0#wasThisHelpful","R235GHZ0FZ0PF4","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I was looking at all the uber-expensive burr grinders, researching reviews all over the internet, and finally came to a review that recommended this one in the lower-priced category. When I saw that there was a $20-off coupon for it, I knee-jerk jumped on it before reading all the reviews here. Then, while waiting for it to get here and planning to return it, I read the reviews and realized that the biggest complaint about this grinderother than the fact that it does not work as well as a high-end grinder, which I don't expect that at this price pointis the design of the bottom holder and the fact that it makes a mess trying to get ground beans into your coffee pot.When it arrived, I had been struggling trying to grind decent coffee for our French press in my Nutri Ninja. DP kept complaining about the ick in the bottom of his cup. So I thought, what the hay, I got this thing for under $40 so I'm going to try it and if it's as wretched as everyone says, I'll donate it to the thrift store. And I had the perfect solution to the mess problem.I have a stainless steel canning funnel that I use for everything, but it's always in my way because there's just no good place to put it. It turned out to be the perfect size to dump a measured amount of freshly ground coffee directly into my French press; the offending Krups coffee container fits entirely inside the funnel so nothing can spill anywhere except into and through the funnel into either my French press or a mason jar or, if I'm cleaning the grinder with a handful of steel-cut oats as I plan to do, right into my Ninja blender cup for my morning smoothie! Not only that, I now have a place to keep the funnel because it can sit on top of the coffee grinder until I'm ready to use it for whatever I'm going to use it for. I'll just have to be sure to dry it after rinsing it out if I use it for anything other than coffee.In the photos I'm posting, you'll see my first run-through making coffee with Krups-ground coffee. I set it on the coarsest setting (how easy was that?) and filled the hopper about half full of beans. I set it on two cups and, thinking that would be 16 ounces, poured my French press about half full of water. Gad, that was some strong coffee! I poured it into two mugs, and you can see how much I got. So the next morning, I left it on two cups, kicked the coarse grind back one notch (I mean, how easy was that?), dumped the ground coffee into my French press, then filled it to the top. That made a coffee that was not too strong, only a tad weak, and quite smooth. And DP did not complain about ick in the bottom of his cup.So, I'll tell you, if this grinder holds up for a few years, I will be quite happy with it. Already it's much better than I thought it would be, given my canning funnel idea. And look how nice my little coffee-making setup looks!UPDATE: Oh, dear. I wish I had something better to report, but I had to send this back. I'd had it maybe two weeks when it started sounding rough. I was going to grind up the last of the beans in the hopper, then try to see if a bean was stuck or something, when it started giving off that bad burning machine odor. That was it. I wanted to like it, and I didn't like the hassle of having to send it back, but send it back I did! Fortunately, Amazon being Amazon, I had no trouble at all doing this for a full refund.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24OKA7ITT7K9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EM9F4Q#wasThisHelpful","R24OKA7ITT7K9C","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been curious about whiskey stones, so I was glad to get the chance to review these. I was offered the productglasses and stonesat a discount in exchange for my unbiased review, so I thought I'd try them.First, let me say that I am suspicious that there is no mention of what kind of glass these are made of. Many of the double-walled glass products on the market are borosilicate, and there are standards for its manufacture. I have some very nice tea infuser glasses made of borosilicate glass, and they just look to be of a higher quality glass than are these whiskey glasses (which are not as clear). I know that borosilicate tends to be less thick than other types of glass (there is a good discussion of it on Wikipedia that explains why) and that borosilicate CAN shatter in certain circumstances, but I don't worry about that so much with these other glasses as I do with these TeiKis glasses. The whiskey glasses just feel very thin and fragile to me, and after reading some of the reviews about them shattering, I do have to wonder if they are not made of a form of glass so adulterated that it doesn't pass muster.I probably would have given this set a middle-of-the-road rating of three had there been any instructions included with the set, but there weren't. I didn't know I was supposed to wash the stones before first use, nor how long they were to be frozen to be effective, so I just threw them in the freezer for a few hours, then took them out to test them in some cold tonic water because I didn't have any whiskey on hand. Well, drinking it made me sick. Soapstone is not supposed to react with liquids and is supposed to be safe, but god only knows what kind of residue from the manufacturing process I imbibed along with the tonic water.Finallyand this is not the fault of TeiKis because these whiskey stones seem to be sold in sets of ninewhy package an even number of glasses with an odd number of stones? One person gets five of them and the other gets four? Why not eight? Why not ten?","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8BDTVK1SJOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPXHWFM#wasThisHelpful","R3P8BDTVK1SJOF","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, first, let me say that I do not think I asked for this particular product from TeiKis when they approached me about honestly reviewing some of their products in exchange for discounted or free product. I asked for the whiskey stones and glasses, which I will review separately, and the ice ball makers, which I did not receive. That said, once the box arrived with the whiskey stone set and this Boston cocktail shaker set, I realized I was going to have to go out researching how this shaker actually works so I could at least make a decent stab at reviewing it. (Sheesh, at first I was thinking ""They didn't sent me a lid with it!"" LOL!)Anyway, a foray into youtube looking for Boston cocktail shaker how-tos was really fascinating. Some of the guys really got into their shaker technique, and I can see that learning to use a set like this is an art. There were plenty of explanations about why one's shaker might leak and how to fix it; different ways to shake to be the most comfortable for you and to develop your own style; some fun bar humor; etc. And I couldn't help thinking of Sean Connery's famous James Bond line: ""...shaken and not stirred....""I think this would be a fabulous gift for someone approaching drinking age to get them thinking in terms of ritual, finesse, and careful consumptionimpressing all their friends with quality, not quantityso they don't fall into the whole binge-drinking thing that hurts so many young people. But this shaker set doesn't have to be used for alcohol-based drinks; there are plenty of healthy cocktail recipes that don't call for alcohol. For the price of this set, I think it's pretty impressive, and it's what I'd be considering if I were planning to purchase a gift for someone I knew was planning to take a bartending course to see if it's something they really want to do. Heck, now that I have it, maybe I'll think about learning more about making cocktails myself.My set did come with a wooden muddler, and the weight and feel of the whole set does seem to be of good quality to me. I don't have anything else to compare this to, and I don't drink cocktails as a rule, so I can only say that I will use it only occasionally for its actual purpose: mixing drinks. That bar spoon is great and is going to be used to stir the coffee in my French press because it fits, and matches, my 32-ounce double-walled one perfectly. I'll be using the glass with measurements to help me measure out smoothie ingredients or for portion control, and the stainless measuring jiggers will be used similarly. I think this set is an excellent value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TCWC2ZKPDIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPX7NO2#wasThisHelpful","R34TCWC2ZKPDIP","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't used a lot of essential oils, so I'm not an expert on them, but I've been offered several different brands and bottles of the oils lately in exchange for an unbiased review. I also (conveniently) was offered a nice little aromatherapy diffuser from another company to test them with.I work in a home office (an older apartment, actually) and the air quality is not too great. I get sleepy easily while I'm working. I like the essential oils to help with breathing problems, of course, and it's nice to use a lavender blend to help me sleep. But what I really needed was something that would help accomplish improving my breathing but also help me stay alert when I'm working.When this Living Pure Essential Oils Frankincense arrived (again, in exchange for my honest review) and I took a whiff of it from the bottle, I thought ""So that's what frankincense smells like. What's the big deal?"" I would not have chosen it from a lineup of other oils if I were shopping for this in a health store or boutique. But I put a few drops into my little misting diffuser to test it, and I was floored at how much I liked it. It smells very different when atomized than it does full-strength in the bottle. It opens up my sinuses and the passageways of my lungs; importantly, it is uplifting and makes me feel mentally less fatigued than I usually do.

"In my twenties and thirties, I wore tortoise shell glasses that looked very similar to these, and I not only loved them, they really were part of my personality and made me feel like ""me."" Then the wire frames came out and the skinny frames came out and I've hated my glasses ever since. Well, I'm in my sixties now. I have some rounded wire-framed prescription glasses (that aren't ""me"") that have started to be not good for anything I do closer up, like reading on my Kindle Paperwhite or watching videos on my phone. I still have to have the other glasses for distance and working on a desktop-distance computer, but I absolutely love these Marrywindix glasses for everything else. It may sound silly, I know, but I actually look forward to the end of the day when I'm settled into bed with my Fire phone feeling like ""me"" again.I like the styling of these so much that I wrote the company to ask if I could have prescription lenses put in them. (I haven't heard back, so I'm going to ask here on Amazon.) They fit my smallU.S. man's hat size smallhead perfectly with no slipping but also are not tight on my temples so they are very comfortable. They are NOT spring-loaded, but I don't need them to be. The only complaint I had about them is that they were kind of ""smeary,"" but I cleaned them with an alcohol wipe and then they were fine. But, oh, the relief of wearing these when reading on my Fire phone. I hadn't realized how strained and tired my eyes were getting until I put these on. Love 'em!

"I was actually wondering what kind of urban guerilla gardening tool I could carry with me on my morning walks to trim back the bushes that have grown over the sidewalks to keep them from whapping me in the facewhen I was offered this neat pocket chainsaw in exchange for my honest review. It comes in a perfect little tactical-type carrying case that can be carried on a belt. The bushes in question happen to be at houses that I know are rented by college students, so I'm sure they could care less if I do what the landlord is supposed to do but apparently isn't. It takes a different approach than using pruning sheers would, but I'm not likely to carry heavy pruning sheers with me. This saw has really strong biting teeth; all you need is the elbow grease and you're good to go. This chainsaw will, of course, be great for camping and wilderness hiking and useful for many activities. Shoot, god forbid you should ever get pinned under a rock or tree, but if you do, you won't have to make like a rabbit so you can escape to live another day.

"I drink a lot of smoothies and have a lot of different dried ""boosters"" (chia seeds, cacao nibs, and the like) that I like to be able to have on a little shelf above my sink where I don't forget to use them. I've been using mason jars with those white screw-on plastic lids, but it takes two hands to get into them and then close them back up, and I wanted something I could access with just one hand. I also needed a way to label them better, because I don't much care for the Avery label look or the hassle of getting the old labels off!These are very nice jars for my purposes. First, they are smooth white ceramic, so they protect the ingredients inside from light. They each hold a cup and a half of dried product, and they can be filled pretty much all the way to the top. The silicone seals are smooth and flexible and effective for closing the jars with one hand, and the chalkboard part is fantastic for labeling those bits and pieces of things that you know you're not going to buy again but don't want to go to waste. Each jar comes with a really neat little chalk stick. It's a harder chalk than what's used on blackboards, and it allows for writing with a fine point. You can put a lot of information on the chalkboard. Just be careful not to rub what you write with wet hands or you'll wipe it off....Speaking of chalk, when I first took these out of the box, I thought they were defective because it appeared that some of the chalkboard part had not been painted on very well. But this was not the case! It's just that there was some white chalky substance on the jars that must have been left over from manufacturing. A quick swipe with a sponge, and it was gone, ready to write on.I started to knock off a star because you can't really solidly stack these. Yes, they do stack but they will roll a bit and not stand totally straight. But this is a small thing. Most people are not going to want to stack them. I mean, the idea is to be able to reach with one hand for one without having to move the other jars around. One interesting thing is that the recession on the top of the lid (also made of ceramic) holds approximately 1/8 cup, or two tablespoons, which is exactly how much I typically use of the ingredients I'm storing in these. I could actually use the lid to measure my ingredient and then just dump it right into my smoothie blending cup. I really do love them. And they look great in my kitchen.

"I have a little chiweenie who runs to the living room window while I am in the far back of the house workingpropped up in a recliner and under a lap desk with 15"" MacBook Probarking his you-know-what off at any activity outside. He knows he's supposed to ""soft bark,"" but he also knows that it's going to take me a while to get out of my chair and get into the living room to yell at him, so he takes advantage of that time to really feel his oats. I've tried bark control products, but they just don't make them small enough for Bingo, so I've wondered if a camera like this with two-way voice would work.

I didn't understand the directions at first for how to get it installed because it had the different ways to handle installation using different devices in a series of what looked like numbered steps.

"I'm a real sucker for beautifully designed products that not only make my life easier but also make me feel like a million bucks when using them. So when I was offered a discounted review sample of one of these double-walled tea cup/infusers from The Immortalitea Companyeven the company name is beautifulI couldn't resist. As soon as I pulled it out of the gift-quality box and found the coupon for a free sample of loose tea, I went to their web site and ordered the tea and another cup so DP and I will both have one. While waiting for the tea to arrive, I tried my infuser/cup with a regular tea bag (and it worked as expected) and also tried some ground coffee in it. The tea was great; the coffee, because the grind was too fine, not so much. A French press grind would probably work fine with it, but this cup is really meant for tea. (If using coffee, I'd recommend pouring the water in first, then sitting the infuser with coffee grounds down into it slowly.)After I cleaned the little (very fine) drainage slots with a soft-bristled toothbrush to remove the trapped fine coffee grounds, making a cup of tea with one of my Alvita ginger-peppermint stringless bags worked just great. I love how the base of the infuser sits inside the inverted lid so you don't have drips all over the place. You can also add dried blueberries or other fruits if you like that kind of thing.But the real pleasure of the experience came when I received my sample of Thai Jasmine Oolong loose tea. The pea-sized buds of dried tea literally bloomed in the water, fascinating to watch, and had such a fine aroma that I just wanted to sit still and linger a while with it. The combination of good tea and a beautifully designed infuser was such a pleasure that I might actually start drinking more tea and less coffee.I haven't tried this yet, but it seems like this cup would also serve for preparing Greek yogurt from regular homemade yogurt. Whey might be too dense to drain through the very fine notches in the infuser glass, but if it works, the infuser would hold an individual serving of the yogurt that could then be mixed with fruit. It would also be a nice receptacle for those kefir grains you wind up having to stick in the fridge for a while because you can't keep up with them. I rest mine in a little filtered water, and this cup would be a mess-free way to hold them cold and drain them as needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OE41PEY1FM13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZKT2N0#wasThisHelpful","R2OE41PEY1FM13","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a case for my Amazon Fire phone that allows for strapping to either my upper arm, forearm, and leg for various activities where I'm tracking movements. This band gets the job done and is a good strong velcro that makes for a really nice, secure fit. I like this band much better than some of those T-style bands because it's a lot cooler.

But for my purposes, it's working out great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UND0B99BC5QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LGUUSU0#wasThisHelpful","R2UND0B99BC5QA","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received two different styles (and, apparently, different builds) of this product in exchange for my unbiased review. This is the second one I received, and it was much better than the first one.The other version, iKoo Powered by 4 Batteries Brushed Stainless Steel body - Top button Automatic Salt, Pepper, or Spice Mill with Led light(one pack), had a black plastic thumbscrew type mechanism on the bottom that could be easily unscrewed (and lost), used to adjust the grind. This one has a different mechanism involving a stainless steel screw that seems more secure and well built. Importantly, this one came with instructions showing how to put everything together. If you happen to get this and it doesn't come with instructions, be sure to pay close attention to where the inner plastic sleeve in the top goes so you can put it back on correctly!With a slight loosening of the grinder screw on the bottom, my pink Himalayan salt ground up perfectly, which is really nice to have at the table. The grinder does not make much noise when grinding, which is a good thing. I don't think this is a $75 product, however. Maybe a pair, one for salt and one for pepper, at that pricea little smaller, with smaller or fewer batteries.The product could be improved by including some kind of funnel to help pour the spice into the cannister. It is not completely open; there is a cross bar over it, and my regular funnels don't fit. I had to make a paper funnel to fill the grinder without spilling salt all over the place. If the price for one of these grinders stays in the $75 range, I would expect less plastic inside and also perhaps a funnel and a little stand to sit it in that could double as a measuring receptacle so the whole thing could sit beside the stove for cooking.I'd like to see someone design a grinder like this that allows for grinding just enough fresh coffee beans for a mug or two of french-pressed coffee. You couldn't do that with this grinder because there's really not enough space for anything larger than a peppercorn to enter the grinding chamber. I tried cacao nibs and chia seeds in the first grinder I received, and neither of them ground well at all. I think that was because the first one was not as well designed as this one. But now I'm kind of afraid to try them with this one for fear it will ruin it for my salt.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z1JYQDOAT9V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S8F8I4#wasThisHelpful","R2Z1JYQDOAT9V8","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received two different styles (and, apparently, different builds) of this product in exchange for my unbiased review. This is the first one I received, and it came with no instructions for use. Because I did not know the top part was supposed to be pulled up and off the see-through part in order to fill it, I only tried to do that once and it was so tightly fitted onto the cannister that I thought that must not be the way to do it. I wound up going in through the bottom of the grinder, removing the screw-on part that is used to adjust the grinder and having to take the ceramic burr grinder piece out to put salt in it. This was too aggravating for words, and then I couldn't get it to grind well. I did like the flat-top styling of this grinder better than the rounded one that came a few days later. Fortunately, the tops are completely interchangeable.The other version, iKoo Battery Powered Brushed Stainless Steel body - Top button Automatic Salt, Pepper, or Spice Mill with Led light(one pack), was made better than the first one I received. Where before there had been a black plastic thumbscrew type mechanism that could be easily unscrewed, this new one had a different mechanism involving a stainless steel screw that seems more secure and well built.

With a slight loosening of the grinder screw on the bottom, my pink Himalayan salt ground up perfectly, which is really nice to have at the table. The grinder does not make much noise when grinding, which is a good thing.

While the shape of it is good, the weight is not. Is that much juice really needed to grind salt and peppercorns? If one were trying to grind coffee beans in something like this (don't even think it; the burrs are too small), I could see it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF11N4KVML8UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013S8F69U#wasThisHelpful","RF11N4KVML8UP","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this microfiber towel with zipper pocket. I love the little carrying case it comes with, too, because it can hold not only the towel but also a comb or small hairbrush and maybe some toothpast and toothbrush. I wouldn't try to carry a phone in the zippered case for fear someone might sit on it and smash it, but it would be good for keys, a little cash, and an ID.Don't make the mistake of not washing it first, however. The instructions say to wash it first. I started to just try using it without washing, but it had the sticky feel that new microfiber often does and I didn't want that feeling against my skin. I washed it by hand because we don't have a washing machine, and a ton of dye came out into the water. (I got the grey one.) After that, I rung it out and hung it up to dry, and even when pretty sopping wet it dried within 24 hours.It's a great size towel, and I love it. I walk five miles every morning and come in sweaty.

"This is a good little stash to have on you when traveling, and it does what it says it does. It is lightweight, sturdy where it really counts (the belt loop especially), and it's got lots of pockets to stick things into. The opening to the back mesh side is small enough that I think it probably is not intended for use for anything except maybe stashing some tissues in it, but you probably want to travel light with this anyway so it's not obvious when worn under clothing.

"I agreed to honestly review these sport headphones in exchange for discounted product. I have very small ears with tiny ear canals, so I knew at the outset that these might not work for MEI have yet to find anything but $$$$ Bluetooth RIC (receiver-in-canal) hearing aids that willbut I thought I'd test them and pass them along to my sister if they didn't.Well, as expected, they don't work with my crazy little ears, but I can say that of the many earbud-style headphones I've tried, the build of these is well above average. I like the strong, flat connecting cable and also the included USB charging cable, which is similarly made, brightly colored, and short so you don't have all this long mess of cabling to deal with at your hub. The USB port cover is better than most and stays firmly closed. The two control buttons give good tactile feedback, although I wish the instructions were clearer on their functions. (The instruction sheet is set in about 4-point type and the photos showing the buttons are tiny. The information included with the photos has been reduced to such a small size that there is no way anyone can read it.) It would be good if they would prominently show a link to online instructions so people can actually find out how to use the product correctly. After much trial and error because of the lack of clear instructions, I was able to get the headphones to pair with my Fire Phone as ""MoMo."" I don't have cellphone service on my phone, so I was not able to test answering calls.I had a terrible time trying to change the bud coverings to the smallest of the three different pairs included with the headphones, but I finally soaked the pair in hot water to soften them, dried them off quickly, and through sheer brute force was able to get them to go on. If there was a better way, it would be nice to have a how-to included. But they were still too big for my ears. I was able to test the sound quality to a degree by holding the earbuds in my hears, and the quality seemed pretty good to me, but I can't say how they will sound to someone with normal-sized ears who can get a good in-ear fit.If you were wondering what those little loop things are at the top of the earbuds, they are auricles that you seat inside your ear, under the outer folds of your ears, to help hold the headphones in; this is a very nice feature for active types. So is the sweatproof nature of the headphones. (My hearing aids are decidedly NOT sweatproof.) And the packaging itself deserves real raves. When you first receive the headphones, it looks like they are in a clamshell-type package, but it's actually a hard clear case held together by a cardboard sleeve containing the product name and advertising. Remove the cardboard, and you have a two-piece case with an inside clear tray to hold all the pieces. If you wanted to toss it all into a gym bag, just wrap a rubber band around it to keep it together. Less plastic in our landfills and oceans!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJQNQ8F85OHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T333T8K#wasThisHelpful","RXJQNQ8F85OHL","A3HQAPXAJV7PRX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HQAPXAJV7PRX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeff Lynne is a brilliant pop musician. There are more undeniable earworms scattered through his work with The Idle Race, The Move, ELO and solo than you'd find in the careers of any ten more mortal musicians. I've been a huge fan of his work for about 40 years now. And this, his first full album of new original material in nearly a decade and a half, is cause for celebration if only for the fact that it has been way too long that Jeff's been alone in the universe.But, sadly, after well more than a baker's dozen full plays to fully let the album sink in and work its charms, I've found that there's not as much here to love as I'd wish, or that I'd reasonably expect. By my count, there are three very good songs here (When I Was a Boy, Dirty to the Bone and All My Life), and a fourth that sounds like a demo for a really good song (Alone in the Universe). And the rest? Well, every ELO album had a few ""skippers""--tracks that weren't exactly horrible, but which I move past when I have the chance. But in the good old days (and even on his first solo album) they didn't constitute 6/10 (60%) of the album...And in the good old days, the skippers weren't so obvious rewrites of other Jeff Lynne work (more on that later).On top of the somewhat low hit-to-miss ratio here, the entire album has an uninvolving boxed in sound, and features drab canned drum tracks. Apparently, Jeff recorded the entire thing on his own, and while it's kind of impressive that a guy can record an entire album on his own in his home studio, maybe it's not as, er, good as it is impressive. I wish Jeff had used a band and an orchestrator to move from these songs--which ultimately mostly sound like highly produced demos--to a more vibrant finished product.The song-by-song rundown.When I was a Boy: The best song here by far. Nice arrangement. This is a latter-day Jeff Lynne classic, no question.  If only the rest of the album were up to this standard.Love and Rain: Typical mid-tempo song that doesn't pay off in the chorus. I do like the that key change around 2:20 where you get the choral ""Love and Rain"" chorus for about 20 seconds--that sounds like good ELO. But then it's back to the drab mid-tempo main verse/chorus.Dirty to the Bone: Clever start, good song. Catchy, and I'm happy to hear it each time it comes on. But like most of the album, it sounds like a demo.When the Night Comes: Starts like a direct rewrite of Balance of Power's second string track ""Is it Alright"" at a slower pace, with crummier production, and doesn't improve from there.The Sun Will Shine On You: I think there might be a very good song hiding here with the right arrangement choices. But as it is, it's merely adequate.Ain't it a Drag: This one's a funny one. Taken by itself, outside the context of the album it's kind of fun, and sounds like an outtake from the Full Moon Fever sessions. But it's missing what Jeff once described as ""the magic chord change"" or something else to keep it from ultimately feeling like a promising idea that isn't fleshed out properly. And within the context of the album, it just slides by.All My Life: Utter pop classicism. Two minutes and 50 seconds of sweet pop bliss. But where are the strings that this song deserves?I'm Leaving You: The best part is the nice guitar figure at the start, clearly inspired by the one Jeff used on Stormy Weather (from Armchair Theater). Then it leads into what sounds like a (very) lousy first attempt at the song that eventually became California Blue, and appeared on Roy Orbison's ""Mystery Girl"".One Step at a Time: The epitome of a Lynne by-the-numbers mid-tempo rocker, OK verses, lame choruses, filler on any albumAlone in the Universe: It doesn't take a genius to hear the orchestral embellishments that this song would have demanded on a classic era ELO album. With those, it would take its place with such sweeping closers as One Summer Dream. As it is, it's a decent song not given its due.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAT2IAORGJXZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RND9H0#wasThisHelpful","RAT2IAORGJXZC","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Asus has become something of a household name over the past couple of decade via their entries in the laptop, tablet and other electronic peripheral markets. What not everyone knows is that they have also made a substantial effort in the past few years to become a player in the cell phone market. And, as you might guess, since not everyone knows that, they haven't been exactly super burning up the sales charts in the US in that area.But that doesn't mean they aren't worth your consideration, if you are one of those people willing to look beyond Apple and Samsung.Earlier this year, Asus introduced a new line of phones the Asus ZenFone 2. These were nice, carrier unlocked, relatively inexpensive phones that offered pretty good functionalty. They didn't have the best cameras on the market, or the best performance. But the phone reception on the phones is very good, and as long as you aren't pushing them too hard, they're attractive lower cost options.One of the features that differentiated those earlier generation ZenFone 2 models is that they featured (relatively expensive) Intel processors, giving them a bit of a performance boost, but making those phones a bit like lone wolves in an ecosystem where Qualcomm Snapdragon processors rule, which, among other things, adds to the support costs for phone manufacturers who want to ensure every new Android update lands on their phone line.So it's probably not a surprise that for their new iteration of the ZenFone, the Asus ZenFone 2 Laser, Asus has moved over to the Qualcomm platform. Beyond the change in processor, the main new feature of this iteration of ZenFones is that Asus has added laser assisted focusing technology to the (13 megapixel) rear-facing camera. On top of that, the specs of this particular phone are pretty solid: An upper-midline Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor (MSM8930) with associated Adreno 405 GPU. A full HD resolution (1080x1920) 5.5"" screen. A larger-sized 3000mAh battery. A generous 3Gb of RAM and 32Gb of storage.  Two sim card slots (you can have two phone numbers with this single phone--although few people use that feature). A second, 5 megapixel, front facing camera. And a micro-sd slot to add storage.The phone comes carrier unlocked and is supported on all GSM networks (so in North America that would mean AT&T, T-Mobile and Rogers (in Canada), plus the third party carriers who use those networks).In the box you get the phone, a USB cable, and a charge. You do NOT get a pair of headphones (honestly, given the quality of the included headphones with most phones, not a loss). Any Android compatible headphones will work with this.Enough about specs and features. How good is this phone?First off, the operating system. The phone comes with Android 5 (Lollipop). That's the good news. On the not as good side of things, to that Asus has added a bunch of (IMHO) unnecessary software on top, which they call the ZenUI. I mean, the added launcher and other software isn't terrible. But I don't think it adds much to the vanilla Android 5 experience and does add more software to slightly slow down your phone and possibly cause issues down the road. That said, one feature of the ZenUI I do like is that it automatically separates your apps into folders based on their category of function. (Photo apps, games, etc.). I do this by hand on my other phones with more vanilla Android interfaces, so having it done automatically (assuming you're OK with the categorization) is not a bad thing. As for responsiveness, I found the phone pretty fast. With about 15 apps opened, including Google Maps, three different browsers, a third party messaging app (Pinger), and a few other things, I was still able to open and play a low-stress game (Angry Birds) without any issue. Everything worked as it should and I could switch between apps and browsers without issue. Responsiveness of the browers remained good and fluid.I wouldn't say the phone was MORE responsive than other mid/high end recent phones. But it was quite satisfactory.In terms of ergonomics of the external buttons, the phone is...odd. The power button is on the top of the phone, not on the side where it's located on just about every other smartphone on the planet. I found that the position of the power button was very inconvenient for one handed operation. This might have been a deal breaker except for the fact that you can also do the equivalent of a power button push by double tapping the screen. While it took a little while to get used to that, once I did, I found that a wholly acceptable alternative to the physical power button. (You still need to use the physical power button to get to the Power Off menu, but I don't typically need to do that with one hand). The volume buttons are also oddly located: On the back of the phone, near the camera, not on the side. Almost immediately, I found this position for the volume buttons to actually be preferable to where you typically find that. They feel very comfortable there. I was worried whether the buttons would be more prone to pushing when the phone was in my pocket, but I didn't find that to be a problem.The screen is bright and clear, as you'd expect for a full HD screen. It didn't seem that the images were quite as vibrant as on some of the top end phones I've used, but certainly it's good enough.Battery life was very good, as would be expected for phone with a larger battery like this one. For an average user, you should have no problem getting through a full day without recharging. In my preliminary testing, I had 35% of the battery left after a full day of power use. A non-typical test of playing video continuously (720p video) until a fully charged battery died gave about 11 hours of play time (with screen at about 70% brightness). The combination of the fairly hefty battery along with the conservative processor and screen shows its power here.On top of the pretty great battery life, the battery is easily replaceable on this phone (snap off the back, change battery). In a world where more and more phones have gone to non-removable batteries, that's certainly a nice feature!The phone, in terms of capability as, you know, a phone, worked quite well. It seemed to be able to pull in a stronger signal in the same place as an iPhone 6--although comparisons based on ""reception bar"" readout are always suspect. Callers told me I sounded very clear, both in standard and speaker phone mode. The built in speaker is clear, precise, and reasonably loud.Finally, there's the camera. (You were wondering if I'd forgotten?) That's supposed to be the special allure of this phone, because the ""laser assisted focusing"" is supposed to allow the camera to focus more quickly and accurately, especially in low light. This is a relatively rare feature on camera phones, available only on a few other phones like the LG G3 (The laser assisted focusing sends out a beam that makes it possible for the phone to quickly and accurately focus even in low light. Most phone cameras auto focus by maximizing contrast/phase in the image, and this tends to start to fail in low light). And I did, indeed, find that the camera focused quickly and reliably on objects that were near to the camera. I have no reservations in asserting that in terms of auto-focusing, the camera in this phone works more reliably than any other mid-line phone camera I've ever used, and arguably better than the top end cameras in phones like the iPhone 6 and the Galaxy S6. That's the good news. The bad news? Well, outside of the focusing, the image quality from this camera is pretty average. Photos tended to be somewhat soft. Also, the laser focusing only works well for objects that are close to the phone. If you try to take a photo of something far from the phone, the laser assist has little effect (and in fact the camera automatically reverts to standard contrast based focusing). Finally, while the camera did reliably focus even in low light, the quality of low light images wasn't particularly impressive--images tended to be grainy. This isn't a surprise, but the quality of the (admitedly focused) images wasn't as good as you could get with the very best camera phones.Then again, let's remember this is a relatively inexpensive no-contract unlocked phone.On the whole, I found this phone to offer quite a bit to like for the price. No, it's not a competitor for the top end of the current generation if things like having the very best camera or playing the most demanding games are important. But it has an acceptable camera, a decent processor, a decent screen, good battery life, a replaceable battery (!), two sim slots and micro-sd expansion. A phone like this would have been amazing a few years ago, and it's still a good phone now.It's worth considering that in terms of processor, GPU, screen size, and battery, this phone is very similar to the new highly hyped Moto X Play. It adds laser focusing but has an arguably slightly inferior camera, the Asus has 1Gb more RAM than the Moto X Play (3Gb versus 2Gb), and the Asus has a somewhat smaller battery (but both phones have large enough batteries for full day use). Depending on what you think is important and your budget (and current pricing when you're looking) comparing these two phones would be a great place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PP1XECENAQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AH8TQE#wasThisHelpful","R29PP1XECENAQN","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazing top end quality leather duffle. If you're looking for a really fine leather duffle, this is the one.It can be confusing to try to pick leather luggage through mail order. First off, everything carries a high list price, but most of those are just nonsense. Some brands typically sell (after common discount) at 60-70% off list, at least, and sometimes more.Also, just because something is made of leather doesn't mean it's made WELL of leather.This particular duffle is, in fact, very high quality. The zippers are good. The seams are well sewn. The lining is high quality. They didn't cheap out here anywhere. Oh, and the bottom is a thick piece of leather, not pressboard with a thin leather veneer. The latter construction is very common among even mid priced leather duffle bags. Here, high quality stitching  in a appropriately thick leather are used instead.Derek Alexander is not that well known in the US, but it's a pretty well known brand of leather goods (especially handbags) in Canada. This is not a budget line. And the real sell through price of this item is only about 20-30% off full list, even on sale.This isn't cheap. So if you need something cheap, look elsewhere.

"Well, it's interesting, innit? A router with a built in LCD screen that allows you to do basic setup without connecting it to your computer.In addition, it supposedly has amazingly high power antennae.Very cool, very exciting.I wish it were so in practice. While this isn't a horrible router, it has its problems and I didn't find the LCD screen input all that hot, nor the power all that great.More on that...Setup:Took the router out of the box, attached the antenna, connected it to my modem and powered it up. It took about 3 minutes from power on to actually presenting an interactive screen. No big deal...There's an included stylus (plastic pointer device; you can also use your finger). There's a Wireless Setup walk through that only offers you the ability to name your networks and give them passwords. I found entering this data through the screen using the on-screen keyboard, to be painful. Yes, you don't have to connect it to a computer. For some, that's a relief. I don't find it hard to connect a router (attach Ethernet cable and browse to the correct IP address...not rocket science). But OK, it's kind of cool. And the resolution of the LCD is sufficient to not imagine you've been sent back in time. But data entry is really laggy and cumbersome. Once you've set up the basic info, there are a variety of other buttons that will take you to various interfaces. There's nothing very deep here--mostly you can get simple readouts of your network status and that kind of thing, set up a DMZ and a few things like that if you need to (most won't). You can also check for updated firmware (mine said none was available). Ultimately, I started to feel after a few minutes that this was as much gimmick as good...But alright...How about performance?Well, I almost didn't think I was going to be able to test it. I set my password, went to my wireless PC (Microsoft Surface Pro), selected the new wireless network, entered the password and...nothing...no connection. Tried again. Nope. Went back to the router to make sure I'd entered the correct password there. Yup. Reentered the password and rebooted. Went back to the Surface Pro. Still no joy. I wasted probably half an hour trying to get the router to talk to the laptop on either the 5ghz or 2.4ghz channel and couldn't succeed on either channel. So then I went back and tried to connect via the WPS service. THAT worked. Finally. But it still doesn't explain the problem negotiating a real password. Anyway, having connected (via 5ghz) I was able to test the speed of the router.On the speed front, the router was fine. I got download and upload speeds equivalent to the built in antenna of the model/router (Verizon FIOS Quantum Gateway). The speed was about 10% faster than  a Wireless N (not AC) router in the same place, the Asus RT-N66U.In terms of coverage...OK, but not amazing. I measured the wireless signal one floor down from the location of the router. The signal for the 5ghz signal was at least 10% LOWER than that eminating from the Verizon FIOS Quantum Gateway router. It was also about 10% LOWER than the 5Ghz signal for the Asus router. On the 2.4Ghz channel, the signal of the Amped router was once again at least 10% lower than that of the Fios Gateway router. More significantly, it was at least 40% LOWER than the 2.4Ghz signal I was getting from the Asus RT-N66U in the same place.Based on these measurements, I can't say I'm extremely impressed with the power of this router. The router is advertised as having an amazing set of high powered antennae, but in my test, the signal from this router wasn't quite as good as two other (high quality) routers just one floor away on the 5Ghz band, and was APPRECIABLY worse than the Asus router on the 2.4Ghz band.The throughput was as expected/hoped, and that was nice to see. But the problems I had in connecting the router using anything other than the WPS mode makes me wonder how convenient this router will be in the long term.The LCD screen input is interesting, kind of cool even, but for me the painfulness of entering information chicklet by chicklet with the onscreen keyboard, and the laggy response to the keyboard input, outweighed the convenience of the screen.On the whole, this is an interesting router, and it seemed to work well enough once set up, but whether one would buy it would depend a lot on the the relative prices of similar spec high end routers....","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YEYI7TQN081/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H4AWAS#wasThisHelpful","R3YEYI7TQN081","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another USB 3.0 hub. You have a zillion purchase options for something like this. But before you pass on this and move to something cheaper, it's worth noting two things:1) All USB 3.0 hubs are not the same: The cheap ones don't reliably perform at USB 3.0 speeds. (And that's a huge thing, because real world USB 3.0 speeds are at least 4-5 times those of USB 2.0 on most platforms).2) Not all USB 3.0 hubs are powered. That isn't a deal breaker for every installation. But if you plan to run multiple devices that have any power hunger (e.g. a hard drive, even some flash drives, a tablet or a phone, etc.) then having a powered hub is definitely worth having--maybe even essential. If all you will use this for is a mouse and a keyboard, then power is not typically required. (But then, why are you buying a USB 3.0 hub?)(Note that while this hub has a power option, and includes the required power supply, you can run it as an unpowered hub for devices that don't require much power).Anyway, enough of the preamble. What about this hub?First, the contents: You get the hub (quite small), a USB 3.0 cable, and a power adapter (""wall wart""). The power adapter is one of those annoying ones that takes up at least two spaces on your power strip, but is otherwise uninteresting.I tested this hub on a PC (Microsoft Surface Pro) that has built in, on board USB 3.0. To test the ability of the hub to perform at USB 3.0 speeds, I connected a USB 3.0 hard drive in three ways and measured the read/write performance of the drive. The three connections tested:A) Hard drive connected directly to the USB connection of the PCB) Hard drive connected to this TRENDnet USB 3.0 hub, hub connected to the PC. No power to the hub.C) Hard drive connected to this TRENDnet USB 3.0 hub, hub connected to the PC. Power applied to the hub.The speed tests were carried out using the industry standard program CrystalMark. The results can be summarized thusly: It made no difference at all to read or write speeds if the hard drive was connected directly to the PC or through this hub, and it didn't make any difference whether the hub was being powered or not. That's perfect. It means the hub is doing a fully compliant pass through of the data at full USB 3.0 speeds. A+In summary: I was happy with this hub. It actually performs at USB 3.0 speeds, has a small form factor, and includes the option of external power. The only reason I give it four stars rather than five is that the power supply is inelegant, taking up two spaces on a standard power strip or possibly both positions of your wall outlet, depending on how that's situated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YAOW8NEMH469/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046TML4E#wasThisHelpful","R1YAOW8NEMH469","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First things first: This phone is not as good as your iPhone6, your Samsung S5, your Droid Turbo, or any other $600-700 phone you can mention.It just isn't. And if you somehow thought that someone could give you a phone that's 100% as good as those top of the line phones for 1/4 the price...well, you can't. There may be fat built into smartphone pricing, but there isn't that much.So let's get real here. This is a $140 phone. No contract, not subsidized. $140 shipped to your home. To bring you a phone at that price point, you would expect some corners to be cut. And some have been cut here.But, terrifically, not so many that this isn't a very intriguing, pretty compelling phone at its price point.So what do you get?Highlights are:** A 5.5"" screen (about the same as those expensive flagships),** A 4000mAh battery (better than much of the competition), This phone EASILY lasts a full day without charging, even if you do a lot of screen-on surfing, etc. Note that the battery is not easily user-accessible/replaceable, but with that much juice, you won't have to worry about carrying extra batteries!** Nearly plain vanilla Android 5 (Lollipop). You'll see some reviewers complaining that plain vanilla Android is missing some of their favorite bloatware, or their favorite launcher, or some other doo-dad. For me, vanilla Android is a major feature. It just works better. It's Android the way Google has designed it, without added third party software that mostly tends to get in the way or break things in the long run. Blu had made a few very nominal changes to generic Android, such as the shapes of some icons, but they are pretty irrelevant.** Dual (two) SIM slots--in theory you can use this phone simultaneously with two carriers** A micro SD slot that be used with cards up to 64gb** Expected connectivity: Bluetooth, Wireless, GSM, etc.** Weight is light GIVEN THE LARGE BATTERY SIZE. Weight is 169g, which is basically identical to something like the recent Droid Turbo (another phone with a huge battery).** The phone comes with a protective case and a screen protector. (This is pretty amazing. The expensive phones I've purchased have never included these...For $140 Blu includes them...Something is wrong with this picture, but kudos to Blu!)Midlights are:** Processor is: Quad core, 1300 MHz, ARM Cortex-A7. ( Mediatek MT6582 SoC with Mali-400 graphics). This is a midline processor. Absolutely fine for simple stuff like surfing the web, email, etc. It will breeze through all that. If you are a hardcore gamer, however, you may find this processor a bit laggy with demanding games.** Screen resolution is 720x1280. This is lower than the expensive flagship phones which for this size screen often have double the resolution in each dimension (1440x2560). There's nothing wrong with this resolution, but it won't be as sharp as the higher resolution screens. On the upside, lower resolution screens take less power and increase battery life.** Generally, the screen is adequate, but not as vibrant as a high end phone** While the phone has clean lines and generally feels nice enough, it's made of plastic and will likely have a higher damage rate if you happen to drop it.Lowlights are:** Only 1Gb of RAM, which can nip you if you have multiple big apps running at the same time** Only 8Gb of built in memory. However, the available MicroSD slot means you can add lots of additional memory at low cost** THIS IS THE BIG ONE: The cameras are fairly lousy. The rear 8MP camera takes pictures that tend to be grainy and/or washed out in anything but bright light. Even in bright light, I found that the camera was often relatively slow to focus. If the camera is critical to you, this may not be the phone for you. The front facing camera offers 5MP resolution (higher than average for inexpensive phones) AND a front facing flash (unusual), but it, too, is pretty mediocre.** Phone is only for GSM carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Rogers, etc.). This phone will NOT work on Verizon (no LTE) or Sprint.** No wireless charging. No fast (turbo) charging.What's in the box: The phone, a special protective case, a screen protector, a USB wall charger, a USB charging cable, a sim card ejector tool, a low end pair of headphones with in-line microphone, and a couple of quick start guides.In terms of basic functionality I found this phone to be perfectly fine. Calls sounded decent both to me and to the person on the other end of the call. Reception seemed to be the same as flagship phones in the same area. The built in speaker is tinny, but it's reasonably loud.On the whole, there's a lot to like about this phone, such as a large battery, a large screen, great battery life, vanilla Lollipop Android, and a SD memory expansion card. Oh, and the amazingly cheap price. The biggest Achilles heel here is the camera. If you are photobug and have the cash, you may not want this phone. But if you can live with a sub-par camera, you aren't really going to find the remaining feature set anywhere else at this price....Those who simply must have a somewhat better camera might want to give consideration to the Motorola Moto G (3rd generation) - Global GSM - Unlocked - 8 GB Black phone, which retails for only a little more than this phone, and has a somewhat better (and higher resolution) camera. But that it's important to note that the camera in the Moto G is better, but not great. And with that phone you give up considerable screen size (5"" versus 5.5"") and you also give up about half the battery capacity/life. Those are major compromises, and you'll have to make up your own mind what's most important.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OX31S6E3OLG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129TQLPW#wasThisHelpful","R2OX31S6E3OLG2","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned dozens of flash drives over the years, starting with my first drive, which was 64mb and cost nearly a hundred bucks (to give you an idea of how long ago that was), to some very recent and good drives from SanDisk, Corsair and others.I have also owned PNY flash drives in the past, which were OK.I have had flash drives start to go flaky, but typically only after years of service. Even the cheapo bottom end flash drives that I regularly use at work for temporary file transfers are reliable, if slow.But THIS PNY drive is an utter piece of junk.

"I'm a little perplexed. Reading over some of the  other reviews for these headphones, I see many claims that the noise canceling  doesn't work.I can assure you: It does. I have well over a dozen different pairs of noise canceling headphones, including a couple of pairs of Bose, Dishwasher, Sennheiser, AKG, Sony,and others. The noise canceling ability of these headphones is better than average.I think it's important to clarify what noise canceling can do. Basically, noise canceling listens to the ambient noise and creates a sound wave that cancels the part of the ambient noise that is predictable and continual. So, for example, the rumble of a jet engine on a plane or the hum of a refrigerator can be canceled. Talking can't be canceled, because it's not predictable. Total noise reduction combines the active noise reduction with additional noise suppression that comes from the design of the headphone.These Panasonic noise canceling headphones definitely work pretty well. You can easily experience this: Put on the headphones without turning them on. Go stand next to your refrigerator, then press the on button. You will suddenly hear the refrigerator rumble disappear. That's the active noise canceling.I've used these headphones on a plane, on a subway, and while mowing the yard. While they will not totally turn your world to silence in those environments, they definitely reduce the ambient noise level enough to make it possible to listen to music at a comfortable volume. I find that the noise canceling on these is better than the Sony and AKG in-ear headphones I have, They are about comparable in that respect to the much more expensive Sennheiser headphones. And they don't block noise as well as something like the Bose over-the-hear noise canceling headphones. But again, they're more portable.In terms of ergonomics: The earbuds themselves are surprisingly comfortable to wear. I find a lot of earbuds either don't form a good fit or else aren't comfortable. With these, the fit was great right out of the box. There's a battery compartment that uses a AAA battery and add weights in the middle of the cable. I don't much like that, but it pretty much goes with the territory with these in-ear noise canceling headphones. You don't have the luxury of placing the battery compartment in earphones themselves, as you do with over-the-ear models. The battery compartment does have a clip on it that can be used to clip the compartment to your shirt to reduce the apparent weight.The headphones only work when a battery is inserted. No battery: No sound. These use a standard AAA battery, which is easily replaceable. I like that better than a proprietary rechargeable battery, which is the design some manufacturers use. Just carry an extra AAA and worst case you replace the battery as needed.In terms of sound: The bass is solid, although it won't please bass-heads. The high end is fine. Not too shrill, easy to listen to over extended periods, but clear. The mid-range is the weak link here. It's a bit muddy. On the whole, the sound is pleasant, but because of the mid-range falls short of great. That said, most noise-canceling headphones don't offer optimal sound, with some sacrifice made for the sake of noise canceling. These headphones are better than average in terms of sound for this segment.On the whole, I like these. Despite midrange that's a bit smeary, on the whole these are pleasant to listen to and are comfortable for extended periods of time. Though I prefer my Sennheiser in ears for overall experience, those are about 3x as expensive. Given the performance at at the price point, these are a very good, and easily recommended, set of noise canceling in-ear headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LFHK362GJ77T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C19125A#wasThisHelpful","R3LFHK362GJ77T","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice, upper end Ricardo Beverly Hills bag. This is basically marketed as competition to the expensive traveler lines like Tumi, although the normal sell through price is considerably cheaper.Construction is good. It comes with a removable garment bag, which is a nice touch. A semi hidden garment tag  that comes out of the side and is held by a piece of flexible elastic (for your ID) is also a nice touch. There's a zipper so you can expand the width of the bag, although it only extends across three dimensions, so the expansion comes primarily at the top of the bag, and not at all at the bottom of the bag. The handle works fine. The bag is (for its size) acceptably roomy.And it's reasonably light (especially if you remove the optional garment bag).What I don't like about this bag: Although it's sold as a ""22 inch"" bag (hence acceptable for most US domestic flights as an onboard, although not acceptable for most international flights as an onboard [since they often limit to 21""]), it's actually closer to a 23"" bag, measured the bottom of the wheels to the top. An airline that wants to be a stickler will, in fact, measure from the very lowest protrusion to the very top protusion. And in that case, this is a 23"" bag. (The body of the bag is itself 22""). As a result,  you risk this bag getting picked for checking--whether you like that or not.Buy and use at  your own risk as a carry-on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAVGB8VRUIWKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQ0H8LA#wasThisHelpful","RAVGB8VRUIWKG","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you were a Veruca Salt fan in 1997, dropped  into a coma in 1998 and woke up this year, and someone handed you this album, you'd say ""well done, it's just what I expected from their third album...sorry I missed it when it was new about a decade and a half ago"".Yeah, it sounds very much like the third album that never happened. I consider that both interesting, impressive, and a bit disappointing. See, while I think both of the mach I albums with both Nina Gordon and Louise Post were pretty decent, I also thought they were a little hamstrung by the post grunge aesthete of the time. It always felt there was a better version of this group under the production.And I felt vindicated in that belief when Nina Gordon left and proceeded to record a couple of very good to great rockin' pop albums in the '00s. I was less inspired by the Veruca Salt releases post Gordon. Which is to say I own them, and they have a good layer of dust on them from sitting in place since about the time I spent money on them. Foolish me.Anyway, I was more than a little disappointed that after her second solo record, Nina Gordon seemed to go into retirement. Her website went dormant and there wasn't a shred of evidence that she'd ever record anything new. Nearly a decade later and...well, suddenly we were hearing how Gordon and Post had buried the hatchets (rumors at the time suggested there were a bunch of them) and a new Veruca Salt album was in the works. ""I'll believe it when I see it,' I thought. And then I wondered if it would reflect the greater pop sensibilities of Gordon's solo material.Well, as it turns out, no, not much. As noted, this really does sound very much like what a third Veruca Salt album in the late '90s or early '00s would probably have sounded like. To me, that's something of a disappointment, for reasons already noted. I would have preferred something that sounded like what the band would probably have evolved to over the intervening 15 years--something kinder, gentler, and less still in the shadow of what Nirvana had wrought. But I think what we get here is a savvy move. I guess that if Nina wanted to release another shiny pop record, she would have just released another shiny pop record.As for the songs, it feels like the other two proper Veruca Salt albums, i.e. some great and catchy, some that sound like they'd be great in concert but aren't super catchy, and a bit of filler.Honestly, I can't imagine anyone who is still a big fan of the first two records not coming away from this one pretty happy. If, like me, you were hoping for another Nina record, I guess you'll have to continue waiting. But at least this album will get repeated plays...","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SNK3X2H3CIHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XM0FS20#wasThisHelpful","R1SNK3X2H3CIHI","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Years ago, I purchased what was then a pretty state of the art home use thermocouple temperature measurement device. It was reasonably accurate, but slow, and hard to use. It also used a weird, ultimately unreplaceable battery, so it wound up in a junk heap years ago. Since then, I've used infrared thermometers at work, but I've never had another one at home.The ones I've used at work have mostly been industrial in design, which means built to withstand the rigors of mishandling. The Amprobe IR-710 isn't like that. It's plastic. But that said, it feels very well put together. The trigger doesn't have side wobble play, and the whole thing seems pretty good for a home use device. The LCD readout is kind of dim, even illuminated, and I've seen better, but it's fine...In terms of accuracy...I took it to work and got the HVAC guy who was working down the hall to do a shootout with his (nearly $1000 high end Fluke) device versus mine. The result? Both guns gave readings withing 0.5 degrees in about half a dozen different spots when we accounted for the better distance-to-spot ratio of his gun (in other words, I had to be closer). The HVAC guy, who uses his gun continually every day, snickered when I asked to compare, but he was very impressed with the accuracy when the shootout was done. Other than build quality and a much better LCD screen on his gun, it should be noted that his distance-to-spot ratio is about 6 times better and he can measure temperatures below 0 degrees, whereas this gun cannot. So there are tradeoffs.But if what you need is a light utility device for home use, you don't need pinpoint accuracy from a long distance, and you won't be measuring temperatures below zero (and most don't), this is a great little item to have...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B4JT99VT5F2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K3M7I4#wasThisHelpful","R2B4JT99VT5F2H","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You can be forgiven for getting confused by all the new HDMI ""dongle"" appliances that seem to be coming onto the market. You have android platforms on a dongle. You have the Google Chromecast device. And you have several vendors offering ""Miracast"" devices. What's a poor boy to do?Well, here's the quick shake out:1) Most of the full android platform devices are for geeks only. A lot of them are underpowered, are difficult to interact with, etc. To be honest, I'd stay away from those, unless you know exactly what you're doing. And if you do, then you're not reading my review, anyway.2) The Google Chromecast has probably received the most attention. It's nice, and allows you to stream a few content providers (Netflix, etc.) to your TV ""out of the box"". Recently, Google has loosened the reigns on the device and toolkit, and now more apps are getting supported. You can also stream whatever is in your Google Chrome browser from some platforms. The upside is that the device is cheap ($35 list). The downside is, I've found, that it doesn't always play nice with platforms like phones, and the built in wifi (how it communicates with your world) is mediocre. It also offered extremely limited functionality until recently, although, as noted, that's changing.3) The Miracast video adaptor, such as the one being sold here under the Belkin name. This is basically a wireless TV adapter. If your device is capable of wireless broadcasting of video, then it transmits its signal to the Miracast, which then pushes that to your TV screen. IMHO, and in my experience, this is more useful than the more limited Chromecast dongle. However, it's also about twice as expensive.In my hands, I find that the Belkin Miracast works very well. I was able to set up a connection between my phone my Miracast/TV in about 1 minute without reading any manual. From that point forward, ANYTHING that was on my phone screen appeared on the TV, exactly as it appeared on the phone. I used it with video streaming (Netflix, Youtube) and found that the connection held quite well, and the picture quality was excellent. The one downside was that there were occasional pixelation glitches on the screen (but not on the phone). But these were a very minor nuisance (and a considerably smaller issue than when using the Google Chromecast, for comparison). After streaming for an hour and a half from Netflix, the adaptor didn't get too hot, and was still working fine.On the basis of functionality, i.e. doing what it's supposed to do, it's great.Breaking things down on a pro/con basis:Pros:1) Super easy to set up if you have a Miracast broadcast (wireless monitor) enabled device2) Easy installation3) Held the signal well4) Good picture quality5) Dongle worked fine out of the box. No need for a firmware update. None of the nightmares (bad firmware) that people have reported with first generation Miracast devices from other manufacturers.Cons:1) Requires USB power input in additional to HDMI connection. If your TV has a HDMI port on the back, this just means connecting that port to the USB input on the dongle, using the supplied cable. If you don't have a USB connector on the back of your TV, then you'll need to buy a USB power adaptor. This adds clutter. But again, the same is true of the Google Chromecast.2) Only works with Miracast enabled devices. I have two cell phones at home. One, a top of the line Razr MAXX phone from a couple of years ago, does not support Miracast. My newer phone (Moto X) does. For the most part, only recent phones actually support Miracast. So check before buying if that's your use case. As for PCs, any PC that supports wireless and that came with Windows 8 or 8.1 supports Miracast--provided you've updated the OS to Windows 8.1. Older PCs that have been upgraded to Windows 8.1 may or may not support Miracast (check before you buy).3) Miracast is essentially a second screen technology. That means that your source device will show the same picture as the Miracast device and you may not have a way of turning off the source device screen. On my phone, for example, I couldn't find a way to do that.4) In the end, Miracast should be considered basically IDENTICAL in functionality to running a HDMI cable from your source device to the TV. There's no functional difference whatsoever. So if you have a source device and the idea of running a HDMI cable from your source device to the TV is not offensive/problematic, just do that--you'll save money and won't have to deal with the occasional data glitches inherent in wireless streaming.So, in the end, would I recommend this? Sure, IF you need it, and if your source device(s) support it. Look again at #4 above: For many people, this is a lot cooler than a HDMI cable, but it doesn't get you anything the HDMI cable won't, if you can run HDMI cable from your source, and if that won't offend the aesthetic (wife) or accessibility gods.  Although, of course, the idea of sitting with a Windows 8.1 table in your lap 15 feet from the TV and controlling what's on the TV is a little more enticing than having a 20' HDMI cable tethering your tablet to the TV--even if you CAN get the OK to do that.And it needs to emphasized that a really useful use case for the Miracast is with your phone while traveling, since most phones don't offer HDMI out.I took my Miracast on my latest business trip and found it a fun way to circumvent the $10/movie charges from the hotel. My new phone doesn't have HDMI out, so running a HDMI cable wouldn't be an option, anyway. The movies weren't great, but the smile I got from knowing that Hyatt wasn't getting a cut made it a lot better. (Don't forget the USB charge adapter, though).On the whole, I was really impressed with how easily this device was to set up and was happy with the performance. I found it quite useful for situations where running a HDMI cable was impossible (phone source).

"I was looking for a fully adjustable stand to replace the one-position stand for my Microsoft Surface. This seemed to fill the bill and I ordered it.The pros:1) Fully adjustable. Very easy to put your tablet in almost any position from full 90 degree (standing up) to around 0 degrees (almost lying down).2) Sturdy enough (touching the screen, the tablet stays in place).3) The ""sticky"" rubber guides keep your tablet in place.4) Easy to set up.5) Will work with any standard tablet from 7"" to 12"" either portrait or landscape. It will actually work with larger tablets, but as things get too big, it's not going to be very stable.Now the con:1) It's almost entirely plastic, and it doesn't feel well enough constructed to last for the long run if you're using it as a travel device (where you'll continually be folding/unfolding it and possibly subjecting it to travel stresses). Should be fine if you just want to set it up somewhere and leave it.I was disappointed with the plastic design. It looks like metal in the pictures here. It's not. I guess at the price I shouldn't have expected anything more. I am a little worried how well it will hold up in the long term. But the ergonomics are great, and it's kind of amazing that there are so few comparably good general use stands at this price. Basically, Amazon has this particular market to themselves.On the whole, as long as you keep your expectations in check, this is a great little stand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOAU6SDX94KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZT4VA0#wasThisHelpful","R2IOAU6SDX94KO","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thought I'd save a mint versus the Microsoft official Type keyboard and get this instead. Saw some good reviews, took a flyer.Big mistake. On the plus side, you do get the leather case and the bluetooth keyboard for less than half the retail price of the Microsoft Type keyboard. And the case does fit the Microsoft Surface snugly. But......but the keyboard itself is hideous. First off, it's a very small keyboard--think the really bad miniaturized keyboards that some of the worst netbooks came with. And remember how some of the key layouts on those were bad. Yeah, this has that problem, too. I could overlook the chicklet feel of the keyboard, if the keys were bigger. But they're not. And that means it's a total chore to type on this thing.But that's not all. The responsiveness of the keyboard is also rather pathetic. Thinking you'll get good use out of the mouse pad? Think again. Lag city. Sorry, but if I'm in keyboard mode, I need a mouse pad. I don't want to switch between touching the screen and typing on the keyboard that frequently.On the plus side: It was easy to set up the keyboard and the bluetooth coupled fine.On the whole, this is another one of those ""get what you pay for"" deals. I might be able to deal with the cheap chicklet feel if the keys were bigger. But they're not. I might be able to deal with the small keys if the touchpad worked properly. But it doesn't--it lags.Oh, and did I mention that one of the straps that keeps the Surface in the leather binder overlaps the power button and sometimes pushes it for you, ""just for fun.""Sorry to say...save your money.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYTY9DW6ZGR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXTF9HU#wasThisHelpful","R1FYTY9DW6ZGR4","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the price point of this printer, you have a decent number of choices in terms of monochrome laser printers. In fact, you can monochrome laser printers with more functionality for as little as half the price. If you're looking for the cheapest solution for printing, you might want to look at one of those.This particular printer is more aimed at workgroup use. That means better construction, higher reliability, cheaper consumables (toner), and a few well implemented features you won't find on the cheap printers, particularly duplexing (printing both sides of a page), which is almost never available on the cheapest printers (and almost always subject to mechanical failure when it is).Setup is as easy as any laser printer: install the toner and imaging cartridges: It takes about 10 minutes, including unboxing and reading the instructions. Connectivity is solely wired, so either you connect to your network via an Ethernet cable, or to a specific computer using a USB cable. Both Windows and MacOS are supported. The underlying processor is dual core and 800Mhz and there is 256mb of installed memory. Both specs are way more than sufficient for the purpose and better than most cheaper printers. Build quality is good (weight is 31 pounds).Print quality is very good, and offers up to 1200x1200 dpi resolution. The print quality is acceptable for both personal and business use. The printer is rated at up to 40 pages per minute, although my experience with real life monochrome documents (.pdf) was about 1/3 to 1/2 that once the document was loaded on the printer and it began printing. That's still way more than acceptable for a workgroup printer.Printer options can be set using a small  readout and buttons on the front panel, but I found this to be cumbersome. The network interface that is available once you install the printer is far easier to use and is recommended. (If you really insist on using the on-printer display/interface for setup, I recommend moving up to the MS510dn; but that printer costs a lot more and doesn't deliver better performance).In printing several hundred pages on this machine, I did not experience any problems, either with the network interface, or with paper jamming. I was able to send heavier card stock through the bypass tray without issue, and it printed properly as well.The main cons to this printer are A) the included paper tray is big enough to hold about half a ream of paper (250 sheets) and there is only one paper tray. In many business settings it's useful to have larger capacity and/or the ability to use at least two different paper supplies and B) there is no built in wireless connectivity (although you can solve that using a wireless access point, if you wish).On the whole, this printer doesn't offer a lot of bells and whistles (no copier, no scanner, no fax, no wireless, no color), but if you need a very solidly built workhorse basic laser printer at a good price, with the added bonus of built in duplexing, this is an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SM4S9I2PA2QW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SM8EFO#wasThisHelpful","R3SM4S9I2PA2QW","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Dell XPS-18:Is is a ginormous tablet or is it a really small All-In-One?It's both.And as such, when I got it, I wasn't sure if it was really a case of neither fish nor fowl--a product without a niche. Certainly, before I got my hands on it, I hadn't been dreaming of the day I could have a five pound 18"" tablet in my lap while watching TV. And I hadn't been hoping to replace the 24"" touch screen All In One I have in the kitchen with one that's way small at 18"".In fact, this unit seemed so far from what I'd been dreaming of, I figured it just had to be better than I expected.And it is, in fact.Until you've played with an 18"" tablet, you don't know what you're missing. Or gaining (about 2+ pounds). Interactive material (videos, web pages, etc.) is a lot more fun at the larger size.And if you want to attract attention, just pull one of these out at your coffee house or other favorite hangout. It works. I tried it. In fact, it was like the first time I had a laptop that could play videos--ahead of the curve--and I pulled that out in an airport lounge. By the time I was 10 minutes into my movie, I had a crowd. Same with this thing. At least right this minute.As for the portability factor. Well, it's 5 pounds. And battery life is kind of anemic by today's standards, at about (in my tests) a little under 4 hours. (Note: This uses the last generation Intel ""Ivy Bridge"" processor. The new Haswell line is now out, and when the next generation of this device comes out, I'd expect battery life to be bumped by at least 50-60%). A wireless keyboard and mouse come with the unit, but they're not integrated (like a laptop), so if you want to have a full solution to take on the road, you not only have the large-ish, heavy-ish tablet, you also have to take the separate mouse and keyboard. I file that under ""not fun for road warriors"". To be quite honest, for travel, I'd rather get a good 17"" laptop.Anyway, back to this device. If it's not perfectly suited to travel, then what's the point? Well, the point is supposed to be that you can easily move this from room-to-room at home, used as either an All-in-One OR a tablet. That's kind of cool--provided your home is big enough to justify it. You need to work that you for yourself.On the whole, I found this to be (to my surprise) more fun and useful than I expected. No, once the ""hey look at me"" novelty wears off, I can't see taking this with me out of the house. But I did find the very large tablet mode continually alluring and I'm using it in lieu of my other tablets (smaller, lighter) more than I originally expected. In terms of performance, I found the I3 processor more than sufficient for anything I'd want to do (light gaming, heavy Web surfing, watching streaming video like Netflix or Youtube). It has no issues whatsoever running Microsoft Office, either, which is something my other tablets (other than a Surface RT) can't even begin to do. Ditto with Photoshop Elements, etc. CPU hogs like video encoding were predictably slower than when performed on my much more powerful desktop. But they didn't bring the system to its knees, either.The ergonomics are fine: Rubberized feel around the edges is a nice touch, and there's a built in kick stand that allows only one stand-up position, but is fine for All-In-One use. (Demerits to Dell, however, for not including the nicer charger/stand and instead charging $100 for it as an option). Connectivity options are mediocre: A couple of USB 3.0 slots and wireless internet, along with a media card reader (thankfully...) But no HDMI, no video out of ANY kind (which means this device is a dog if you need something to take around with you for professional presentations...unfortunately).Summarizing:Pros:Intel I3-3227u processor is sufficiently fast to do most anything you'd want to do on this tablet (there's an optional I7 processor; most people won't be able to tell the difference except for very cpu intense processes, such as video editing)4Gb memory is sufficient (an optional upgrade bumps this to 8Gb; few will notice the difference)Nice high resolution graphics: 1920x1080Fast to bootBluetooth 4.0Media card reader (""8 in 1"")Pretty good sound quality for a tabletEh:Built in front-facing webcam is adequate, not great (720p = 1280x720)Included wireless mouse and keyboard are pretty genericUses basic Intel integrated graphics. Fine for most purposes. Will not thrill hardcore gamersGlossy screen suffers standard reflection issues when viewed head-onCons:Uses last generation ""Ivy Bridge"" processor. New ""Haswell"" processors get much better battery life with same performance and will assuredly be in next version of this productMediocre battery life (~4 hours)No GPSNo video out (no HDMI, no video display port, nothing)No wired eithernet port (you will have to buy a USB-to-ethernet adapter if you need wired ethernet.

"This is a hefty drive, both in terms of storage (128Gb) and in terms of physical construction (brushed aluminum). In an age where many of the recent drives are enclosed in plastic, a hefty metal housing is something of a novelty. That said, the design of the casing is strictly old school: Large, with a removable cap. Personally, I prefer designs that keep the cap attached to the housing--I have lost too many removable caps in my time...But, ultimately, for any modern large capacity flash drive, the big question is: How fast is it? Because if you have 128gb to fill, and you can't fill them fast, you may well take hours to take advantage of that capacity (or even days, if your drive stinks).I ran CrystalDiskMark 3.02 x64 (the standard drive performance test program) and attained the following results, averaged over 3 runs and a 1000Mb test size. Results are:Sequential Read (block size = 1024KB): 281.2 MB/sSequential Write (block size = 1024KB): 173.4 MB/sSequential Read (block size = 512KB): 213.0 MB/sSequential Write (block size = 512KB): 1.516 MB/sSequential Read (block size = 4KB): 5.629 MB/sSequential Write (block size = 4KB): 1.287 MB/sSequential Read (block size = 4KB, QD32): 7.367 MB/sSequential Write (block size = 4KB, QD32): 0.790 MB/sThe read and write speeds for the moderate sized (1028KB) files are very very good, and are in line with the speeds promised by Corsair on the packaging and on their website.For most users who will use this drive to store and/or read standard data (e.g. music or video files, documents, etc.) this is the speed test of greatest importance. If you're in that group, you can't go wrong with this drive.The read speed for the 512KB files is also very good.The write speed for the 512KB files, on the other hand, is very slow. This is not unusual for flash memory USB drives, but it indicates that this drive is not optimized for writing very small files.The 4K speeds are mostly of importance to those who either plan on running an operating system from this drive or else will be running certain types of programs from the drive. In these cases, a lot of small files (or fragments) will get written to the drive. The write speeds of this drive are relatively anemic and this drive is not well suited for this purpose.If you don't plan to run an OS or programs directly from this drive, then the 4K (and 512K) speeds aren't that important, and you should, as noted before, simply focus on the 1028KB speeds.Ultimately, this is a super fast drive if you're looking for raw storage--for a place to store your files for reading and writing. It's highly recommended for that purpose. Those looking for advanced functionality (OS on a stick, etc) should look elsewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Z5X5G8ZCR2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0HKIUG#wasThisHelpful","R29Z5X5G8ZCR2M","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As has been noted and discussed at length, the first release of this release was defective, with the incorrect labels on many of the vinyl records (the music on the records was fine, but the labels were wrong).Subsequently, the manufacturer pressed up replacement records with the correct labels. In sets released since the fix, the replacement records are shoved into the box (in individual ""inner"" sleeves) next to the box set itself. I didn't find this particularly worrisome or problematic, and because they packaged the set this way, you wind up with a spare set of most of the records that you can give to a friend (at least, a friend who can deal with the labels being wrong).The pressings are fine and the sound quality is fine.The sets are advertised as ""autographed"" and, indeed, a special 12x12"" cardstock insert appears in the middle of the gatefold for Transatlanticism that features the original signatures of the group.So far, so good.Here's where it goes awry: The box that holds the individual albums is manufactured in such a way that every album has a cut/dent at the edge of the album. Every set I've seen or read about has this problem. For the price being charged for this set, that's unforgivable. This should be close to perfect, and it assuredly won't be.On the whole, at well over $200 for the set of 7 albums (8 vinyl records), this is extremely pricey. Hardcore fans will want it regardless of the price. But anyone forking over that much cash for this set will assuredly expect something a little closer to perfection in the packaging.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8RSVJSVSJUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AGKH97G#wasThisHelpful","RE8RSVJSVSJUX","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First off, this is an extension camera for an SDI system. To use this camera, you need a SDI format DVR or other SDI compatible receiver. If you don't, you can't use this camera. Such a system can run you several hundred dollars and up.Second, this camera is wired. You need to run a cable from the camera to your receiver. If you need a wireless system, move along.OK, if you haven't been put off, the question you have is: How good is this camera? To test it, I tried it in two environments: 1) pointed to a fairly well lit street and 2) pointed into a nearly pitch black back yard. For the first test (well lit) I would say that the picture this camera is capable of is excellent--more than sufficient for any purpose. The auto focus is very good and when put into motion detection mode, it seemed to be quite adept at doing its job. But all cameras these days are fairly good with good light. It is in the second test (very low light) that I found that this camera really shines. Although the picture was unexpectedly grainy (it was amplifying the very little light it could pull in), the images were still more than acceptable (for a surveillance camera; don't expect to show these at your next anniversary).On the whole, if price is no object, I'd strongly recommend this camera. On the other hand, if you want to be cost efficient, then I'd suggest you could do with a cheaper camera in locations with good light. However, for very low light situations, you will probably find this camera is the best solution--despite the added cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E6JU5V49K8C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEQK9VC#wasThisHelpful","R3E6JU5V49K8C1","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll tell you what this is: It's a flaming pile.Once upon a time, there was a pretty cool LA punk band named Fear, back when punk was still kind of scary. Fear were always too smart for the room, and beneath the dangerous facade, there was a knowing wink. But it was all good. (Trivia note: I worked with guitarist Philo Cramer for a couple of Summers at a job where he put his physics degree to good use).Anyway, Fear put out several albums over the years, but it's only the first one that most really care about. It was (and is) a classic of the era: Fear: The Record. (The Record) (It came out in 1982, on Slash Records, they good ears folks of LA who also brought us early X, Germs, Los Lobos and Blasters, among others.)Three decades have gone by since Fear: The Record came out. The band split up and the members have cast to the wind, mostly, as good ex punks are wont to do. The original release has become a very quiet catalog release that sells whatever an artifact release like this might sell, which is probably not a lot. Certainly not a lot enough to keep any of the original members swimming in dough.So Lee Ving, original lead singer has been recruited to form a new version of ""Fear"" and re-record the original album. Because that's just what the world is waiting for. Or not. Perhaps, and by perhaps I mean assuredly, there was a modest check in it for him proffered by some huckster with a plan: Call the new album ""The Fear Album"" instead of ""Fear: The Album"" and lure a bunch of suckers. Oh, and make the cover kind of similar, too, just in case.So that's what you have here: A paycheck masquerading as some kind of relevant release. I don't need to tell you that this doesn't sound like Fear, and that even if it did, it would sound like Fear after Fear got fat and happy and more concerned with making the mortgage than with instigating the gobsters in the front row and hanging with fast living hipsters.This is atrocious, unnecessary and unworthy.

"This is one of a new breed of convertible laptops created to take advantage of the Windows 8 paradigm, which allows use as both as tablet and a laptop. While this category is expected to grow, right now, there are essentially only a modest number of entrants, and only two that could be reasonably be called innovative: The Dell XPS 12 (this one), and the Lenovo Yoga 13. The Dell and Lenovo sport similar power specs (cpu, memory, hard drive, battery life), but the Dell has a much higher resolution, better, screen. In my opinion, the Dell takes that competition handily.This is actually the second generation of the XPS 12, which replaces the earlier model which was released last year (Dell XPS 12 12.5-Inch Convertible 2-in-1 Touchscreen Ultrabook). The new version is almost identical to the older version in all physical terms, with the primary difference being that it's slightly lighter (about 3 ounces lighter). Under the hood, there is one very significant difference: This new model uses Intel's latest ""Haswell"" line of processes. These processors are APPRECIABLY more energy efficient than the previous generation processors (""Ivy Bridge"") that were used in the previous iteration of the XPS12. This means that run time on a full battery charge has increased from around 5 hours to around 8 hours. (!!!!) That single change--to run time on a full charge--addresses what many considered to be one of the major downsides of the previous generation XPS 12. (Note: The two processor lines, Haswell and Ivy Bridge, are pretty close to indistinguishable in terms of performance, with the Haswell just ever-so-slightly better [PassMark scores of 3380 and 3278 for the Haswell and Ivy Bridge, respectively, with higher being better]).Now, focusing on the XPS 12 as a total package: This is a terrific piece of hardware, with a lot of pros, and only a few significant cons.Summarizing,Pros:Beautiful super high resolution 1920x1080 12.5"" screenVery high build qualityTerrific innovative screen that rotates in the frame to go from laptop/keyboard to tablet configurationVery responsive with even the base configuration of an Intel I5 processor and 4Gb memoryIncredibly fast boot time (10-15 seconds)Very good keyboardResponsive touchscreen which operates in both laptop and tablet modesFast SSD drive in all configurationsDecent webcam (1.3mp)Light, portable charging cable.Bluetooth, Wireless N (5 + 2.4Ghz)Backlit keys on keyboardBattery life is 8+ hours (New for this version!)Eh:Weight is 3.2 pounds, which isn't heavy, but isn't super light for a 12.5"" laptop. A bit heavy feeling in tablet modeSpeakers are predictably mediocre for a small laptopBase configuration has only a 128Gb mSata SSD hard drive. However, the hard drive IS user replaceable.Cons:No HDMI or VGA port. Only a graphics mini displayport, which means you will need to carry a mini displayport -> HDMI or VGA adapter if you want to use this for business or with a TV/external monitor.Memory is soldiered to motherboard and is not upgradeable. Fortunately, even the base configuration 4Gb of memory is more than sufficient.Only two USB ports (both USB 3.0, however)Battery is not easily user swapped/replacableNo built in media card reader. If you want to the SD card from your camera, you'll need to carry an external reader.No GPSNo wired Ethernet port. If you want wired Ethernet, you'll need to buy a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. (You have wireless Ethernet, of course).Of the cons, the worst, in my opinion, is the fact that the battery is not easily swapped/replaced. While the 8+ hour run time is very respectable, one can expect battery life to diminish over time, and I am not looking forward to dealing with that eventuality. Also, I like to carry a spare battery to swap out for long trips. That's not possible here.Having struggled with various underpowered Android based tablets, including the Asus TF301/keyboard dock, I can say that using the XPS 12 in tablet mode is like a huge weight has been lifted. The XPS 12 screams when surfing the web, which is something I can't say about any Android (or Mac) tablet I've used--and I've used a lot of them.People have complained about the lack of apps in the Windows 8 app store--and it's true that the Windows 8 app store is pretty anemic compared to Andoid or Mac. But some of the most important apps are there (Skype, Netflix, etc.) and it's still growing. There are enough to make using the tablet mode acceptable now...and the responsiveness provided by the Intel I5 processor makes it a pleasure to use.There are a few configuration options available for the XPS 12, all related to the processor (a few speeds of I5 and I7), memory (4Gb or 8Gb) and hard drive size (128Gb or 256Gb or 512Gb). My recommendation: Any of the available processor speeds will be more than acceptable and the difference between the I5 and I7 processors for almost any user will be negligible. Similarly, most users will not need the 8Gb of memory. Windows 8 runs perfectly fine on 4Gb of memory. Unless you plan on running memory hog processes (advanced video editing, certain scientific apps, etc.) you won't need the extra memory. If you do need the extra memory, however, you need to order the laptop with 8Gb installed from the factory, as the memory is not user-upgradeable (it's soldiered to the motherboard...grrr...) A larger hard drive than the 128Gb SSD that comes installed on the base model is definitely a nice feature. But the hard drive IS user replaceable, and the incremental cost of getting the 256Gb mSata SSD from Dell is more than it would be to buy that 256Gb mSata SSD on the aftermarket and clone your 128Gb drive onto it. (You will also wind up with a spare 128Gb drive that way). Unless you are scared of the idea of hard drive cloning/migration, I'd recommend that path. Please note that this laptop uses the mSata configuration hard drive, rather than a full sized SSD to save space. mSata drives tend to be a bit more expensive than standard SSD drives.Overall, this is a terrific laptop, and buying the least expensive configuration version is, for most, the recommended route. In addition, the newer generation processor used for this updated version of the XPS 12 had addressed one of the major limitations of the earlier version, bumping the battery life to over eight hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29A2LQLQNVF9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3ZNQXU#wasThisHelpful","R29A2LQLQNVF9L","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's getting mighty crowded in here. ""Here"" being the portable and semi-portable bluetooth enabled speaker segment of the market. Thanks to the success of the Jambox, a truly portable (although heavy) small battery-powered bluetooth speaker, every Tom, Dick and Huckster has come out with a competitor. Some of these are really great given their limitations, such as the JBL Charge Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Grey) (and much better than the Jambox), many others are, er, not as good. To be polite.Rather than just add more noise to the segment, venerable speaker maker Boston Acoustics has taken a different approach. They've ditched the attempt to make a truly portable (read: battery powered and easily slid into your backpack) speaker, and instead made something with a little bigger footprint and a lot bigger sound. In the process, they also tossed the built in battery: This speaker is powered from your AC outlet, although Boston Acoustics cleverly neglects to show that cord in most of the photos. So if you want to move it from room-to-room in your house: no problem. If you want to move it from your house to the beach or the outdoor patio at your local Starbucks--this is not gonna cut it.But, truly, how often do you actually carry your several pound portable speaker with you? I have a couple of them--and they're nice for what they are--but I generally find a nice place for them to sit at home or at the office, and then they sit there for eternity. I guess maybe I'm beyond the age of ""dude, instant party!"" and perhaps that's the focus of this product.Anyway, back to the BA MC100. This is an elegant AC powered speaker (well two speakers in the case, actually) bluetooth enabled speaker. Like all the other bluetooth enabled speakers, you can connect it to your bluetooth enabled phone/tablet/laptop and like the other bluetooth enabled speakers, you can use it to fill your room (a moderate sized room, anyway) with sound. This one gets louder than most (perhaps all) of those smaller portables, however, and does it without straining and distorting as you raise the volume. I think the JBL Charge is swell (and pretty much the segment leader in portable bluetooth speakers), but this unit pretty handily crushes it. But it's not really portable in a backpack way (unless you have a big hunkin' backpack). It's portable in a ""could you please take that speaker up to your room so we don't have to listen to YOUR music anymore?"" way.Beyond the basic bluetooth enabled functionality, this isn't huge on features. You can connect it via the newish ""NFC"" protocol, if your phone/tablet/laptop supports it. (This protocol means you just touch the two devices and they connect. The rest of us actually have to press about 2-4 keys, once, which is not really a hardship). And if you don't have bluetooth, you can connect the speaker to your device via a minijack input. And the speaker supports the very new AptX bluetooth protocol for, arguably, better sound transmission (if you phone/tablet/pc supports it). But most probably won't notice.That's it. You can't charge any devices with this speaker (unlike some of the portables) and there's no built-in microphone (so you can't use it as a hands-free speaker with your phone--not that any of the portables with this feature work very well, anyway). So if you need and want those features (or true portability) move along.But if sound quality--especially at higher volumes--is your main concern, and you are willing to accept that this is only portable within the confines of your home (or within the confines of your work cubicle), then I strongly recommend you audition this speaker (which, I should point out, retails for the same price as most of those decent portables). For me, at the price and with bluetooth connectivity, this is the one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YMHDIYBU5A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EWEHIE6#wasThisHelpful","R38YMHDIYBU5A4","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bacco Bucci has, for some time, stood for reasonable quality, with a line of made-in-Italy shoes that combine good materials and design with a fit that is comfortable for American feet (uncommon for Italian shoes).These shoes, however, are another story. The caste is still comfortable. However, the leather feels thin and cheap, the soul is cheap plastic, and (perhaps not surprisingly) this one is made in China.It carries the Bacco Bucci name, but it's hardly worthy of their typical lines.The look is OK, and if you can get them cheaply, give them a try.

"When someone demonstrates a real market for a new electronics product, you can be sure that the rest of the industry will soon follow with a variety of me-too and me-better competitors. So it is with the now seemingly endless array of bluetooth speakers that are appearing on the market, in the wake of the first hit in this segment, the Jambox (Jawbone JAMBOX Wireless Bluetooth Speaker - Black Diamond - Retail Packaging).Basically, all of these speakers are portable, allow Bluetooth connections, and promise ""good"" and loud sound. Not all fulfill their promises, of course.Tylt's TUNZ Bluetooth speaker system is very clearly aimed directly at one-upping the Jambox. It even looks like a Jambox, although it's about 1.5"" more narrow and 1.5"" thicker in the other dimensions. The question is, is it better, or even as good?First things first: While Jambox defined the segment, there are now a few high end competitors who are considered by many (including myself) better. First among these, perhaps, is JBL's Charge (JBL Charge Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Grey)), which sounds better than the Jambox. And I can say without any hesitation that the Tylt TUNZ speaker does not compete on sound with the JBL. The JBL runs away with the sound quality competition. So if that's your one and only criterion, then stop reading and go get one.But for many, this is a lifestyle product, and in that case, the ergonomics and other features may hold some sway. So let's get to the pro/con analysis.Pros:1) Comes with three different changeable colored rubber gaskets (black, blue, orange) that fit around the speaker, so you can coordinate with your room, your backpack, or your mood.2) Unlike the Jambox, TUNZ allows you to connect a USB device to the back and use the internal battery to charge your device (at the rate of 1A). Note that the internal battery is 2800 mAh in size, and you can only charge an attached device until the internal battery is half empty. That means that you only have 1400 mAh, maximum, to devote to device charging. What all this means is that a fully charged TUNZ device could probably provide a decent charge to your smartphone once, and will not be able to provide more than a modest charge to your tablet or other more hungry device. Also note that TUNZ won't even start to charge a device if the battery is less than 75% charged, so if you use it for a while, it's not likely going to be able to even start providing a charge until you recharge the speaker itself.3) A list price that's 25% lower than the list price of the comparable Jambox (although actual selling price is about the same).4) Allows for NFC connection. This means that if your phone is ""NFC"" enabled, all you need to do is tap your phone against the body of the TUNZ speaker, and the Bluetooth connection will be automatically set up. Kind of neat, although a lot of phones are not NFC enabled, and the real amount of effort this reduces (if you have to force the Bluetooth connection with the button on the speaker) is modest. More cool that essential, in other words.5) Has an integrated microphone that allows phone calls to be handled through the speaker6) Sound at low-to-mid levels is good, with decent (for this size device) perceived bass.7) Can get sufficiently loud to fill a modest sized room8) With a fully charged battery, the manufacturer claims 20 hours of life at ""half volume"". To test, I charged mine and played at a moderate volume continuously until the unit gave out. I got a little over 17 hours. Which isn't bad. Note that at loud volumes, the rated playtime is only 8 hours.9) Bluetooth implementation is version 3, which is somewhat faster to create a connection than the older implementation in most Bluetooth devices. The TUNZ speaker connected very quickly in my tests.Cons:1) At loud volumes, the speaker tends to distort. To my ears, the Jambox does better at loud volumes than the TUNZ. And the JBL Charge does much better. To be fair, however, the TUNZ speaker does seem to get a little louder than that of the Jambox.2) The unit is very slow to charge. A full charge through the USB cable takes 6-7 hours.3) I found the unit pretty useless for making/receiving calls. The problem is that integrated microphone isn't very sensitive. When I tried to call people using this speaker, they would complain that I was too distant unless I was speaking loudly very near the speaker itself. This defeats the purpose of using this as a hands free speaker for calls. Although it's nice to have this feature (and the better sounding JBL Charge doesn't have it), the implementation is inferior enough that I would say that it's irrelevant. (Again, in fairness, the implementation for the Jambox, which include a microphone, is also problematic).On the whole, I found TUNZ speaker to be reasonable in quality, with some nice additional features. Sound quality at low and mid volumes is competitive with the Jambox. This speaker seems to get somewhat louder than the Jambox at higher volumes, but also seems to distort more than the Jambox at high volumes. Sound quality across the spectrum is inferior to the JBL Charge. The ergonomics (shape, weight) are comparable to the Jambox, and TUNZ has some cute colorful rubber gaskets to personalize the look, which the Jambox does not. TUNZ has a built in microphone, but I found the performance of the microphone disappointing and nearly useless--which is an issue with the Jambox as well. In terms of add-on functional niceties, TUNZ has two that stand out, relative to the Jambox: 1) Ability to charge a smartphone or other low power device (although only with the TUNZ battery is nearly full); 2) NFC connection, which allows equipped phones to start a connection by merely tapping the TUNZ speaker.Given the slightly lower price, and the various differentiating niceties, I would suggest that TUNZ is worth auditioning for those who would otherwise purchase the Jambox.That said, if you are satisfied with the ergonomics and can live without the (flawed) microphone, my recommendation would still be the JBL Charge (JBL Charge Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Grey)), which offers better sound quality, as well as (like the TUNZ speaker) the ability to charge your smartphone--and the internal battery in the JBL Charge is 6000mAh in size, more than double that in the TUNZ speaker.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WN4DEINJUYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DG8NI5C#wasThisHelpful","R3WN4DEINJUYK","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got two pairs of these. On both pairs, one of the buttons on the headphones was defective (did not work). A different button on each pair. On one pair, I was able to listen (though not adjust the volume), and the sound quality was mediocre at best: Thin and inaccurate.They weren't very comfortable to wear, either.The only positive things I can say is that the Bluetooth connection was easy to set up.

"This is a straight reissue of David Gates' four solo albums for Elektra: First, Never Let Her Go, Goodbye Girl and Falling in Love Again.Gates, the songwriter, singer and arranger of all of Bread's most famous songs, started out very strongly with his debut solo album, First. Great songs, great arrangements, excellent singing. The songs on his followup, Never Let Her Go, are somewhat weaker, but this is still a generally strong entry. The third album, Goodbye Girl, features his only actual hit as a solo artist (the title track), and mixes it with a combination of decent new material and some songs recycled from earlier releases. At this point, Gates seemed to be running out of steam somewhat, which was probably due in part to using some of his material for the Bread reunion album (Lost Without Your Love) around the same period. The recycled songs that originally appeared on Goodbye Girl are not presented again in this collection. Finally, Gates closed out his Elektra tenure with Falling in Love Again. This album is appreciably weaker than any that appeared before. Gates sounds tired and uninspired here, and in interviews years later has admitted that he had lost the muse when it came time to record this record. To my ears, there's only one really good song on this album, Where Does the Loving Go.After the Elektra period, Gates would record one more solo album, for Arista, and then go into a more than decade long retirement. (The Arista album is better than Falling in Love Again, but it's not great).I'm giving this collection four stars on the basis of how I'd rate the individual albums:First: 4.5*Never Let Her Go: 3.5*Goodbye Girl: 3*Falling in Love Again: 2*and rounding up the result to reflect the discount one-stop-shopping available here. In truth, this collection is about a 3.5* set, if Amazon allowed partial rankings.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YDXWTV9PCYGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY5XTB6#wasThisHelpful","R1YDXWTV9PCYGF","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off: All the negative reviews that appear here aren't related to the music that's here. They are related to the fact that this was misleadingly marketed as the soundtrack to the reformed ELP's shows at the High Voltage festival. It's not. It's just a compilation of old studio material.OK, now you know.What do you get?You get1) Side one of Tarkus in its entirety. (This is the 20+ minute fan favorite progressive suite that fills the entirety of side one of the original album).2) You get the entirety of the live Pictures at an Exhibition album.3) You get about 1/2 of their debut album, including the best tracks, and including the 12+ minute extended opus from that album, Take a Pebble.4) You get one of the two group showpieces from the Works Vol 1 album, Fanfare for the Common Man5) You get the minor late-era hit Touch and GoThat's it. And taken just in terms of music, that's a pretty good list. Strangely, you get absolutely nothing from their biggest album, Brain Salad Surgery. But side one of Tarkus and all of Pictures, plus the three tracks from the debut album constitute something of a generous best-of of the first three albums. Combine this with a cheap copy of Brain Salad Surgery and you'll have a pretty good cheap starter collection--although you'll have nothing from the worthy Trilogy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWI6ARRXVV9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SCMHGC#wasThisHelpful","R2DWI6ARRXVV9Y","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another day, another set of headphones added to the arsenal. I have everything from very high end Shure and Sennheiser headphones to a handful of mid priced headphones from brands like Sony, Sennheiser, Bose, Monster, Beats and AKG, to a drawer full of the cheap stuff. While the super high end phones are great, they are also super expensive (too expensive for me to comfortably take them on a trip, for example). Also they're usually klunky looking for wearing outside the home. The middle ground headphones are sometimes really good, but also mostly have their limitations. And the cheap stuff is all over the map.Anyway, back to these phones. They're definitely priced and marketed as middle ground headphones, intended for use outside the house. They're kind of trendy looking--as much so as over the ears headphones can be--and they're priced to compete with stuff like Monster.The question is: How do they sound.Answer: Pretty good. VERY deep bass, clear, non fatiguing highs. Clear midrange. These are NOT the headphones for you if you want a neutral listening experience. However, if you are looking for a ""fun"" headphone that will do well with bass rich music (rock, rap, etc.) you'll likely enjoy these. To compare these with what I suspect is one of AKGs competitive targets: These wipe the floor with the popular Beats by Dr Dre line--better defined bass and without the hideous flabby midrange and mediocre high end.In terms of long term listening (several hours): I found these headphones pretty comfortable when I put them on--a little tight on the ears, but nothing bad. But I did start to get mechanical fatigue from the headband and earpads after a couple of hours. These are assuredly not as comfortable as something like a comfort leader like the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones for extended listening (but they are better in a low noise environment).Noise isolation seemed pretty good. I tried them out in a bus environment and was able to fully enjoy my music. There doesn't seem to be much leakage of sound to annoy the person next to you, either. This might make them OK for a plane flight--but I'd hesitate due to questions of whether they'd be comfortable for that long a duration.These come with an in-line remote and microphone, which are designed for use with an iPhone/iPad. I don't use that ecosystem, so I didn't try out these features.The package comes with the headphones, a minijack to full jack adapter, a simple pouch and a cord extender.On the whole, I like these headphones. Whether these should be one of your top considerations should depend very much on whether you tend to prefer a neutral listening experience, or whether a headphone that can (and does) emphasize the bass appeals to you. These are assuredly of the latter type. I find that fine and fun, and often my preference for non-critical listening in public, in the gym, etc. But if you want that neutral experience (usually my preference at home, and assuredly what most classical/jazz/etc listeners will want) then I'd suggest looking at a different model.I can state with 100% assurety that if you are considering something like the Beats line, these headphones are both cheaper and hands down MUCH better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274PTD2EMIA9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KPMQAS#wasThisHelpful","R274PTD2EMIA9G","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Belkin @TV Premium mobile TV platform is one of a growing number of devices that allow you to broadcast your home video to your mobile devices or to computers (mobile or on your home network). It follows the segment leading Slingbox, as well as a number of other brands, including Monsoon (of which this is a rebranded variant), Sony, and others.The question is, then, what does this device bring to the table that the well-established (and fairly slick) Slingbox platform does not? I can answer that very quickly:1) It's somewhat cheaper than the comparable Slingbox hardware (at retail, about $50 cheaper)2) It offers built in wireless, whereas the comparable Slingbox does not. (You must move up to a much more expensive model Slingbox to get wireless built in).3) The app to view Belkin @TV broadcast on your tablet is free (Slingbox charges $15 for it). HOWEVER, you still need to pay to get the app for your phone (same as Slingbox, although at the time of writing, the Belkin app is a couple of dollars cheaper). It's worth noting that you can buy the Slingbox phone app and use that on both your phone and your tablet, so if you plan to buy the phone app, this is really a push for the two platforms.4) Using the mobile software, you can record video on your mobile device (tablet/phone). Note that this is real time recording (your @TV broadcasts the video and you capture it into a file on your mobile device as it is received). So this isn't going to be of much help if you're about to get on a plane and forget that you wanted something to watch while you're not connected to the internet.5) This device allows multiple users on a local network to watch the video from a @TV Premium source. This means if you are AT HOME and you have multiple users that want to watch the same video at the same time on different platforms AT HOME, you can do so. Slingbox doesn't support this, and I can see where this might be useful. HOWEVER, if you are outside your local network (on your phone or tablet or PC away from home), only one user can watch the @TV unit at once (and that one total user includes home users)--same as Slingbox.Here's where this device is inferior to the Slingbox:1) To watch on any PC device, you need to install substantial software. Unlike the Slingbox, there is no browser embedded application. Right now, the only platforms that are supported are Android, iOS (Apple iPhone/table), Windows, and MacOS. Glaringly absent from that list are platforms like the Chromebook--since there's no browser embedded app. Also, you will need to download and install a > 200 mb file to run the player on a Mac or PC. Some will find this annoying.Here's an annoyance this device shares with the comparable Slingbox model:No HDMI connectivity. You have to use analog/composite connectors. Cable clutter is so 2005, don't you think?As for setup and performance: I found the Belkin @TV Premium pretty straightforward. Connect the proper cables, set up the IR blaster (to control your device), download the software for your PC (or Mac or Android or iOS), set up an account, go through the setup and tell the device what it's connected to and what video source it will be controlling, and watch. One caveat: You HAVE to connect the Belkin unit via wired ethernet for initial setup, even if you will subsequently use wireless. Once you set things up, you can remove the cable. But be aware you'll have to do this.Video quality seemed good once I had it all set up. On my home network, video was clear with no stutters, and seemed comparable to Slingbox. When I went to a local coffee shop to test the remote broadcasting capability, I got a pretty good signal, with a few stutters. It appears a few seconds of buffering on intermediate servers is implemented on this device, just as with Slingbox, so even if your signal gets dodgy for a few seconds, you can watch a fairly constant video flow.I had a Slingbox attached to the same video source, so I was able to A/B the video quality with the same signal at the remote location, for this device versus a Slingbox. My qualitative analysis is that most of the time the two signals were pretty much the same, although when the internet signal got slow, it appeared to me that the Slingbox did a little better job of maintaining a watchable (though degraded) picture.On the whole, this seems like a decent alternative to Slingbox, and at a lower price. Normally, I'd be a little worried that this device represents only a narrow piece of the corporate Belkin pie, and so support could be dropped at any time if it's not a raging success. However, Belkin is just front ending a device and software being supported by a company whose primary focus is this type of device (Monsoon), so I'm not too worried about that.The one important drawback to this @TV device is that it does not support a browser embedded app. This means you have a large program you will need to download and install on your PC or Mac. More significantly, it means that for now you can't use this device with platforms like Chromebook (where there is a Slingbox app). Depending on the hardware you use, this could be significant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23RG2D6SCVMHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPH56AU#wasThisHelpful","R23RG2D6SCVMHZ","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The story of Flash Harry is pretty well known: Harry Nilsson, he of anglelic 3+ octive voice and commensurate songwriting abiltities is signed to RCA, where he releases a string of criticially adored albums and one commercial blockbuster, then blows his voice out in a lost weekend recording session with John Lennon, loses his songwriting muse in a blur of alcohol and other sidelines, and ultimately loses his RCA contract, never to release another album in the US in his lifetime.He did, however, release one more album. That being this, Flash Harry. Issued in limited quantities to a non-plussed select few countries in 1980. Quantities pressed and sold were minimal and it has become something of a holy grail rarity over the years for Nilsson fans--although more because it has seldom been heard than because it's great.And make no mistake: This is NOT a great Nilsson album. It's not even a good album. It's mostly a mish-mosh of covers and moldy stuff that had been written years before, delivered in a voice that isn't even as good as the somewhat recovered voice Nilsson revealed on his last RCA album (Knnillssonn). Nilsson doesn't sound engaged here and, to be bluntly honest, it's entirely clear why Mercury (his record label for this release) chose to not even bothering to release it in his home country. Rather, the surprise is that it got a release in ANY country.That's sad, but it's the hard truth.At any rate, in the wake of ""The Year (or so) of Nilsson"" (a box set covering his tenure at RCA; a well-received documentary; a biography) we get this piece of the puzzle that serves as an endcap on the RCA box. Those who fall in love again with Nilsson on the basis of the box and those who never gave up the faith will undoubtedly be happy to finally be able to get a copy of this album at a reasonable price.

"Neither the listing nor the boatload of reviews seems to give any real pertinent information about this charger. So I will.First off, the specs: This is a 1A, 5V USB charger. The 5V part is standard. The 1A (1000 mA) value is the key one. You want a charger that can provide AT LEAST the amperage requirements of the device you're attaching to it. This value does NOT have to match the rating of the device you're attaching, but if your device is designed to use more than 1000 mA then this charger won't keep it charged while in use (it WILL slowly charge it when not in use). What this means, in practical terms, is that this charger is suitable for just about every smartphone made (all of which use about 1000 mA or less), but will NOT keep something like a power hungry tablet charged while in use.Second, this charger, while it carries the Kodak brand name, is just a standard charger from China, and also appears in other contexts without the Kodak name. This charger is not ""designed by Kodak"" or ""proprietary to Kodak"". That said, it appears to be of reasonable quality.Ultimately, if you need a USB charger with the above specs, then this is a reasonable possibility. Would I recommend it? If the price is good. I WOULD recommend this over any of the no name chargers you see being sold by the online cell phone accessory companies for $1-2. Those are typically underpowered AND poorly regulated (meaning they can burn out your device if the charger doesn't burn out first).One last note: These things are also manufactured in huge quantity as counterfeits. If you decide to buy this, I strongly encourage you to buy only directly from Amazon. You have been warned...","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWYQBSHH4IQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003A4H2LI#wasThisHelpful","R2EWYQBSHH4IQF","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This album is atrocious:1) It's a bootleg. The material covered by this album is owned by the Gene Clark estate and this is an unauthorized release.2) The sound quality on the first disc, which is copy of the legitimate/licensed Gene Clark Live Silverado '75-Live & Unreleased is unbelievably bad. Sound is ridiculously bad. Song order is wrong. They even speeded up the recordings when mastering. This is a grand master class in the creation of bootleg rubbish.3) The sound quality on the second disc is mediocre at best, and this material has NOTHING to do with the material on the first disc. It wasn't recorded at the same time (it was recorded years later). It sounds like an average bootleg, and really brings little to the table that isn't already available on legitimate issues.Stay as far away from this piece of junk as you can.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R42CBYQ9FIBPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVNXMIQ#wasThisHelpful","R42CBYQ9FIBPO","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love hot and spicy, and I love hot sauce. I'm the guy in the crowd who orders his food too hot for anyone else to share...not to be antisocial, but because I like hot.I have a love/hate relationship with this Huy Fong Sriacha sauce.On the plus side: 1) Decent heat; 2) Not vinegary; 3) Pleasant flavor, not just hot; 4) Super cheapOn the down side: 1) Not super heat; 2) Second ingredient is sugar.#2 on the down side is why I have the love/hate relationship. I wish this had less sugar in it. It's not super sweet--don't get me wrong. But it's sweeter than I would generally like, and for that reason, while it works great in some dishes, in others it adds some sweetness that's unwelcome.The high sugar content is why I consider this to be, basically, Asian ketchup. Ketchup is tomatoes, sugar and vinegar. This is hot peppers, sugar, and vinegar (with a bit of garlic). You wouldn't put ketchup on everything, even if you love ketchup on some things, and it's the same with this stuff. And I think the places they don't belong are pretty similar: Foods where the added sweet is not a plus.Anyway, I keep a bottle of this around for all the foods it DOES work well with.

"If you're looking at this Eagles box set, presumably you already know most of what you need to know about the band, and about their albums. They started as a country-influenced band, had a few hit singles and modestly successful albums. Over the course of their first four albums, they moved increasingly towards the pop/rock middle. With their fifth album, they took on rock guitarist Joe Walsh, lost the last vestiges of country (and some of their original members) and had their biggest, most shining, moment with Hotel California, which rightfully defined a musical time and place. Hubris, infighting, drugs, and many other withering influences wrecked havoc with the now huge band in the wake of Hotel California, and the long delayed swan-song studio album of their original run, The Long Run, was disappointingly inferior given expectations and the time it took to come to fruition.Later came the Hell Freezes Over reunion, the endless tours, and one more (decent) studio album (so far). But that part of the story isn't covered by this box.So what do you get here? You get all the original studio albums of their 1970s Asylum tenure. You don't get the live album from that era (rather dull anyway), and you don't get the one-off Christmas single (Please Come Home for Christmas), or a stray b-side. But other than that, this is their entire released studio output of that era. There are no bonus tracks on any of these albums. The albums also have not been remastered for this release, but instead are identical to the previous remasters from more than a decade ago. They sound fine, though...The mini sleeves are adequate, as is the enclosing box. There are no liner notes.Ultimately, this is a good deal for someone who wants all the music, with decent sound quality, for a low price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TM041JOH3EHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7VPKMY#wasThisHelpful","R1TM041JOH3EHO","A2I18AO597DSDI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I18AO597DSDI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing by Marie Kondo has become my new bible.  I never even heard of this book until I saw it on a recent best-seller list.  I read the reviews and was intrigued.  Many readers claimed that it changed their life.  Although I havent yet begun decluttering, I have taken to heart many of Kondos lessons about accumulating too much stuff and I am forming an action plan.My husband and I have been married almost 32 years, and we have lived in our present (very large) house for 30 years.  We have been talking about downsizing and moving, but the thought of divesting ourselves of all our possessions is a daunting task.  Like many, we have clothes that havent been worn in 20 years, greeting cards going back decades, bills and cancelled checks from our entire married life, pictures, books, knickknacks, mementoes and the list goes on.  Kondo provides many lessons about how to get control of your life by getting control of your stuff.  First, you need to discard and then you can organize what remains.  She also recommends sorting by category, and not by location.  So if youre going tackle your clothes, do all your clothes in every closet and bureau in every room.  Then you can move on to the next category.  I love greeting cards and save them for sentimental reasons.  But Kondo claims that each card has fulfilled its purpose the moment the receiver finishes reading it.  Kondo also advises saving things because you love them and because they bring you joy.  This is especially important when assessing sentimental items.  No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past.  The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important.Kondo includes so many little tips throughout her book.  Dont save extra buttons.  We never use them.  If you have owned a book for some time and havent read it, you wont.  Dont scatter storage places.  Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.  Dont stack items when you store them.  The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up is filled with such gems.  Will I follow all of them?  Probably not.  Im a bibliophile and the thought of parting with books is just more than I can tolerate right now.  But I am looking forward to using Kondos techniques to get the rest of our house in order.  People who have done so claim it is life transforming.  I certainly hope so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VQ3M3ZSTFL4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607747308#wasThisHelpful","R3VQ3M3ZSTFL4U","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah Vowell has a way of bringing history to life with knowledge and humor, and I was thrilled to obtain her latest effort, Lafayette in the Somewhat United States, through Amazon Vine.  Not too long ago, I wondered why there are so many cities and towns named Fayetteville throughout the United States.  When reading the history of Fayetteville, NC, I realized that all these places are named after Revolutionary War hero, the Marquis de Lafayette.  Unfortunately, the contributions by this French citizen to our own country have been largely forgotten.  So leave it to Vowell to bring Lafayette back to life in this interesting and entertaining book.Lafayette was born Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de Lafayette.  Mostly, he is known as the Marquis de Lafayette or just Lafayette.  The thing that drew me to Lafayette as a subjectthat he was the rare object of agreement in the ironically named United Stateskept me coming back to why that made him unique.  His father died when he was only two in the Seven Years War and he was born hating the British.  When he was 19, he sailed to the United States without the knowledge of his family to offer his services to the Continental Army.  His reasons were varied including a lust for glory, the appeal of escaping his nagging in-laws, boredom with the court shenanigans of Versailles, and a head full of Enlightenment chitchat about liberty and equality.  It didnt hurt that he was independently wealthy and agreed to serve without pay.  At first he was given the rank of major general, but without any duties. But it didnt take long for George Washington and Lafayette to form a father-son bond and General Washington soon started trusting the young Frenchman with more leadership rolls.  Vowell takes  us through the Revolutionary War and highlights Lafayettes contributions in the war effort.  She also covers his grand tour of American in 1824-1825, where tens of thousands of Americans came out to see him as he toured all the states then in the US, as well as visiting those friends from Revolutionary War times who were still alive including John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Thomas Jefferson.  At the time, Lafayette was the last surviving general from the Revolutionary War.But what makes Lafayette in the Somewhat United States so good is Vowells humor, her impertinence and her ability to compare past to present.  She travels to Brandywine, PA to see the sight of the Battle of Brandywine.  She times her visit so that she is there for a Battle of Brandywine reenactment and A Son of Liberty puppet show about Lafayette.  I neednt have worried about how the event planners could possibly turn a bummer like Brandywine into a celebration.  If Americans can transform Memorial Day, technically a remembrance of all our war dead ever, into the official kickoff of summer, we can handle adapting one demoralizing battle into a wholesome, chipper get-together.  In 1934, FDR gave a speech before congress honoring Lafayette on the 100th anniversary of his death.  FDRs speech acknowledged that every now and then, a bunch of backbiting blowhards like the United States Congress can temporarily come together with their president to mourn the death of one of the few people, places, or things they and their fidgety constituents have ever agreed on.Vowell says it best when she writes that Lafayette represented neither North nor South, East or West, left or right, Yankees or Red Sox.  Lafayette has always belonged to all of us.  In her book, Lafayette in the Somewhat United States, she puts him back on our national stage and gives him the prominence he deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKWNG5VABDYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631743#wasThisHelpful","R3KKWNG5VABDYC","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louise Pennys The Long Way Home is the 10th novel in her Inspector Armand Gamache-series.  However, Gamache is now retired from his job of Chief Inspector of Homicide for the Surete du Quebec and is living in the small village of Three Pines with his wife, Reine-Marie.  The Long Way Home was a bit of a disappointment and it is not what I have come to expect from Penny.  I think her Gamache-series works better as a police procedural.  Without that discipline and focus, this novel tends to wander.  Also, please dont try to read any of these novels out of order.In novel number seven, A Trick of the Light, Clara and Peter Morrow, two recurring characters who live in Three Pines, have separated.  The deal is that after living apart without any contact for one year, Peter will return to their home on the exact anniversary day of his departure and they will decide how to proceed with their marriage.  Both artists, the breach was caused by Claras sudden artistic success after years of struggling, along with Peters jealousy.  But that anniversary comes and goes and Peter is missing.  Clara asks Gamache for help, and the former chief inspector enlists the aid of his former assistant and now son-in-law, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.  Along with retired psychologist and Three Pines bookseller, Myrna Anders, the four take off to track Peters journey.  Credit card records show he traveled to Europe and back, but the trail goes cold once he arrived back home in Canada.  And so Gamache and crew figure out that he must be painting with a former professor in a very remote area of Canada.  It appears that this once very conservative artist is trying to expand his horizons, although all think that Peter is in danger.There was just too much that didnt quite work in The Long Way Home.  The plot was totally implausible.  Do we really think that someone would try to murder another by exposing them to asbestos?  The constant art talk got tedious and it was tiring each time the crew tried to analyze and interpret Peters five new paintings.  Their constant travel was also monotonous (plane, boat, car).  The areas in which they ended up including Charlevois and Baie-Saint-Paul sound stunning, but without photos, the written descriptions were lacking.  And the ending was a total disappointment.  Still, Pennys writing is poignant except that instead of writing about crime, most of her observations were about art and the damaged souls of the characters.  Although Peters new paintings are very disturbing and not pleasing to the eye, they were markers, signposts. Pointing out where hed been and where he was going.  The route he was traveling, artistically, emotionally, creatively.After going through all of Pennys previous novels in quick order, I now am down to her latest book, The Nature of the Beast.  I do hope that Penny finds a better way to utilize Gamaches talents in book number eleven.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7SEJEG4AQME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022053#wasThisHelpful","R3U7SEJEG4AQME","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deep South by Paul Theroux is the second Vine book Ive ordered recently because the promo said it would appeal to readers who enjoy both Tony Horwitz and Bill Bryson. Those are two of my favorites, so I just had to order Deep South: Four Seasons on Back Roads.  Deep South is a wonderfully written travelogue that is fascinating, depressing, informative and yet hopeful.  Deep South has photographs by Steve McCurry, but unfortunately, the uncorrected proof didnt have any except for the haunting cover shot.Paul Theroux is a very prolific writer but most of his books are written from foreign locales.  During the United States presidential campaign of 2012, he travels through the South and realizes how little of the United States he has actually seen.  So he returns to the South during all four seasons.  After his first trip, I knew that the South had me, sometimes in a comforting embrace, occasionally in its frenzied and unrelenting grip.  He tries to stay away from major cities and instead, visits the Lowcountry, the Black Belt, the Delta, and the backwoods  What Theroux experiences during his four seasons is a mixed bag.  On the negative side, he saw extreme poverty, hunger, bank and food deserts, struggling farmers, closed industries, few jobs, a lack of health care, discrimination and the long shadow of the Ku Klux Klan.  Much of what Theroux saw reminded him of the Third World countries in which he traveled, only they received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States to aid projects to improve or promote education, create energy resources, offer medical care, even help the tourism industry ($700 million to Tanzania and $350 million to Zambia, for example).  Most of these areas in the US receive little or no federal dollars.  On the positive side, Theroux witnessed beautiful country, friendly and earnest people, hard-working farmers, a number of characters and many true heroes (Cynthia Burton, Bernie Mazyck, and Pam Dorrto name just a few).  He also discovered that The Deep South today is not in its books, its in its people and the people are hospitable, they are talkers, and if they take to you, theyll tell you their stories.I also enjoyed Deep South as this book is also about Southern writers and Southern books.  Theroux quotes liberally from writers who have made similar journeys.  He also critiques a number of Southern writers including William Faulkner, James Agee, Harper Lee, and Charles Portis.  If I have one negative about Deep South, its that I think the author spent a little too much time blasting Bill Clinton.  He continually criticized the Clinton Foundation for helping countries overseas without spending anything in the United States.  That is a valid point, but he doesnt have to mention it over and over again.  He also condemned Clinton as being a bird-dogger of chicks, a Southern hackster, emotionally immature and hungry for the worlds affection.  Again, this book was about the Deep South and not Bill Clinton.Throughout Deep South, I was enthralled by Therouxs writing and observations and even though Ive read a Vine uncorrected proof, I plan to purchase the published book so that Ill have the photographs to enjoy, as well.  I also plan to start reading some of Therouxs others works, as Deep South was my first exposure to him as a writer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17K9VAL0ANX1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544323521#wasThisHelpful","R17K9VAL0ANX1E","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After finishing Louise Pennys The Beautiful Mystery, I had to immediately begin How the Light Gets In to see how this continuing plot-line played out.  How the Light Gets In is book number 10 in Pennys Inspector Armand Gamache series, and is extremely dark, complex, and intricately woven together.  Yet, it ends on a note of hopefulness.As in most Gamache novels, the chief of homicide for the Surete du Quebec has two storylines.  The first is the murder or murders that Gamache and his team must solve.  The second is a plot that carries over between novels and mostly goes back to the Arnot case and also, the evil Superintendent of the Surete Sylvain Francoeur.  The Christmas season is approaching and retired psychologist, Myrna Landers, is hosting a former patient and now friend, Constance Pineault.  Pineault has never really revealed all the secrets of her childhood to Anders, but she appears on the verge of doing so when she is found murdered in her home.  Very few except Landers know that Constance is the last of the Oulette quintuplets (think Dionne quintuplets born in 1934).  They were removed from their parents, lived in a house built by the government, and put on display to become a major tourist attraction.  Although the victim doesnt live in Gamaches territory, their homicide chief is happy to dump the case in Gamaches lap because of the approaching holidays.  Meanwhile, Superintendent Francoeur is doing everything in his power to destroy the much beloved and successful homicide chief.  Almost every agent except for Isabelle Lacoste has been removed from his team, and instead, hes been given the dregs of the Surete.  Gamache seems not to be bothered by this and plays along with Francoeur.  But what really disturbing to Gamache is the falling out that he had with his second in command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.I found How the Light Gets In to be a haunting book.  Armand Gamache had always held unfashionable beliefs.  He believed that light would banish the shadows.  That kindness was more powerful than cruelty, and that goodness existed, even in the most desperate places.  He believed that evil had its limits.  But looking at the young men and women staring at him now, whod seen something terrible about to happen and had done nothing, Chief Inspector Gamache wondered if he could have been wrong all this time.  Maybe the darkness sometimes won.  Maybe evil had no limits.  But there is also a lot of good in this bookespecially the residents and recurring characters from Three Pines.  I sometimes grow tired of having so many Penny books take place in Three Pines, but How the Light Gets In isnt one of them.Although How the Light Gets In is dark and disturbing, it ends on a hopeful note.  Also, based on the ending, it is possible that Louise Penny might take Gamache in a new direction in future novels.  I cant wait to see when I begin The Long Way Home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZDO1VO2G3IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047277#wasThisHelpful","R2RZDO1VO2G3IT","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon starting Sweet Forgiveness by Lori Nelson Spielman, I thought this was going to be a very enjoyable novel.  True, it was a little sappy and very predictable, but it was fun.  And then I reached the end and thought that the author really dropped the ball.Hannah Farr has her own morning television show in New Orleans.  To outward appearances, it might seem that Farr has it all together.  But her ratings are slumping, she has creative differences with her boss, and a new, beautiful and young co-worker is trying to muscle in on her territory.  She is also in a relationship with the mayor of New Orleans, which is going nowhere.  And she hasnt seen or spoken to her mom since her graduation from high school.  A former classmate, Fiona Knowles, has scored a big social trend with forgiveness stones.  You send two small stones or pebbles to a person you have wronged.  If they forgive you, theyre supposed to return one of the stones to you.  Fiona Knowles bullied Farr in grade school, and so Farr is one of the first to receive stones from Knowles (the Original 35).  But Farr isnt sure shes ready to forgive and the stones have been sitting in her desk for two years.  Its not until shes forced to deal with this as a television topic that all of Farrs secrets are exposed.Where Spielman lost me is in her subplot over the inappropriate touching of Farr when she was 13 years old by her step-father.  I think that the author botches who was the victim here.  When Farr finally has a chance to learn the truth, she backs away.  A fishing tackle box might hold the clues to what happened years ago.  Instead, I slam the lid shut.  No one needs to know the truth.  Not RJ.  Not my mother.  Not my old fans or former employers.  Not even me.  I will learn to live with ambiguity.  Really???  This book teaches the wrong lessons about sexual abuse.  I just wish that Spielman had dealt with this issue more appropriately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAGLAULPXWYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147516765#wasThisHelpful","R3IAGLAULPXWYQ","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been on a Louise Penny Inspector Gamache-kick lately, I decided to read her novella, The Hangman.  The Hangman was written for Good Reads as an easy-reader for beginning adult readers or English as a second language readers.  While The Hangman was very good, it was much too short and a bit of a tease.Outside Three Pines, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his assistant, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, are called to the scene of what appears to be a suicide.  A man was found hanging from a tree near the local Inn and Spa.  From the very beginning, red flags are raised over the lies and inconsistencies that the two inspectors discover.  Soon, those at the Inn and Spa are assembled (ala Agatha Christie) so that Gamache can reveal the killer(s).  Gamache tells the assembled group Like most murders, this one was about secrets and lies.  But hidden below all those lies was an emotion.  Sorrow.  A sorrow so great it turned into a monster.  And that monster finally consumed the man.  But what was the secret that led to murder?  Leave it to Gamache and Beauvoir to solve what appears to be an impossible crime.It is very commendable that Louise Penny would lend her talents to such an effort and even though The Hangman was short, I enjoyed the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19FDI05694XU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1926583248#wasThisHelpful","R19FDI05694XU0","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess I would have to say that 2015 for me is the year of Louise Penny.  I just cant get enough of her Inspector Gamache mystery series.  I keep telling myself that Im going to slow down, but I just cant help myself.  The Beautiful Mystery is number nine in her series and is a beautifully written story with an intricate plot.  I was also happy that in The Beautiful Mystery, Penny gets away from her usual locale of Three Pines.Inspector Armand Gamache is head of homicide for the Surete du Quebec.  He and his second in command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, are called to Saint-Gilbert-Entres-les-Loupes (Saint Gilbert among the wolves).  This monastery of Gilbertine monks was hidden to the outside world until a recording of their Gregorian Chants was produced and sent out into the world.  But the 24 monks live in almost total silence except for their singing in a compound that is closed to outsiders.  That is, until their choir director is found murdered.  Now it is the job of Gamache and Beauvoir to investigate the killing and discover which of the remaining 23 monks is the killer.  There is much of beauty in the monastery and the two agents are drawn into a world of simplicity, worship, hard work, good but simple food, and beautiful music.  But the two also start to see something very ugly, and that is a breach between the prior and the murdered choir director that has divided the monks.  And somehow, that breach has led to the murder.  The monastery doctor tells Gamache that often times there are little deaths before a murder.  People die in bits and pieces.  A series of petites morts. Little deaths.  They lose their sight, their hearing, their independence.  Those are the physical ones.  But therere others.  Less obvious, but more fatal.  They lose heart. They lose hope. They lose faith.  They lose interest. And finally, they lose themselves.  And if there isnt enough evil in the monastery with a murder, the malicious, corrupt and manipulative Superintendent Sylvain Francoceur of the Surete shows up at the monastery with a hidden agenda.  This book will end of a very dark note.I thoroughly enjoyed The Beautiful Mystery and after finishing this novel, I immediately had to begin the next, How the Light Gets In. As a church musician, I am fascinated with the history of church music, and Louise Penny gives the reader a pretty good tutorial on Gregorian Chant.  While this might seem a bit much for a novice, I was thrilled to read a novel where music played such an important part.  I plan on giving copies to my choir friends this Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1DMWG807EX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250031125#wasThisHelpful","RQ1DMWG807EX3","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leave it to Liane Moriarty to start a novel with a major birthday brawl in a local restaurant that will keep people talking for years.  The novel is Three Wishes and its Moriartys first effort and as with all her later books, it combines humor and sadness in a creative way.Cat, Lyn and Gemma Kettle are triplets celebrating their 34th birthday when their night of fun turns into a nightmare.  The triplets are beautiful and attract attention where ever they go.  But they also each have their own demons.  Each sister is totally different and they are dealing with a host of issues including a cheating spouse, infertility, a miscarriage, panic attacks, abuse, failure to commit and the death of a fianc. They also suffer scars from their divorced parents, who seem to be showing an interest in each other once again.  For as much as the sisters love each other, they also have major altercations.  It was like every fight theyd ever had over the past thirty years was all part of the one endless argument.  At any moment, without notice, it could be started again, hurtling them straight into the middle of irrational, out-of-control, name-calling fury.  They never said sorry.  They just threw down their still-loaded weapons, ready for next time.  The story alternates between the triplets, so we get a personal glimpse of each sister.  And this is where Moriarty really shines.  Her writing combines so many different emotions and her observations can be so very moving.  Gemma lost her fiance in an accident years ago.  It felt as if Gemma had moved up to a higher, more complex level of human emotions that Lyn couldnt even hope to understand.  She didnt know the rules.  She didnt know the right thing to say to make it better.  It was like Gemma possessed a secret, terrible knowledge that Lyn could only clumsily guess at.  I am sure that many readers will identify with this on some level.The only negative about Three Wishes is that after finishing this book, Ive read all the adult novels that Moriarty has written.  I certainly hope shell be publishing another one very soon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q93LSSSS9K10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060586133#wasThisHelpful","R2Q93LSSSS9K10","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love May Fail by Matthew Quick is one of those novels that appealed to me on so many different levels.  It appealed to me as a retired educator.  It was fun to read in that it took place close to my home and I knew all the landmarks.  I enjoyed that the story was clever and moving and very engaging.  And I have enjoyed every novel that Ive read by Matthew Quick.  I believe that Love May Fail is one of the best novels that Ive read this summer.Love May Fail is told through four characters.  The two main characters are Portia Kane and Nate Vernon.  The novel opens when Kanes marriage is imploding.  Her husband is a handsome but sleazy millionaire who produces pornographic movies.  She flees Florida to return to her childhood home in Westmont, NJ.  Once home, Kane learns that her very favorite teacher, Nate Vernon (think Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society) has had a very unfortunate bit of bad luck and is no longer teaching.  She hasnt even seen or talked to Vernon since she graduated high school, over 20 years ago.  But not even knowing where he is now living, she decides that it is her job to save him.  The other two characters are Vernons mother-turned nun, Sister Maeve Smith and Chuck Bass, the older brother of one of Kanes classmates.  But what happens when a person doesnt want to be saved?  And maybe in trying to save someone else, you also have a chance to safe yourself.  Quick examines these themes in great detail in Love May Fail.Serendipity plays a big part in many of Quicks novels, and Love May Fail is no exception.  Maybe its God, or coincidence, or fate, or luck, but more than a few times, these four characters are brought together by serendipity.  As always, Quicks writing is insightful, eloquent and extremely moving.  Portias mother has mental issues. You can get lost in Moms madness.  Its like a maze of tall bushes, all thorns and no roses.  And she insists I navigate while blindfolded.  Later on, Vernon tries to convince Kane that she never really knew him.  You do not know me.  Trust me on this.  Students never really know their teachers.  Its all a bit of a show, and you are familiar with the show I used to put on twenty-some years ago, for a paycheck, health insurance, and a meager pension.  I no longer play that roleThrew out the required mask many years ago.I have had the pleasure to hear Matthew Quick at the Free Library of Philadelphia on the release of his last two novels, and Quick is as talented a speaker and a storyteller as he is a writer.  I would have loved to have Quick as an English teacher back in high school and I suspect that there is a lot of Quick in both Nate Vernon and Chuck Bass.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P9J0GW3DLX6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062285564#wasThisHelpful","R2P9J0GW3DLX6L","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After watching several television movies based on Robert B. Parker's Jesse Stone series, I decided to read some of Parker's novels.  When I picked up Killing the Blues, I didn't realize that this novel was actually written after Parker's death by Michael Brandman.  Brandman assisted in co-writing and producing some of the movies, and was hand-picked to continue the series by Parker's estate.  Although I thought that Brandman's dialogue sounded very similar, I felt that his Jesse Stone was more violent and operated more outside the law.The summer season is about to begin in the resort town of Paradise, Massachusetts and a crime wave begins.  Someone is stealing Honda Civics, although a heist gone bad ends in murder.  At the local school, 14 year old Lisa Barry takes the principal hostage with a gun because of a bunch of nasty girls who won't stop bullying her.  And just when things can't get any worse, Rollo Nurse, a psychopath who Stone put away while working in California is now out of jail and coming east to seek revenge.  Stone's love life always is a sub-plot and in Killing the Blues, his love interest is Alexis Richard.  Richard was hired as a public relations specialist and event planner for Paradise.  But things are made a little more complicated because her uncle is selectman Carter Hansen (not a fan of Jesse Stone).  As the story developed, I thought that no police chief could do what Stone did and get away with his actions.  Then again, I guess that's why they call this genre fiction.This fast-paced book was a quick, entertaining and suspenseful read.  Some die-hard fans might be disappointed in Brandman's efforts, but I think that maybe Jesse Stone still has a future, after all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAM2G0UTTW4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425250458#wasThisHelpful","R2XAM2G0UTTW4N","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Split Image is the third Jesse Stone book that I've read in a row, and this book by Robert B. Parker is pretty lame.  I understand that this is the last Jesse Stone book that Robert Parker wrote before he died, and maybe he just wasn't playing with his A-game anymore.  But for whatever reason, Split Image was a big disappointment.Jesse Stone is the chief of police in the fictional town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  As in most Stone books, there are numerous plots and subplots.  The major plot focuses on the murders of two men. One of them was a local gangster who lived right next door to another career criminal.  They were both married to beautiful, identical twins.  This part of the novel was totally bizarre and unbelievable.  It was also hard to keep all the characters straight.  A subplot involved a local religious cult, Bond of the Renewal, that may or may not be keeping people against their will.  And then there is also the issue of Stone's love life.  At least his obnoxious ex-wife, Jenn, seems to be totally out of the picture.  But now he's going back and forth with Sunny Randall.I guess with an author as prolific as Robert Parker, you're bound to write a clunker every now and then.  This one certainly was in my estimation.  If it wasn't for some sharp repartee from time to time, I would have given it 1 star.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDQWJ77QX4MLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042523973X#wasThisHelpful","RDQWJ77QX4MLB","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Growing up in the Philadelphia area, I visited the Mutter Museum a number of times.  But as much as I knew about the museum, I actually knew very little about Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter, whose collection of medical curiosities was the core of the museum.  Wanting to learn more about Mutter, I selected Dr. Mutter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine written by Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz.  While very interesting and informative, the book is more about Mutter and less about his museum, which is perfectly fine since this former rock-star of 19th century medicine is now largely forgotten.Thomas Mutter was born in Virginia and orphaned at an early age.  Deciding he wanted to study medicine, he traveled to Philadelphia and earned a degree from the University of Pennsylvania.  After graduation, he spent a year in Paris, learning the latest surgical techniques of the time, including plastic surgery.  He then returned to Philadelphia where he built up a private practice, before being hired on as professor of surgery at the new Jefferson Medical College.  It was at Jefferson that he truly made a name for himself.  He not only performed surgeries that were never heard of at the time, but treated his patients with compassion.  One procedure, the Mutter Flap, is still done today.  He was the first physician to use ether as an anesthetic in Philadelphia at a time when many doctors were thoroughly against the practice.  He believed that surgeons should keep clean, both their persons and their instruments, before germ theory was even understood.  He lobbied for the opening of a hospital at Jefferson to care for their surgical patients.  After surgery, patients were simply sent home.  It took some years before Jefferson finally did open a hospital.  And he was a riveting lecturer who was beloved by his students. Instead of straight lectures, he engaged them and challenged them to come up with the answers.  Throughout his life, he was a dapper guy who dressed in suits of bright colored silk and entertained lavishlysomething not always appreciated in Quaker Philadelphia.  Unfortunately, Mutter spent much of his life in ill-health and his fellow colleagues were not able to save his life.  He retired early and died in 1859 at age 48.Perhaps Mutter's largest legacy is the museum that today bears his name.  Mutter's reputation as riveting lecturer also partly owed to his habit of bringing specimens to class, those he kept safely store at the school's anatomical museum a well as those from his personal collection.  And to his students, the volume of diagrams, models, and specimens collected from around the world seemed nearly limitless.  There didn't seem to be an injury, disease, malady, or treatment for which Mutter couldn't seem to produce a relevant sample, and he would weave these specimens into his lectures masterfully...  It is these specimens that made up the nucleus of the Mutter Museum.  Knowing that his health was failing, he wanted to donate them to Jefferson Medical College.  The gift would come with a  $30,000 bequest and several strings attached.  Finally, the College of Physicians (not an actual college) accepted Mutter's collection and met his requirements.It was especially interesting to read about the evolution of medical practices during this period, and it was gratifying to learn of the important role that Philadelphia played in the education of medical students.  After reading Dr. Mutter's Marvels, I think I'm due to revisit his museum which can be found at 19 South 22nd Street in Philadelphia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2398O3LY2DKW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592408702#wasThisHelpful","R2398O3LY2DKW2","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw Driving the King by Ravi Howard on several lists of the best books of 2015, so I ordered it when I saw it offered through Amazon Vine.  I generally shy away from historical fiction, and although this novel is beautifully written, I kept getting stuck on the fact that a lot of what was written here wasn't true.Nathaniel Weary and Nathaniel Cole (Nat King Cole) both were born in Montgomery, Alabama.  They were in the same class in school until the Cole family moved to Chicago when Cole was still small.  Without giving the plot away, after a grave injustice was done to Weary, Cole hires his childhood friend to move to Los Angelos and become his driver.  After serving as a soldier in World War II, this may seem a bit of a come-down, but Weary is hoping that in LA, he won't find the kind of racial hatred that exists in his home town.  During this time period, the Montgomery Bus Boycott is getting under way and members of his family are directly involved.  Dr. Martin Luther King is a pastor in a Montgomery church, and he, his family, and his church are threatened.  It truly is an ugly period in our history.  Yet, Weary discovers that this type of racism is not limited to the south, and that there are many who would love to see the talents of Nat King Cole silenced.  It is Weary's observations about this time that are Howard's strength. It was just tiresome thinking about folks having to fight for the least little thing.  I loved my people for fighting, but hated the reason why, and that left me with that crosscut notion of pride and anger pulling in different directions, two kinds of muscle fighting for the same piece of bone.But while I enjoyed this story, I found out early on that Nathaniel Weary was a totally fictional character, and thus, I felt that Driving the King rang false.  Also, a major subplot in Driving the King was about Nat King Cole's return to Montgomery for another concert, years after his first concert in his hometown was disrupted by violence and he was injured.  Unfortunately, I read that after the incident at the first Montgomery concert, Cole never gave another concert in the souththus another untruth.  But perhaps blame my own prejudice of historic fiction for my taking exception to these embellishments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5Z3NZNCTLXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006052961X#wasThisHelpful","R2D5Z3NZNCTLXT","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have discovered that two of the finest books written about Franklin Delano Roosevelt were written by Geoffrey C. Ward.  The first, Before the Trumpet, covers FDR's life from his birth to his marriage to Eleanor Roosevelt in 1905.  The second book, A First Class Temperament: The Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt, 1905-1928 is just as meticulously researched and wonderfully written as Before the Trumpet.  A First Class Temperament ends when when FDR is first elected governor of New York, and it is fascinating to read so much about the time before FDR became president.If Before the Trumpet details those influences that made FDR the man he became, A First Class Temperament covers those factors in his life that made him one of our most influential leaders.  The key events in A First Class Temperament include his early forays into politics, his desire to follow in the footsteps of his distant cousin Teddy Roosevelt, and his battles with Tammany Hall.  Quite a bit of time is dedicated to his stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the Woodrow Wilson administration.  During this time, Eleanor Roosevelt discovered the infidelity of her husband with her social secretary, Lucy Mercer.  This event caused a change in the dynamics of their marriage and allowed Eleanor more freedom to take on the causes that were important to her.  During the years covered, FDR will meet many individuals who will play an important part in his administration including Louis Howe, Frances Perkins and Marguerite LeHand.  And then there is his contracting polio and his unsuccessful fight of many years to fully recover.  This not only made Roosevelt a different man, but again, it helped push Eleanor to become more independent and more politically active.One aspect of Roosevelt's life that I found particularly interesting was his time spent as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.  I always thought that Roosevelt looked down his patrician nose at Naval Secretary, Josephus Daniels. FDR thought that the North Carolina newspaper editor was a bit of a country bumpkin.  Yet Ward shows us that although Daniels had no naval experiences, he was shrewd when it came to the DC political game and he had much to teach his young charge.  Years of political experience had taught the older man the ways and means with which to deal effectively with Congress; he spent much of his time as Secretary on the Hill, doing the sort of amiable, indispensable lobbying on the Navy's behalf that the impatient, impulsive younger man would then have found impossible.  Daniels gave us young assistant many lessons in dealing with Congress, admirals, and big business.  It was also compelling to read about his struggle against polio.  This often debilitating disease turned him from a spoiled, self-absorbed youth cut short by an illness whose searing impact somehow transformed its victim into a thoughtful and compassionate leader.  This change gave him the empathy to deal with those less fortunate and was a important lesson leading up to the Great Depression.I was privileged to see Geoffrey C. Ward not too long ago for an author talk with Ken Burns, promoting their mini-series, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History.  Ward spoke of the steady stream of questions that people ask him about when he is going to finish his biographical work on FDR.  His answer was that the mini-series and companion book are the ending.  For our sake, I hope not!  I don't think that anybody has done FDR better than Geoffrey C. Ward.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9LWJWVRJ88G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804173354#wasThisHelpful","RA9LWJWVRJ88G","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always game for a new book about the Roosevelts.  When I told my husband that I had ordered Hissing Cousins: The Untold Story about Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth by Marc Peyser and Timothy Dwyer through Amazon Vine, he rolled his eyes and said I wasn't going to read anything new.  I am happy to report that the authors proved him wrong.  Yet, I wouldn't call it the untold story.  It is no secret that these first cousins were at odds for much of their adult life.  Over the years, the press played Alice and Eleanor off each other like rivals in a blue-blooded version of Oz: the good witch [Eleanor] and the bad witch [Alice].Alice and Eleanor were born in the same year to fathers who were brothers.  Alice's mother died two days after giving birth to Alice, and father Theodore Roosevelt handed off baby Alice to one of his sisters to raise while he headed out West.  He would not reclaim Alice until he remarried, almost 3 years later.  Eleanor's father Elliott was a lovable but out-of-control alcoholic.  Her mother was beautiful but remote.  When both of Eleanor's parents died before she turned 10, she was sent to her stern maternal-grandmother to be raised.  The two girls were different in many ways.  Alice was beautiful, bold, and reckless.  When Theodore becamse president, she became Princess Alicethe first media celebrity of the 20th Century.  Eleanor was not very attractive, uneasy in society, and afraid to break the rules.  She had a great interest in helping those less fortunate.  Both girls were largely educated at home, until Eleanor was sent away to an English boarding school where she would gain confidence and poise.  Alice and Eleanor were both from the Oyster Bay-branch of the Roosevelt family.  When Eleanor married Franklin Roosevelt (from the Hyde Park-branch), she became the bridge between the two.  But it was also the catalyst that started the bitter rivalry between the two branches, each one believing that they had a claim to continue Theodore Roosevelt's legacy.Throughout their years, Eleanor and Alice did many of the same things, although Alice tended to work from behind the scenes.  Eleanor tried not to let politics get in the way of their relationship, but it was often difficult when Alice treated both Franklin and Eleanor with such venim.  Several times she was even banned from the White House because of her behavior.  But despite their differences, these women were more alike that even they would admit.  They both lost parents and siblings at a young age. They both married powerful men who were mamas' boys and unfaithful to them.  They were much better grandmothers than they were mothers.  They also share part of at least one important legacy: they short-circuited the twentieth century's rules of gender and power.  Their roles as power players are all the more impressive given that they didn't even have the right to vote until they were thirty-six.I thoroughly enjoyed Hissing Cousins, and savored some of the new anecdotes and stories that were included.  It starts off strong with the funeral of Eleanor Roosevelt, much of which was new information to me.  But lots of the middle sections are common knowledge.  Otherwise, I would have given it five stars instead of four.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MU5D0S3UY8H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385536011#wasThisHelpful","R3MU5D0S3UY8H7","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been fascinated by the Abraham Lincoln assassination and John Wilkes Booth.  I selected Fortunes Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth by Terry Alford through Amazon Vine.  While Alford calls this book the first biography on Booth in quite some time, I believe that other books that Ive read provide a more comprehensive background on the actor-turned-assassin.Fortunes Fool can be divided into two halves.  The details of the life of John Wilkes Booth are fairly well known, and the first half provides information on his childhood and into his acting career.  Booth was born the son of famous Shakespearian actor Junius Brutus Booth.  The family moved between Baltimore and rural Maryland.  Booth fell naturally into the family business of acting, following in the steps of his father and his two older brothers, Junius, Jr. and Edwin.  Much of this first half deals with his acting career, and I felt this section contained too much minutia.  Alford is to be commended on the extent of his research, but as a reader, I got tired of reading about all his acting gigs, the theaters, the towns, the plays, the costumes, his fellow actors, and the reviews.  Also, in the first half, Alford portrays Booth as St. John.  He was a gentleman, kind-hearted, beautiful, loyal, a good son and brother, charismatic, generous, and a genius on the stage.  He could do no wrong.  Even when someone wrote that Booth was a bully in school, Alford dismisses the charges as unbelievable.The second half of Fortunes Fool deals with Booths conversion to the dark-side during the Civil War which led to his assassinating Lincoln.  While his family remained loyal to the Union, Booth had strong feelings for the Confederacy.  Eventually, he stopped acting and started developing a plot to kidnap President Lincoln and force a prisoner exchange.  During this period, even his closest friends felt that Booth exhibited symptoms of madness.  Although the story definitely picks up, there isnt much new in terms of information.  I did find the information in the Epilogue interesting about what happened to his body after his death.Alford seems an apologist for John Wilkes Booth and loves to quote from Booths friends who still held the actor in high esteem even decades after the assassination.  Fellow actress Kathryn Evans couldnt forgive the assassination, but still claimed I cannot refrain from telling those who never saw him that he was the finest gentleman I ever met.  Also, Alford claims that perhaps its time that we forgive and embrace John Wilkes Booth.  Maybe history will forgive Booth, but I dont think we can be expected to ever embrace the man.While I enjoyed Fortunes Fool, I think that two better books on the subject of John Wilkes Booth are American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies by Michael W. Kauffman and My Thoughts Be Bloody: The Bitter Rivalry that Led to the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln by Nora Titone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AX4HTFVV00SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195054121#wasThisHelpful","R2AX4HTFVV00SL","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive become a fan of John Sanford and his Lucas Davenport series, and even Sanford admits that Winter Prey, his 5th in the series, is one of his favorites.  Winter Prey is not just a riveting thriller, but it also introduces the reader to Dr. Weather Karkinnen, who will become a regular in Sanfords novels and Davenports life.Lucas Davenport is a former Minneapolis cop.  Needing a break, he decides to leave the city and spend some time in his isolated Wisconsin cabin.  While in the area, a totally evil person, the Iceman, brutally murders the LaCourt family and then burns down their home.  The relentlessly cold winter has paralyzed the region and makes investigating the case so much harder.  Being entirely out of their league, the county sheriff deputizes Davenport and asks for his assistance.  The murders are tied to a child sex-ring, and as Davenport gets closer to the truth, more and more people disappear and/or murdered.  Not only must Davenport faceoff against the Iceman, but the entire law-enforcement community must battle the weather.  This makes things even trickier as the Iceman can zip around unnoticed on his snow mobile.  Davenport also realizes that the Iceman is targeting the local medical examiner, Dr. Weather Karkinnen--a woman who is starting to melt the former-cops heart.Winter Prey follows the same formula as the other Prey books that Ive read. The point of view alternates between Davenport and the Iceman.  In some books, you know the villain right away.  In Winter Prey, the identity of the Iceman was not revealed until the end, and came as a complete surprise.Im happy to have finally started reading John Sanford.  I wouldnt want to read all of his books in a row, but they are well-written and suspenseful and a nice treat from time to time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG09B3PC0TW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425231062#wasThisHelpful","R2CG09B3PC0TW2","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly enjoyed the first two Liane Moriarty novels that I read, What Alice Forgot and The Husbands Secret.  I dont think that The Last Anniversary, one of her earlier books, quite measures up to her later efforts.  While I liked the ending, I thought that the journey was often tedious and the entire plot was a stretch.Like the previous two novels that Ive read, The Last Anniversary rotates viewpoints between several characters.  And the anniversary in the title is not a wedding anniversary, but the anniversary of an unsolved mystery that took place on Scribbly Gum Island.  On July 15, 1932, teenaged sisters Connie and Rose Doughty stopped by their neighbors cottage for tea.  Instead, they discovered the kettle about to boil, a freshly baked marble cake waiting to be iced, and a tiny baby waking for her feed.  Somehow, the sisters raised the baby, named Enigma, and it is now present day.  Enigma has her own extended family with children and grandchildren, and they all have made a big business and earned lots of money over the Munro mystery.  When Connie passes away, her death sets the family (along with a friend, Sophie Honeywell) on a collision course with the truth.The entire Munro mystery is unbelievable and early on, its obvious that its not really a mystery at all.  Also, some of the characters were not that likeable.  Im sorry, but the subplot with Grace was pretty horrible, and Veronika was insufferable.  But Moriarty does have some gems of wisdom in The Last Anniversary. Connie tells a reporter that marriage is housework.  Its never finished.  Youve just got to grit your teeth and keep working away at it, day after day.  Connie also observes that marriages go through patchesgood ones, bad ones, so-so ones.  For example, there was that really enjoyable time in the early Eighties when they discovered apricot massage oil from Avon.  Goodness me.  That had certainly spiced things up in the bedroom (and once in the bathroom and quite a few times in the living room!).I think that Liane Moriarty is a talented writer, and in reading The Last Anniversary, I can see how much shes developed as a writer over the years.  I will certainly not give up reading her novels.  Next on my list is her best-seller, Big Little Lies.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ISUQ5DAVPUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060890681#wasThisHelpful","R14ISUQ5DAVPUI","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started reading David Baldacci, I would purchase a hard back as soon as one was published.  And I started reading him from his very first book, Absolute Power.  After awhile, I would wait until them came out in paperback.  Im at the point now that I get new Baldacci books from my county library-- theyre just not worth the money.  His latest novel, The Escape, is the third in his John Puller-series.  The good news is that at least John Puller is developing a personality and is less a Jack Reacher clone.  The bad news is that there are just too many issues with The Escape to make it one of Baldaccis better novels.John Puller is an investigator with the US Army Criminal Investigative Division.  His brilliant older brother, Robert Puller, was a major in the USAF and a fast-rising star in the intelligence community.  That was until he was convicted of treason.  Serving a life-term in a military jail at Fort Leavenworth, he escapes when a storm wreaks havoc on the facility.  John Puller is brought in by three very important people who have a mission for him: find his brother.  Early on, Puller runs across some very bad men who want nothing better than to shut down the investigation by killing him.  He realizes that he not only needs to find Robert, but he also needs to discover whether or not the treason charge was a frame.  He is also assigned as a partner, Veronica Knoxa captain with the United States Armys Intelligence and Security Command.  Throughout the book, Puller doesnt know if he can trust Knox, or not.  He also doesnt know what her motives are.  Their investigation will leave many dead bodies in their wake, as well as evidence that top officials in the government are working for the enemy.  But identifying them is no easy task and finding proof is even more difficult.But as I said previously, there are just too many issues for me in The Escape. The plot is fleshed out and the book comes in at almost 500 pages.  But the plot itself is pretty far-fetched.  You have to suspend all logic in order to believe most of the story. From the opening pages, I knew how this novel was going to end.  Also, the many intelligence groups, military and otherwise, are totally confusing.  There are almost as many acronym-groups (NSA, NSC, DOD, STRATCOM, SES, DTRA, ISR, etc.) as FDR had Alphabet Agencies.  Puller has become less like Jack Reacher in that he now shows emotions, cries, has a cat, and drinks tea instead of coffee.  And I didnt like Veronica Knox at the beginning, or the end of this book.  To me, it felt like Baldacci was just writing his quota of words without really crafting this novel.  Sad in that he used to be one of my favorites.I will continue to read David Baldacci, but I have stopped spending any money on his novels.  Maybe he will figure this out, but most likely, not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1KS8K4OSGSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455521191#wasThisHelpful","R3T1KS8K4OSGSH","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have read quite a few novels by Anne Rivers Siddons and I always find them well-written and very enjoyableuntil I read her latest book, The Girls of August.  I am not one who generally low-balls my ratings, but the only reason that I gave this book two stars is because I like the locale.  Otherwise, it was horrible and I cant imagine why her editor let something so shabby be published.Madison, Rachel, Barbara, and Melinda met while their husbands were in medical school.  Ever since, theyve always spent a girls-only week at the beach in August.  Their only requirements are that the house be isolated and that they always stay somewhere new.  When Melinda dies in a car crash, they take some years off.  But when Melindas husband marries Baby, a 22-year old bimbo, they decide to try and resurrect their yearly vacation.  It just so happens that Baby has a beach house on Tiger Island, a very secluded spot where they will need a boat to reach the island, and then be stranded there for two weeks.  Each woman comes to the island with baggage and after time together and enough alcohol, the secrets seep out. But overall, this book is pretty horrible.  The characters are totally obnoxious with Baby being the worst.  The ending of the book was so weak and very rushed, and The Girls of August was much shorter than any other Anne Rivers Siddons book Ive ever read.  Also, there seemed to be a problem with the final two chapters.  A part of chapter 7 seemed like it should have been in chapter 8, or maybe these two chapters should have been flip-flopped.  Perhaps it was a problem with the Kindle edition. I am very surprised that Anne Rivers Siddons published something so shoddy.  The only good thing for me was that I borrowed it from the library.  I would have been seriously upset if I had paid good money for The Girls of August.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIY79E4LVZ4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2C6EWO#wasThisHelpful","R1GIY79E4LVZ4W","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always wanted to travel to Venice, and reading The Golden Egg by Donna Leon is a bonusnot only does her Commissario Brunetti-series take place in Venice, but this is a mystery series that shows how different law enforcement is in the City of Lights.  I truly enjoyed The Golden Egg, but as this is book number 22 in the series, I think it would have been better to start with book number one.Commissario Guido Brunetti lives in Venice with his wife and two children.  His wife mentions that the handicapped boy who worked for their dry cleaners died, and she asks her husband for more information.  Davide Cavanella was actually near 40 years old and the cause of death was suicide by drug overdose.  But it seems strange that when Brunetti starts asking around, he finds no records associated with Cavanella including no birth certificate, baptismal certificate, and school or medical records.  Its like he never existed.  When he interviews this mother, he gets evasive stories and downright lies.  This makes Brunetti even more curious, which is difficult because a crime hasnt been committedor has it?Donna Leons books take us to a world where native Venetians arent accepting of outsiders, including fellow Italians.  Some still speak Venetian, rather than Italian.  Its an environment where police get around by boats instead of cars.  And I enjoyed reading about Venetian culturethe history, the food, the buildings, the customs, etc.  The Golden Egg starts out slow and deliberate and even by the end, were not sure if a crime has been committed.  But we do know that something horrible happened to Davide Cavanella.  In addition to recommending that a new reader start this series at the beginning, I also suggest that Leon provide a glossary for Venetian and/or Italian words that liberally sprinkle her novels.  She does place them in italics, and while I could figure out some, others I couldnt.Im so glad a friend introduced me to Donna Leon and Commissario Brunelli, and I look forward to picking up this series at the beginning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WVMCEY6IUFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3M46W2#wasThisHelpful","R38WVMCEY6IUFI","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Needing a new series on audiobook for long car trips, my husband and I settled on Craig Johnsons Longmire series.  Being big fans of the television series based on these books, it seemed like a good choice.  We decided to start with book one, The Cold Dish, which is narrated by George Guidall.  While The Cold Dish was suspenseful and entertaining, there are some differences between the books and the television shows and it is really unfair to compare the two.Walter Longmire is the sheriff of fictional Absaroka County in Wyoming.  Bordering on Indian territory, Longmire sometimes finds himself caught between two worlds.  His best friend, Henry Standing Bear, is his bridge between two cultures.  Several years prior, four white teenage boys sexually assaulted a special needs Indian girl.  The four got off with outrageously light sentences.  When one of the boys is found dead of a gunshot wound, there is speculation that it could have been a hunting accident. But soon, Walt knows for sure that the boys are being targeted by someone seeking revenge for their prior sins.  The murder weapon is a Sharps riflea historic gun and not too common in these parts.  It also takes special talent to fire a Sharps great distances, which narrows Longmires list of suspects. How The Cold Dish plays out it exciting and suspenseful.  It definitely had us on the edge of our seats and we didnt see the ending coming, at all.On the whole, I found that The Cold Dish had many more comical moments than the television series.  The book provides interesting background on Walter and Henry including their high school and college years and their time in Vietnam, where Walter served as a Marine and Henry was Special Forces.  But if youre looking for the characters to be an exact match between books and television shows, you might be disappointed.  The book characters dont always look like their television counterparts (Walter and Henry are both much bigger guys, Vic is a dark-haired, olive-skinned Italian, Ferg is much older, etc.).  Sometimes their personalities are different.  Turk (Branch in the show) has a lot less redeeming qualities in the book.  But overall, my husband and I are hooked on Longmirethe book and the show.  And I guess its a good thing that we discovered the books because it doesnt look like the show will be back for season 4.  We are already looking forward to listening to books two and three on our next car trip.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I66229CHM8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MGB2B8#wasThisHelpful","R3I66229CHM8Z4","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Husbands Secret by Liane Moriarty was highly recommended by a number of friends, and I can see why.  This haunting and beautifully written story would be the perfect book club selection as it provides quite a few different angles for discussion.Moriarty weaves together the stories of three Australian women.  Rachel, a widow, is still mourning the murder of her only daughter, Janie, when she was 17 years old.  The crime is still unsolved, although Rachel believes she knows the identity of the killer.  Coming up on the 28th anniversary of Janies death, the pain has not dulled and we contemplate what Rachel might do, if anything, to avenge her daughters death.  Tess is happily married with a six year old son.  But when she discovers her husbands betrayal, she takes her son and moves to her mothers to lick her wounds and regroup.  Cecilia has the perfect husband, the perfect daughters, the perfect house, and a perfect life.  But then she learns her husbands terrible secret and her life will never be the same.  The lives of Rachel, Tess and Cecilia will all intersect at some point.The Husbands secret is about marriage and families.  Its about hurts and forgiveness.  Its about the dangers of secrets.  Its about what we will do to protect our families.  And sometimes those things we do to protect them can actually cause unforeseen damage.  Moriarty is an accomplished writer and sometimes she made me chuckle, sometimes she made me sad, but always she made me think.  This is a novel that will haunt you long after youve finished.  Comparing one couple: Hed wronged her.  Shed wronged him right back.  Had they both been suffering a form of temporary insanity?  It was a defense for murder, after all; why not for married couples?  Marriage was a form of insanity; love hovering permanently on the edge of aggravation.  How true  I also liked the Epilogue, although would have liked to learn more of what happens to Cecilia and her family.After thoroughly enjoying The Husbands Secret, I have What Alice Forgot, also by Moriarty, on deck.  In fact, I predict that Liane Moriarty might just become one of my new favorite fiction authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDQ4I9RWXQ9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7Z4GQY#wasThisHelpful","R1JDQ4I9RWXQ9J","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Lions Roar: The Churchills and the Kennedys by Thomas Maier is not just about Winston Churchill and Joesph P. Kennedy, Sr., but also includes their extended families as well.  I always enjoy reading about Churchill, and so selected this book from Amazon Vine.  Reading more like a novel, this book far exceeded my expectations.The story of Joseph Kennedy's years as American Ambassador to Great Britain is pretty well known.  Because of his generous support of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Democratic Party in the election of 1932, the ambassadorship was the second big job with which Joe was awarded.  A strong isolationist who wished to offer little or no support to Britain, Kennedy proved to be an embarrassment to the Roosevelt White House and he was eventually removed.  Churchill and Kennedy had a fascinating and complicated relationship that exposes the politically astuteness of Churchill.  But When Lions Roar is not just a story about these two powerful men.  It is also a story about their children and how difficult it is for the sons of strong men to make their own way.  For the first half of this book, this also includes FDR and his bunch of dysfunctional children.  This is a story of intrigue and affairs and spies.  Winston condoned an affair between his young daughter-in-law, Pamela, with American Averell Harriman.  His son Randolph never quite forgave his father and suspected the real reason Winston accepted Pamela's cheating on Randolph was because she was passing along Harriman's secrets.  Sometimes they shared the same women.  Claire Booth Luce had affairs with Randolph, Joe Sr., and Bernard Baruch (another major player in this book).  They definitely shared many of the same people in their orbits.I enjoyed When Lions Roar because of the many little-known facts that came to light.  Maybe others know them already.  I didn't realize the delicate relationship between the White House and the Vatican during World War II.  Although Rose Kennedy isn't necessarily the power behind the throne, she was definitely on board with her husband's plans for a political dynasty for his family and was one of the few who could criticize Joe for his boorish behavior.  We learn that Joe, Jr. signed up for that extra month of service in England (which ultimately lead to the mission that caused his death) because he was seeing a married woman.  We also learn that maybe Jack was the best of the sons to be president, and not Joe Jr.  Although When Lions Roar was a bit long, I didn't want it to end.  But I do have two complaints:  first, Maier has a tendency to jump around between time periods.  You might reach 1941, and then you're back to 1940.  Also, I don't always appreciate some of his observations.  Maier says that Randolph was Still ruggedly handsome in a boozy way.  I'm not really sure what he means by that.Otherwise, When Lions Roar was an engaging read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the Churchill and Kennedy families.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWK28YCBUS9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307956792#wasThisHelpful","R1HWK28YCBUS9H","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"New Orleans is one of my favorite cities, so selecting Empire of Sin: A Story of Sex, Jazz, Murder and the Battle for Modern New Orleans by Gary Krist through Amazon Vine was a natural for me.  The entire history of New Orleans is rich and varied, and Krist gives us a quick lesson on the history of the Crescent City.  But the focus of Empire of Sin is what Krist calls the 30 year civil war that New Orleans waged with itself over the Storyville District.  This is a story that is equally fascinating and depressing.New Orleans has often been called the Sodom of the South.  Up until the late 1800s, gambling, prostitution, street violence, and bawdy entertainment had been a prominent feature of the city's life for its entire history.  But as brothels and gaming houses started moving into residential areas, a move began to make the city more respectable.  Alderman Sidney Story came up with the idea to move all vice to an area that became known as Storyville.  And for 30 years, between 1897 and 1917, business was booming.  But soon, even this small pocket of vice became unacceptable to social reformers, clergymen, and even the US Military.Empire of Sin is a story of culture, sex, music, organized crime, and Jim Crow.  It pits politicians against businessmen, and businessmen against law enforcement.  It features violence, murders, riots, vigilante justice, and lynchings.  It counters Americans against immigrants (mostly Italians), and the Black Hand against the Italian Mafia.  It features social reformers and the US Military trying to regulate morality.  It is the battle by white leaders to suppress the new black music, Jazz.  And it is a war to fully segregate a city that for centuries had a large population of black and white creoles who intermingled and intermarried.  These actions not only contributed to the Great Migration of blacks to the north, but the city razed almost the entire Storyville District (including beautiful Victorian mansions along Basin Street) to create a public housing project.  What happened to Storyville was ultimately depressing, and even today, it is ugly to read this history.Empire of Sin is the second book that I have ready by Gary Krist, the first being City of Scoundrels.  My one complaint with Empire of Sin is that Krist does jump around quite a bit, which I think detracts from the flow of the story.  Also, I'm not sure that the Axman is really part of this story, and the case is still unsolved.  But I did enjoy so much of the history that he presentsespecially the history of Jazz. I'm hoping to travel to New Orleans sometime next year and hope to see some of the places that Krist writes about that are still standing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TPEZOGUNIPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770437060#wasThisHelpful","R16TPEZOGUNIPE","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one of 6 million active geocachers, I was surprised to see a new mystery on the Amazon Vine list that used a geocaching-theme.  Ursula Archer has written other books, but Five: A Novel is her first adult mystery and very good first effort.  I especially liked that it took place in Austria, where geocaching protocol is slightly different than in the United States.Beatrice Kaspary and Florin Wenninger are called to the scene when a farmer discovers a dead woman in his cow pasture.  Kaspary and Wenninger are homicide detectives who work for the Salzburg State Office of Criminal Investigation.  With hands tied behind her back, the one strange find on the body is that numbers were tattooed to the soles of her feet.  It takes a little figuring before the detectives realize that the numbers are GPS coordinates.  One of their colleagues is a geocacher, and he gets assigned to help with the case because of his hobby.  Soon, they're involved in a geocaching chase, but instead of looking for treasures, they're finding body parts and dead bodies.  The entire time, the killer is toying with them and taunting them for being incompetent.  But Kaspary and Wenninger also figure out that in playing the killer's game, they are also lending him assistance.  This psychological thriller had me guessing until the end.Archer is a good writer and I enjoyed her descriptions of things.  At one point, Kaspary had never described to the belief that dead people looked like they were sleeping.  They looked like a foreign species.  Shockingly different, even if they had died peacefully. But I did get more than tired of the drama with her ex-husband and also, the description of every cup of coffee she ever made or drank.  I don't think that these things added to the story.  But overall, Five is a fine read and you don't have to be a geocacher to enjoy this book.  In fact, it might be a good introduction to geocaching, although geocachers tend to be kind, gentle peopleunlike in the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IRHBM0JN7XTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250037417#wasThisHelpful","R2IRHBM0JN7XTP","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another long car trip...another Jack Reacher thriller.  Our departure just happened to occur right after Lee Child published his new novel, Personal.  This is book 19 in his Jack Reacher series and is read by Dick Hill.  My husband and I enjoyed Personal, although it is not without some issues.Former Army MP and current nomad Jack Reacher is traveling by bus near a military base.  He picks up a discarded copy of Stars and Stripes and finds a personal advertisement directing him to call a one-star general with whom he's had previous dealings.  In a flash, he's being flown to Fort Bragg and it turns out that the Army (and the CIA and the State Department) need his services.  A sniper took a shot at the French president, but it's not just any sniper.  This shooter is one of the elite who can hit a target at  mile away and he appears to have military training.  Reacher once put such a sniper in jail, John Kott.  Those trying to prevent a catastrophe at the coming G-8 Conference set for London are betting that Reacher can once again track down Kott.  Of course, the chase will mean that Reacher will be acting on his own.  Plus, he's given a rookie CIA agent, Casey Nice, to baby sit him.  But not only is Reacher after the sniper, but he also has to battle a local gang and the Serbian Mafia.  And there is always the possibility that Reacher is the real target.Entertainingyes.  Hokeyabsolutely.  But Personal suffers from a variety of maladies.  First, the descriptions go way overboard in this novel, and the beginning of this book was especially slow in getting started.  Although it was nice that Reacher avoids any sexual activity in Personal, Casey Nice was more like a daughter.  I was thoroughly tired of the neurotic, untested agent very quickly.  Also, the possibility that the Army (or the CIA or the State Department) recruiting anyone on the outside for an operation is pretty laughable.  We all know that these groups don't play well with others.Still, a Lee Child with some issues is better than a lot of other authors at their best, and Child will continue to be our go-to author when taking long car trips.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q75BSFJRE159/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBQWGXK#wasThisHelpful","R3Q75BSFJRE159","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in high school when Eleanor and Franklin by Joseph P. Lash was published, and it started me on a life-long fascination with the Roosevelt family.  I have quite an extensive collection of Roosevelt books, and I never tire of reading anything new.  I found out last year that Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward were going to debut a 14 hour mini-series on Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor in September 2014 and I have been counting the days ever since.  Well, that time is finally here!  Their companion book, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, was published today to supplement the series, and I am thoroughly enchanted.  Although this coffee table-style book has over 700 photos, it also contains a strong and well-written narrative about the lives of these three remarkable people.The Roosevelts were a noteworthy and prolific family, descended from Claes Martertenszen van Roosevelt who settled in New York in 1644.  Two branches of the family were the Oyster Bay Roosevelts (Teddys family) and the Hyde Park Roosevelts (FDRs family).  Eleanor was the bridge between to two branches, being the niece of Teddy and the wife of FDR.  Although the branches were different in many ways, including political affiliation, they both had a love of the land, a sense of duty to others, family tragedies, and great ambition.  The Roosevelts: An Intimate History covers the large lives of Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor.  Teddy and FDR were natural leaders, and FDR set his career path to emulate that of his older cousin.  Eleanor was a more reluctant leader, taking on a bigger role only after FDR came down with polio.  In reading this book, I was haunted by so much of the Roosevelt history.  Teddys first wife and mother die on the same day, two days after the birth of his daughter.  Eleanors parents and her younger brother die young.  Both branches were plagued by alcoholism.  Franklin, a mamas boy, was unwilling to cut the apron strings and was unfaithful to the emotionally fragile Eleanor.  Teddys youngest son, Quentin, was killed in World War I. The Oyster Bay and the Hyde Park branches had a falling out when FDR went into politics as a Democrat, and they continued to feud long after Teddy was dead.  And although Eleanor and FDR might have been a power-couple in many ways and loved each other more than they would admit, they found the most happiness in other people.The photographs in The Roosevelts are worth the price of the book.  Many of them have never been published before and I thoroughly enjoyed them all.  It is especially haunting to see modern-day pictures of intimate objects owned and worn by the Roosevelts. There is Eleanors engagement ring and her engagement pendant with teeth-marks from her babies.  There is a photo of the lucky campaign hat worn by FDR during all four of his presidential campaigns.  It was raffled off after the third election, but returned to FDR in time for the fourth.  Theres a glass case with a bullet hole that most likely saved Teddys life. And there is a beautiful Cartier watch given to FDRs mother when his father found out she was pregnant with FDR. There are campaign buttons and posters, wedding and baby pictures, maps, magazine and newspaper articles, postcards, political cartoons, formal portraits and candids, pictures of Roosevelts at work and at play, houses and the White House, family pets, etc.  This book is also filled with fun stories and ironic anecdotes.  Someone asked Teddy why he couldnt do anything to control his wayward daughter, Alice.  I can be President of the United States, her exasperated father once told a friend, or I can attend to Alice. I cannot possibly do both! Another story has FDR visiting Grover Cleveland in the White House when he was five.  As they were leaving, the weary president shook Franklins hand and said, My little man, I am making a strange wish for you.  It is that you may never be president of the United States.After the publication of The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, I cant wait to watch the series.  Im sure that I will go to this book again and again throughout the coming weeks, and beyond.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PEG06XTXONTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700232#wasThisHelpful","R2PEG06XTXONTU","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If any book should be made into a blockbuster movie, it's Tinseltown: Murder, Morphine, and Madness at the Dawn of Hollywood by William J. Mann.  Tinseltown has it all--murders, rising and falling stars, movie moguls, Prohibition, extortionists, civic reformers, etc.  Just add hooch and illegal drugs and stir. It makes for an explosive combination.The centerpiece of Tinseltown is the murder of famed director, William Desmond Taylor--still unsolved to this day.  His killing brought out his many secrets including the fact that his name wasn't even William Desmond Taylor.  Two female stars were directly linked to Taylor and they were suspects for a time.  During this same period, Fatty Arbuckle is on trial for the brutal rape and death of Virginia Rappe at a wild party.  Some of Hollywood's biggest stars are addicted to illegal drugs and alcohol (also illegal).  Adolph Zukor and his colleagues run their companies with iron fists.  During the days of silent films, big stars belonged to studios, who not only produced the films but then showed them in their theaters (something the FTC will eventually target).  During this same period, a group of ""church ladies,"" flush from their success in finally pushing through Prohibition now feel it their duty to regulate morality through Hollywood movies.  Zukor knows that for the film industry, ""the greatest threats it faced were in those civic reformers and church ladies who saw the handiwork of Satan in silvery shadowplays that flickered across the nation's screens.  Movies glorified sex and sin, these bluenoses charged, and the movie players, with all their affairs and divorces, were agents of the devil.""  The effects of their efforts will be felt for over 35 years.One of the most fascinating men in Tinseltown is Adolph Zukor, president of Famous Players-Lasky and Paramount Studios.  This movie mogul had a vision of the future.  ""Zukor envisioned longer, more complex narratives for films.  He took the movies out of their makeshift storefront theaters and enshrined them in grand palaces of entertainment."" He also saw movies moving beyond silent, and beyond black and white.  ""What if someday they could be synchronized with music scores?  What if they could be shot in color?  What if movies could talk?""  He also imagined a time when movies could be seen at home ""on devices not yet invented.""  Zukor lived until 1976, when he died at the age of 103--ultimately seeing his dreams become reality.I know very little about the early days of Hollywood, and Mann gives us a fascinating look at this particular window in time.  Most of these stars who were very big names are now mostly forgotten.  I found Mann's tabloid-style writing well suited to this story.  And although some have complained that it is too long, I disagree.  It's not just a story about Taylor's murder--it's so much more.  Think Devil in the White City or Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  There are a lot of patches in this quilt.I only have two complaints about Tinseltown.  First, there are no photos in the Vine edition, although there are plenty to be found online.  I assume the published book will include many.  The second and more serious charge is that Mann does not solve the murder of William Desmond Taylor.  Although he speculates on who may have committed the crime, he has no hard evidence or concrete proof.  Otherwise, I found Tinseltown to be thoroughly enjoyable and learned a lot about the early days of the film industry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KT0MD479W14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242164#wasThisHelpful","R8KT0MD479W14","A39ABKRS1MKFTW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39ABKRS1MKFTW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Each bottle of PacificCoast NutriLab's nutrients is a different color- CoEnzymeQ10  a bright orange.On the side of each container is the URL for an ebook about that specific nutrient (TheCoQ10effect.com). These ebooks are beautifully illustrated in brilliant color and are very informative. In fact it could be said that each ebook is the horse's mouth for that particular nutrient.No hanky-panky. No anecdotal observations. Scientifically backed research.Although I have just received my COQ10 from PCNL, I have been taking this amazing nutrient for years. And I am a case in point:  85 years old. All my marbles. I design Tshirts on the Internet. I am never sick. Although I walk with a cane I walk fast. It would not be proper to say that my longevity is due to COQ10 because I cannot prove it.  But if I had to give up all supplements other than multiple vitamins, except one, COQ10 would be my choice.The capsules are egg-shaped, small and smooth and go down with a gulp.Based on the ebooks which are excellent and classy, I am willing to put my trust in PCNL products and stick with them in the future. I received CoQ10 and Arginine free in return for an honest, unbiased review for each. I award both 5 stars and am delighted to do so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPWN7EGU7SHT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV7MK4C#wasThisHelpful","RPWN7EGU7SHT9","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on a couple other reviews, I was leery about what I would really get with this lens kit.  As it turns out, all the pieces were there and the quality of construction exceeded my expectations.  It comes with a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone back case which the lens screws into. Also included is a sturdy little tabletop tripod that attaches to the lens by means of an aluminum ring that slides onto the lens.  Assembly is quick and easy.  Usage is just as easy.  You merely turn the focusing ring and snap away!  The lens provides 12 X magnification. Also included are a soft storage pouch, a lens cleaning cloth, clearly written instruction sheet and lens caps. Even the box is high quality.  Nowhere could I find that said it was made in China, so I don't really know.  Regardless, it is well made and packaged.  I highly recommend this lens kit if you are in the market for a camera phone telephoto lens. -- Roger Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXOK1R7ZQK0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJRKEJ0#wasThisHelpful","RXOK1R7ZQK0O","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grilling season is here!  Because I live in the southwest, grilling season never really goes away, but it's ""official"" after Memorial Day.  We like grilled chicken breasts and salmon marinated and basted with Teriyaki sauce.  This large bottle should last quite some time, even with our grilling habits.  The flavor is a little ""weaker"" than some others we are used to, but still tastes very good.  Once opened, it must be refrigerated and, therefore, takes up quite a bit of refrigerator space.  That is no fault of the Teriyaki sauce, however, just a side comment.  As much as this will get used, it won't be a problem for long! While an acceptable Teriyaki sauce, I will be less likely to seek out and purchase it just because of the bottle size and the fact that its flavor really isn't superior to others we've used.- - Roger Meyer","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DO3L7Z1S4C6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9XFX0A#wasThisHelpful","R1DO3L7Z1S4C6F","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As part of a Vine program review of several selfie sticks, this stick was reviewed after reviewing the URPower Monopod QuickSnap Pro 3-in-1 selfie stick.  The only significant difference in the two units was the phone mounting fixture.  In this unit, two different phone mounting fixtures are provided.  They are different sizes and therefore will accommodate a wider range of phones.  My review of that unit follows and applies to this unit as well. The camera mounting fixture is padded with foam to protect your phone while mounted in the fixture.  When I first installed my phone (Samsung Galaxy S4), I was concerned because it seemed that it was not centered along the axis of the stick and would tend to ""roll"" to the heave side.  After playing with the unit for a while, I happened to notice there were screws on the bottom of the camera holder.  I loosened them which allowed me to slide the camera back and forth and could center it.  I didn't see that feature indicated anywhere in the instruction, on the box, or on the Amazon web page (In fairness, there was a photo showing the base extended, but no reference to that ability, and it was not on the main photo page.). The stick itself seems substantial and extends to around 38,"" and the extensions do not rotate, thereby keeping the phone in the orientation desired.  The device comes with Bluetooth shutter activation.  It paired to my phone flawlessly and activated the shutter the first time I tried it.  Shutter activation is accomplished with a button on the handle that is easily pressed while holding the stick.  Included in the package is a short USB cable to be used to recharge the batteries in the handle. The only other criticism I have is the instructions included.  I realize this unit is made in China, but I've seen much better translations in other products.  It was hard to read because of the tiny print and VERY difficult to understand. Granted, while this product is somewhat intuitive in its operation, some people who are not technically inclined could use some better instructions for Bluetooth operation and charging the batteries. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and ease of setup.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a selfie stick.  The price is reasonable too.-Roger Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4ZFP3NOIG4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIT0QC2#wasThisHelpful","R3D4ZFP3NOIG4V","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing I noticed about this selfie stick after opening the box was that it came with a key fob type Bluetooth shutter activation device.  I was intrigued and surprised as to how easy it was to pair with my phone and use it to activate the shutter.  I'll be using this even without the selfie stick as I frequently get blurry photos when pressing the phone screen shutter button because I move the phone slightly. The phone mounts to the holding fixture quite easily and can be moved, as necessary, to avoid any side buttons on the phone. Stick extension is about 33"" and seems sturdy.  A complaint I have, however, is that the mounting of the camera holder to the pivoting fixture on the stick was difficult.  It seems that the threads did not mesh properly, and I could only screw it on by a few threads which left the camera holder very loose.  I eventually used some tools and forced it tight, all the while hoping it would not break.  It didn't.  Another complaint is that there were not an instruction sheet in the box, only very brief instructions on the box, but no reference to Bluetooth operation.  There was actually more information on the Amazon web page than included with the selfie stick. Apparently, the manufacturer assumes that the Bluetooth setup is intuitive, and is to a certain extent, but no explanation was given as to operation of the fob, e.g., the power switch, meaning of the blue light, and operating abilities/constraints. I would have given this device only three stars because of the camera holder attachment difficulty and lack of detailed instructions for the Bluetooth device, but the convenience of the Bluetooth device being separate and allowing me to use it without the selfie stick bumped it up to four stars.Roger Meyer --","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U23EOSKU43KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P3UMNFC#wasThisHelpful","R3U23EOSKU43KN","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I admit I was always prejudiced against Patsy Ramsey who I felt was railroading JonBenet into competing in child beauty pageant contests for the sake of her own vicarious gratification and ego. I find repelling such contests which are both tacky and tasteless. Unspeakable is coaching little girls to assume suggestive poses. And little girls' values may be warped into thinking beauty is everything. JonBenet was wetting the bed virtually every night which would certainly indicate she was stressed. I came away from reading Foreign Factions still disliking Patsy but being a bit more sympathetic towards  a woman to whom appearances, both physically and socially, were everything. I was surprised to learn she had graduated from college magna cum laude, a Barbie doll with brains, perhaps, and she was determined to morph her daughter into a junior version.Faction is a documentary containing a huge amount of information. Author James Kolar, a  former police officer, plays his hunches, his instincts and he sees red flags everywhere.  He opens the book with a pastiche- four intruders with a grudge against John Ramsey, sneak into his house on Christmas night, their prey JonBenet, and one of them the Monster does unspeakable things to the little girl. This scenario is not out of line with many theories and speculations concerning the death of this child who has achieved a ghastly sort of fame.Kolar pokes his bloodhound's nose into every crevice concerning this remarkable case and you, the reader, feel comfortable with him. He follows his hunches. He sees red flags everywhere. He takes you by the hand and  propels you into the drama and you will come away with enough information for you to easily navigate the interior of the Ramsey house if you were suddenly to land there. He  shows that the Ramseys-  eys. That John's money, and influence  bought him a reprieve from the District Attorney Mary Lacy who astoundingly put into writing in a letter to John that she believed the Ramseys totally innocent of the death of JonBenet. The Ramseys and their lawyers barricaded themselves from the Boulder police department which they scorned. When you consider that defense attorneys charge $500 AN HOUR and that John Ramsey kept a stable of them for years after his daughter's death, you realize what sort of financial ballpark he inhabits. Money talks and money is a deodorant.Author Kolar easily penetrates the coverup smokescreen John Ramsey created with an experienced policeman's cold hard facts. He is like Jack Webb who played Sergeant Friday on TV many years ago and always opined just the facts, Ma'am. He never actually accuses anyone as the murderer of JonBenet but he gives you enough evidence- psychological, and factual- for you to point your finger at the  perpetrator yourself. I think the person is obvious, but some other readers disagree with my choice.It is highly recommended that you read the incredibly varied and intelligent comments made by readers of  the Foreign Faction reviews here on Amazon.You will learn a  lot about polygraphs and how they operate and the fine nuances of a stun gun and what one does to human flesh as well as many interesting procedures accompanying a murder investigation. Faction is a page turner, a lesson in police procedures, a lesson into the complexity of human nature. But not a lesson in justice because poor little JonBenet did not receive justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PFEB3TOWX5IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098476321X#wasThisHelpful","R2PFEB3TOWX5IF","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received Mastermind and PAS free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, which I am delighted to provide for these very effective products. It should be noted that the two Zahler compounds- Mastermind and PAS- were taken together. Both can be taken separately, and they are effective separately, but together they seem to be synergistic or they may simply pack a double punch. Certainly they cover the bases for physical and mental health.The beautifully packaged Mastermind is pure serendipity. You can't help judging a book by its cover as you open the box. You virtually never see a superior product packaged in an ugly or boring container. You realize at once that Zahler is proud of this offering and  they tweak you a bit by including  a handsome embroidered Zahler baseball cap.There are a great many types of depression other than grief, a normal emotion which time will alleviate. I am a very old lady, 85, with all my marbles, but have been afflicted all my adult life  with a miasma of depression that settles down and covers me like a cowl. My problem is not manic-depression as there is no up swing. The miasma can hit any time and any place with no warning and no reason. Because it doesn't appear to be triggered by any life event the cause is elusive, but my instinct is it's metabolic. I looked for help and found Zahler, a caring company with superior compounds for both mental and physical health.If you look at the ingredients in Mastermind you will notice they include very large amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12. Four caplets a day are recommended. When I researched this I found there is good reason. Studies have shown low body levels of B12 may be associated with Alzheimer's and actual shrinkage of the brain and people over 50, some 20% of them, may have a borderline deficiency because they can't absorb enough of the vitamin (mostly found in meats). Vegetarians are at risk (but I am not one). I don't have Alzheimer's either, but I'm WAY over 50.  Not enough B12 can result in mood swings, depression and lethargy. The Harvard Medical School calls a B12 deficiency sneaky and harmful.B12 gives you physical, emotional and mental energy.PAS is not intended as a vitamin supplement, although it contains A, C and E. It is actually a polynutrient which plugs in where your multivitamin supplement leaves off by providing the strengths of highly selected botanicals.  Two of these herbs are Valerian and Rhodiola. Valerian root  has been used for centuries to combat insomnia and stress. The Greeks knew Rhodiola as an antidepressant, the Vikings took it for strength and stamina, the Chinese called it the golden root. and took it, probably, for everything.So how did an old lady of 85 respond to Mastermind and PAS? You may think any supplement for someone that old would be like putting a sugar coating around a pill. OK, I walk with a cane, but fast. My mind has never been sharper and I am in my element designing tee shirts. BUT, as I mentioned earlier I am susceptible to crippling depression and I am arthritic enough to make getting up from a chair a production. I spend hours at my computer with the consequence that I can hardly get up.I did not expect this: about six hours  after taking my first two Mastermind capsules and two PAS capsules  I was able to pull myself out of the chair with comparative ease and I seem to be infused with new energy. Whether this amazing result is the consequence of taking both products or one or the other it is impossible to tell.  This would be easy enough to prove by taking just one to see what happens but I am loath to do this. Because if it  ain't broke don't fix it. That same night my arthritic shoulders which had made turning over in bed painful, were not hurting.Today (day 2 with Mastermind and PAS) I had enough energy to vacuum the carpets, a chore I had put off much too long. If you've never seen an elderly lady whizzing around with a vacuum cleaner, come on over!Now for the depression. I am on a level keel at the present. I am not running down the hall singing the Hallelujah chorus (although I should be if my arthritis is actually zapped);  however, I am not down. In the middle. This mood is perfectly acceptable and may approach a normal state of mind. I don't expect to ever achieve a state of Nirvana, but maybe I will down the road, once or twice.Mastermind and PAS in tandem do nice things for me. Yes, they are expensive but not nearly as pricey as psychiatrists and physicians. Everything is relative.

"I showed the new Dimore Boys Boxer Brief underwear (although the label states E.T.X. underwear they are the same as pictured) to my 4 year old and he immediately took off his shorts and underwear and put a pair of these on!  The manufacturer thankfully sizes them based on age so you dont have to decide whether or not a 4T or 5T is the right choice.  This set is labelled for 4-5 year olds and fits perfectly.They are made of 95% cotton and 5% polyester and feel very soft.  According to my son, they feel very comfortable and cozy.  There is a pouch sewn into the front for added comfort and support which is a nice, quality touch.  The set we received contains 5 pairs in a variety of stylish colors.  All of the seams and stitching are perfect.  They look like high end adult underwear.The one drawback to these is the manufacturers label which is sewn into the outer left thigh area.  The description for these underwear states,  and he loves that there are no scratchy tags.  This is misleading because I inferred that there are no tags; perhaps they meant the tags they have sewn into the product are not scratchy?  Maybe the E.T.X. version have tags and the Dimore do not?  This may cause some irritation down the road but well have to wait and see.  If so, Ill just remove them.Overall, these underwear are luxurious and well-constructed for a young boy.  My son certainly feels very comfortable in them and refuses to take them off for their first laundering which is a good sign!--Gina Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T9J10V1LV66O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4IGDVC#wasThisHelpful","R1T9J10V1LV66O","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also, the are easy enough to pair up  I just turned the Bluetooth on on my iPhone and despite it having several other devices synced to it, it still found the headphones in just a few seconds.  They do have a cord so I can use them while plugged in if my Bluetooth goes down or I dont have a full charge  its great to have these options.--Victoria Franks","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QR39DG4L8Y7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STPHMI6#wasThisHelpful","R28QR39DG4L8Y7","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Tailgaterz Cool-N-Carry Cooler is so perfect for taking all the snacks you need for your next tailgating party but more importantly (for a mom of two littles!) for transporting groceries and shopping items without everything spilling over in the trunk, while keeping cold items cold for the trip home!  This cooler features a foldable cooler that keeps beverages and snacks organized, four mesh pockets that provide added storage space, a cooler compartment that is supposed to stay cool for 12 hours (I haven't tested that yet!), a favorite feature of a folding design to make storage easier, and finally, an adjustable shoulder strap that makes it easier to transport into the house!  I love this well-built addition to my trunk!--Victoria Franks","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IM8T2VDYHPX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJNLXTA#wasThisHelpful","R1IM8T2VDYHPX0","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sherpa fleece is not from a lamb (thank goodness) but a man made polyester fabric than is even softer than lamb's wool and feels like lamb's wool to the touch. The Sherpa nubby side is on the bottom, the printed side on top is as soft as velvet. This blanket-throw is just plain luxurious.The name Sherpa comes from the ethnic people of Nepal,  but any mountain guide in the Himalayas is referred to as a Sherpa even if he is not technically of the ethnic group. There are 2,5000 genuine Sherpas in New York City, amazingly. A skyscaper in place of Everest?All our family are rabid Anglophiles and everybody wanted the Union Jack. The colors are simply brilliant. The throw is very light, and although very warm it is not burdensome. Our cats found the throw right away where it was draped over the couch arm.

"While this is a decent clipper set for the home, it is definitely not a professional clipping/grooming set and the price is a bit high for what you get.  These pet hair clippers are a pretty basic set and they have 4 attachments. The unit seems pretty solidly constructed (made in China) and includes an A/C cable. I do have to say that they are very loud!  It has a blade adjustment lever and comes with a little cleaning brush and all of it comes in a black plastic carrying case.  I have 2 small dogs (well one is medium sized) and I had to go over the dogs a couple of times to get their hair off. I didn't expect professional quality, so with that in mind it's decent enough for how I groom my dogs at home.--Victoria Franks","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DW61BT48EEZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYE62YS#wasThisHelpful","R2DW61BT48EEZ4","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some years ago I went to the Hollywood Bowl to see Zubin Mehta conduct the LA Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra. I couldn't take my eyes off Mehta who is a rather small man off stage  but he becomes a Titan on the podium. I felt that he was drawing forth from each member of the orchestra beautiful music by osmosis. That symbiosis between a conductor and his musicians, between a corporate executive and his company is what this interesting and provocative book is all about. Author Itay Talgam is both an orchestra conductor and a conductor of people, a guru for executives and corporations. The goal is the most beautiful music possible or the greatest achievements possible, and the hearts of all the players whether on Wall Street or Carnegie must be in the enterprise.A conductor is a virile, iconic symbol of leadership but a great maestro is not an autocrat. Whether a man is on a podium or in a director's chair, author Talgam  explores and defines  the nuances necessary to bring out the best performance in musicians or the fellow members of a corporation. An orchestra is not a place for prima donnas but every person whether a first violin or the guy that tinkles the triangle has to be imbued with enthusiasm, even eagerness and ambition to do his best not for glory to himself but glory to the whole.An executive has to allow for creative freedom in his group. He is the boss but he must supply his underlings with enthusiasm by letting them come forth with their own ideas. Passion is a big factor here. A violinist must play the proper notes but how he wrenches the tones issuing from his instrument is his to discover and make his own. But he is contributing to the whole, the glorious sound of a great orchestra.In between a conductor's baton and the members of an orchestra there is a gap. There is a gap, really, between all people. The maestro or the corporation CEO fills this gap by listening. The members of each may have great ideas, suggestions and sheer talent and the maestro or boss must have his ear to the ground. This is definitely a two way street. Neither the executive nor the conductor is in isolation on a pinnacle. Harmony can only prevail when everybody is allowed to do his thing. Not playing any old note, of course, but coaxing his instrument, being a dynamic member of a corporation group.Author Talgam explores the style of six world-class conductors. The approach in each case is how each maestro controls and yet inspires his players. It is helpful to run these famous musicians through Google to witness their performance on the podium. You can check out Arturo Toscanini temper tantrums (all bark and no bite), The six conductors are Riccardo Muti (autocratic but he pulls forth glorious music from his orchestra); the emotional and passionate Arturo Toscanini; the sedate Richard Strauss; the aristocratic Herbert von Karajan; the incredibly agile Carlos Kleiber; the charismatic, handsome Leonard Bernstein.The title  The ignorant Maestro bothers me just a bit- it's that word ignorant. Certainly any executive, conductor or entrepreneur will find many gaps between himself and his players, areas in which  he has to fill in and even embrace because hidden in those gaps may be superb talent, a wealth of ideas, cutting edge originality.  But ignorant implies to me a lack of education not a lack of understanding, a lack of information of his group. But I won't belabor the point. The book is highly original, and Talman appears as a very knowledgeable and likable guy with plenty of talent to spare.The bottom line here is that when the players on a stage- any players, any stage- give up on self expression, when the joy of discovery and creativity have been buried by routine a vital element has disappeared. And somehow when I see a conductor raise his baton to signal the start of a piece, I am irresistibly reminded of Charlton Heston as Moses raising his staff and parting the Red Sea. Perhaps Moses and the conductor and the CEO are all part of the same thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYLHFPI8EJAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847230#wasThisHelpful","RRYLHFPI8EJAM","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample in return for writing an unbiased review.You can't judge a book by its cover (but everybody does including me). The attractive packaging of any item is to me paramount to my decision to buy the item. These BodyVega Omega-3 fish oil capsules come in a nice-looking bottle in blue and chartreuse colors and the ingredients are very clearly stated on the back. The bottle itself is very smooth, fitting your hand nicely. Good packaging gives the product CLASS.  (I know you are laughing at me but that's OK).Now, about the performance in a serving which is two soft gels containing 800 mg of EPA and 600 mg of DHA. Other reviewers have written excellent reviews comparing the ingredients of Omega 3 capsules to other fish oil brands and relating their own experiences using the gels. It can be said that Body Vega fish oil capsules are power-packed. In my experience there is no after taste whatever and no lemon flavor, not even when gulped down with hot coffee at breakfast.There is an enormous amount of research concerning the efficacy of fish oil. I have taken it for years but this is my first bottle of Body Vega. I didn't start seeing miracles with Body Vega- the miracles have really already occurred. Peering at the monitor all day while designing tee shirts and other items wreaks havoc with my eyes without a fish oil supplement. I am 85 years old and with all older people arthritis is a big problem. In my case the shoulders are the worst hit, making turning in bed a nightmare. Fish oil is a huge help, in fact it is so helpful to me that I am awed.BodyVega Fish Oil appears to be a superior supplement based on what other people have said and although my experience with this brand is short I will stick with BodyVega. This brand is number one, the biggest fish oil supplement on Amazon. It appears to be a power-house and its efficacy is backed up by other reviewers and the manufacturer as well.  Maybe because we all evolved from creatures in the sea  our bodies are very amenable to fish oil. The solution is very simple: two capsules a day and you're off and running or maybe I should say swimming. And your brain may benefit, too. Take it from a very old lady:  if fish oil can help a person like me, think what it can do for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14MQ90AHTAJVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FOVLXYW#wasThisHelpful","R14MQ90AHTAJVA","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wolf Hall is a highly intelligent, superbly nuanced adaptation of Hilary Mantel's stunning book. The film is not a study in extremes such as black and white, good and evil, but a subtle study in shades of grey. It embraces the underbelly of the Tudor Court where the mechanics of  governing the country grind.The atmosphere of England in sixteenth century of Wolf Hall is wonderfully embracing,  The ambiance will take you right in. The dark, gloomy nights lit only by candlelight almost make you want to watch your back, in the gloom an enemy could be lurking right there, behind the drape. In the daytime no sunshine enters the small windows and outside the sun does not sparkle, the shadows are misty. Wolf Hall is never exuberant. The camera often follows a person from the rear-in a dark cape he may like a crow. It is interesting that the back of an individual speaks as much as the front- the position of the hands, the tilt of the neck,  a rapid or slow gait, even the mood...I have never seen a camera perform this trick so often. In one scene it follows Cromwell and a crony, both dressed in black riding on dark brown horses. Sort of a sea in darkness on a bleak day. I know there is a metaphor here and I ponder it.Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell brings a great deal of nuance into the role, his dark eyes always watchful. He is not inscrutable, the thin mouth often hovering in the ghost of a smile as he goes about performing his tasks as principal minister to Henry VIII. He is immensely likable and if the real Thomas Cromwell was not likable it matters not.  Who are we to say? The plot revolves around him and you see him tete a tete with many famous sixteenth century characters. I read that there are 102 characters in the series- they fit seamlessly into the story because a master hand, is directing them.Claire Foy is perfect as Anne Boleyn, capturing her brittleness, her bravado. She is obliged to walk a tight rope controlled by Henry and she is fully aware that if she doesn't produce a son her life as Queen is over. Her distress is palpable but she takes great pains to conceal it, often acting haughty.Thomas Wolsey like Thomas Cromwell hasn't been treated kindly by history and usually appears greedy and self-serving and yet he earned his accumulation of wealth including a palace,  as rewards for his services to Henry. Jonathan Pryce as the Cardinal, like the film portrayal of Thomas Cromwell, is a well rounded personality, sensitive and loyal to the King. But he cannot convince the Pope to declare the marriage between Henry and Katherine of Aragon  annulled.  And so Henry VIII pulls the plug and the Cardinal is stripped of earthly glory. You see him at the end of his life shuffling slowly along, his red robe no longer a symbol of power. You feel for him.Damian Lewis makes a fine King Henry with his (genuine) red beard, his aristocratic mien, his arrogance, his mercurial temper, his power. He often has a diabolic grin on his face that is close to snarling. When Henry is on stage, metaphorically speaking, nobody else is. He is the magnet that draws all attention. However, in one amusing scene Henry falls asleep at the dinner table. There is an immediate hush as none of the diners dares to wake him for fear of a reprisal. Finally a girl taps his arm and Henry comes to, remarking he has just been resting his eyes, and all is well, but the relief around the table is palpable. When Henry is present the air seems electric, wired, almost turbulent.Although a small role, that of Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister, gives  the story piquancy and charm. And as Mary actress Charity Wakefield with her snub nose and mischievous smile often banters with Cromwell. She has been dumped by Henry VIII who saw a better catch in Anne Boleyn, but Mary is relieved to be off the royal hook, she laughs at Anne and she likes Cromwell. Plenty of chemistry between the two even if it comes to naught.One very important aspect of Wolf Hall is the character and portrayal of Thomas More, who was made a saint by the Catholic Church in 1940. Hilary Mantel is an outspoken anti-Catholic and More (played ably by Anton Lesser) becomes in the film adaptation of the book a cruel, hypocritical prig who actually enjoys attending burnings at the stake of Protestant heretics. While historically More has been regarded as somewhat of a hero in his courageous stand against Henry's divorce and Cromwell has the reputation of a villain, both men were creatures of their time and behaved as such and neither could be called scrupulous. Whatever the reader's feelings are on this subject, it is best to let sleeping dogs lie and enjoy this splendid series for what it is: a very fine drama","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBINGS8E7T5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3I97A0#wasThisHelpful","RXBINGS8E7T5Z","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This laptop review will be more of a high level review from the point of an ""average"" user, not a technophile. I was very impressed immediately upon opening the box.  This laptop appears to be very sturdy.  The case feels like it can take the abuse of being carried around in daily use in less than the ideal home or office environment.  I was leery of the design of the swivel screen, but upon inspection and using it for a while, I am very happy with it.  It is well built and offers a wide range of uses.  Since this laptop is really a laptop/tablet combination, the swivel screen can be placed in whatever position the user wants - traditional laptop configuration, as an easel, or fully flat in the table mode. I am also impressed with battery life.  My past experience with laptops has been that, if they lasted 4 - 5 hours, I was lucky.  This laptop has exceeded 8 hours in my usage so far, and the battery monitor indicated over 10 hours available when fully charged. Since this unit comes with Windows 8.1, which most new computers are loaded with, I won't address the software aspects.  I'm also not a fan of Windows 8.1. I wasn't sure I would use the touchscreen much in the laptop mode, but I find myself using it more and more, especially when I have the screen in an easel configuration.  The touchscreen is easy to use, not overly sensitive, and very convenient. I find that I use it especially when I'm using a web browser.  It's much easier to use when scrolling the screen than using the touch-pad.  The keyboard is the standard layout, of course, and is comfortable to use.  The keys, once one is pressed, have a back-light that lights up the perimeter of them with a soft blue light.  The touch-pad is also pretty much standard fare and works quite well. One of the technical features I really like is that this unit uses solid state devices (SSD) instead of a hard disk.  This results in amazingly fast boot-up times as well as fast operation for any function that requires typical disk drive operations.  There are three USB ports, two USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0. There is also an HDMI port, and SD card reader, and a combination mic/headphone jack. Overall, I am very satisfied with this laptop/touch-pad computer and highly recommend it to others.  It is versatile, fun to use, has long battery life, and is sturdy.Ports include two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port and an HDMI port. You'll also find an SD card reader and a combination headphone/mic jack.  - See more at: http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/acer-aspire-r-13#sthash.2QNuF29F.dpufRoger Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IHFD7O9G6ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45UMAC#wasThisHelpful","R3IHFD7O9G6ZF","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very surprised at the negative reviews for this fine production. Some reviewers complained that the series was like a stage play. It is, but that fact in no way mars the quality. I have to say up front that I am deaf and require the closed cc's  but it is easy to follow the plot. using the captions I can't  judge the quality of the voice  acting. However the ccs are perfectly synchronized with the speech which is not always the case.The casting  and costuming of the various characters is spot on. Aside from the major players it is easy to recognize Cromwell, Cranmer, Woolsey and even the Duke of Norfolk. The production accurately brings to the viewer Henry's six wives in all their agonies and ecstasies. A great deal of research was required and Henry VIII's court as it appears in this series is a reflection of the real thing. You are there.

"I received the Nerf Rebelle Super Soaker Tri Threat squirt crossbow today and my 4 year old son couldnt wait for me to free it from its packaging.Although it is obviously marketed toward a female target market he didnt seem to notice; it has a blue stock and the other colors are neutral orange, white, and dark purple.  Besides, its a CROSSBOW, what boy wouldnt love to have a crossbow that shoots water?  If you are purchasing this for a girl, she will certainly enjoy it.The suggested minimum age is 6; however, my 4 year old had no problem operating this weapon of mass hydration.  Instead of a traditional trigger, this reimagined squirt gun employs a pump-style mechanism at the front to deploy its liquid bolts.  I appreciate the pump design because as a boy I routinely wore the skin off of my trigger finger on my primitive squirt guns.  My son was able to shoot this device effectively whereas with some other squirt guns his fingers arent strong enough to pull the triggers.This squirt crossbow has a novel feature of 3 simultaneous streams of water.  I was skeptical about the distance it would shoot due to the limited range of motion of the pump mechanism but it gets the job done and shoots quite a distance.  The center stream is definitely more powerful than the two side streams but the overall result is the same:  you will thoroughly soak your enemy.Overall, it is well-built, feels comfortable to hold, survives inevitable drops, shoots far, and is priced reasonably.  The only drawback is if you are on the receiving end, you will be soaked with one blast.-  Matt Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T63PB4N74O4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQ7MPCS#wasThisHelpful","R2T63PB4N74O4S","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Tudors"" is gorgeous, exciting, a feast for the senses. However I have a major problem: I cannot  visualize Henry VIII without his trade mark red hair, a sort of Tudor beacon that he passed on to his daughter Elizabeth.The series wrenches history a bit- for instance Henry's sister Margaret did not marry the King of Portugal, but the King of Scotland and she became the grandmother of Mary Queen of Scots. Cardinal Wolsey did not commit suicide although he may have wanted to. There are other historical wrenches but if you are not an historical purist, these irregularities won't dampen your enthusiasm and enjoyment for the series.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is handsome, viril, and dynamic but to me he is not Henry VIII but an actor playing the part very competently but through a glass darkly. Catherine of Aragon does not  sartorially do much better. Catherine, the real Catherine, was not swarthy with dark hair, she was fair with light brown hair. In fact she was much nearer the  physical ideal for a woman in the sixteenth century than the raven haired Anne Boleyn.I loved this series, especially the jousting and the wonderful panoramas of the lushly green English countryside. But I am giving the series four stars, not five because Henry VIII, although character-wise was authentic has to be auburn-haired. The emperor's new clothes simply do not fit the real Henry VIII.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E73XGZ5X7MUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010XVEP6#wasThisHelpful","R3E73XGZ5X7MUN","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Mengo S-Power solar backup battery is a very clever, rugged device.  It can charge up to two cell phones at once via dual USB connectors.  The manufacturer says that only one tablet should be charged at a time though.  The indicator lights provide a four point level of charge indication for the internal battery.  To recharge the device, you have a couple options.  It will charge when placed in sunlight, but it is a slow process. Just place it in the sun and a green LED will illuminate indicating that it is in solar charge mode.  The manufacturer says that only about 1/8 of full charge is input per day, however, so it is a slow process.  It would be a good way to keep it ""topped off,"" however.  The best way to recharge it is to connect a power source (phone charger, computer, etc) via the micro-USB connector port.  A short USB to micro-USB cable is provided with the unit.  Also provided is a carabiner for attaching the unit to belt loops, backpacks, etc.  The unit is advertised as being resistant to some water such as rainfall, splashing, etc, but not submersion in water. While I haven't had this device for a very long time, I can see it as being a handy battery charger for those times when you forget to recharge your phone, have been away from a charging source longer than you had planned, or in emergency situations.  It is reasonably priced, conveniently sized, rugged, and attractive in appearance.--Roger Meyer","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWW1CNSXKXKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNV8SRS#wasThisHelpful","R2IWW1CNSXKXKX","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The biggest disappointment I have with this entertaining  group of essays is the fact that the rich eccentrics are not named*. But Kirshenbaum is loyal and he protects them. Even evidence like a painting hanging in a mansion is not attributed to the artist. There are hints but I couldn't guess who any of the disguised people are maybe because my situation as a church mouse is practically on a different planet. The book is not an expose nor is it titillating. The super-rich are not funny, they are quirky. The playing field of  Old Money versus  nouveau riche has leveled as Old Money felt themselves getting stale, getting submerged in fuddy-duddyism, perhaps and therefore welcomed the Nouveaus into their hallowed halls. Not many years ago the Nouveaus were considered vulgar parvenus. Not any more according to the author.One interesting discussion involves the very posh and their sense of entitlement. Aside from royalty only the super rich feel entitled. You can be a famous artist or music composer or writer and not feel the world is your oyster. It is the very wealthy who believe the world revolves around them. Their teenage kids have been brought up believing in their superior status, that their money opens all the doors.  Family chauffeurs  are often delegated to being nannies for these rich kids, getting them home if they have passed out in a night club or have committed some another social gaffe. The drivers, many of whom are ex-cops, know how to beat the system in getting their young masters out of trouble. Money talks.The author seems to have a permanent pass into the lives of the moneyed class and his descriptions of the elegant  dinners he has with the money crowd will get you drooling as you read, even if you (like me) haven't  a clue as to what some entrees are: malazania parmigiana; hijicki salad washed down with Sancerre; gigande beans. Your tastebuds are telling you something even if you don't know quite what and you will end up starving when you finish the book.The best dressed persons among the privileged are men, not women, and they are Italian. With these guys a suit is a way of life. They are part Casanova, part hockey stars. Nobody can lounge around the way a slinky well-dressed Italian can. For women looking chic is a huge on-going battle. Getting an appointment with her eyebrow lady is like getting an audience with the pope. Their hair must be salon blown EVERY day except maybe Sunday. When you are super-rich you must look the part, even subsisting on lettuce or kale to keep elegantly thin.Is there a downside to being a member of the 1% club? One father complained that he was an invisible ATM since the minute he walked in the door his wife and daughters would all start clamoring for something expensive. Whether the filthy rich are happy is a point to ponder although I imagine it is better to be unhappy rich than unhappy poor. Some of the disguised characters in the book appear reasonably exuberant, but not all. Some appear just plain disgruntled.And so author Kirshenbaum cheerfully wends his way between the watering holes of his well-heeled friends and acquaintances. He himself emerges from the pages of Isn't that rich?as very likable.

"I haven't had a chance to try this blade yet, but based on inspection and reading of the claims, it appears to be incredibly ""universal"" in that is supposedly fits a wide variety of oscillating tools. Based on some other reviewers, however, it seems that a few, at least, had some minor difficulties in fitting and/or securing the blade.  I would like to think that when the manufacturer claims the blade will fit on a particular brand of tool, that they have actually tried it and found it to be a successful fit. The difficulties could arise, perhaps, from minor changes made over the years and/or different models offered by the same manufacturer. I noticed that this blade has a unique ""set"" to the teeth that will help with use on wood that should prevent burning by removing sawdust that one reviewer complained about with other blades, but not this one.This blade is an economical alternative to some pricier blades and ""should"" fit most tools, it the claims are true. The manufacturer also offers several styles of blades for different applications.--Roger Meyer","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISBUVBETUWP8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMAQ4K2#wasThisHelpful","R3ISBUVBETUWP8","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This card is an economical way to go for your smart phone, tablet, camera, or any device utilizing a micro SD card.  While another reviewer claimed its transfer speed is slower than competitors, I can't verify that claim.

I'm not too concerned with that feature because it seems plenty fast to me when transferring photos on my phone to my desktop computer.

"I received the Adonit Mini Precision Disc Jot stylus and was immediately impressed by its overall design.  It looks sleek, stylish, and functional.  I proceeded to use it with my Samsung Galaxy S5 in my favorite drawing game, Draw Something, and was finally able to draw the finer details my fingers have been unable to.The device is constructed of lightweight aluminum and the writing point is centered in a clear disk which helps to properly position the point in the same plane as the writing/drawing surface.  The disk also fully rotates to accommodate any writing position.  The diameter of the shaft is sized properly and fits comfortably in my fingers.  I appreciate that it isn't large like other styli; it unobtrusively fits in my pocket.  The device also comes with a screw-on protective lid which screws onto the opposite end to prevent losing it--nice touch. It works as advertised and I am pleased with the results it gave me.  I look forward to using it anytime a fine touch is required.

"Death ex machina is derived from the Latin deus ex machina. Death or god from the machine has evolved as a plot device meaning an obtuse problem is abruptly resolved by the intervention of a new event, character, ability or object. (Wiki). In the novel it is a double entendre as a death literally occurs aboard a crane like machine used to lift the actor high above the stage.Gary Corby takes you back to 485 BCE during the Golden Age of Pericles where you will feel quite comfortable. Conversations are in the modern vernacular and it's easy to imagine the characters speaking in the Greek vernacular. There are many descriptions of various ancient Greek activities and methods that are not only interesting but most certainly authentic, such the tortuous manner in which a surgeon sets a broken bone and the molten beeswax an artist uses to prepare a wall for a fresco-like painting.  A device which plays a central role in the plot is a unique hoisting machine which  grabs an actor playing a god and suspends him high above the stage as though on Mount Olympus.There are many touches of humor and you can imagine Sophocles or Socrates slapping his leg and guffawing. Sophocles and Socrates are among the famous characters which are seamlessly woven into the novel and of course Aeschylus the playwright is included as this is a novel centered around the theater.A  huge festival, the Great Dionysia, is about to convene with thousands of people from all the Greek provinces on their way, expecting a series of stage plays honoring Dionysus, the god of wine. But a taint hovers over the city-a murder on stage under the watchful eye of the god. Dionysos will not be mollified until the killer is apprehended. The actors and stage hands of the theater think that a ghost is loose when strange things begin to happen like accidents which escalate into a murder. Husband and wife detectives Nico and Diotima are employed by Pericles to investigate and find the assassin but quick as the crime must be solved before the festival begins.  The people are literally at the gates of Athens, a great mass of revelers moving exorbitantly towards the city.The novel is funny, with plenty of suspense and it's interesting, too. You will learn a lot about ancient Greece. In fact the parts I liked the best in the book were purely descriptive, such as word pictures of  a sleek ship manned by three tiers of rowers on each side . The Salaminia was the fastest boat in all the world.Death ex Machina is a good read, original and fast-moving. Although it is part of a series it is not necessary to have read the previous volumes. The book can easily stand on its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11UOTO423XSBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616955198#wasThisHelpful","R11UOTO423XSBH","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the former review ""If you don't mind the assembly"" I turned chicken and ran for the nearest man  to help a helpless old lady (85). The nightstand weighs 38 pounds and after struggling to get it in the door I decided this nightstand and I were not going to tango. My handyman- inclined friend made me feel somewhat mollified by remarking the stand wasn't all that simple to assemble. However all is well and it is now sitting next to my bed where it will hold books under the drawer and in the drawer odds and ends for late night reading, pencils for making notes for reviews, granola bars, a notebook or two and even a hair dryer and curlers.The nightstand is handsome, grey in color,  quite distinctive, the cloth pattern on the drawer a nice touch. Bravo to the other reviewer for heroically putting her stand together herself. No heroics here but all's well that ends well, and we both have our nightstands performing nicely as a handsome piece of furniture and perhaps a catchall..

"My initial intent for this SSD was to use it as a secondary drive, which I did.  Very satisfied with its performance.  Much faster, as expected, than my old HDD.  I have an older Dell Dimension E521 (amazing what we consider old when it comes to electronic products and computers!) and will eventually clone my primary drive to achieve faster boot times and to increase storage space.  Based on what others have said in the reviews, I would expect a MAJOR reduction of boot time.  As my older system has lots of programs that start on boot up, I am looking forward to the decreased boot time.  This drive is easy to install and (obviously) quiet since there are no moving parts.  Predicted life span and not hearing those typical warning sounds of impending HDD failure is something to look forward to also. In summary, this SSD is an amazing product that for not much money, you can increase performance, reduce boot time, add lots of storage space economically, and have a reasonable expectation of not having a sudden drive failure as with a HDD.

"We did not know who Jerry Baird was, so we Googled him and found this former college professor has spent some thirty years  perfecting his gourmet spices by cooking for hungry Texas cowboys from a chuck wagon.

"I used this bottle for the first time today by taking it to work.  I particularly like the diameter.  It's not too big and is very comfortable to hold.  The sealing mechanism is well designed and easy to use.  The cap pops open with a simple push of the button.  The opening button can be prevented from accidental opening by simple flipping up the locking bar. It is comfortable to drink from and water flows easily because of the air hole.  Both the air hole and the drinking spout seal easily by merely snapping the lid closed.  The carry strap is a handy addition which allows you to carry it with one finger, if you so choose.  Overall, it is attractive, easy and convenient to use, seals well, and comfortable to hold.  The only negative I would give it is the price point.  It seems a little high, but it is a quality bottle.

"It is hard to judge the style of a novel that is translated, in this case from Italian but the prose is clear and purposeful; however, there are many cliches. The novel itself represents a great deal of research of pre- renaissance Italy and its powerful warmongering states but it is too long, with too many characters and the reader-at least this reader-got somewhat bogged down. Some of the characters talk like college professors and at length about the architecture of the cathedral among other things. There is too much unnecessary dialog and data in this novel which slows the plot.Italy itself in the fifteenth century was not a unified country but consisted of states vying for power and the most powerful state was Milan. The supreme ruler of Italy was the Catholic Church which held sway over all the states, however in Milan the church was infiltrated by Celts who had first come to Italy many years before. These Druids performed their rituals in deep secrecy, hidden away in  a subterranean cave near the cathedral which was in the process of being constructed. I checked with Google, having never heard of Druids practicing  alchemy and the magic arts anywhere in Milan, let alone Italy. Author Piazza is right: the Druids were a large presence. In the novel they built a temple ""The Temple of Light"" near the foundation of the cathedral, and their goddess was Belisama who  in the novel evolved and morphed into the Virgin Mary. The brotherhood are intriguers and deadly serious about ancient prophecies which must be fulfilled.The protagonist of the story is Niccolo, son of the deceased Duke of Milan, who demands on his deathbed that the Archdeacon Onorio bring up Niccolo in secret as his son as the Duke had many enemies and many might be tempted to kill the boy. Unknown to the Duke, Onorio is a Druid priest. As he grows up, Niccolo feels his calling as a sculptor and little by little practicing the craft on hunks of marble he morphs into an artist. Interwoven with his story are threads about the beautiful dark haired Lorenzo who is a paid killer and his sister Maria who had become an aristocrat's mistress but is discarded when convenient. The aristocracy is powerful and at times ruthless and at times cruel.  That might makes right was alive and well in fifteenth century Milan.And there is the chestnut-haired  Angelica with whom Niccolo falls in love, but he is noble and  she is a commoner. Angelica, Lorenzo and Maria are threaded through the novel and in Niccolo's life. There is a great deal of detail about the Druids, their philosophy, they are guardians of the Philosopher's Stone. They seek a temple with direct access to the Virgin Mary, a pillar of light. But there is too much on this plate. I felt I had to plow through endless detail to finally reach the end. The novel is erudite but needs lightening up. I feel rather guilty giving this novel three stars because it is obviously a huge undertaking, but author Piazza, who has great potential, needs an editor who can separate the grain from the chaff","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBMLDXVMT032/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504000692#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBMLDXVMT032","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Benjamin Percy.is a descriptive writer, rather a rarity these days with the popularity of he-man prose with no adjectives, the text an unadorned skeleton. The prose in this highly original thriller is beautiful. and sets you down into the plot where you feel belonged and part of the action.  Lewis Meriwether (formerly Meriwether Lewis of the Northwest Passage) Wilhelmina Clark (morphed into a girl from William Clark) along with a ragged survivors of a holocaust, a nuclear war that has flattened North America, eke out an existence in the Sanctuary. The Sanctuary is the  ruins of Saint Louis, the famous arch in shreds, the vestige of the city supporting a few survivors who have reverted to riding horses, killing the little game they can find with bows and arrows. The small population lives on the decaying ruins of Saint Louis and is coerced into obeying its leaders. Escape is ruthlessly suppressed. But rain rarely falls and the area is drying up.Creating a new wrinkle in the famous Lewis and Clark expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to head West into unknown territory in 1804 is ingenious. In The Dead Lands after radiation  from  a nuclear holocaust and a flu epidemic have devastated North America the narrative compares the formidable dangers of slogging into the wilderness in 1804  with the present  formidable dangers of slogging into the nuclear radiation-ravaged Dead Lands. From out of nowhere a girl on horseback arrives at The Sanctuary. This young woman who will guide the small party West is Gawea, a modern edition of the famous Shoshone guide and interpreter Sacagawea* who married one of Lewis and Clark's expedition members. Gawea has come from Oregon, riding alone by horseback. She tells Lewis he is being summoned West by Aran Burr. A version of the arch-traitor? You the reader will not understand this until you reach the end of the book.Six people sneak out of the Sanctuary-Lewis Meriwether, Wilhelmina Mina Clark, a woman doctor, two young men, and Gawea. They must travel over a vast dead civilization, the mid-west remnants of America, with  horrid reminders and echoes such as a decrepit ferris wheel, children's skeletons in a bus, a  mummified body on a brass bed. They are attacked by man-sized white bats, horrible mutations and enormous white bears. Danger lurks under every leaf. The poor horses suffer from one catastrophe after another, they whicker and scream and drum their feet and die.In the meantime, back at the Sanctuary the remaining citizens of the city rail against the authoritarian rule of the mayor. Simon, a brash young man who is a thief (but lovable) and his girlfriend Ella are subjected to constant indignities and coercion  of a dictatorship where floggings and executions seem to be an everyday affair and where freedom does not exist. They learn of the adventures of the group that has gone West via a mechanical owl programmed by Lewis with a cavity inside for hiding letters. Ella and Simon face a great dilemma: should they also venture forth into the dangers or remain in relative safety in what is really a prison.Surely one of the hallmarks for a great science fiction or fantasy novel is its plausability.. Benjamin Percy's bone-chilling story in no way seems contrived as he seamlessly records the adventures of a latter day Lewis and Clark. One of the characters, John Colter, was a real member of the explorer team and is considered one of the first mountain men, an expert tracker at home in the wilderness. In the book he is a strange man who dressed in black and rode a black horse. A knight come riding in a way, but just as vulnerable physically and emotionally as the rest of the explorers.When the little ragged band reaches the Pacific they have suffered just about any indignity, hardship or physical pain possible. Some of their woes are self-inflicted, others the slings and arrows of enemies lurking everywhere. The voice of Aran Burr has beckoned the little troupe to the Pacific like a Siren. Aran Burr is a symbol- you will have your own interpretation based on the fact that Aaron Burr was thearch-traitor of the early, struggling America. The novel is really an allegory. It takes you to the frontier of the human soul. The greatest human emotion is love, which will conquer evil. Will the adventurers finally see in a glass face to face? The ending of the novel is stunning, delicious and exactly right.*In 2000 the US Mint issued a gold-plated dollar with a rendition of a Shoshone girl engraved upon it. The coin was a tribute to Sacagawea but most people hadn't a clue as to who Sacagawea was and the rendition appeared rather uninspired to boot. The coin like the one of Susan B. Anthony bombed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26QWE32K0SM65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455528242#wasThisHelpful","R26QWE32K0SM65","A22F3BWM7RAHDA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22F3BWM7RAHDA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These lights are very different from the ""2 for 5 dollars"" solar lights that are perennially on special at the local hardware store. They're heavy duty, made from thick aluminum. They're quite large, about 6 inches in diameter and standing about 15-16 inches above the ground once the stakes are pushed in. They're quite bright, with a warm white (not bluish) light. Two lights are sufficient to light up my 24' sidewalk. The manufacturer did a nice job of matching the paint color with the solar panel on top; as a result, the solar panel doesn't stand out at all, unlike many lights I've seen. The on/off switch is a nice touch. In the ""on"" position, the lights will come on automatically at night, and turn off (and charge) by day. In the ""off"" position, the lights won't come on automatically at night.Overall, these lights are as sturdy and put out as much light as the hardwired NightHawk landscaping lights they replaced. The solar Gama Sonic lights are much easier to move around since they have no wires, and I won't have the same problem of mice, squirrels, etc. chewing through the wires.So, they're much sturdier and higher quality than the plastic lights at the hardware store, which have to be replaced every season. And they're as bright as but more flexible than hardwired lights. Based on these comparisons, it might sound like a clear five star product. However, when the lights arrived, I noticed a rattling sound in one of them. When I took apart the fixture, I found a loose screw. I found it's matching hole and tried to put it back in place, but the threads were stripped, which why the screw hand come loose. There were three screws holding this part of the fixture together, so losing one screw shouldn't affect performance, but having a loose screw rattling around in a product that's positioned as a higher end product isn't right. Also, the threading on the poles wasn't well matched. High quality design and heavy duty materials should be matched by high quality manufacturing and quality control. Overall, I would purchase these lights at their current price without hesitation, and feel that I'd received good value for my dollar, but a bit better manufacturing quality control would make for an overall better customer experience out of the box.Bottom line: I almost took off a star for the loose screw, but these lights are so superior in so many ways (heavy metal construction, great light output, warm white light color, on/off switch, large solar panel, pole height, etc.), that I still give them five stars. In terms of appearance and performance, they really are the equivalent of my old wired NightHawk landscape lights, which is not the case with 95% of the solar landscape lights I've encountered.UPDATE Oct 2015, after the lights have been in place through one spring/summer/fall season: I still like these lights a lot. They look good, they're much taller than many other path lights, they're heavy and durable, and they put out many hours of light each night. But the manufacturing quality issues have become an increasing issue. Today I noticed that one of the two lights had started to fill up with water. The water was about to the top of the reflector cone in the bottom of the glass fixture. We've only had a few days of rain in the past few weeks, and not particularly heavy rain. I can't see how the water is getting in (must be a leaky seal around the solar panel), and I can't see any way to drain the water without tipping the unit upside down, which would submerge the electronics, which are in the top of the fixture. I have a feeling the water will continue to accumulate until it reaches the top and kills the light. So, I still really like the design and performance of these lights, but it appears that you can't expect more than a season. I hope they fix the Quality Control issues.

"There are a number of places around the house where I need just a little light for a brief time, like when going into the garage to empty the trash, or coming in through the walk-out basement door on the way upstairs. In those cases it often feels wasteful to flip on a light switch that lights up the whole room (garage/basement), especially given that both are lit with fluorescent shop lights, which use a lot of power on start-up and don't like being turned on and off frequently. Also, my hands are often full or filthy. These sensor lights solved the problem. I just plugged one into each wall outlet near the garage and basement doors. They can be pointed right at the door, which in my experience has made the motion sensor wicked sensitive. The light turns on instantly when I open or approach the door, then turns off again about half a minute after I leave the space. The LEDs put out a lot of light for 5w, and the standby motion sensing mode uses minimal power (a fraction of a watt). This is a really slick solution for spaces where you want spot lighting that turns on and off automatically.I previously had bought a couple of very similar looking Mudder brand sensor lights. The Mudder lights are a more intense cool white light (6000K), like a cool white fluorescent, whereas these Bessky lights are a warmer white (2700K), more like an incandescent bulb. Given how I'm using them, I actually prefer the cooler white lights, but these Bessky lights were a quarter the price of the Mudder lights, so I'm more than happy with the warmer white. They did take a few weeks to arrive, having been shipped regular post from China, but for 75% savings over the Prime-eligible lights I ordered earlier I was willing to wait a few weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YS8DFC51RFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P61FC8I#wasThisHelpful","R10YS8DFC51RFG","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adding one of these packets to a liter of water really is like squeezing in a couple of lemon wedges. After years of drinking lemon seltzer water, I'd gotten used to artificial lemon flavor. It was a delight to remember how much better and fresher real lemon tastes, without the hassle and expense of keeping and cutting up actual lemons. We use one packet per SodaStream bottle. True Lemon is significantly cheaper than the lemon/line/orange essences sold by SodaStream, it tastes better, and it's easier to get consistent flavor. We also add True Lemon to regular uncarbonated water. We use two packets per half-gallon jug of water. It provides a beverage that's tastier than plain water but without all the sugar and calories of juices or sodas. This company also sells Lime and Orange packets. We've tried all three flavors and really like them. The lemon and lime flavors are great when mixed, one packet of each in a half gallon of water. This is one of those products that's so good, so simple, and so inexpensive that we actually tell friends about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M1SFPCQO9R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RZ63KK#wasThisHelpful","R12M1SFPCQO9R5","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an outstanding lighting product. It comes in and out of availability on Amazon, so you may have to check back regularly, or go direct to the site of one of the Marketplace vendors, like Energy Saving Lighting (I've bought from them both direct and via Amazon).This Philips LED light basically allows you to install what looks like a recessed light with diffuser into a location that's wired for a light fixture. It wires direction into the junction box that the light fixture used to be wired into. LEDs are mounted across the disc, and because LEDs are very thin, the whole fixture only sticks out about half an inch from the ceiling. Once installed, it looks like it's a recessed light with a diffuser, even though it's really just a half-inch-thick LED light disc, rather than a recessed light that sticks up into the ceiling.The light is is very even. I can't tell there are individual LEDs mounted on the disc even when I look directly at it. The light is quite bright -- to my eye, it seems to create about the same brightness as a 75-100w light in a recessed can. The light is more directional than a flush-mount fixture, since there's little light cast to the side. The down-light effect works great in the hallway locations where I've installed them.Installation was a breeze. I installed two in our hallway (including removing the old, heavy flush-mount fixtures) in about 20 minutes. To install, you fit a mounting plate onto your junction box, connect three wires (black, white, ground), then push the fixture up onto the mounting plate. The wires and LED driver tuck up into the junction box. The fixture is held onto the mounting plate by a couple of spring steel clips. The fixture is extremely light, so installing is considerably easier than with old-fashioned fixtures.The fixture draws only about 12w and runs significantly cooler than a traditional fixture with a couple of 60w bulbs, so it doesn't need all the layers of insulation that old flush-mount fixtures have. And since it's almost completely flush with the ceiling, it makes our hallway ceilings look higher. Best of all, because it uses so little electricity, I don't have to feel guilty about leaving the hallway lights on, which is nice for both safety and comfort.I initially bought two of these for a downstairs hallway, but have subsequently ordered five more for other locations. I've long wanted to replace the flush mount ceiling light fixtures around our house, but installing recessed lights was too much of a hassle. This light does the same thing without the hassle, and it has the added benefit of using about 80% less electricity. I normally don't get too excited about lighting products, but the engineers at Philips really did come up with a great innovation when they dreamed up this LED fixture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360YZUHEEUP2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVEM92O#wasThisHelpful","R360YZUHEEUP2K","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hat is a good design (reminds me of the ""Flap Happy"" hats our young kids used to wear to the beach). You won't get a sunburnt face, ears, or neck. It has good ventilation panels, and the material seems both lightweight and likely to be durable. And the price is great -- less than that of a cheap baseball cap.On the downside, the hat runs quite small, and one size definitely does not fit all. I wear a men's large hat (not an XL), and this hat was painfully tight. My wife wears a much smaller hat size, and this hat was a good to snug fit on her. [Update: I just checked the tag inside the hat and it says S/M, not one-size-fits-most, so the product label is right but the product description on Amazon is not. In fact, it runs on the small side of medium, as the product tag of S/M would indicate.]In terms of quality, the material is good, but there were a couple of missed/broken stitches around the brim of the hat. Those threads will work loose before there time and shorten the life of the hat. Also, the cord and clip that keep the hat from being lost if it blows off were not included. They're clearly shown in the product photo, but they weren't on the hat or in the box. Another customer noted the missing retainer strap, so it doesn't seem like this was a one-time accidental omission.Bottom line: Good design. Quality is not great but is OK, in line with price. Product is not as advertised (missing strap), which may or may not matter to you. But most important of all, the hat runs small, only up to about a men's M. ""One size fits most"" is always risky, and one-size hats rarely fit XL, but this hat runs particularly small for a one-size hat and is very, very tight if you normally wear even a L.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVKOOT7S9VVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PKR93Q#wasThisHelpful","R2JVKOOT7S9VVO","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While watching this movie, I felt the same sense I used to have when watching the original Twilight Zone episodes back in the day. A very good short story (one with unanticipated twists and turns), turned into a simple screen play (one that could be filmed on a handful of simple sets, with not a hint of computer generated imagery), cast with well-known actors playing character roles. Add to that the emotional drama of tortured souls who want the world to be better, and the extra twists and turns allowed by a feature length film, and you have a genuinely captivating movie.Don't get me wrong -- I've enjoyed Transformers, Avengers, etc. But after a decade of computer generated battle scenes, I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed old-fashioned science fiction story telling and stage-style acting. It was a genuine treat.The movie is slower paced than action adventure flicks, especially up front, and there's not a radical new time travel twist here. What you will find is a good story, that follows an arc you probably didn't expect. And you'll feel the angst of the characters, and understand and believe how their loves and turmoils drive the actions that propel the story to its surprising end.I wish the industry were producing more movies like this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5BS0XN7SAXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNPH244#wasThisHelpful","R1P5BS0XN7SAXT","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had pretty good luck with this Scotts grass seed. Each seed is covered with a coating that provides a bit of starter fertilizer, prevents fungus, and holds a bit of moisture to the seed. It's not a miracle product, meaning you still have to water the new seed regularly, meaning every day. But it is a slightly more forgiving product, meaning that the seeds are more likely to survive if you're half a day late watering, or if you get an unexpectedly warm/sunny day during the sprouting period. The downside of this coating technology is that you only get about half as much actual seed per pound, since half the weight is in the coating. But having used a wide variety of both uncoated and coated seeds over the past 15 years, I'm convinced that my success rate is at least 2x better with these Scotts coated seeds, so I still think they're more efficient in terms of end product. Given my work schedule and the unpredictability of our weather, it's hard for me to keep seeds constantly damp for two weeks, so these coated seeds raise my odds of actually turning seeds into grass, which makes them worth the premium. If you're able to water your newly seeded areas a couple of times a day, regular uncoated seeds may be a better deal for you.In terms of specific mixes, I've had good luck with Scott's Northeast Mix. It filled in thin areas nicely when I used it for overseeding.

"This is a Tale of Two Products ...First, there is the tale of physical installation, which was a royal pain. The space between the mounting plate and the unit is negligible, so all of the wiring (and I do mean ALL of the wiring) had to be stuffed back into the hole in my wall, the one the doorbell wire was poking through. That was easier said than done, since the hole was just wide enough for the doorbell wire and wouldn't accommodate the crimp-on connectors that came with the SkyBell or the extra wires from the SkyBell. I had to widen the hole, cut off the SkyBell connectors, work up an alternative connection solution, etc., etc. All told, physical installation took a couple hours, most of which involved figuring out workaround solutions, whereas just installing a simple doorbell button is usually a five minute project.Once the physical installation was complete, though, the tale of the second city emerged, and this city is a place of wonder. The SkyBell synced with my home network and my iPhone on the first try. Setup was absolutely seamless and took roughly a minute (maybe two at most). The universal app also loaded onto my iPad and worked perfectly first time. The installation instructions had all kinds of warnings about setting separate SSIDs on dual band routers, making sure my iPhone was on the 2.4 band, etc., but I just went ahead and started the sync without making any of those adjustments and it worked flawlessly on the first try. Maybe I got lucky, or maybe SkyBell has worked out some of the kinks reported by earlier users.In use, the SkyBell has exceeded my expectations, which is highly unusual for early generation home automation products. When someone rings the doorbell, the SkyBell rings the physical chime on the wall, and with only about a half-second delay it rings a doorbell sound on my iPhone. Establishing the video connection is fast and simple, and the two-way voice connection works great. The camera is very wide angle, and I can see all the way to bottom of my very long driveway, about 100-120 feet away. When the FedEx guy came this morning, the motion sensor ""rang"" the doorbell on my iPhone to let me know someone was there (which allowed me to get the package before it got soaked in the rain). And starting up a video feed on demand (without someone pressing the button or triggering the motion sensor ... basically using the SkyBell like a web cam) works great. In a nutshell, every feature of the SkyBell is working as advertised and better than I expected.I haven't used the SkyBell remotely yet (e.g., answering my home doorbell while at work, over an internet connection rather than being on the house wifi), so I can't evaluate that functionality. I'll post an update if I run into any issues.After I had read the installation instructions but before I started the installation, I had some questions about the wiring, since I wasn't sure whether my indoor doorbell chime would be compatible with the SkyBell. I submitted a question to SkyBell customer service via their website and received an answer very quickly (within an hour or so, as I recall). We exchanged a few more emails in rapid succession, and they answered my questions. Two thumbs up for quick and clear customer support.Bottom line:  I wish SkyBell had some old-fashioned home hardware folks on the team, since someone with experience in that market could improve the physical hardware design pretty easily (e.g., by designing in space to stuff the extra wire, as with any electrical fixture). But those are minor annoyances. The important parts of the product -- the camera, the app, two-way audio, the motion sensor functionality, the integration with the physical indoor chime -- work perfectly for me. Skybell has brought another dumb part of my house (the doorbell), into the wired age. Now I know who's at the door before I open it, I can hear the doorbell anywhere in the house (or yard), I can answer the door (at least virtually) when I'm traveling, I know when someone (e.g., FedEx, oil delivery, neighbor) stops by even if I'm not there, I can take a snapshot of whoever is at the door.I absolutely love this product. Sometimes I wait for later versions of a product. But the SkyBell v2.0 offers so much value right now that I'm really glad I bought it today. I may swap it out in a few years, just like I upgrade my phone every few years, but I'll absolutely get my money's worth during that time. This product is insanely cool and genuinely valuable.[And now a few suggestions for the SkyBell engineers, in case you read the Amazon reviews of your product:1) To avoid ""ringing"" the app every time someone walks past the doorbell, you've built a timer into the software, so the SkyBell only sends a notification if someone is in front of the SkyBell for 10 seconds. I wish the delay were a user-adjustable parameter. We live in a very quiet area, so it's rare for people to wander by, so the 10-second delay isn't really needed. And our UPS driver drops and goes so fast that the SkyBell doesn't register him, since he's in and out in under 10 seconds. I'd like to be able to adjust the delay to suit my needs.2) Since installing the SkyBell, there seems to be a consistent faint hum from my wall-mounted doorbell chime. It seems that the SkyBell must keep the circuit always closed, with the resulting hum. It's very faint, and no big deal; I just thought this feedback from the field my be useful to your engineers as you refine the product.3) Please add space inside the case, between the SkyBell and the mounting plate, for a bit of excess wire. See above. It would make installation easier for more homeowners.4) You know that ridiculously tiny set screw that needs to be screwed in to secure the unit as the last step of installation? Well, it's ridiculously tiny. It would be fine if this were a consumer electronics product. But that screw has to be installed outside, in the sun and wind, over a driveway or porch or grass. It's hard to get into place (it wasn't pre-installed, as the instructions said, but rather loose in the parts bag), easy to drop, and impossible to find if you do drop it. Need a better solution on v3.0.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPSIO9DBJ3TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PV7WI1Q#wasThisHelpful","R2IPSIO9DBJ3TR","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most of the other reviewers, I received a free Workshop WS0610VA for review. Until I received this new unit, I was still using the hold ShopVac I bought with my first house, close to thirty years ago. The old ShopVac was still running, so I never thought seriously about replacing it. Having now seen how much wet/dry shop vacuums have improved over the past three decades, I regret not having replaced the old warhorse sooner.Positives of the WORKSHOP WS0610VA:+ Good size for home shop use. About half the size of my old ShopVac, which is optimal for home use.+ Good ergonomics. Wide base relative to height, so it doesn't tip easily. Casters glide well. Top mounted handle is very convenient. Ability to store tools on the unit (they slide into fittings on top of the caster feet) is great -- I wouldn't store the tools there while the vacuum is in use, but it's very convenient to be able to store everything together when I put the vacuum away.+ Cord length is good for home use. My old vac had a super long hose, which I actually found unwieldy. 10' is right for my workshop.+ It's still loud, but a bit quieter than my old shop vac (which sounded like an old 727 at takeoff).+ The pleated filter plus filter bag do a very good job of filtration. When collecting fine particulates (like plaster dust) I like being able to just pull out the bag, rather than dumping the bin into the trash and creating a secondary dust cloud. On an open job site, it would be different. But for home use, the bag is a real plus.+ The hose is large diameter, like my old vac.+ The attachment clips are more secure than my old vac (which used friction-only connections, which came loose at all the wrong times).Shortfalls:- You need to buy a separate filter if you plan to suck up more than a minimal amount of water. The wet filter should be included if this is marketed as a wet/dry vac ... and even if it isn't, since everyone expects a shop vac to work for dry or wet.- The unit comes with the bare minimum of tools -- just the extension wand and one floor nozzle. At a minimum, it should come with a brush attachment.Bottom line: I'm very pleased with the WORKSHOP WS0610VA as a home shop vac. It's a good design and the right size for a small home shop like mine, with excellent filtration options for both sawdust and finer particles like plaster dust. It does not come with what should be standard equipment, like a wet filter and a brush attachment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLV5UWSGBTD6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKJGLNC#wasThisHelpful","RLV5UWSGBTD6Q","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate sunscreen. It seems that there's the choice between greasy and sticky, and I hate the feel of both. Also, the smell of many sunscreen lotions is like a coconut supernova. I wear a wide-brimmed hat and a long-sleeved fishing shirt outdoors so that I don't have to wear sunscreen. Having said that, there are times when it's not practical to stay covered up, and in those situations I'm grateful to Neutrogena for creating this product. It's a sport formulation, so it provides lasting protection, but it's a nice creamy lotion that doesn't feel greasy or sticky. It works into the skin like a simple moisturizing lotion. I'm not sure how they did it, but it works and feels great. Also, the fragrance is very mild and doesn't scream ""I'm covered in sunscreen here!"" Last, but certainly not least, it hasn't caused any skin reactions. Hands down, this is the best feeling, least smelly, easiest on my skin sunscreen I've found in the past thirty years.

"This is a good light-duty backpack.  It has enough room for a good four-inch stack of homework or business work, a single padded laptop slot that handles my 13"" Lenovo with room to spare, and three separate areas for chargers, gadgets, etc.  Like all Targus packs, the space is well thought through for handling the stuff you're likely to carry for school or business.  The material is heavy duty, the stitching is even, the zippers are good quality, and overall construction is what I'd expect from Targus.On the downside, the straps are thinner and not as well padded as on my preferred backpacks.  And the back, while padded, doesn't have a mesh cover of the type that's become fairly standard on more expensive packs.  The combination of these two factors means that I wouldn't use this backpack every day for carrying heavier loads or for longer durations.  Also, the pack has just one device slot, for a laptop -- a second padded area for a tablet would have been nice.  The storm flap around the zipper is a nice touch if you'll be walking in the rain, but it also makes it more cumbersome to zip the pack open and shut in everyday use.  One upside of the lighter construction is that the pack is quite lightweight.The bottom line is that this case offers good value and quality for it's price.  In fact, a bit more quality than I expected at this price.  But I wouldn't use it to carry heavy loads for long periods on a daily basis.  It's destined to become my ""side trip"" pack -- something to use when I want a light pack to carry some but not all of the stuff in my regular pack (e.g., for weekend trips).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6U47KQCID2V4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IW0HJC#wasThisHelpful","R6U47KQCID2V4","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I put this bag through its paces during a week of cycling in Maine then another week along the seashore in southern New England.  The bag exceeded expectations.  It's not fancy, and didn't win me any points for being the coolest bit of biking gear.  But it's very well designed and offers great functionality and value at a low price compared to what was available in the local bike store.  Specifically:+ The size is perfect for day trips when the weather is changeable.  I stuffed in a rain jacket, rain pants, an extra jersey, and an extra pair of shorts in the main compartment.  The side compartments held stuff I bought along the way, and the velcro-sealed pouch on the end held my good-sized first aid kit.+ The shape really works.  The rounded ends are very smart.  One tucks under the seat (I'm short, and I don't have as much seat post showing as in their product picture), and the sloped back end provides just a bit extra clearance when swinging my leg over the back of the bike.+ It installed easily, with two big velcro straps on the bottom.+ The bag washed off nicely with a hose after it got caked in mud during one particularly fun ride.Well designed, and a super value at a modest price compared to many bike bags.

"Given how often we lose power, and how long it stays out, we have lot's of solar powered lights.  For durability, functionality, speed of charging, and hours of light, my favorites are the lantern and task light from d.light.  However, the d.light products are rigid, so although they're great for home use, they're not so good for travel.  That's where this Hallomall solar light really shines.  The Hallomall light is basically a cylindrical beach ball with a solar panel, battery, and LEDs embedded in the disk at one end.  When filled with air it's about the size of two rolls of duct tape stacked one atop the other.  When deflated, though, it's only about half an inch thick.  At just 3.4 ounces, it's also feather light compared to most alternatives.The light is surprisingly bright.  On the dim setting, it easily lit a 20x30 foot space enough that we could move around and work.  On the bright setting, it pumped out enough light that several of us could read at the same time.  In other words, its coverage area and intensity are quite impressive.  I can't attest to how many hours of light it puts out, since I haven't run it all the way down before recharging.The vinyl seems to be pretty thick, so I'm optimistic that this product will hold up well.  Time will tell.  There are vinyl grab straps fused to both faces, presumably so that you can hang it on the outside of your backpack and charge while hiking.  I'm not sure I'd trust the vinyl straps in rough conditions.This product seems to be a knock-off of the Luci solar light.  I like to reward innovators, but in this case I bought the knock off since it seemed to offer better features/functionality in several areas:1) The vinyl is stamped with a prismatic pattern that does a very good job of diffracting and smoothing the light from the LEDs without decreasing brightness.  Reminds me of the lenses in old New England lighthouses.2) The rated lumens are higher (80 vs 65 at the time I bought).3) The Hallomall base product includes high, low, and flashing settings.  With Luci, you have to buy a different (more expensive) model to get flashing.A number of reviewers have commented on the inflation nozzle.  It's the same as on kids toys or air mattresses.  It has a flap to prevent air from blowing back out when you're not blowing in, so you have to pinch the nozzle when blowing in (to open the flap).  I didn't have to puncture anything the first time.  Even easier, if you just pinch the nozzle and gently pull the two ends apart (like an accordion), the lantern will self inflate 90% of the way, which keeps the moisture from your breath out of the cylinder.My primary use for this product isn't backpacking or camping, it's traveling to countries where there are frequent power outages.  During a business trip to India, we lost power four or five times a day.  The conference room we were meeting in had no windows, so it went pitch black during the outages.  In settings like that, having this little three-ounce wonder in the briefcase is really handy.Bottom Line: This product is worth every penny of the fifteen bucks I spent on it.  I plan to buy a few more to give to family and colleagues.  Seriously, every house should have one for emergencies, and every international traveler should stuff one in the travel pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8VYM9QPYU43P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MG7I732#wasThisHelpful","R8VYM9QPYU43P","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Note: This review is a transcription of an interview with my eight-year old niece, who is the primary user of the seat.  She's also the one who set the rating, at four stars.)  (Second Note: I received this seat for free through Amazon's Vine program so that I could review it.  I liked it enough that I just ordered and paid for a second seat to give to a relative.)""I like this seat because you can move it around.  It isn't heavy like my other booster seat so I don't have to lug it around.  It feels like I'm not in a booster seat because it isn't on my back like some seats that come up over your back and near your head.  It's like I don't even have a booster seat.""""I really liked how it worked because it wasn't hard to use.  You don't have to do a lot of things.  With my other booster seat you have to do more stuff.  With this one you just have to put it down basically.""  [Editor's Note: You also have to fasten the side clips around the seat belt for proper installation, but it's a very simple task given the seat design.]""It's comfortable.""And now, in my own words:  This is a good seat for aunts, uncles, and others who intermittently transport younger relatives who aren't quite big enough to ride safely with just the regular car belts.  It's much lighter weight than most full booster seats, so it's easy to move around; it's very low profile, so it's easy to store; and it's simple and easy to install, so you can pop it in place quickly when needed.  Importantly, this is a minimalist seat, for older youngsters who are just under the height limit and need a ""positioning"" seat for safety but don't need a full ""booster"" seat.  For youngsters in this range (and for the aunts and uncles who occasionally drive them), this is a convenient solution.  If you have a younger/smaller child, want more ""lift"", and plan to leave the seat permanently installed, you may prefer a more traditional booster seat, but for our needs this is a very good solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REKLS1UWG929P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FLXBHIU#wasThisHelpful","REKLS1UWG929P","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good niche product for specialized situations when you need a ruggedized (water and impact resistant) auxiliary battery.  The case is rugged rubber.  It adds a good deal of shock absorption in case of drops.  It also adds a bit of thickness relative to other 6000 mAh batteries, but surprisingly not a lot of weight.  The input and output ports are sealed with rubber flaps.  I don't know that they would protect the battery if it were totally immersed in water, but they're more than sufficient to seal the ports if you get caught in a downpour.The battery charges quickly with a standard iPad (2.1 amp) charger.  I had less luck charging the battery with backpacking style solar panels.  The battery comes with about a 50% charge.  I tried hooking it up to a Nomad 7 solar panel (two panels) and an Instapark Mercury 10 panel (3 panel).  Both panels connected fine and caused the battery to show that it was charging (the next LED, for 75% charge, started blinking).  But neither panel was able to bump the battery charge indicator up to the next level.  On the days of my tests, it was sunny but with big puffy clouds, so the sunshine came and went.  I wonder whether this battery is like an iPad, which requires a more constant input from its charging source, without cloud interruptions.When it comes to dumping power back into phones and tablets, the NOCO battery performs well.  It charged my iPhone 5s from 45% to 95% in an hour and five minutes.  It took another half hour to punch it up from 95% to 100%, but that's fairly standard and mimics charge time with a wall charger.  Charging my iPhone 5s from 45% to 95% didn't appreciably drain the XGB6 -- it was still showing 100% charged after filling the iPhone, which supports the product claim of being able to charge a smartphone several times.The 6000mAh capacity of the battery is not quite sufficient to deliver a full charge to my iPad Air, but it does fill it up enough to get a good day's work done.The built-in LED ""glow light"" is a nice touch.  It won't throw a beam down a dark trail, but it is more than sufficient to find things in a tent or in a car.The battery instructions are a bit quirky (I don't understand why they designed the battery so that it has to be ""turned on"" with a power switch before charging a device).  It's worth trying the battery when you first get it, rather than trying to figure it out in the dark woods or in an emergency.The battery is pretty expensive for a 6000 mAh external battery.  If you don't need the ruggedized, water resistant case, you can get smaller, cheaper batteries with higher capacities.  This battery is really designed for specialized applications where the battery will receive rough treatment or be subjected to wet weather.  Unless your phone/tablet are also in ruggedized, water resistant cases, having a rugged battery may not make much sense.Bottom Line:  Good solid battery for specialized situations where you need a rugged battery.  Didn't play well with my backpacking solar panels, but otherwise performed admirably.  Expensive if you don't need the ruggedness.  Four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MOF3TKQQZBIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36Y2M6#wasThisHelpful","R2MOF3TKQQZBIS","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of OXO products, and for years their 4"" paring knife has been one of my most heavily used kitchen knives, so I was eager to try this 6"" utility knife (disclosure: I received the knife at no cost for evaluation).  The 6"" utility knife has the signature OXO design, meaning there's a heavy emphasis on ergonomics.  The handle is very comfortably contoured, and it's covered in a rubber-like sheath that provides an extremely secure grip.  The metal between the handle and blade is shaped to protect your hand from the blade.  The design emphasizes safety and comfort -- little risk of this knife slipping, even when wet.The knife is heavier than I expected for a utility knife, weighing in at a bit over 4 ounces.  The blade is thicker and stiffer than I expected from a utility knife -- in use, it almost feels more like a narrow-bladed chef's knife than a typical thin blade utility knife.  For me, this is a positive, but if you're used to an Asian style flexible blade, this knife will seem heavy and stiff.  Like I said, it almost has more of the feel of a French knife.The blade is no-stain, but takes an edge.  Like my other OXO knife, I expect this knife to be in the sweet spot -- a little harder to put an edge on, since it's harder steel, but also requiring sharpening less often, since it's harder steel.  A very good balance for my use.The reason for four instead of five stars is the packaging.  The plastic packaging is the opposite of frustration free.  It was one of the harder plastic clamshell cases I've dealt with in quite a while, and I really feared I was going to slice my fingers trying to get it open.  It may seem harsh to subtract a star for packaging, but the whole point of OXO is comfort and safety, and I wouldn't give the product in this package to my elderly parents.Bottom line:  Excellent, sturdy, durable knife designed for comfort and safety ... but in a package that's the antithesis of the wonderful knife.  OXO needs to apply their outstanding principles of product design to their package design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9O9RI7L3X3Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13ODO#wasThisHelpful","R9O9RI7L3X3Z7","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Used these this weekend to help my eldest child move into a new apartment.  We had to lash mattresses to the top of my RAV4.  The straps are long enough to wrap around two twin mattresses and the roof rack easily.  The spring-loaded latch made it very easy to cinch the straps very tight, and equally easy to unfasten when we arrived.  Much, much faster than trying to tie the mattress down with rope.  Nothing shifted during our ride.  Every car should have a pair of these straps in the trunk.  Beats having a knot slip and watching the mattress fly loose on the highway.The straps that came with my Thule kayak carriers have fancy rubber covers over the metal buckles.  These straps don't (and they're also much cheaper), so when positioning make sure to keep the metal buckle up away from the car's finish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35P8ZY21TF2D8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQLVKG#wasThisHelpful","R35P8ZY21TF2D8","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried a number of sensor systems for monitoring my household environment (temperature, humidity, and water leaks) when I'm gone for extended periods.  I haven't found any perfect system, but the Wally system is definitely the best I've found.  After several months of use, I've found ways to work around the system's shortcomings and it's become my default system for home environment monitoring.[Important Update: In my initial review, which was posted after a month or two of use, I noted that I was having trouble making reliable connections.  I think I found out why.  I had some repair work done in the basement shortly after setting up the Wally system.  Apparently the electrician unplugged the Wally hub from the ""dumb"" extension strip and plugged it into a power strip that has a surge suppressor.  I just noticed this yesterday.  Since the hub was taken off the surge suppressor and plugged into a regular extension cord, the performance has been close to flawless.  The sensors still have to be ""near"" house wiring, but ""near"" can be several paces away from any obvious outlets.  This is a huge improvement, and I'm raising my rating from to five stars.  The Wally manual says to avoid plugging the hub into a power strip with surge suppression, and they mean it.  Now, back to the original review ...]Strengths:+ Exceptional battery life.  Most other sensors either have to be plugged in or chew through batteries.  My Quirky+GE Spotter sensor, for example, chews through batteries, and the Spotter is designed to turn off half the sensor functions unless it's plugged into an A/C adapter.+ Design.  The sensors are very small (about the size of a credit card and about as thick as my iPhone) and have a nice, unobtrusive shape.  They can be tucked away almost anywhere.+ Setup.  Adding a sensor via the web interface or iPhone app is trivially simple, as long as the sensor can get can communicate with the hub.+ Accuracy.  The readings match well with my regular thermometer and hygrometer.+ Interface.  The sensors feed data to both an app and also to a web site that can be accessed with any browser.  The web page and app both have a very clean, intuitive, easy-to-use interface.  Also, very importantly, Wally is clearly investing continuously in the web dashboard and app.  They have pushed several updates to the app, and the latest web site design is outstanding.+ Connectedness.  Alerts are easy to customize and can be sent to smartphone or email.  Most leak sensors just sound a buzzer on the device if they they detect water, which doesn't do any good if you're not home.  Others work only with a dedicated app or send text messages to only one phone.  Wally wins for flexibility; it pushes alerts and email notices, and you can pull status information from any browser on any device.+ Intelligence.  The website/app don't just display current readings, they also store a year's worth of history, so you can track conditions over time in problem locations (e.g., to see what times of year a basement space is prone to high humidity).+ The conditions that trigger an alert (e.g., high and low boundaries for humidity) can be customized for each sensor, and the system pushes three types of alerts (email, alert notifications via the smartphone app, and alert badges on the monitoring dashboard) when conditions go outside the bounds you set.  Very customizable to avoid false alarms, and the redundant alerts raise the odds you'll know about a real problem quickly.+ You can add sensors and they all report through the common dashboard and app.Weaknesses:- Wally's ""special sauce"" is that it sends signals through house wires, rather than having to maintain a high-powered wifi connection (which is how the sensors get such great battery life).  My guess is that whether you are satisfied or not with this system will depend on whether you need to put a sensor in a specific location that doesn't have any house wires nearby.  [As mentioned in the update, my ""problem locations"" are all now communicating with the hub just fine, once I plugged the Wally hub directly into a dumb extension cord rather than into a power strip with a surge suppressor.]- Part of Wally's value proposition is that it doesn't just measure and display your temperature, humidity, etc., it also analyzes the data.  For example, they say they'll send me a message if conditions in my home suggest I might have a problem with mold, and will even suggest contractors who might help.  That could be helpful, but I'm guessing this is also part of their model for making money.  I wish they would give me control over my data and what stays strictly private.[UPDATE Summer 2014:  We were away for a week, visiting the parents.  While we were away, I started receiving alerts from the Wally sensors, saying that the temperature and humidity were above their ranges.  I thought the system was glitching, since this was my first summer after installing the sensors.  When we got home, we found that a mouse had gotten into the air conditioner, chewed on the wires, and shorted out the system.  We got home late Friday afternoon and weren't able to get repair service until Monday, and it was a very hot and humid weekend.  If I'd believed the Wally sensors, I could have called the repair guy from my folks' house and had the system up and running again before we got home.  I should have trusted the sensor system.][UPDATE Spring 2015:  The Wally sensor system just paid for itself!  We had just left for a weekend getaway when I received an alert on my phone, saying that a Wally sensor in the basement near the water tank had detected a water leak.  I had never received a false leak alert, so I turned the car around and headed back home to check.  Sure enough, there was a fresh and growing puddle on the basement floor.  I was able to identify the source of the leak, do a quick temporary repair, and arrange for a plumber to come on Monday to do a permanent repair.  The leak was spraying out water at a pretty good rate.  If it hadn't been for Wally, we would have come home from our weekend vacation to find a flooded basement.  Traditional water sensors (the kind that sound an alarm when they get wet) wouldn't have done any good, since there wouldn't have been anyone home to hear the alarm.  Thanks, SNUPI/Wally, I owe you guys.][SPECIAL NOTE FOR ANYONE HAVING CONNECTION ISSUES:  Back when my Wally hub was plugged into a surge strip and I was having troubles with connectivity, I fiddled around until I could make connections under the worst of circumstances, and I thought it might be helpful to share my workaround.  For example, before I figured out the surge suppressor issue, I was having trouble getting signals from two of the sensors in my basement, relatively far from any house wires (there are only two outlets in the basement).  So I took a heavy gauge 25' extension cord and ran it from a wall outlet straight across the basement floor.  Then I put the Wally sensors along the extension cord.  It wasn't a first-best solution, but the sensors reliably and continuously sent data even when the Wally hub was being blocked by the surge suppressor.  Nothing was plugged into the extension cord, so I just fastened the open end up high on the opposite basement wall, so there wouldn't be a problem if there was a water leak in the basement.  If you're having troubles with dead zones, and if you've already made sure your Wally Hub isn't plugged into a surge strip, then this might be a workaround for you.]Bottom Line:  Unobtrusive sensors (beautiful design).  Extreme battery life.  Accurate readings.  Excellent alerts.  Great reporting interface.  Excellent smartphone app.  This is what a home sensor system should look like and work like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16EJY0UT3P23B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDI510M#wasThisHelpful","R16EJY0UT3P23B","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I saw a demo of this product at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.  That's how cool this product is -- Apple gave them airtime at their big conference to show off the product.  The technology is very impressive and showcases the convergence of real and virtual gaming.  The cars are much more than updated slot cars in two ways.  First, the cars are really Software Defined Race Cars, meaning the attributes of the cars are defined by software, not built-in and fixed.  As you race the cars, you can level up and add capabilities, just like in a computer games.  Second, the cars can be autonomously controlled by their own software, meaning that some of the cars on the track are competing on their own, rather than being driven by other players.  Insanely cool.The downside of the product is that once you get past the initial feeling of ""Wow, this is amazing technology,"" the fun of the racing game wears off.  The racing game should get more engaging as you level up the cars, but the overall range of functionality is pretty limited compared to completely virtual computer games, and the novelty of a virtual/real hybrid isn't strong enough to keep it really interesting.  Also, the game takes up floor space and requires that all players have iPhones/iPads to play.  My college-age son spends many hours gaming online, but this race-car set pretty much stayed in the box this summer after the initial novelty wore off.Bottom line:  This game showcases some amazingly cool technology, and virtual/real hybrid games will probably become increasingly popular, but this early example offers limited entertainment for gaming/toy dollar in its initial form and at its current price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T21G4ECFNN05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6MWM1Q#wasThisHelpful","R1T21G4ECFNN05","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These bags are AWESOME for moving and for car vacations.  Basically the bag is just a lightweight tarp fabric sewn into the form of a bag with two sets of handles (one long, one short).  We recently used this set of five bags for a family vacation that involved only driving, no flying.  Instead of messing with luggage or boxes, each person got one blue bag.  The bags are much roomier than our usual luggage and duffel bags -- each one holds about twice as much as a standard laundry basket, and easily held a week's worth of clothes, biking gear, hiking gear, etc. for each person.I've also been using them to help the kids move into new apartments.  They're much better than boxes for two reasons.  First, they're flexible and can be filled beyond the top.  Second, the handles make moving so much easier.  When hauling stuff up five flights of steps, I find it much easier to carry bags at my sides than to carry a box up at chest height -- the box is harder to grab and it blocks my view of the steps.  Also, I can carry two bags at once.  Last, but not least, they fold down and take up almost no space when not in use, so I can leave a set with the kids for future moves (unlike boxes, which are a pain to store, even when torn down).The handle design is great.  There are actually two sets of handles on each bag.  One set is short, for carrying the bag in your hands.  The other longer set can be used like a shoulder strap, for carrying the bag up high.The material is plenty durable for everyday use.  I wouldn't drag it over gravel (it wouldn't survive the abrasion), but it has no problem carrying heavy loads (excellent strength).  I expect them to last for years, but not forever.  Given how cheap they are, I plan to buy another set for when these wear out -- I expect two sets to last until well after I'm too old to lift them any more.These bags are a tote design, with an open top.  There's a different model that has six sides and zips closed, but it's five times more expensive.  The fabric is sturdy enough to stand up when packed, but the sides will flop over when it's empty.Never thought I'd get excited about super-sized totes sewn out of tarp fabric, but these things are incredibly handy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SGX6Z5XVFZGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BSRQ0S#wasThisHelpful","R3SGX6Z5XVFZGV","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Canari liners are made from a good durable fabric, the sizing is good (and the fabric stretches), and have good grippers at the bottoms of the legs.  The gel liner is not as thick as I'd like, but it absorbs impact pretty well for its thickness.  The seams where the liner is sewed to the shorts are the weak link in this liner.  The seams are rough and they chafe.  For me, that's not a huge negative, since I usually wear a pair of ExOfficio boxer briefs under the liner; but worn against skin those seams could create real problems.

"One of the great joys of living in the e-book age is easy access to the writing of a wide variety of new authors.  Based on the number of great reviews for this author, I decided to give her novel a try.  I read most of the book while sitting on our porch in Maine, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The writing is both engaging and technically proficient (unlike many non-edited works), the characters are well developed (I had no trouble keeping them straight, since each has a distinct and memorable personality), and the plot development hits the sweet spot of being complex and intriguing without being convoluted.  The plot, with its layers and deceptions, reminds me in some ways of Asimov's classic Foundation series, or, more recently, some of Peter Hamilton's epics.  The novel creates a rich, engaging, intriguing world.At one point in the story, a character exclaims ""This isn't a romance novel.""  It's an amusing self-referential nod from the author, since the novel is definitely (in addition to being a well crafted sci fi story) a romance novel.  The romance novel aspect of this book was dialed up a bit too high for my taste, and was the one area where the writer's style was too repetitious and formulaic (I noted 42 passages about Caleb's eyes, before I stopped counting, and at least an equal number of references to his evil grin and quirky smile).  Almost cost a star, but that's my preference.This author has the vision to create a rich story and the technical writing skill to tell it.  This was one of my favorite novels of the summer -- along with works from Hugh Howey (Silo, Sand), Lee Doty (Out of the Black), and David Weber (Dahak) -- and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel (yes, as you can guess from the fact that this novel has ""Book One"" in the title, the story is really just ramping up by the last page).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGO675LPE250/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J709RIK#wasThisHelpful","R1BGO675LPE250","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed a rear rack for a week-long bicycle tour on fire roads and carriage trails in New England.  This rack was a fraction of the cost of other models, and I liked the simplicity of a rack that simply clamped around the seat post, since I wasn't sure which other racks would fit on my ten year old mountain bike.  The only thing that gave me pause was the number of reviewers who complained about the rack not fitting snugly on the seat and as a result sliding around.  On my mountain bike, I used two of the plastic sleeves and tightened the clamp using my regular bike Allen wrench tool, which has about a 4"" handle and provides some leverage.  The rack clamped easily and tightly around the seat post and doesn't move at all, either up and down or side to side.  I've done some rides on bumpier hiking trails with roots and rocks, and the rack hasn't budged from where I clamped it.  So, although you'll still need to take into consideration the experience of others, on my bike this rack was easy to install, is solid as a rock, and has provided a very cheap solution to carrying an extra gear bag in the rear.  Very happy with the Schwinn rear rack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25P74CM2BO88O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030RS5CA#wasThisHelpful","R25P74CM2BO88O","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading the wide variety of reviews on this product (from one to five stars), I wasn't sure what to make of it.  But it was fairly cheap, and I needed a solution for carrying my iPhone 5s on my Raleigh mountain bike, so I gave it a try.  It works great.  The iPhone 5s fits perfectly in the case -- snug, so it doesn't move around, but very easy to insert and remove.  The top plastic layer works with the iPhone's capacitive touch screen, so you can use the phone right through the plastic, without removing it from the case.  The velcro straps fit perfectly around the frame of my ten-year old Raleigh mountain bike and the pack stayed firmly in place through a 25 mile trail ride -- no wiggle or shifting at all.I'd been looking for something like this that would protect my iPhone while riding.  Popping it in the handlebar pack would subject it to too much pounding on aggressive rides, and putting it in my jersey pocket would subject it to too much sweat.  Also, I like to be able to check the phone easily when it chimes, rather than having to dig it out.  This pack works perfectly on all counts.  The phone sits in a suspension cradle with the case sides providing lots of shock absorption, and the phone is completely visible and usable right in the case.  As a bonus, I can stuff my ID and a couple of energy bars inside the case.Based on my own experience, this is a five-star product, hands down.  I think the variation in reviews probably has to do with the fact that people's phones and bikes vary a lot.  There are multiple sizes of this product available on Amazon, and I had to search to find the one that would exactly fit my 4.2"" iPhone 5s (the product titles use generic terms like ""large"" and ""larger"", so you have to read the detailed descriptions to find the right size for your phone).  Also, if your bike has vary narrow tubes you might have to trim the velcro, and if you have one of the newer and more expensive bikes with very large, more flattened tubes, you might have to buy a few strips of velcro to use as ""extenders"" to fit around your frame.Bottom line:  If you pick the right size, and if your bike has a fairly standard frame, this is a great, super convenient product for protecting your phone and making it readily accessible during rides.  Wish I'd found it years ago.  It will be a permanent fixture on my mountain bike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NQWU0GSAQ78R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAKVXWI#wasThisHelpful","R3NQWU0GSAQ78R","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought a Surco spare tire bike rack, since it was a bit cheaper and got great reviews.  Unfortunately, the Surco won't fit on a 2006 or later RAV4, since Toyota added a small, semi-cylindrical tire support bracket on the spare tire mount.  I subsequently found that only a couple of spare tire racks have been re-engineered to work on vehicles that have a bracket on the spare tire mount.  Between the two leading contenders, from Thule and Yakima, I decided to go with the single-post Yakima.  I installed the rack yesterday.  Installation was very simple -- took about half an hour, and I could do it again (now that I'm familiar with the process) in about ten minutes.  The only tools you'll need are your tire iron to remove the spare and a hex key (included by Yakima) for optional adjustments.The rack comes with three different posts -- the piece that fits horizontally into the mounting bracket, and onto which the vertical bar mounts.  For my RAV4, I used the short post.  For bigger tires, there are medium and long posts.The Yakima rack is very sturdy, and the three-point tie-down system really holds the bikes securely.  My mountain bike didn't shift or sway at all on the drive to the trails.  It has a handy integrated lock loop, and Yakima includes a 5' locking cable to thread through your bikes (or you use your own).  The knob that screws the bike rack onto the mounting bracket also has a lock that prevents removal of the rack itself.  The rack lock and the cable lock use the same key, which is very convenient, and Yakima includes two keys.Bottom line:  Great design.  Sturdy construction.  Easy to use.  Looks good.  And, most importantly, is engineered to work with vehicles like my RAV4 that have support brackets on the spare tire mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P9UPZ2AFJWNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038QAKN0#wasThisHelpful","R3P9UPZ2AFJWNC","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I turned to this novel after finishing (and thoroughly enjoying) Howey's Silo saga.  This novel is quite different from the Silo series, showing Howey's versatility as an author.  It's a tighter, shorter, less sprawling story.  For those old enough to remember Golden Age sci fi, this novel felt like a modern channeling of Heinlein, Silverberg, etc.Early in the story, I feared it would be ""Lord of the Flies"" set on an unnamed planet.  Instead, a better comparison would be Heinlein's ""Tunnel in the Sky.""  The difference is that the underlying theme is one of hope, not despair, and the characters are teens who are becoming adults, rather than adolescents who are pretending to be.As usual, Howey's writing style is a joy.  With many Kindle sci-fi books (especially self published works), I read for the plot and little else.  In Howey's books, including this one, I find myself re-reading and highlighting passages just to enjoy the play of the words.  There's art in this man's writing.This is a memorable book.  More than a beach book, it will stick with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UG79IHU6MTPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QCIPGK#wasThisHelpful","R2UG79IHU6MTPN","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've been using these All Free and Clear pods for a couple of months now. They're super convenient. You just throw one of the packs in the washer. No measuring, no drips, and no standing the bottle upside down to drain out the last of the liquid. I thought pods were a goofy invention to solve a trivially minor inconvenience, but I have to confess that they've turned out to be a wonderful little bit of luxurious convenience when doing laundry. They've also been great for our kid at college. Instead of carrying a full jug of detergent to the laundry room in the dorm basement, he just carries one or two tiny pods. Again, super convenient.I bought this 84 load package because it's more convenient on the shelf than the smaller packages, which are just plastic bags. When the tub is empty, I'll probably refill it with whatever size package is cheapest.We like the Free and Clear detergent, either in pod form or in a bottle. It doesn't have any dyes or perfumes. Gets the clothes really clean without leaving a fragrance. Good for allergy sufferers, or those who just don't like fragrant clothes.The container arrived well packaged and in good shape.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MH8GB5DP997/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BISIW5S#wasThisHelpful","R7MH8GB5DP997","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read the complete Wool series over the past year, I had to try Sand.  The book does not disappoint.  Author Hugh Howey has an amazing ability to imagine and bring to life future worlds that occupy the uncanny valley.  Worlds that seem so familiar because the mundane machinery of life goes on, but that are disturbingly different because some aspect of the characters' world is fundamentally at odds with what we know on our Mother Earth.  In Sand, as in Wool, a sense of mystery and intrigue pervades the story, as we try to figure out how the world got this way.  But the real focus is on the people and how they live -- what the human condition looks like in this world on the other side of the looking glass.  This is what sets Sand apart from many typical dystopian novels.  The world of Sand may be bleak, but it's the world the people live in and have always known.  They actually live their lives, rather than simply being grist for the dystopian mill.  Last, but not least, Howey is a good writer.  I routinely find myself highlighting passages because they were so nicely crafted and styled ... not just words to advance the plot.As stated in the review title, this was a five-star book for me, even with what I saw as flaws.  I'm guessing the author will say these were choices, not flaws, but I wish that he had:- Eventually provided at least some explanation of how the world got to be the way it is in Sand.  Maybe Howey plans a prequel, like the Shift series before Wool.- Expanded more on the characters of Violet and Rob, both of whom were hinted to have extraordinary potential.  In the full omnibus, we receive little more than glimpses into these characters.  Maybe Howey is saving them for the sequel (again following the Wool model).I'm eager to know more about this world of Sand and how the characters fare.  I really, really hope that there will be another book or two to extend the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLNSJTX5JIRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSXGYCK#wasThisHelpful","ROLNSJTX5JIRS","A3NGOG8Z78AZSD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NGOG8Z78AZSD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Creepy is the best and most appropriate word to describe this movie.  I give it 4 stars not because it is an amazing movie, but because it is an amazing movie if you are sitting with the right person.  My movie date gets very frightened and that makes this a blast!  I have to admit a couple scenes made me jump as well.  It is hard to get good movies in this genre, and so much is rehashed and repetitive.  Not that different in this movie, but it is executed well, and it works.Setting is excellent, a farm in Illinois, where I wouldn't dare set foot, and the two young actors as the twins do an admirable job.Cast is decent:: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Robert Sloan, Dartanian Sloan and Lea Coco - but you will notice the missing star power of an Ethan Hawke.Director: Ciaran FoyWorth seeing, make sure to see it late at night.

"I struggled with whether to give this a 4 or 5 star rating (tough problems, I know!). I finally ended up with a 5, because I really like this device. I love that it has a light, so it works as a nice little night light, with two settings. It was super easy to use, and I ran it through my computer with the accompanying USB cable. Note, it does not come with an AC adapter. It functioned like it was supposed to, and the 2-3 drops of oil I used lasted for hours.There were only two things I didn't like, and they don't affect performance at all. First, the instructions are very difficult to read. I spent 5 minutes tearing apart the box and twisting parts of the diffuser after reading ""Use the measuring cup to fill the reservoir with water"". Ah, now I know they mean the measuring cup in my drawer in my kitchen :) Lots of really bad grammar in the instructions. Second, there is a safety feature that turns it off when it gets dry, it would be nice if that same safety feature turned it off when the lid was removed. But neither of these things affect performance, and I really appreciate this little device!I was given this diffuser to evaluate and write a review based on my experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFAI78JVJXOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78XLTW#wasThisHelpful","RYFAI78JVJXOI","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best headphones you will find in this price range!  I would give them a 4.5 if that was available.  They are easy to navigate, and easy to pair with phone or laptop.  The range is surprising, and being able to walk upstairs and around without losing connection to my downstairs phone was nice.  Sound quality is nice, with *great* treble and high range, equalized nicely.  They fold up nicely and can fit whatever other case you may have sitting around.  They are fairly light, and quite comfortable on the ears for extended wearing.The only reason I don't give them a 5 is that based on the advertising, I was expecting a bit more from the bass - the bass was fine, just my expectations had been set for more. Second, the stitching on one ear piece started coming undone just a bit (which I am sure the manufacturer would replace, and was super easy to just tuck in a bit).  But honestly, I have not seen a better pair of headphones in this price range. The next step up would be 100+ headphones.I received a pair of these headphones complimentary to review.Overall, this is a very, very solid pair of headphones, and since I gave mine away to a DJ who loved them, I plan on getting another set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TUZOKVBM5RGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SCY8ZY#wasThisHelpful","R3TUZOKVBM5RGL","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you loved Bridget Jones diary, this movie is for you, with much of the same kind of storyline.  Add in some great sports and up the raunchiness factor a bit (OK, a lot!), and you have a Trainwreck in the making!  This was a fantastic, laugh out loud movie, and the audience was responding throughout in the theater I saw it in.Basic premise is simple - Amy plays a woman who sleeps around, avoids commitment, drinks WAY too much, and is just plain awkward.  She comes from an American broken home where the father slept around with pretty much everyone, but now suffers from MS. Her sister is perfectly married, and has a goofy step-child named Allister, who actually ends up being a bit of a darling.  She hates sports, and gets stuck interviewing a sports doctor, played by Bill Hader, falling in love, falling apart, and finally reconciling.Tons of cameos here - Marisa Tomei and Daniel Radcliffe, though this part gets a bit long, John Cena and Lebron James are both excellent, especially LeBron who is a bit of an unexpected comic presence.  Chris Evert, Matthew Broderick, Marv Alpert all play a small role.The jokes and gags in this film are excellent, and Judd Apatow, as usual, I think does an excellent job of making it all work, and giving these great people the room to play, along with Amy Schumer's script.  There are even some tender moments in here that work, and may tug a bit at your emotions.  If you are a fan of Amy Schumer, don't miss this excellent movie, you just might want to leave the kiddies at home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JD4SVTC8I28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U0JWMK#wasThisHelpful","R25JD4SVTC8I28","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had made up my mind to skip this movie, even though I am a fan of the actors, the genre, and have seen every other Marvel movie.  If I hadn't looked at the well-written, comprehensive and positive reviews here, I would have missed what is undoubtedly one of the best Marvel films to date!  You can read all these great reviews here, so I will keep this short and sweet!.This was a joy to watch, innovative, with just the right blend of action, tension, family, incredible special effects, etc.  Michael Douglas was fantastic as always, Paul Rudd took a strange role in a genre he is not used to and made it his own.  Michael Pena was brilliant, and added some excellent comedic timing, with the lip syncing bits practically stealing the show.  And Evangeline Lily, you simply have to appreciate for the ability to portray a strong, sexy woman who can hold her own, can still show some emotion, and all without relying on tactics like butt shots and thigh high slit skirts. As she was referred to in the film - ""the mean pretty lady"".You'll laugh, you'll be astonished, you might even tear up a bit (not me, but maybe you), you'll cheer.

"Making the impossible not only possible, but believable.  And like a mouth full of Pop Rocks - this film is intense!  This is easily the best since the first Mission Impossible.  Cruise is in top form, and an inspiration to anyone from a fitness perspective - can you believe he is 53 years old?  I need to stop writing reviews and hit the gym more!  This film is nonstop action, you won't want to miss a minute.  Make sure to get there on time, because it jumps into intense action immediately, well before the opening credits.  This opening scene with Tom Cruise hanging onto the side of a military style plane sets the tone for the entire movie.Simplified premise is that the IMF has been disbanded after being implicated in the destruction of the Kremlin, they are absorbed by the CIA, Hunt is acting as a rogue agent, the Syndicate is out there, and not only do they need to be stopped, but the IMF has some pride in its mission and wants to clear any doubt about its efficacy.  There are plenty of double dealings with the main characters, espionage, and a water tank scene that will literally have you feel like you are running out of air.  More than that would be considered a spoiler :)Cast:Tom Cruise.  He really has become the king of action films.  In this one, I love the balance with the other characters - it is not just a showboating Tom Cruise, but a cast that works incredibly well together.  Sean Harris is a brilliant bad guy as Solomon Lane - calm, cool and collected.  Simon Pegg is a major player here as Benji, and is absolutely fantastic and totally in his element adding a touch of comedy. Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust - where did she come from?  Wow!  And she will keep you guessing throughout the film.  Ving is back as Luther (although limited), and Jeremy Renner plays a major role - I like his role here much better than previous roles such as Hawkeye in the Avengers.  Alec Baldwin is perfect as a political cog in the machine - the head of the CIA..Visually stunning, the action never lets up, the stunts are amazing, and the settings diverse.  Opening in Belarus, you'll spend time in Vienna and Casablanca, accompanied by the very suitable soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin.I had only one small complaint, and that is that I felt the congressional hearing to disband the IMF was a little too reminiscent of goofy Keystone Cops humor, and almost threatens the seriousness of a movie like this.  But you get through that scene quickly, and back into the action and storyline, and it is soon forgotten.I loved this film, with its incredible energy, a cast that really played off each other, real ""set the bar"" stunts, and diverse sets and locations.  The action never lets up, and it will certainly become a Friday night favorite for years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GRSVTY6EGEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XYP82U#wasThisHelpful","R8GRSVTY6EGEX","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this story.  Stephen King is such an excellent writer, and it was truly a joy to read.  It was clear, came together well, made sense, and had a very appropriate ending with a few minor unexpected twists.  The characters are well thought out, complete, and developed in a way that few authors can rival.  Pace is excellent, and everything here happens for a reason - there are no loose ends or extraneous scenarios that leave you wondering ""what was he trying to do here?"".  This is a thrill ride that is hard to put down.You do not need to have read the first book in this 'series', Mr Mercedes.  King is a master storyteller, and the characters are so alive that you don't need the additional context.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I felt that it was a bit too predictable.  I found myself pretty much anticipating everything that happened ahead of time.  Luckily, King is such a great writer that I looked forward to it.  Still, I also enjoy surprises and not knowing what is going to happen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R950SETJ4WSEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WROG#wasThisHelpful","R950SETJ4WSEY","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent pillow, and for the price, excellent value.  I appreciate that it comes in a small storage sack as well.  I have used this camping, hiking, and on multiple airplanes as both a pillow and something to sit on.  For something to sit on, I usually have to push a bit of air out or it is too full.  Self-inflating works well, and only occasionally do I need to actually blow into it for added volume - e.g. using it as a chest pillow if reading while laying on stomach in tent.My only issue with it, and that is not a big issue, is that if you are tight on room in a small pack, this is probably not the pillow for you.  I carried it attached to a carabiner on my pack inside its storage sack, otherwise it would take too much space.  There are other options if you just need a very small bit of extra comfort that take up less space.  Personally, I find it worth it in most cases to hang this and take it with me.I also am not 100% enthused with the texture and material - it is not bad, but it has that kind of slickness to it that you would not get with a real pillow, for example.

"Rating a weak 4 stars.  Premise is that animals are rising up against humans.  One scientist was on to it, but died early on, and his son remains to carry on, trying to find and understand his research, find the answers, and participate with the gorgeous French scientist, his tough straight forward African friend, and anti-social animal scientist, played by Billy Burke, who you might remember from Revolution..If you are a fan of the book, this has very little to do with it.  Name and overall premise are the same, but most everything else is different, and in fact, kind of hard to recognize.  But if that doesn't bother you, or you haven't read the book, it is entertaining and fun - and to be honest, the book wasn't fantastic, so I doubt there is a lot of story loyalty stickiness there anyway.  If you are vegan, you will probably absolutely LOVE this series :)  I actually like this show better than I did the book, although the pace does sometimes drag a little if you are waiting for something to happen.Acting, writing, etc., is generally not anything great, or inspired, but it is entertaining.  I do enjoy Billy Burke's generally anti-social, sarcastic character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEQI4IIUREY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OEC23E#wasThisHelpful","R3KEQI4IIUREY4","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is SUPER bright!  Throws off more light than most larger flashlights at 1050 lumen on its brightest setting.  You do have to get the separate batteries for it, which can be a bit inconvenient, but worth it.  love the fact that you have 4 brightness settings, easy to use with a simple accessible push button.  This allows you to lower the brightness to conserve battery, or avoid blinding other people.It is sturdy, and very solid and well made.  I have dropped it many times, and have had no issue.  I have had it roll into the edge of the river, and it still works no problem.  Toss it in a backpack, and rolling around inside through tough hikes, etc., no issues.  This is a quality product, and worth getting a couple of them for the price.Also has a great little belt sheath for easy carrying and a loop for connecting to your beaner or pack.  Battery life is not days at high power, however, so you should take extra batteries.  Allow for about 2-2.5 hours on brightest setting, which gives you quite a few late night bathroom trips.  Note that the end of the light does get quite hot after a few minutes.  I rarely use it on high power, however, I usually use the 2nd or 3rd setting unless I am trying to spot in treelines.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKCPJ6FKZG3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEWOCP0#wasThisHelpful","R1YKCPJ6FKZG3O","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dudes go trekking in the Amazon, and you and your mates will appreciate that you took your Dude Wipes with you!  These were great, and two packages were perfect for 3 weeks in the rainforest!  There were times when it was either bathe in a pool of electric eels, party with the piranhas, or apply Dude Wipes.Unscented, so they don't attract bugs - believe me, this is critical!  Especially in the areas you are most likely to be using them!Come out of the package easily, and as long as you don't yank them out, they don't tear.  Packaging seals back up nicely.Effective, didn't even use deodorant.

"Fantastic product, but wicked expensive, thus the 4 stars vs 5, specifically just for value.  You can find alternate brands that are much less expensive.  However, these taste fantastic, and most importantly to me, they are a great travel companion.  They do not take up a lot of space, and can handle high or low temps with no problems - an ideal snack that also gives you a bit of hydration at the same time.

"I have read this book twice now, mostly because I actually forgot I had read it - and it is generally a good book.  It is simplistic, but more complex than other books of his you might be familiar with, such as Maximum Ride.  I found the pace generally good, albeit sometimes a bit disconnected.  The overall idea is excellent - our overuse of tech and plastics has caused an evolutionary step change in animals.

"UPDATE:  Just put this chair through its paces on a trek in the Amazon.  3 weeks of sand, forest, jungle, even using it for bathing at the edge of the river.  It held up perfectly, and at the end, one of our indigenous guides traded me a lovely handmade war club for it.  One thing would make this absolutely perfect, and that would be the ability to telescope the legs a few inches to adjust the height within at least a 3-4 inch range.  Sitting for an hour or more in this when your are taller than about 5'8 - 5'9 can get a little tiresome.  There are some more comfortable chairs on the market, but none that beat the convenience, weight and size of this one, which can easily fit in a backpack water bottle holder.  You can bet that I will be buying another.I love this chair!  I am 225#, and have had absolutely no problems with this little lightweight camp stool.  Well, other than the fact that my butt might be just a touch over the edges.  But I feel comfortable, sturdy, and it is the simplest thing in the world to fold out and set up.  In fact, there really isn't anything you can do wrong, to be honest.  It might not be the perfect comfy chair, but it a) fits in a pack for hiking and b) is a heck of a lot better than the ground, a rock, whatever.Tip: put this right up next to a tree for your backrest, and you'll be comfortable for hours.This is great value for the money, and truly practical.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G0H89TRR3ZP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQU3WJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G0H89TRR3ZP6","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ultimate staple for first aid kits.  I keep some of this in my house, my car, my travel first aid kit.  It is the perfect thing to take for bug bites, allergic reactions to dog or cat fur or plants, etc.  One of the best things about Benadryl is that it also makes you drowsy.  So if you are itchy at night from all those mosquito bites around the campfire because you refused to use a good bug spray, this will do the trick - reliving the itch and putting you right to sleep for the night.The 48 pack is perfect, so you can easily split it up for home, car and travel.Note, I find that the worse my allergies are, the less drowsy I get as a result.

"We really enjoyed this lovely game for 3-8 players.  It is quick, so a great game for people who don't like to commit or have short attention spans :).  It is small, so it is easy to bring with you.  Because of the level of randomness and partner play, you can play with a wide variety of participants at different skill levels and still have fun.  We play it with multiple people who have English as a second language, and it flows well for that.  You can be playing this game within 5 minutes of getting it.Two things prevent me from rating it higher.  First, much of it tends to be a bit easy for true word nerds.  Second, the deck of cards is fairly small, so play time is somewhat limited - you'll get through all of the cards easily in a few nights of play.Two tips:Tip #1 - save the little plastic bag that the dice and small cards come in - it is useful later to store pieces, since there is not a nicely compartmentalized spot in the box to separate them out.Tip #2 - this game is for 3-8 people,  We modified the rules to go with 2 people and it is still fun.  Just do the following:* Don't use the partner die.  Just play every turn as if it were solo.* Us vs them simply becomes me vs you, and you play it that way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCV7VOI77OG0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452105480#wasThisHelpful","RCV7VOI77OG0","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no argument that this is the world's best e-reader already, so the discussion is really around what version to buy, since having one should be a given.  It is far beyond any competition.  And although I LOVE the feel of a book, I have learned to love this even more, with easy word lookups, marking passages, finding relevant information and incredible lighting and reading experience for my aging eyes.  And several thousand books in a 7.2oz package is awful nice.UPDATE! Just figured something out that many people probably know already.  Was travelling in Brazil, and learning Portuguese, and stopped in a store to get a book.  They are 3x the price in the states, so I thought, ""I wonder if that is on Kindle?""  Well, I am happy to say that all the Portuguese books I could ever want are on Kindle Unlimited.  But the best thing is it also automatically downloads a dictionary, so when you hold down on one of the unfamiliar words, BOOM! there is the definition, what an ideal tool to round out language study!  Loving it!  Chapter 5 of Harry Potter, here we go!DON'T HAVE A KINDLE PAPERWHITE?  If you don't have an e-reader, have a different brand e-reader, or have a Kindle that is not a paperwhite, then this version is a valuable upgrade to you.  It is light, easy to hold, simple to operate, and is the closest thing to a book 'experience' as you can get.  It is incredibly easy to read at a beach with no glare, or at night.  I use my Kindle everywhere in many conditions, and have never looked back.  The price gap, at least for the moment, is only $10 between the new Kindle PW and the previous version, so it makes sense to buy the new one.  However, keep an eye on it, and if the price drops further for the previous gen, it is not really compelling enough to spend the extra $$$ for this brand new one.ALREADY HAVE AN OLDER PAPERWHITE?  So, if you already have a paperwhite, is this 2015 upgrade worth it?Consider COST first  it is $119 w/ special offers, no 3G.  Then you add $20 if you want no special offers, and another 70 (plus about 5% extra weight) for 3G.  That extra $90 buys a lot of books!*Buy 3G? I find internet access pervasive nearly everywhere, and have not used my 3G at all.  I buy the books ahead of time, and if I actually ran out of books on a trip, it would not be unanticipated, and I would certainly have some internet access at some point.  I simply don't find the 3G to be something I need, even for a small price.*Likewise for SPECIAL OFFERS...they do not interfere with reading at all, they are pretty unobtrusive, and I have even found a couple to be of interest and have made a purchase decision from that.Then COMPARE.  I love this compared to my original paper white.  There really is no comparison, and if you have, and love, your original, this is a great upgrade.  It is lighter, crisper, has great adjustable lighting, more memory and features, it is well worth $119 to upgrade, and give the other to a family member or friend.BATTERY  life.  I started with this new Kindle PW and my old Kindle PW charged up fully.  After using each for a couple hours, I noticed no difference in the battery degradation.  Obviously this is not a scientific test, and the chance for variance is high, but Amazon says you can still get several weeks of life from this new Kindle, and I see no reason to doubt that.  Mathematically, the battery spec provided by Amazon shows a slight decrease, but I still charge my Kindle once every week or two just to make sure I don't run out, and that has always worked out just fine for me.CLARITY: If you have the 2nd generation paperwhite (late 2013): it is a more difficult choice.  Personally, I think it is worth it, but definitely not compelling if you are short on funds.  The increase in PPI from 212 to 300 is noticeable, as is the pleasant new font Bookerly. The main thing for me, however, is actually this new Bookerly font.  It is much easier to read.  I started wearing reading glasses about 6 years ago, and in comparisons with my other PW, I can read effectively at one size smaller font due to font clarity and gentle contrast on a better screen.  That may not seem like much, but I appreciate less page turning and interruptions.  YMMV.Big IF - If your eyesight depends on HIGHER CONTRAST, the new Kindle PaperWhite is actually not as bright as the last gen PW.  I have included side by side pictures to demonstrate this.  The new PW seems more like a book to me, with its nice gentle light.  In the pictures, I have used the same font, same brightness, etc., so that you can see the detail for yourself.  The new Kindle is on the right.OVERALL, this is a worthwhile upgrade for anyone who does not already have a 2nd generation PW.  If you have a 2nd generation already, it might be something you do only if the specific need is there, or if you want to give your old one away.Finally, what about the WARRANTY?  When these devices were $399 plus, maybe getting an extended warranty was worthwhile.  But with the prices continually falling, and the likelihood that one will actually fail extremely slim (I have had only one instance, and Amazon replaced it immediately), I would personally recommend against the purchase.  Seems silly to insure a $100 device that has a low failure rate, spending an extra $19 for year, or up to $39 for 3 years of extended coverage.TIPS:Do yourself a huge favor and get a case.Password protect your screen.  If someone gets your Kindle, they can spend your money and make lots of problems.SMALL UPDATE:  I have been using this to send documents to for reading, mostly PDFs.  It is functional, but if you require good reading of PDFs, then you probably won't like it that much, and you would be better off with a traditional tablet.  The issue is that the font is exceedingly small, and there is no way to expand or enlarge that I have found.  You can make the font slightly larger by entering landscape mode, but then the flow is off.  I also end up with an occasional crash of the browser.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NLHNKPB0UCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQVZDJM#wasThisHelpful","R37NLHNKPB0UCM","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie was really funny  but not continuously, more of a few hugely funny storms followed by some dry spells.  You need to be stoned to truly appreciate it  since only 41% of critics liked it, I conclude that 59% were not stoned.  There were at least 5 people in the theater with vape pens  welcome to Washington State!Directed by the infamous Seth McFarlane, who also plays Ted, this movie is about Teds journey to become a person.  After Ted and Tammy cannot conceive (Ted is not quite anatomically correct), they decide to adopt, which puts them square onto the radar of the government, who decides Ted is not a person and annuls his marriage and denies their dreams of parenthood.  Amanda Seyfried is a young lawyer who ends up taking the case pro bono.  A bit of a side story involves Hasbro toys, and their evil plot to make millions of Teds, but the real play here is about Ted, and what makes a person.  It is actually well done from that perspective.There were several things to really appreciate and watch out for here.  First of all, Mark Wahlberg and Ted are magic, just like in the first movie  in fact, their relationship and interaction continues to grow and seem more and more natural.  What an amazing job Wahlberg does, as well as the animators.  Second, I absolutely love Amanda Seyfried, who steps into this perfectly  from lighting up during the first meeting to touching moment of her singing the song about the moon above a pot farm.  She is an incredibly good sport with the Gollum references  wow.  There are amazing comedic moments.  Without giving anything away, watch for the Kardashian comment (groan), as well as the moment when the theme from Jurassic Park starts playing.  Finally, there are some amazing cameos and other appearances throughout.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant, Jay Leno is just plain awkward, Liam Neeson makes a completely pointless cameo, but nonetheless well worth it  especially if you wait until the absolute end of the credits, Tom Brady sketch is brilliant (super awkward, but I am sure there are many women out there who would volunteer!), during which Ted is sporting a Paddington style raincoat - very clever.  Finally, Jessica Barth as Tammy (Teds wife) is incredible, and probably my favorite part of this movie.There are also some things not to like so much, which is why I only gave it 4 stars vs 5 for the original Ted.  First of all, most of the jokes were a bit tiresome.  Funny, but then repeated ad nauseum.  Of course, I mostly forgot that it was a repeat and laughed anyway '  There was way too much focus on the black humor, and that quickly ran out of juice, so to speak.  Finally, this whole thing with Donny and Hasbro being resurrected just didnt add a lot to the story.Overall, a great romp, fun, definitely not something to see with the kids, or even sober.  But given the current themes where dolphins and orangutans have recently been granted non-human sentient status by various gov entities, it actually gave rise to quite a bit of follow on discussion the next couple evenings about what defines a person.  Rated R.Tip:  If you are watching this at home, you may also want to get the following cookbook, which is a great companion to any Ted movie - http://www.amazon.com/Baked-Over-Tasty-Marijuana-Treats/dp/1931160805","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KU749OS3YTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAOHCQQ#wasThisHelpful","R25KU749OS3YTK","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had an instant connection to the characters.  The series, interestingly, is created and written by the two stars - Rob Delaney, who plays Rob, and Sharon Horgan, who plays Sharon.  It is witty, funny, refreshing, awkward all at the same time.  The characters are honest and insightful, and I was laughing all the way through every episode!  It is too bad these episodes are only 25 minutes, because this series is a winner.  Well acted, you really do believe these are two strangers who ended up pregnant after a week long one night stand, or as Rob puts it ""I'm not a stranger, more of a familiar acquaintance"".  They are truly ordinary people in an awkward situation amid all the strange friendships that get even stranger when mixed with both UK (British and Irish) and US perspectives.I love the dialog...here are a few examples...In regards to having a baby: ""We could do this and not f* up the kid too horribly""Regarding birth: ""You see that little troll come tobogganing out of your wife, on a wave of turds, and you'll hold her responsible""Regarding the best friend's naturopathic remedies:  ""My guru cured himself of prostate cancer with walnuts""  Rob: ""Give me a break!  What did he do, jam them up his a$$?""The other characters are excellent - his irresponsible model-loving friend, her best friend, Rob's mom who continues to research how to get out of this mess, etc.  You'll see several people you'll recognize, such as Carrie Fisher, and that Captain from the show Outland, for example.I highly encourage you to give this show a chance - watch it all the way through, take in the catastrophic proposal, the bachelor party, the wedding night. It is NSFW, and not kid friendly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XKZRQC1VJYCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8UI466#wasThisHelpful","R2XKZRQC1VJYCA","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to this book, and ordered it MONTHS ago.  So yesterday, when it showed up on my Kindle, I was excited to read it.  I actually haven't been reading too much, and this series has dropped off my radar for quite a while, so I missed a few in the middle.  But I am a big fan of the world, and Anita Blake.However, this book is still simply trying to show and develop the character of Anita Blake, with literally nothing new that I could tell.  Yes, she is tough and sexy, just the kind of person I would like to have as a friend (definitely not enemy) in real life.  But the story here was pretty much just her, with little happening.  I found myself growing a bit bored, to be honest, and disappointed that I picked up this series again when there is so much else out there to read this summer.  It seems to have lost its purpose - it wasn't sexy enough to be really sexy, it wasn't tough enough to be real adventure, it wasn't introspective enough to be thoughtful, etc.  It was just kind of lost in the middle.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RGKJVNR8SBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4DJG#wasThisHelpful","R24RGKJVNR8SBM","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might be just a bit generous on this rating, but I have been reading Brooks since the 1977 Sword of Shannara, and I absolutely love this universe, the history, the detail.  Terry Brooks novels are never like a wild ride through the rapids, with excitement at every turn, but rather more like a hike, with beautiful vistas and a slowly unfolding story (at least until you meet the bear in the woods :)). This story was no different, although a bit less complex than others in the past.Paxon Leah, who we met in the last book, continues on in his role as protector, and we still have Arcannen, the evil sorcerer who escaped.  The wishsong is the focal point of the story, and the intent is to find the source of the magic before it can fall into the wrong hands (obviously that is Arcannen).  The story is a bit slower, and feels sometimes a bit more awkward than other past novels.  Perhaps after reading so many books, the formula is showing a bit of its age at this point.But this is still a great story, perfect for taking on vacation and losing yourself in.  But while this story would be able to be read standalone, there is a lot of history and character affinity that you will miss out on.  If you have a nice summer vacation ahead of you, I would highly recommend grabbing some of the other books, starting with the amazing first, and getting lost in this universe.
