"These power crunch bars are awesome!  Absolutely the best tasting bar, and really hits that sweet tooth as well if you have one.  Great flavors, nice wafer format, none of the dryness of other bars - just super light snack that doesn't weigh you down nor requires a glass of water to wash it down (of course, you should drink that glass of water anyway!)  Note that it certainly has much higher fat than most others, but if you are not using them as your sole meal replacement, they are great to have in your mix.

"The best thing I have read on Elon Musk so far (and from what I understand, the only one that he has participated in himself).  Vance is an excellent writer, and you may or may not be familiar with him from Bloomberg Business and other high profile writings.  I loved the insight into Musk and how he operates, and you get a very broad and complete picture of Musk as a driven visionary that is absolutely set on delivering some of the most aspirational goals of any human in history.  You also get some great insight into the overall ecosystem around Musk - his companies (SpaceX and Tesla primarily), relationships with other companies and gov entities, as well as the important people around him.  Many bios give you a timeline of the person, but little insight into the broader context and I appreciated that in this book.You get unique insight into his personal relationships, how he coped with things that went wrong (not always a pretty story), and how he manages through both failure and success.  Since you learn so much about his childhood and formative years, you get a good grounding on why he is the way he is, and how those relationships developed.Finally, you get a lot of detail around 'green' industry, space exploration, etc. which really fills out this ecosystem and delivers an inspiring and educational view of one of the most intriguing people of our lifetimes.  The book almost seems to ask ""What are you going to go out and reinvent?""  Well worth reading and even gifting to friends who may be fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36154BSX0SITG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062301233#wasThisHelpful","R36154BSX0SITG","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to give this book any less than 5 stars.  I am a big fan of other Trudi Canavan works, and I was really hopeful with this one.The quality of writing is not great, the story development is slow and predictable, and I found myself rushing to the end to find out if something, anything, happens.  There are two stories throughout the book, Rielle and Tyen, and they are completely different, unrelated worlds.  In fact, they almost seem like one story written to resonate with girls, and one for boys.  At one point, I remember thinking ""I am on page 463, and I still have no idea how these stories relate.""  Perhaps this should have been written as two series from different viewpoints - some authors have done quite well with that.I was disappointed as well with the detail around the magic systems, and use of magic, which was totally skimmed over.  Based on previous work, I was expecting something a bit more inventive, vs what became the same story told in a variety of environs.It was good enough that I will read the next books in the series, although I will wait a few weeks so they are not at the intro price!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VQ5HGPB0YEKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316209252#wasThisHelpful","R2VQ5HGPB0YEKM","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love this show, and watch every season.  Strangers start out naked, so they need to find safe shelter, water, food - in that order.  Fire tends to be a major problem, since that is often required for both the food and water requirements.  Season 4 is not much different from past seasons, just different locations.I only give it 4 stars, since it would be really interesting to see more evaluation.  For example, one pair spends 4 days trying to build fire.  We know there is a panel of experts always adjusting their PSR (or Primitive Survival Rating) - what is the consensus of what they could have done better?  Would be great to learn a bit more out of the show.  Naked and Afraid Uncensored doesn't do this, but rather spends more time on background of the participants.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T64KOYMEOACB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WEWBMT0#wasThisHelpful","R3T64KOYMEOACB","A6U2O5KZG06TI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6U2O5KZG06TI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love to do crafts of all kinds, and know how to hand-embroider. I've always wanted to own an embroidery machine, but could not afford one. I was a little bit skeptical at first, since my first experience with Brother was a lemon sewing machine (it only truly likes to work in reverse!). Compared to other machines, the price point on this one just cannot be beat!The manual is more than a little intimidating. Some of it is very roughly translated-to-English descriptions, but I muddled through to the point I was willing to give it an actual try. Putting the parts together was much worse on paper than in real life - a simple snap-on to the bottom part, and then snap on the hoop and I was ready to roll. On to the pleasant option of which design to try first.My experience with the automatic needle threader was more frustration than helpful, and I found myself wishing I could take it off so I could reach the #6 threading spot easier. The instructions seem to overcomplicate it, so I'll try it again in another way viewed on a video and see if I don't want to take a hammer to it.On the embroidery - you do have to change the thread a lot to get the desired results. Thankfully, like most Brother machines, the threading sequence is printed right on the machine so you aren't trying to remember if the thread goes over or under that metal piece or around this little piece. We used a rayon type thread, which has a nice sheen to it. Since I was giving the machine a test run, we did our tests on simple (translation: cheap) muslin fabric with tear-away stabilizer on the back. I have included some pictures on our results. I wish we could load more photos, but I guess that would overload the website. (I also tried to take a video, but failed miserably for some reason.)  I would advise users to buy the best thread you can afford, because one of our cheaper colors caused the needle to break because of thread burrs hitting the eye of the needle. SNAP!!That was the one actual complaint I had about this machine - we had to stop and put on a new needle of course, and we were on Color #3 of a six-color design.  We could not go BACK to Color #3 and continue - we had to scrap the hoop contents and start over from the beginning.  I would have liked the option to continue where we left off, but couldn't.The embroidery is not perfection - there were little gaps between the colored thread and the outlines on a couple designs we tried, but nothing overly bad. If I wasn't fine-tooth-combing it, I might not even notice. We even tried one of the six-color designs in only ONE color, just to see how it would look (and to save thread!) - it looked surprisingly good! For those new to machine embroidery, the machine will have connecting threads by color - in other words, if there are five areas that use black, there will be thread running between those five areas. It is normal and perfectly ok. This machine starts with a few anchoring stitches - just trim away the connected threads - they are NOT part of your design. That goes for the front AND the back.There are several Disney and Pixar licensed designs included with this model. There are five fonts as well. I wish there were more, and you can bet that fonts are the FIRST thing I am going to look for to download! Yes, you can just download more options, designs, fonts and frames to this machine. Well, to your computer, then transfer them to your machine via USB port. I have also learned as of today that there is software available to even digitize your own designs, which will create truly custom designs for your machine. The Brother uses files in the PES format (there are a LOT of embroidery formats out there, so be sure you stick with the right type for the machine). Brother has included their design library website location on the front of the machine, apparently knowing they will be creating an insatiable thirst for more designs and fonts!There are many YouTube videos available on how to use this machine, in case you are not into reading roughly translated manuals (even though I recommend at minimum familiarizing yourself with the machine via the manuals before trying using it). I've been looking at some today, and have already learned some new tricks.All in all, I truly love this machine. It does everything you could want (except large designs - that will take a different model - the maximum embroidery area for this one is 4x4, even though the hoop is larger than that) and does it very nicely. I am thrilled and extremely grateful to have had the chance to own it! In fact, since trying it out, my mind has been racing as to all the things I could make (or try to make) with this, and I haven't done a lick of actual work. My daughter also tried out a design and had no trouble with it either. We are in the process of making her first quilt, and had been wondering how we could get some of the words she wanted to include on her fabric as part of the design. Now we know! We'll be creating our own blocks.I seriously can recommend this machine to anyone who enjoys making custom gifts or even wants to start selling embroidered items as a side business. This is definitely for home use - the size and speed are not going to work for a high-volume business. But this home user is incredibly happy with the machine, and can barely wait to try some new fonts!  You WILL enjoy this one!Note that I've read more than one review that complained about nesting on the back. If you have not done any sort of machine embroidery before, please know that you HAVE to use some sort of stabilizer fabric on the back of the item on which you are embroidering. Amazon sells many different types. I like to buy the precut, since it saves me a lot of time and frustration. This machine uses 8""x8"" precuts. Any type will do, but I like the tear-away the best so far. If you are using a stretchy fabric, you'll want a more permanent stabilizer. Also, cheap threads are not a friend to this machine. That broken needle was on my first time out - the cheap thread caused a burr that snapped the needle in half. Get the best thread you can afford.Good luck, and happy embroidering!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R75V58I8RANI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGUOT80#wasThisHelpful","R75V58I8RANI3","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not as exciting as I thought it would be.  I've seen several commercials for spiral slicers, like I am sure we all have.Big, luscious-looking piles of zucchini ""noodles"" stack up on a plate. You see carrots being turned into strings as well.So, I had to try one. So far, I have tried it with carrots and cucumbers.I'm sorry, but the hype is more than the results. Yes, it looks great, but unless you can chew big piles of strings with the texture of licorice whips, then this might not be for you. Whoever did the zucchini would surely have to cook it first, and I'm not sure what the breakdown would be on the thin strips in the heat of a pot of skillet.  (We haven't had much zucchini yet this year, so haven't tried it with that yet.)It also doesn't use all the vegetable, so know that if you think three carrots will give you a plate full of orange curls, you would be wrong - you'll have a half plate of orange curls and three stubs of carrots that look like stubby sharpened pencils! I just chopped up the rest of the stubs and cooked them with everything else. Plus, you'll; have the fun of trying to get that thing with very sharp blades clean.  For those of us who do not have a dishwasher (I miss it! Wah!) and have to wash by hand, it is a bit of a challenge to get the bits out of the middle where the two ends meet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R853IVZQO74IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA50AFE#wasThisHelpful","R853IVZQO74IZ","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skepticle about these bars being very good.  I mean, I know Barry from the commercials loves the Fiber One bars, but what about those of us to had to actually buy them, and weren't paid to eat them?Well, turns out that these are VERY good. They are also VERY small.  Apparently, Fiber One made the portion size with keeping under 100 calories in mind.  I was seriously surprised at the tiny size. But, you have to keep your focus on the fiber so you don't kick yourself for such a tiny bar. They do have a lot of sugars in them, mainly from the lemon flavored frosting squiggles. Not sure if they had to add so much sweetness to cover the taste of the inulin (chickory root), the fiber they use or what, but at this point, I don't mind.  Thanks to dental troubles, I can't chew as well as I used to, so getting fiber is a challenge. (Sorry, I just can't down a glass of Benefiber, even though I know it isn't supposed to be gritty! I know it's in there!)  These bars seem to be doing the job I hired them to do, and taste goodwhile doing it.Well done Fiber One.  This is one I'll be a repeat buyer for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CE2WCJ41SVNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G91O3TS#wasThisHelpful","R3CE2WCJ41SVNU","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fan and description seems to put a different ""mental image"" in my head than what we received.When I see 30"", I think plenty big for a small room.  In reality, when we opened the box, I was shocked to see how very small these blades really are!  They are 10"" from tip to tip.  Not sure how they measure ceilng fans - I'll have to google it - but two 10"" blades with about 6"" of housing inbetween doesn't equal 30"".But, the fan part of our old fan/light had died, and warm weather is here.  We rent, so can't modify anything, can only replace. With all the area stores, even Wally World, wanting $55 and up for the tinest fans, I decided to go ahead and try this one.  Never heard of the brand before either.It is a SMALL fan.  Very small.  The foreign instructions stink, but my husband has put up much more than his share of ceiling fans before, so it was no big deal. He claims the hardest part was screwing in the tiny screws with the washer into the housing, because many of the holes were drilled at some sort of angle. But, he finally got it after a few mutters under his breath.I do have to say that I am surprised by the amount of light and air this Liliputian fan actually supplies. It was for a 10'x11' bedroom. The fan it was replacing was a 36"" fan (actually 36"" from tip to tip) with a globe style light with two bulbs. So I was not truly expecting a lot of this tiny offspring of normal fans. However, whether it is the six blades or the size of the motor, this tiny thing moves more air than the larger fan did. In addition, the light kit took only one bulb (the style that looks like miniature incandescents, not the ""flame"" ones), so I was expecting not much light. I was again surprised to see that it does a great job on the lighting as well.  Seriously - this fan offers more than meets the eye.  The pullchains are also miniscule, so unless you want to drag your knuckles along just below the blades to turn the light off and on, you'll need to add some ball chain to their pulls for both the light and the fan.  We just took ours off the old fan and attached them instead of using the mfg pulls.The blades are reversible, but you'll probably want to stick with the white with the faux wood pattern. The reverse side is a fugly brown with blue accents. Yuck!  The all white fan helps it to visually blend up and into the ceiling without drawing your eye immediately to it.So, while I was ready to hate it and disappointed to see the tiny blades, this fan does everything it promised.  I don't know how long it will last, but for now, it is the Little Fan That Could.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKFN1QVTCU26B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VZQ468#wasThisHelpful","RKFN1QVTCU26B","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I realize that everyone's definition of ""easy to set up"" comes from a different place.  For me, I've worked around computers for over 25 years now, so pretty comfortable, BUT - I am more comfortable with software than hardware.  So although this should not have been intimidating, it was a little bit. I formerly was using a Linksys router on our home network. It did a fine job, and was very easy to maintain. However, it didn't give much of a boost to the downstairs connections. The computer was always slow, and would drop the connection from time to time, and require a reboot to get the connection back.This router is truly great looking. It is white, sleek and has nice blue lights. It sits vertically, rather than horizontally like my old one. I wasn't sure I'd like it, but I do. It comes with three screw-on antennas that can be pointed in any direction to boost your signal in that direction. The metal frame is very sturdy and would take a LOT of pressure to bend. I currently have mine on a separate little shelf because my current desk is too small.There is only a quick set-up sheet included with this item. Ironically, if you need help, it tells you to go to the company's WEBSITE! Ha! So, if you can't get it to work, go ahead and get online.  Yeah, No. But, if you are willing to disconnect and reset up a single-user home network using your old router, it could work! The sheet does give you very plain graphic instructions that tells you which item to plug in where, which many will find very helpful It came with a very short ethernet cord, so you either need to keep the router close to you or buy a longer cord. (The one I had was just purchased last year and was six feet long, so I was in good shape.)Now, I couldn't get it to connect right away. The short troubleshooter on the insert says to reboot your modem, then to reboot the router. I did. Several times. The computer refused to acknowledge the new router! I was ready to just reconnect my Linksys when I decided to go against all logic and swap the ethernet and modem cords. For many years, computers and peripherals have been fairly color-coded to make it easier for non-tekkies to hook things up. In this case for the TP Link, the ethernet ports (there are four) are yellow and the modem port is blue. I even had previously bought color-coded wires so I didn't accidentally pull the wrong one. After 45 minutes of not being able to connect, I take another look at the back. Everything is in the right spot. But, since I wasn't connecting anyway, I decided to swap out the modem cord and ethernet cord, plugging yellow into the blue slot and the blue cord into the yellow slot. Totally backwards.  As you might guess, it took off immediately! So apparently, our unit was either labeled backwards or connected backwards on the inside. Seriously strange. But as long as it works, I don't much care.The default setting of this router is PUBLIC, so be sure to change your settings to PRIVATE NETWORK, if you don't want everyone in the neighborhood to try and tap into your network. Yes, they would need your password, but there are a lot of smart hackers out there, so you just never know. Better safe than sorry. There are default settings for the account name, network name (your SSID) and passwords, so you will need to change those as soon as you can. (If you forget to write them down, there is a reset button on the back to rol it back to the default passwords.) I also had to change the other settings to WPA2 for our area for the home network. No big deal, just different from before.The TP Link C9 runs two parallel bands - 2.4Ghz, which is what most home routers use for regular internet access and browsing, and a 5.0 Ghz band, which is for streaming videos and movies. The nice thing about this router, is that if you name BOTH the 2.4 and the 5.0 the same name, it will AUTOMATICALLY switches to the strongest network for your use. I love that!  The on/off switch is on the back of the router, so it won't easily get bumped. While my photos show the antennas straight up (we haven't had to move any of them to get a better reception), they rotate and bend towards whatever area you might need a little boost.Has our reception improved? Yes! The downstairs computer now cruises like it was directly connected to a wired access point. The kids can watch movies and I can browse the net without anyone slowing down. The reception range is fabulous - we live in a multi-unit building, and could probably provide internet connection to all four units. It offers connection speeds of 1.3Gbps over the clearer 5GHz bandwidth and 600Mbps on the 2.4GHz bandwidth. We have not yet found a dead spot in our place - even outside picks up the signal.In addition to the fabulous signal and great connection speeds, this router can also handle your USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices. There are ports on the side of the router, so you can easily transfer files, photos or data from an external drive to your own computer, or even hook up your printer to print wirelessly. (I haven't tried that yet, but the possibilities are there.)It also offers a ""tether"" function for your smartphones.  I have not used that, and won't be using that, but it would be great for parents who want to monitor network access/usage from work for their older kids. It is nice to know that option is there.I am so very pleased with this router! I probably would not have looked at this brand, since I tend to stick with the equipment companies I've had previous success with, but I cannot state enough that this would be an asset to anyone's home network setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EG7HL33YH8UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDLRHFW#wasThisHelpful","R1EG7HL33YH8UT","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really cute rain boots.Note that they are HEAVY, so don't expect a lightweight, easy-to-wear-all-day boot.They are surprisingly heavy, in fact.What is really good about them is that they provide an alternative for ladies who don't have skinny calves!Almost all the rainboots currently available, adorable as they might be, are too tight in the calf area if you carry any extra weight below the waist.

Yes, a few places make wider calved boots, but you have to invest in them, and they aren't very cute.Great for rainy, soggy days that are not gully-washers.

"Very cute movie.  Of course, I find it even more entertaining, since we were living in Houston during the whole Enron/Arthur Andersen debacle. If you've ever worked in a cube farm situation for a faceless corporation, then you'll truly relate to and enjoy this movie.I had already seen it many, many times. We bought it because my daughter needed to see it for a class assignment, and no one had it playing.I was surprised to see who was actually playing Milton!

"Well, we used to buy Greenies for our dog and our cats all the time.  That is, until we got a cat that was allergic to corn!These things are mostly corn meal.If you have a pet with itchy skin, you might want to try and see if corn meal is creating a reaction. Just like with people, corn can be highly allergenic and cause gluten problems.The small amount of chlorophyll for their breath isn't worth a tradeoff of itchy skin and bloating for our cat.No more Greenies for us.

"I decided to try these out more for the size than anything extra special about the formula.  I do not drink diet sodas, as I am allergic to aspartame, and sucralose seems to give me a headache as well. That leaves the very few sweetened with stevia, and this is NOT one of those.This simply uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup for the main sweetener.  As far as taste, I don't taste a lot of difference, except that this one is a little bland and less carbonated for some reason.  Perhaps our package got beat up too much on the trip.  Probably a total of 10 cans out of the 24 cans had dents or smooshed edges on them.  One could not be opened at all by hand.  The edges were the worst, but some of the ones in the middle were also a little mashed, which surprised me. It wasn't worth tryig to return it, so we kept it.There are a couple pros though -first off, aesthetically, I like the can color!  Ha!  Yes, I like the shiny green can.  I like shiny things. I also like caffeine, but once the evening wears down, I often don't want to drink a full can.  This is where this product shines.  They are just the right size for a late evening Pepsi without having the rest of the can sit and go flat overnight. (I've poured out more than my share of the blue cans the next morning.)I wish they were more carbonated, and they need to perhaps put them in sixpack rings AND the case to keep them from slamming around so much.But, they have a place in the Pepsi world. Would I buy them again?  Undecided at this point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMEE575PIYWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSNWJIW#wasThisHelpful","RSMEE575PIYWR","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yuck! Already dry bars, combined with the drying effect of the inulin fiber, and it can be hard to swallow literally.While it might not seem like you could ever have too much chocolate, you CAN.These seem to have too much chocolate for what they are. I did not like the flavor of the squiggles across the top - very artificial tasting.Overall, this was my first and last purchase of this flavor.

"I absolutely LOVE this little thing!They are not huge - maybe a little larger than a baseball. (It has been years since I held a baseball, so use your own judgement there.)Every one will vary a little, because they are carved from Hilalayan salt.  I have three other salt lamps as well. We have two asthmatics in the house, and they do seem to help purify the air.This candle uses ONLY tea lights. You can pick them up almost anywhere very inexpensively, so that is not a huge cost.You'll need a stick-style lighter (like you'd use on large candles or your grill) because you won't be able to get a match in there unless you have some fireplace matches.  DO NOT use votive size candles either - the wax will melt down into the base and make a very large mess.  Tea lights only please!They are a funky pink when sitting unused in the room. They don't really expire - my salt lamp in the bedroom is probably three years old and you can't tell I've even used it.  When you put in a tea light and light it up, the glow is a beautiful orange that is very eye-pleasing.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and with the product itself.  I would gladly give these as gifts (and receive them too!).If this is your first time to try out a Himalayan light product, this is a great way to do it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30OT70XMPKRM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LZUE7Q#wasThisHelpful","R30OT70XMPKRM5","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one has a ways to go before it is useful.I bought it because our family loves deviled eggs and I make them almost weekly in the warmer weather.I wanted a way to store more deviled eggs, as the container I had only held 12 halves. Not enough! The fact that each tray held 18 halves was really a great thing, so I thought. I also wanted something that wouldn't take up a lot of refrigerator room, and thought this might slide in on top of other items in the fridge.The item came with the two trays and lids shrink-wrapped together.  There are little clamps on the egg portion of the tray that hook to the lid portion. Not well, but they hook. There is NOTHING remotely sturdy about this set.  You cannot pick it up by the handle. If you think you can quickly grab an egg and pop the lid back on, think again - it is not quick and you will probably need both hands.The tray itself holds the eggs very well. Almost too well - the indentations are deep, and we found ourselves using a fork to get the eggs back out. No big deal, but something you should know about these. They would work very well for a buffet table (that is at your home, and you did not have to transport them in these trays anywhere).  Some others have said they put ice in the upside down lid and put the tray on the ice. I could see that being helpful in a picnic situation.Bottom line is that they do not fasten well enough in any way.  I would not trust them for transporting eggs. I would not trust lifting them out of the refrigerator. I would not even trust them to keep the eggs fresh, because the seal is not tight on the top/bottom. It basically sits on top of the gg tray, and you use the little latches to pretend to hook the top to the bottom.  Meh at best.  I would have returned these, but as mentioned, I can see these working well for a buffet or self-serve party situation. That's ALL they would be good for, in my opinion.  Just too flimsy for anything else.I have already purchased a different set via Amazon that is perfect for our needs and airtight too.So, if you have a lot of home dinner parties or family dinners, this will work on the food table.If you don't and might want to drive to somewhere and bring your deviled eggs with you, please get a different container.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JH3SVYFP5U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SJYINO#wasThisHelpful","R25JH3SVYFP5U1","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my third egg keeper I've purchased.  I tried the Rubbermaid (okay, but doesn't hold enough and lost the lid in the last move), a set from Amazon that was two platter-type holders with plastic covers. What a mess those were - okay for a buffet table, but that would be all. Not good for transporting anywhere or even fridge storage.So, decided to give these a try.  Our family loves deviled eggs, and I make them almost weekly in the summer. Our fridge space is at a premium, so always looking for something that will help it store easier or in a smaller footprint. This is it!I was VERY pleasantly surprised by the quality of this set.You get a total of FIVE pieces in this set - two of the actual containers, two inserts for deviled eggs and the top latch/lid.The white trays come out, so you can use these to hold almost anything you'd want to. Each of the trays holds a dozen eggs (either hard boiled, fresh or deviled halves).The bottom snaps onto the upper tray securely. I wouldn't worry about it falling off, unless someday the snap itself broke off. Possible, but it would take some really rough treatment to break them. The lid snaps on to whichever tray is on the top level. You can easily pick it up by the handle and off you go.  Now, I haven't traveled anywhere with this yet, but I can see it working very well for about anything - picnic, car trips, etc.I'll be getting another set or two for sure. They can all connect together.  I'd love to see some different lid colors, but other than that, love this set!Both segments are full of eggs in the fridge right now from making devilled eggs yesterday. VERY pleased with the airtightness (?) of the containers and love how little space it really takes up in the fridge.  Well done, Snap 'N' Stack!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTU6FI9J97FJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PQAIVA#wasThisHelpful","R1LTU6FI9J97FJ","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After I had bought another car seat warmer for my husband that wasn't ever used (he hated it!), I thought I'd try again.This one looked simple, soft and was a reasonable price.When I gave it to him, I got the standard eye rolling, and mumbling about how he didn't want the other one, why would he want this one, etc etc.But, if your hubby is like mine, he has a very small behind, and gets colder than I do. He has to get out in all kinds of weather for his job, and my thoughts were that it would help keep that tiny behind warmer this winter.As it turns out, he had to grudgingly admit that he really liked this seat, and used it every day this winter.  It actually felt good, warmed up just enough to take the chill off, and was comfortable as well.  That's about as good as it gets with him!So, we have to give it all thumbs up - finally found a seat that he liked, it worked like it was advertised, and it was affordable!

Turned out that I needed HALF of this box just to have one folder per account set up by these various entities!  Good grief.  13 different accounts for the treatment of the same medical problem!

"Well, I have to say that Petstages has a huge hit with this item.Both of our cats adore these round beds.In fact, they adore them so much, we have now purchased four beds for two cats!The new ones get put in the room they hang in the most, and the older ones get putdownstairs for a spare place to lay.Made of tightly wound corrugated cardboard, these beds seem to thrill the cats.Our older (and larger) male loves curling up in these, no matter where we place them. He hangs over the edges a little, but he doesn't seem to mind a bit! Our little girl loves to sharpen her claws on them, no matter who's bed it is or where it is.She has no boundaries and regularly uses our male cat's bed as her sharpening place.I would love it if Petstages made a larger size of this bed, as our male hangs over the edge.(We included a photo of him hanging on to the newest bed as we try to put it on the floor. Hedidn't want to even let it go!  He's 13 lbs. We also included a photo of our girl cat curled up inher bed - she is 9 lbs, in case that helps anyone decide on whether or not to try this bed for their kitty.)All in all, it is the best purchase we've made that both cats adore, other than food.It will be on our permanent purchase list!  When one wears out (and it takes a while, despite allthe use they get), we just order another one.The legs can be a little tempermental, especially if they start wrestling on one of them. (And their humans have stepped on the beds from time to time by accident, popping off a bed leg!)  I've tried a few different glues, and found that a plain old glue gun with medium or hot melt sticks does a great job of anchoring the legs back onto the bed. Don't throw them away - just glue back on for more cat fun.Thank you Petstages for a real winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0G4GTMUXEUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QTOASE#wasThisHelpful","R3P0G4GTMUXEUA","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No shreds, tears orruined boxes.The only mild complaint I had about these was that when they are put together, the corners areslightly open. In other words, if you had put a flashlight in the on position in the box, you'll see lightcoming through everywhere the corners meet.  Since I ship things with fabric in them, that meant I needto put an extra piece of tape on each little corner to keep as much of the outside out as possible.I also found out that I could have gone down 1"" to ship what I make, but that's just something that you don't knowuntil you try it.

"Well, I wish the colors had varied - we got the yellow shown in the current photo.

Maybe someone else will have better luck.The lid is very stiff plastic. It was easy to clean. That's the good part.It fit the regular 5.5 ounce cans (like Friskies) very well. Almost too well - I tried to get it back off last night,and finally got it off by using one of the ""ears"" to get the seal to break.Oh well.

If it matters, they are very shiny silver, not dull like some pins.You can pick these up with a magnet, so that is also helpful, since I often drop pins!The only things I would change, is to make the heads flatter.

"This is a beautiful ornament stand.  BUT...the only way it can actually hold an ornament is if the ornament itself has a very SHORT hanger. In other words, all the beautiful ornaments with fabric ribbons and such won't work.  I tried four different ornaments, and every one of them hung way too low and touched the bottom curve of the stand.  If I cut the ribbon shorter, it would not ever be able to be hung on a tree, to be able to alternate decorations.It needs to have the top where it curls over be extended/uncurled one turn.  We experimented with ours, figuring since it wasn't working anyway, the worst we could do would be to break it. Either way, we weren't able to hang ornaments on it.  So my husband started tweaking the curves and coils with tools.  We managed to uncurl the top enough to raise it up, which helped a little bit, but not enough.  We also played with the curve in the middle, having to UNcurl it some to get a little more height. Once that was done, the ornaments still faced sideways, due to the placement of the top curl.  So yet again, we played with that, and turned the top curl 90 degrees out, which finally allowed a regular ornament to be put on there without touching any of the stand or facing the back of the stand.So, over all, it is a sturdy stand, and the bottom curl is beautiful. Note that it has a fairly large ""footprint"", and will take up some room. But the design is a little flawed in reality, with the curves' angles needing to be revamped to make it useful.  You'll note in the photo that the ornament they display is actually very small, and does not have a drop-down hanger of any kind - it is a very short little hanger too.  Most ornaments that you would display won't be like that.  This would be great for small ornaments, but the larger ones that you might hang on your tree just won't work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ866K2EUK5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YVZOFE#wasThisHelpful","RRJ866K2EUK5K","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The blue color is really great and I liked it.The width did not feel too bad, but the liners of the Asics are SLICK!I found myself sliding around a little too muchinside to be comfortable.  I also felt that they did not offer much support.  Note that I am NOT an athlete and didn't planon using these for running - just good ol' walking from place to place. They didn't feel like they would last long, andthe sliding was very annoying!  It wasn't just the width - I had ordered these and a pair in D width to check. I had the slidingproblem in both pairs of shoes simply because of the liner material.

"We only buy SafeCat cat collars, because the latch is not so hard.I really do NOT recommend buying any cat collar that uses those black rectangular latches... those are meant forsmall dogs, who have a lot more neck strength than cats do.  Odds are good that if your cat got caught on a branchwith one of the black latch collars, they'd be stuck and subject to harm. The SafeCat latches are easier for cats to break away from.Our cats are indoor cats, but I buy reflective collars for our little girl, who sometimes likes to try to sneak out of the door.She hates it when she's out there and wants right back in, but just in case... I wanted something safe for her.  We normally takethe bells off, but this time, we left it on.  I have to say, it is completely for our own amusement, because our girl cat hates to be held, detained or otherwise blocked in any way at all. We have said her name should have been Houdini, because we swear she can be downstairs and if you turn around, she's sitting on the bed upstairs beside you, and you never heard her or saw her come up the stairs. The bell, however, announces some of her activity!  She hates being heard!  Ha!  It gives our other cat a warning before he gets pounced on as well.She is trying her best to walk in a way that the bell makes no sound, but we hear her bounding down the stairs now, as well as coming back up at breakneck speeds.  We might take it off at some point, but it has been amusing to hear her as she comes up, and see her face when we look her way.  She likes being anonymous! Ha!Anyway, you just cannot get a better collar for your cat than Safe Cat.  They come in many designs, so if you don't like this one, just look for some others.  The blue looks cute on her (she's a tortie), although we would have preferred black.  They were out when we ordered.(I think Safe Cat has even saved her life INSide the house too. She tries to climb everywhere and on everything.  She was missing her collar one day, and we finally found it about a month later behind our washing machine. She had apparently been climbing around and slid behind the machine among the hoses.  She could have strangled if she had some other type of collar on, but Safe Cat released for her and she was able to climb out by herself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZB3FDCJH619/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHRX4G6#wasThisHelpful","R2UZB3FDCJH619","ATJN4KEHJBOC8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATJN4KEHJBOC8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was really happy to get this one and find that it is not only has lots of options, but it actually works well. It's made of steel and has an enamel coating that makes it not only attractive but protects it from rusting. The rubbery grip is a nice feature and provides comfort when you're using it for long periods. The metal trigger is strong yet very easy to pull. There are 10 different settings and a knob that adjusts the flow pressure. That's something different that isn't on all nozzles. I've had nozzles with a variety of sprays, but often that just means a lot of irregular spray patterns. Not so with this one.

"I have to say that in the past I haven't really been that concerned with the need to ""prepare"" for disaster. But times have changed. With so much being said about the possibility of cyber attacks and what it would mean to our communities, I'm reconsidering. I've recently been reading up on some very basic ways to plan for short-term periods with no electricity...perhaps up to two weeks. Lack of clean water is a concern. Without getting into all the details, suffice it to say that having a means by which we can turn lake water into drinking water could be a blessing. So when this company offered me a discounted sample of their LifeStraw water purifier in exchange for an honest review, I was thrilled.This unit is very compact when empty. It can easily be placed in a backpack for hiking, suitcase for travel to other countries, or stored in your car in case of an emergency and need for water. I have the 12 liter (3.17 gallons) purifier which is a nice size, not too heavy to handle. It's a simple gravity fed operation using no electricity and no chemicals. The filtered water exceeds EPA drinking water standards removing 99.99% of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. That means E. coli, rotavirus, hepatitis A, giardia, and cryptosporidium. In case of a sudden interruption in water supply, I know I can run down to my local lake and filter myself and my family enough drinking water to keep us going for some time. That's peace of mind to me.As if that isn't enough, for each filter purchased, LifeStraw will provide one school child in Africa with safe drinking water for an entire school year.

"Blueberry Pet makes really quality pet products, and this collar is no exception. It's soft and very heavily padded. The colors and patterns are always so bright. I have the black and multicolored one with lime green latches. One thing I have to note is that the color itself has such a heavily padded fabric that it's a little difficult to adjust because you have to squeeze the fabric through the clips.  I ordered the small and still needed to adjust it down a bit. By the time I did so, the collar was extremely thick. For this reason, I feel this is an absolutely wonderful collar for a larger dog. You have a nicely padded neckpiece without the extra bulk that you have when cinching it down for a small dog. I still have to give it five stars for excellent quality, because when I extend it out completely, the bulk isn't an issue. I think it would help if the plastic latch and adjustments were a bit bigger to allow for the heavy collar fabric to move through more easily.

"My husband is really picky about what kind of wallet he'll carry and tends to use the same one till it literally falls apart. He likes something simple and slender...not bulky. This wallet is perfect for him. It's an attractive medium brown. It's closed dimensions are about 4 1/4 x 3 1/4 inches and about 7/8 inches thick when loaded. There are 8 pockets for credit cards/IDs, two long pockets for bills and checks, and pockets underneath the card slots as well. There's a flap that lifts up to reveal a framed slot for your driver's license. Holds everything he needs while still remaining slim.

"These are cute little plastic clips with a strong grip. I've had small and large clips that snap right in half easily. I took one of these Attmu clips and opened it over and over about 40 times (till my fingers tired), and it never broke. These are made to last. They come in a clear plastic jar with a screw-on lid. A great addition to your craft table. I plan to give some of them to my granddaughter for making jewelry. They're the perfect size for small projects. The backs are flat, so I tried gluing small magnets to a few of them and put them on my frig for hanging notes. That worked great, and they looked cute.My plan for the ones I keep are for Christmas. These are going to be just what I need to secure my keepsake ornaments to the Christmas tree. Every year I lose at least one that gets knocked off the tree, usually by the cat, no matter how carefully I think I've hung them. These strong clips will no doubt hold them securely and yet be small enough to not be seen.I was happy to receive these at a large discount in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOI0VE5UVXII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5AN00W#wasThisHelpful","RCOI0VE5UVXII","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well this LED light was snapped up instantly by my husband the minute he saw it on the kitchen table. He informed me that this was EXACTLY what he needed to work on his truck. He pointed out the magnets on the bottom and back that will hold it in place to free up his hands. He also pointed out that the light can be adjusted to a variety of angles, again just what he needed. The 32 LEDs are very bright, and there's a flashlight mode on the end for more direct light. There's also an emergency flashing mode if the need arises. He installed three AAA batteries (not included) and headed to the garage. I can say that he was very happy with the brightness, adjustability, and weight. The magnets were his favorite feature. Mine too. I didn't have to come hold a flashlight for him.

"These Glow Sticks are going to make great prizes at our local church's annual Harvest Party. The prizes for the games are usually candy...which children love, but it's fun to offer something more. Children  LOVE glow stick necklaces, and a bonus is the safety feature of making costumes more visible in the dark during trick-or-treating. For those people who like to find alternatives to candy to hand out  to your door-to-door trick-or-treaters, these would be perfect.There are 50 of them in a heavy cardboard tube, and there's a bag of connectors for making each stick into a necklace. You snap the wand in several places to ""activate"" it. I activated one about 8 p.m. last evening, and it was still glowing at 6 a.m. this morning...just not quite as bright. My husband pointed out that it was still glowing softly at 3 this afternoon. So your children will have plenty of enjoyment from their necklaces. I have a rather large neck, and the size was plenty big for me. A small child won't even have to disconnect the connector to remove it from over their head. It's safe of course, because the plastic connector would come apart if the necklace got caught on something.I was happy to receive these glow sticks in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G576RLCLCB7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URZ3STI#wasThisHelpful","R1G576RLCLCB7I","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found these small garbage bags to be so useful. I use them for garbage of course, and they fit the cans in my bathroom, office, bedroom, and laundry room. The plastic is heavier than those flimsy, fly-away bags that are hard to put in the trash can...like the ones they use in hotel rooms. These maintain their shape and stay in place. But here are a few more ways I use these little bags:I keep some in each car to collect the garbage that always seems to accumulate.I use them when I clean the kitty litter box.I put my shoes in a bag before packing them in my suitcase to keep my clothing clean.I bag shampoo and other liquids when traveling just in case of a leak.I take one along with a paper towel to scoop the poop when walking my dog around the neighborhood.I cover packages of meat in the frig when thawing to prevent drips.They're perfect for wrapping up that diaper for disposing of later (though I don't have diapers around anymore).I was happy to receive these at a large discount in exchange for an honest review.

"This daypack is a wonderful example of a company putting lots of thought into creating a pack that provides everything you need to carry a days worth of goods and keep it safe. Theres plenty of room for books, files, a laptop...whatever you carry with you to work or school. Its all protected by good padding and sturdy clips and zippers.The fabric is a combination of polyester and Dupont Kevlar. Kevlar is a synthetic fiber of high tensile strength used especially as a reinforcing agent in the manufacture of tires and other rubber products and protective gear such as helmets and vests. That would account for the anti-slash/anti-puncture quality. Each heavy-duty zipper is covered by a fabric shield that helps keep rain out and also makes it difficult for anyone to see where the openings in the pack are. Theres a large fabric shield that covers the opening of the main compartment. It would be a challenge for anyone to try to get into your pack without you noticing it while youre wearing it.For added security, you have three combination locks. Two of the locks have a TSA key access so that the airlines can access your bag if you check it during flights. These locks secure both large compartments of your pack. The third lock is a cable lock that allows you to lock your pack to a stationary object. Note: Pull the lock all the way out of the pocket so you can access both buttons to operate and reset the combination. Obviously someone with cable cutters could cut through this if they really wanted to, but this is intended for situations where you might want to leave your pack for a few minutes in a low-theft situation. For example, this is going to be absolutely perfect for my husband to use when he travels by Amtrak train a few times a year. He always has a carry-on bag that holds his laptop and other essentials. When he needs to use the restroom or run up to the dining car for coffee and will be away from his seat for a few minutes, he usually has to haul his carry-on with him unless he feels pretty confident that he can trust the people seated around him. This pack is going to allow him to lock up all his compartments and also cable lock the whole thing to his seat. You could do the same thing on a plane, allowing you to go to the restroom without worrying about leaving your bag behind. These locks are a GREAT feature.There are other handy mesh pockets for water bottles and larger phones (on the sides) and also two small pockets on the outside next to your body that could hold frequently used credit cards or a smaller phone. The shoulder pads are lightly padded, and theres a top handle for easy carrying. The shoulder straps are adjustable and curved to fit properly around your shoulder blades. They really have thought of everything.I also have to make note that according to the tags on the pack, this company has joined together with the African Children's fund to help support a campaign to get children back into school and have the opportunity to provide a better life for them and their families. Numinous Packs provides 15 school meals for the most vulnerable children in Africa for every Numinous backpack bought at retail. These packs appear to be from London, and the charity is a United Kingdom charity that Im not familiar with. However, I think the donation is a good cause worth mentioning.I was very excited to be offered the opportunity to review this daypack in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I have to say, I couldnt have asked for a better made or more secure travel pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31E61TOV3OO6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4P2FF8#wasThisHelpful","R31E61TOV3OO6K","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice set of dry face paints. I point out that these are dry because I've used some that are soft and wet and never actually dry enough on the face to keep from smearing. These start out dry and you add just enough water to your brush or sponge to make them glide on easily. Then they dry quickly and stay in place with a matte finish. I tried them out on my hand, but I plan to give these to my grandchildren to use for ""spirit week"" at school. I'm sure they'll use what's left for Halloween.The set has 9 very bold colors and a bonus silver glitter paint that I've never seen in previous kits. There are two brushes, one about a quarter inch wide and the other a fine point for more detailed work. There are three sponges, about 1 1/4 inches in diameter, that rinse out easily.The quality and coverage are very good.

"This is the first time I've ever used ceramic knives. I read up on them to understand the difference between these and regular stainless knives. Basically you just have to remember that these are made out of a zirconium oxide powder that is pressed with 300 tons of pressure into a knife mold, thereby making the blade. For this reason, you have to be careful not to cut into hard things like bones or frozen foods, and you can't use it to pry open things or smash hard spices. The blade is more fragile and can begin to develop chips. These are intended for slicing and chopping fruits and vegetables.The first thing I did was grab a tomato and begin slicing. This is always my way of testing the sharpness of a knife. Amazingly it sliced a nearly paper-thin slice with ease. I was impressed. I can't imagine these knives will be this sharp forever, but I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts. Each knife comes with a thick and sturdy blade sheath, much better than the flimsy cardboard that usually comes with even very expensive knives. That totally surprised me, and I think that is a smart feature.

"It's hard to describe how beautiful this set of prints is, as the pictures here can't do them justice. I was amazed at the color, the weight, the perfect framing, the work that went into making this wall art something anyone would be happy to hang in their home or office. Each section was individually and carefully wrapped so that it arrived in excellent shape. Not a crease or dent in any panel. The set is exact in size with corners that are perfectly square so that the three pieces make up a gorgeous continuous picture. You wouldn't expect such quality at this price. I have another picture in blue colors that would look great with this. Same water theme with adirondack chairs. I've decided to redecorate a room just so I can use these. The scene here is so peaceful. They've included three hangers for you to attach to the frames. These hangers are small, but each print is rather lightweight so they would probably be strong enough.I was absolutely thrilled to receive this set of prints in exchange for an honest review.

"This is my new favorite way to label things around the house. In particular, I keep items in shoe-box size (and larger) plastic containers, things like medicines, cleaning rags, soaps and other toiletries, craft supplies, candles, etc. Many of the containers aren't clear, so it's hard to identify what's in them sometimes. Labeling them with masking tape works, but it doesn't look very tidy. These labels actually decorate up my containers a bit, and I can wipe them clean and relabel as needed. I also have some Tupperware containers that hold large quantities of flour, sugar, and other pantry items. I've relabeled those using these chalkboard labels too.

"I have gray hair that has become somewhat coarse over the years. I hate to use conditioning shampoos, because my hair is also thinning and I need all the added body I can get. I was reluctant to try anything with the word ""oil"" in it for fear it would leave my thin hair even flatter than it already is. To my surprise, this shampoo and conditioner not only made my coarse, dry hair feel soft, it still left me with some ""lift"" at the roots. I love the tea tree fragrance which is mild and refreshing.

"I was surprised at the quality of this silicone cutting board. It's a full 1/4 inch thick, heavy, and sturdy. They say you can fold it to store it, but this heavy-duty board is really too thick for that. I just slide mine behind my toaster oven, and it's always ready to grab. There's a narrow channel all around the surface to catch any runoff. A tab for hanging is on one end, and a built-in handle is on the other. Both sides can be used for cutting. I've been using mine daily with very sharp knives for a few weeks now, and I can barely even tell I've used it. It's what you would call self-healing. It cleans up faster and better than any other type of cutting board I've owned, and I've owned them all. No stains, no odors. Easy to wash and easy to rinse. You can put it in the dishwasher, but it's so easy to sponge clean that I've never had to. They included two basting brushes made of acrylic handles and silicone brushes.

"This is the first piece of silicone bakeware that I've owned, and I love the way it works. I made corn muffins in it the other day. They turned out perfectly with NO burnt bottoms. I was really impressed with the ease of cleaning. My muffin tins are so hard to wash. I soak them and then put them in the dishwasher. They still come out crusty, so I have to wash them by hand again. Not this silicone. It comes clean without even soaking. I decided to make some mini meatloaves in it, and again they turned out great. I was always reluctant to make them because of the difficulty with cleanup. This is so much easier. I realize you have to make the added step of putting it on a baking sheet for stability, but that's a  small effort for so much less work.

"It took me four months to get around to writing a review for this watch. But on the plus side, I'm able to say that it hasn't lost a minute of time yet. I checked it with my computer then, and it's still accurate to the minute. And before I forget to mention it, my husband pointed out that this is a great watch for men who do either mechanical or electrical work. The fact that the body of it is made of resin and the band of a nylon fabric means no ""spark"" to short anything out. He knows from experience, but that's another story. My husband says the wide nylon band is really comfortable because the pressure of the band is spread over a larger surface area than your average metal band. The velcro closure is easy on and off.Besides those good points, I can say it's packed with all the bells and whistles. Huge easy-to-read time numbers, large day and date, continuous countdown seconds, alarm, regular and military time choices, and blue back-lit numbers for reading in the dark. It's supposed to be water resistant to 330 feet. Pretty amazing if you like to shower, swim, or snorkel with your watch on.

"What a great all-around sport watch. I love the soft rubbery resin band that fits so comfortably and feels good all day long. The metal on the buckle closure is flat and never feels bulky. I have an average size wrist, and there are four extra holes left, so a person with a large wrist would probably have no problem wearing this. The face is large but not overly large, and the digital numbers are black and easy to read. It has all the best features like the day of the week (a bit too small for my old eyes), the day of the month (much bigger), seconds that continuously count down unless being used as a stop watch, an alarm, and my favorite feature....backlit numbers for seeing what time it is in the dark. I LOVE that feature. The goldtone rings that surround the face give it a little dressier look. It's supposed to be water resistant to 330 feet so you can shower, swim, and snorkel with it on. I haven't tried any of that, but it's a great feature for those who would need it. I received this watch four months ago, and it's still absolutely accurate to the minute.

"This is a really lovely watch that is simple in design but elegant enough for dressier occasions. The oblong face is large enough to easily read. The bracelet is a smooth link style with a clasp that lays flat on my wrist with no bulky feel. There's an extension clasp attached that is easily removed for smaller wrists or if you prefer a tighter fit. Even though I'm a large person, my wrist is of average size. With the extension link, the bracelet fits loosely, so women with large wrists would probably find this a perfect fit. I decided to remove the link to keep it from sliding around. The face is a soft silvery tone, and the number marks are goldtone. There's a small genuine diamond in the ""12"" location. The case, band, and bezel are all made of brass. The two-tone is just beautiful, and the yellow gold color is soft making for a muted, barely noticeable, contrast. I've had this watch for almost 4 months now, and the time is accurate to the minute. It's supposed to be water resistant to 165 feet for swimming and showering, but I haven't tested that. I don't do either with a watch on, but that would be pretty convenient for those who do.

It's fun to put it in the color-changing and strobe modes, but I like to go to sleep with a steady soft color. This would be a really nice bulb for a child's room. You could let her/him pick their ""sleep color"" each night, and the color-changing mode would lull them to sleep.The remote is handy for changing the settings or turning it off silently without waking anyone up. At first I thought my remote didn't work, but then I realized there was a plastic strip in the battery compartment that needed to be removed for connection. Be sure to look for that. The LED bulb is sturdier than your typical incandescent bulb. I even dropped it on my dresser, and it still worked. This is a nice product that I was happy to receive in exchange for an unbiased review. I'm happy to say that it's a quality product and I use it every day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OB2FOGRZ0CEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105RUGDS#wasThisHelpful","R2OB2FOGRZ0CEG","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of filament for 3D pens arrived just in time to try out with my new pen. I was thrilled with the selection of colors. I put my creative granddaughter to work on trying it out, and she was able to make some adorable items like a small vase with flowers, some spiders, etc. This filament worked very well and melted appropriately. It actually goes a long way. The pen was from a different seller, and unfortunately it was not a quality 3D pen. It clogged and eventually broke. I'm planning on purchasing something of higher and sturdier quality and look forward to using this filament for more creative fun. I was happy to be offered this filament set in exchange for an honest review and can say that it worked well.

"The megaphones this company makes are of surprisingly good quality.  They're sturdy and heavy, not just a cheap piece of plastic. The handle folds down, and there's a nylon strap attached. Batteries are super easy to install by pushing a small button and opening the back of the unit, but it's difficult enough that a very small child probably wouldn't accidentally open it. There are two easy-to-use buttons; one for the siren and an on/off button for the megaphone. Voice sound is loud and clear, and the siren is plenty loud.  There's a volume control wheel to tone things down a bit. The police megaphone is just as cute, realistic, and well made.The only thing I would change is the strap attached to the handle. It would be better if this strap would unclip so that you could remove it when letting very young children play with it. They most likely will put the looped strap over their head to hand it around their neck. I definitely feel this could be a choking hazard and would cut the strap off. It won't affect the appearance or performance in any way.I was offered this really cool toy megaphone in exchange for an honest review and would certainly buy this item for a child's gift or a fun addition to an adult costume.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPZG32U6FGU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8C6I1W#wasThisHelpful","RHPZG32U6FGU3","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave these earphones to my grandchildren (both 14 years old, boy and girl) to try out, since they've used many pairs of gaming headsets. I asked them a few questions and will post them here.First, I asked how they liked the color (white). My granddaughter loved the white; my grandson was fine with it too. I was surprised since I assumed a 14-year-old boy would prefer black. My granddaughter pointed out that she especially liked the blue lights on each headpiece (""they're cool""). There's a USB plug that provides power just to those lights.I asked them the headset felt. Both said that they are very comfortable ear pieces and the foam on the head piece makes it easy to wear for a long time. They're also lightweight which they liked.They've used some very expensive headsets and yet said that the sound in these were good. Their friends had no trouble hearing them on the other end. Keep in mind that some laptops don't have microphone ports, so if you're buy these for a gift, you'll want to make sure that the recipient has a computer with both audio and microphone ports, which is of course why this is a ""gaming"" headset.Since these aren't the same quality of some $250 gaming headsets, I would normally give them 4 stars. But considering the price of these is so low, I'm giving it 5 stars for excellent value..","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFK7ANK4CAV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7F6KCW#wasThisHelpful","R1CFK7ANK4CAV1","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I received this motion sensor light, I was surprised at how small it was...only about 7 1/2 inches long by 1 1/4 inches wide. What was more surprising was just how much light this little thing put out. It has 10 bright LED bulbs that can completely light up a closet. It can also shed a decent amount of light on a larger area, such as a laundry room, when you just need to go in and out without the need for complete lighting.I like the idea of using LED lights in tight spaces, such as closets. Regular incandescent lighting puts out heat from a hot bulb, and I've always felt uncomfortable having a heated element such as that so close to my clothing or linens. No problem with these LED lights as they produce no heat.It's simple to operate. Just insert 4 AAA batteries in the slide-open door at the end and mount the sticky tape wherever you'd like. That's it. When the infrared sensor senses any movement, the light comes on and continues to stay on till no movement is detected. I counted about 14 to 15 seconds between the time I opened my closet door and the time the light went out.One nice feature is that the light is actually attached to the sticky strip by a magnet. This allows you to remove it for replacing batteries. It also lets you use the light like a portable flashlight if you need to. You could also just sit the light anywhere in the closet without using the strip. The aluminum case is heavy, sturdy, and feels well made.I was offered a sample of this light in exchange for an honest review, and I would recommend this product to anyone who would like some automatic lighting in enclosed, dark areas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVQKSTRR730G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ELG24W#wasThisHelpful","R3PVQKSTRR730G","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's nothing better than a long soak in a hot bath, and these bath bombs make it just that much more elegant. I love to drop one of these in the water and watch it fizzle away, faintly coloring the water and adding a gentle fragrance I can enjoy while I relax. There are six fragrances to choose from, and you pick the one to match your mood. I took a morning bath a few days ago, something I rarely do, and chose the coconut lime for a pick-me-up. These bath bombs make the water feel silky and leave the same feeling on your skin --- not greasy, just silky. When I'm  just soaking in the tub, I rinse off in the shower afterward, but I don't use soap. When I dry off, my skin still feels moisturized.

"This is a nicely made jump rope offered at a very reasonable price. Since it's advertised as being for kids (as well as adults), I like the fact that it has lightweight soft handles. One of the things I've found kids are tempted to do with jump ropes is grab the rope and swing the handles around, and that means an occasional smack in the face or shin. These handles are a lot safer in that regard, and they provide a great grip. The counter in the handle seems pretty accurate, but I can only jump a few jumps and therefore can't tell you if it stays accurate for long workouts. A big plus is the fact that you can easily adjust the length of the rope at each handle if you need to. A good feature for growing children.

"This is a beautiful copper mug that holds 16 ounces of cold beverage. The metal is ""hammered"" for that old colonial look. The handle is somewhat squared off and plenty large. I love the way ice cold water tastes in metal cups...just like those old aluminum tumblers of various colors we drank out of in the 50s. The high-gloss shine is most likely protected by a coating that, when washed off, would allow the copper to eventually develop a natural tarnish.

"I have a number of retractable dog leashes and have found them to be so much nicer than a regular standard leash that is always getting tangled around my dog or my legs. I have a somewhat small 17 lb. dog, and this leash is not only adequate but probably more than I need. I have the medium size, but I could get by with a small. That said, however, I always choose to buy the larger retractable leashes because I feel they're stronger and more dependable. I have one leash that uses a cord. It's strong, but it also ""snaps"" back at a dangerous speed. I like the way this ribbon leash retracts at a slower speed when unhooked. The handle is big and sturdy and has a rubbery grip. The lock/unlock button slides smoothly and easily. The fluorescent yellow ribbon makes you very visible...a great idea. The clip is big, heavy, and sturdy...much more so than others I have. I could easily use this to walk my daughter's three labs.I know some people have concerns about using retractable leashes, and I do understand that. I don't feel that these leashes are a good option for children to use, because they may not react quickly enough when the dog they're walking decides to run into the street or after another animal or person. It's important to be aware of how these leashes operate and be prepared to control them. But I do feel they're an excellent option for adult dog walkers.I was happy to receive this leash in exchange for an honest review, and I can say this is the best one I've owned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMGW7JKYV2YD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV27H8#wasThisHelpful","RMGW7JKYV2YD5","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This oral irrigator is an attractive unit, white with a blue water reservoir. It stands about 7 1/2 inches tall and 11inches when the pick is attached. The base is plenty wide, so it doesn't tend to topple over at all. It can be filled by opening the small fill spout, but that is a bit slow. It's a lot faster to slide the water reservoir down and fill it that way. I like that it doesn't use batteries and instead is charged with the included wall adapter. But you can unplug the adapter cord to use it cordless. It's very simple to operate. You just push one of the two included water picks onto the unit, push the ""mode"" button (normal, soft, pulse), and then push the ""on/off"" button. I only use the ""soft"" mode, as that is plenty strong.I definitely feel this irrigator does a good job of cleaning the gums and between the teeth. It would be good for anyone with dentures as well. The water reservoir holds enough water to get the job done, if you get right to it. Sometimes I refill it for a better cleaning. I use warm tap water.The set comes with two water picks, each one with a different color band. It took very little time to charge. I've never used an oral irrigator before, so I can't compare it with other brands. I've always wanted one, so I was very happy to receive this one in exchange for an honest review.

I have to assume that it might lose some of its power as the two AA batteries begin to drain.The attachments I tend to use the most are the make-up sponge and short soft brush. I wet the sponge/brush and then spin it on top of my bar of Dove soap. It picks up just the right amount of soap, and water doesn't run everywhere. I make this point because the tool is not waterproof or water resistant. For this reason you have to be sure not to use too much water. I also use the latex soft sponge to apply a facial cream all over my face and neck, and it's very gentle around the eyes on low speed.I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does lack a few things. The design of the ""on"" button makes it difficult to push upward. I have to use my fingernail to move it. The fact that it isn't at least water resistant concerns me, because this is a product that is being used with water and it would be easy to get water into the battery compartment. It's not like you're going to get shocked from batteries or anything, but it could damage the unit. Finally, there are 7 attachments, and it would be nice if there was a small bag included to keep everything in. Still, at such a reasonable price, you can't expect high-end quality.That being said, I think this facial cleaner would be a great gift for a younger child/preteen. It's small, safe, cute, and inexpensive. I think it would encourage kids to take facial hygiene seriously...preferably before they end up with a face full of acne. You could include a small vinyl or plastic bag to keep all the parts in. Any girl would love the pink, but I think a younger boy would be fine using this if you bought the blue one. I would caution them about overdoing the polishing attachment and pumice stone, but the rest of the attachments are all soft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJCP29V2CQB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKDUARQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QJCP29V2CQB5","A33PLZ7SD5MCG0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33PLZ7SD5MCG0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are very simple things that you yourself can do at home and implement into your everyday life to overcome depression and feel happier. Things like being active (exercising), being grateful, being creative--can all improve your lives.

With that being said, it's obviously terrifying to be put in that situation and overwhelming to try to figure out what to do next.

"This is a really refreshing book in the ""mystery/thriller"" genre, and I'm glad I picked it up. I found this book to be unique because it didn't quite start off like the books that I've been reading recently that are also in this genre! Instead of presenting the story first with an intense, high-adrenaline incident, the book started off relatively calmly--a meeting between Max Bowman, ex-CIA agent, and a client--Barry Filer. I actually quite liked this kind of mellow narrative for the beginning--there's a lot more opportunities for the suspense to build up, and once it does, it has a LOT more impact than the books that give it all away in the introductory chapters. Not to mention, this all gives the author plenty of time to flesh out the characters. In the beginning of the book alone, we meet Max, Barry, Howard, and Jules--all presented to us and characterized through vivid dialogue, description, and actions. I found that to be very compelling, and Max Bowman's narration (for the book is narrated by him) is interesting. I don't think I've ever read a narration from such a snarky main character, but it honestly adds so much to the book--for example, the descriptions in this book were never JUST descriptions--they're commentary. Take Max Bowman's description of Roosevelt Island, for example--It's not just a simple description of the place; his description had character, which made the place and the setting come alive.Overall, this is a book with a very compelling writing style and a plot to die for. Enjoy the ride--I certainly did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CGDABCJ2ZR23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013Z367WI#wasThisHelpful","R1CGDABCJ2ZR23","A2NCF92JQAOA8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NCF92JQAOA8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very unique book about Eurasians in India in the 20th century. Though the events happened less than a century ago, I still felt like I was being transported to a world that was entirely different, through this book. It was certainly interested to read the story of these women in this book, and I thought that the topic/setting of this book--Anglo-Indians and their lives--was something that was really interesting to dive into and read about.I think my favorite character in this book was Dolly. I saw her as fierce and independent, marrying James against her parents' will and living through the Depression and Independence movement in India. It was very interesting to read about since I don't know too much about it, and the author is very well-informed about this topic. Whether or not you're familiar with this historical time period, you will be able to enjoy it--no prior knowledge is necessary to know what is going on!This is probably one of the best biographical books I've read this year. It's captivating and so interesting that it reads like a novel. I loved getting to know this time period, the characters, and this gave me a lot of insight on the history of India and the people who lived there then.

Appropriately called a novelette, Half Past follows the story of Dolores, who, at the beginning of the book, has turned 40. While 40 for a lot of people means kids and fulfillment, for Dolores, it just seemed more and more like time is running out. She has no kids, no significant other, and though she has a great degree and stable job, we know early on that she was missing something from her life. Without giving away too much, this is a book about love and loss, a book about the ""almosts"" in our lives and a book about what ""could be.""One thing I really liked was the length of this book. A lot of short stories are not quite satisfying, and longer length novels sometimes take me hours upon hours to read. This book, I easily finished within 2 hours, and I enjoyed a full length story with well fleshed out characters. I liked getting into Dolores's head and really getting to know her character and history, and I think the author did a fantastic job with that too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123VUL5ODT7KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153JR0R8#wasThisHelpful","R123VUL5ODT7KR","A2NCF92JQAOA8E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NCF92JQAOA8E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book really helped enhance my reading experience with a chapter by chapter summary and analysis.

"I love the biblical background in this book. The Cub's Mistress is a first person narrative told in Moses's, a priest's, point of view. I was pleasantly surprised with just how realistic the backdrop of this book was, and how vividly the author developed this character and conveyed his every emotion and temptations. This book was throughly enjoyable, and the narrative was engaging. The character was fictional, but developed well and intertwined brilliantly with the culture of the time period and the setting.

"This is smaller than I expected, I ordered it to use in my husband's lunches as he travels several days a week. On the one hand this fits perfectly in his soft sided lunch bag Harley-Davidson Durable 6-Pack Bar & Shield Cooler.

It kept homemade chili hot for 4 hours.  I even like the color, it's a bit of glittery green and very pretty.I always handwash things like this and the opening is big enough to get a washrag or bottle brush into and there are no weird recesses to harbor mold.

"These were initially described differently so I didn't expect them to be so very small. At best they are for use as cuffs because there isn't enough length in the loops to go in the earlobe.

"This would make a great gift!! It came packaged with a bit of silk cocoon and information about it. I love silk pillowcases because I've read about how gentle they are on your face and hair. I have long curly hair and I can comb through my hair in the morning with ease, no more hunks of tangles!It's very soft and luxurious, I wash it in a lingerie bag with other delicates once a week. You could hand wash it, or put it on cold delicate gentle wash. I wouldn't use it in the dryer myself. It dries super fast!I I have used other pillowcases (satin) like this and the one thing this pillowcase has over most, is that the bottom is cotton. If you ever have used a silk or satin case the worst thing about them is that they slip all over your darned bed while you sleep OR they slip off the pillow. THIS ONE ZIPS so your pillow doesn't go anywhere from inside it, and the cotton bottom of the case catches on your sheet and doesn't slide all over.

"Where has this been all my life?!?!?!?!I have too many clothes to fit into my closet space (clothes hoarder!) so I have to divide by season. Summertime, I put the winter clothes away and label the plastic tubs ""WINTER CLOTHES"".  Then when Winter comes I take the tubs out, put the summer ones in, and turn the tub around so the sticker that says ""SUMMER CLOTHES"" is facing out. There are probably about ten plastic tubs. As you can imagine, when anyone else messes with my tubs it gets confusing. Nothing is more frustrating when I go to swap out closet space and there is a jumble of tubs where they've been knocked over and now I have to open each and every one. I never could figure out a better organizational system until these came up.ONE STICKER on the front. Wipe off, write new season, put away, and don't worry...!! I LOVE THESE STICKERS. I also started using them on my shoe boxes (shoe hoarder) instead of trying to put new labels over old ones over and over. (I can't find good clear shoeboxes cheap that actually have a lid that stays on----)  They have been handy to label clear plastic containers of 'ingredients' that I use and reuse in the pantry.

"This is the perfect solution if you want to set up a universal charging station somewhere in your house! I set one up on the breakfast bar in our kitchen. I was getting so sick and tired of everyone grabbing whatever cord they wanted out of my stash and then I couldn't find what I needed. We have an array of devices that use a PILE of different USB chargers, and the most common ones I just keep plugged into this on the counter and told everyone no more taking cords, leave your device.  What a relief!! It was so frustrating to need to charge something and having to track down whichever family member took the *^$(*%T cord I needed. This charges FAST as well.

Some are just adequate, very few are so great that we BOTH use the same one! (yes we have a couple in the shower that we rotate as they die, rarely do we use the same one as we like different things)  THIS speaker is so loud and doesn't distort at high volume---and instantly connects to both our phones--so this is our go to speaker at the moment.  It's all self-explanatory, easy to use, and I love that it takes a common charger and not a special cord. This happens to share the same charger as my Motorola headphones so what a bonus!The only reason I didn't leave it five stars is because I can't get the suction cup to hold for anything.

"I thought I'd be able to retire my 20 year old 3 qt. Hamilton Beach cooker that I use only for cooking whole chickens (fits perfectly) but this Crockpot is not deep enough for a whole chicken---but it WILL fit a whole cut up chicken!This thing is like a casserole dish on steroids. You can assemble your food in the 9x13 dish just like you are about to cook it in your oven. I made a batch of queso dip in this, normally I use my round Hamilton Beach crockpot but it's so deep that only the edges soften up first. With this rectangular shallow design my cheese and chili melted together perfectly without dried and burned spots in it!I LOVE the very secure rubber gasket on the lid also! You can latch the top down with liquids inside and it's not going anywhere while you travel. I love the timer feature (something my 20 year old cooker lacks)  I can't wait to use this at Thanksgiving and during entertaining, it will be perfect on the buffet on WARM to keep food ready to serve!!it comes with a little Cambell's recipe book as well. Very easy to use this neat Crockpot!UPDATE: Months later and I still can't believe how much we use this. My husband always grabs this one first if he's using a slow cooker recipe. Sure it's not that deep so you can't cook EVERYTHING in it but what it can do, is amazing. Another bonus I hadn't realized til lately is that the wide and shallow cooker design is perfect for meatballs or meatloaf. The deeper designs often make your meat boil in grease or liquid and this shallow concept actually lets your meats get cooked properly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z27AB911YVQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QY1NF0Q#wasThisHelpful","R1Z27AB911YVQ7","ARYSDAZNRXN6G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARYSDAZNRXN6G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this to make my nails longer, read below for how I do it. This method works for me with my equipment, your mileage may vary!I love this gel, it is self-leveling and I get smooth results!  This is HARD GEL, if you want something to just give your nails a little hardness then you can use STRUCTURE GEL.....it's softer. I'll do a review on that too.I had acrylic nails lately and they were a thick mess. Rather than go back and have them further butchered I bought this gel and now I do my own fill ins. Yes you can use this gel to do fill ins over acrylic nails! When the acrylics pop off (because that's how schitty a job the tech did) I just replace them with a dual form gel nail and they are slender and pretty and look like my own nails!This is what I use and how I do it.*GELISH  18G LED LIGHT: Yes it's expensive. Yes it's worth every dang penny! I wasted more than this costs, buying lesser quality lights. It works with every single gel polish I've tried. It never fails me and I can always count on whatever I use, working.  My instructions are based on my light and I can't be sure what results you'll have with other lights. I've watched Youtube videos of people doing these nails with other lights and their instructions didn't work with my light or they used much longer times.*HARMONY PRO BOND: Yes you want this instead of just the PH Bond. Don't try to sub alcohol or acetone for this. Just buy it. It's cheap and it lasts forever*DUAL FORMS: I got the 100 pcs for about $5, I'll try to put a link in my review.*HARMONY HARD LED BUILDER GEL: Make sure it's the hard builder and not structure*#6 nail brush*Gelish Foundation coat (what you use for doing the colored gel polish)*Very fine buffer squareStarting with clean nails----use the very fine buffer sponge and lightly buff your nails in a downward motion from cuticle to free edge. Just enough to take off shine. Wipe with alcohol then dab on Pro Bond. Let dry.Apply a thin coat of Gelish Foundation coat, cure 5 seconds in Gelish light.Select the dual forms that fit best on your natural nails---make sure they fit from side to side, edge to edge, without overlapping or having a gap. File to fit if you need to.One nail at a time, paint a light coating of Builder Gel inside the dual form. Place inside your light and cure 5 seconds.Paint another light coating of the builder gel inside the nail. Fit the nail to your finger and press gently--don't make the gel squish out. Make sure there are no bubbles under the form. Place the finger under the light and cure 30 seconds.Remove finger from light, grab form at end with tabs and gently work it side to side to remove the dual form from the nail. If the form is not damaged you can put it back in your box and use it again.At this point the form should release cleanly from the nail and you are left with a shiny nail. It may be soft-ish. That's where I do something I have not seen in any other how to: put the finger back under the light (now minus the dual form) and cure another 20 seconds.Trim nail to desired length.To paint just lightly buff with the sponge, use your foundation and color coats like normal. I get over a month of color with this method and just fill in as they grow out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199RU02MNJQ9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005P4NQJ8#wasThisHelpful","R199RU02MNJQ9J","ARYSDAZNRXN6G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARYSDAZNRXN6G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had sleep problems for decades, tried everything ever recommended in any magazine. Had a doctor tell me to take Benadryl. (Yeah love that 24 hour zombie feeling!!) Even tried Ambien for a couple of years but the stuff ""Ambien Angie"" did while on that is appalling. (I didn't know she was a gourmet cook until I woke up to a dirty kitchen with no recall of cooking!). I've been off the Ambien for 7 months and tried a Schiff Super Melatonin product that is 3 mg----it was better than the last time I tried melatonin 20 years ago and I've been using it.  I have been using the Ubervita for 4 nights now and I will not be reordering the Schiff!It says to take it 30 mins before bedtime, so I did. An hour and a half later I'm still trying to get to sleep so I wasn't thinking good things about this product. I woke up a few times in the middle of the night from some really disturbing and upsetting dreams, so the next morning I wasn't forecasting a good review on this.The last few nights though have been different. I know I'm in deep sleep because I am having vivid dreams and I'm remembering them. When I wake up I'm stiff because I've been sleeping like a log and not rolling over 100x a night like normal. I have even woken myself up snoring on my back and I'm typically a side sleeper. This morning was the first time in years that I was ready to get up when the alarm went off.I'm giong to use the rest of the bottle and I'll update if anything changes but at this point if it keeps working like this I will use it as long as they make it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMM52JI6O6U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NGUJ9WG#wasThisHelpful","RGMM52JI6O6U2","ARYSDAZNRXN6G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARYSDAZNRXN6G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product free for a review.In my opinion it is very natural to feel cynical about five star reviews praising a product that the reviewer received free.  I've done it myself so I know where you are coming from.  However, in this case the square storage containers passed every test I could throw at them and came up still worthy of five stars.  Go figure.This is what you will get from the standpoint of sizes.  The cup measurements are from me, not listed on the bottom of the containers with the other measurements and are approximate because I would never fill any container all the way to the tip-top because of the need for expansion of the food in the freezer.Size #1:  1.25L/42 oz/1.32 qt or approximately 4 3/4 cupsSize #2:  900 ml/30 oz/0.95 qt or 3 3/4 cupsSize #3:  700 ml/24 oz/0.74 qt or 2 3/4 cupsBelieve me, I put these containers through every kitchen torture test I know because I've had so many failures with other plastic sets and the national brands sold in grocery stores.  I put water in them and left them upside down on the kitchen counter on a towel all night to check for leaks.  I froze pot roast in the largest one and left it in the freezer for a week, then nuked it in the microwave.  No damage and the container was still firm and perfectly shaped when I took it out.  I put made-from-scratch banana pudding in the 3 3/4 cup size, snapped on that airtight lid and slapped my husband's hands for three days before I would allow him to dig into one of his favorite desserts.  The custard had no 'skin' on the top and the bananas had not turned dark.  I've kept tomato soup in the fridge for a day, frozen for 3 days, then defrosted and heated it in the microwave with no evidence of the bubbling and discoloration of the inside of the container.  I've placed the containers and the lids on the top rack of my dishwasher and put them through the normal wash and heated dry cycle multiple times and can see absolutely no warping of any of the pieces.  All are still firm and square.Honestly folks, I've run out of ways to prove this product is inferior.  The containers stack inside each other and sit on the lids in my cabinet.  Yes, I did have to give up some space to have room for them.  I'm sure I will miss those flimsy containers from the deli which no longer had a lid but I think that will be a long way down the road.  This is a quality product and I'm glad to have it in my kitchen.  You just can't recommend something any more than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NVCX708HAQRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YNZU90#wasThisHelpful","R1NVCX708HAQRY","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free for a review.I happen to be a skeptical consumer when it comes to plastic storage containers.  IF I buy the ones sold in grocery stores it's always with the thought in mind that they will be for a single use, no matter what the packaging may say.  All of that to let you know I approached this set of plastic storage containers with raised eyebrows and low expectations.  Whew!  Am I ever glad to say this set has met and exceeded all my expectations.  The one thing the product page doesn't do a very good job of is telling you the sizes you get so I'm going to give that information here.  The cup measurements are my approximate measurements because I would never fill a container to the brim, leave a little air space at the top - especially for items placed in the freezer.#1 size:  2L/68 oz/2.11 qt---approximately 8 cups#2 size:  1.25l/42 oz/1.32 qt---approximately 4 3/4 cups#3 size:  700ml/24 oz/0.74 qt---approximately 2 3/4 cups#4 size:  3.25ml/11 oz/0.34 qt---approximately 1 cupI put water in each container, used the ""click"" closure, turned them upside down on a towel and went to bed.  In the morning.....no leakage at all.  I then repeated this leak test after each container had been in the freezer for at least 48 hours (some up to a week) and after each had been used in the microwave and gone through a dishwasher cycle with heated drying.  Still no leaks and the ""click"" closures are nice and firm.One of my ultimate tests involves red sauces, a plastic container and a session in the microwave of at least one minute - in one case it was almost five minutes - to see if that dreaded rough, red ring would form on the inside of the container.  Nope, clean as a whistle for both barbecue sauce and red pasta sauce.  The creamy cheese sauce in the container worked wonderfully also.  Plus I love the fact that these containers don't come out of the microwave squishy soft.  The container still felt firm and strong even straight from the extended time it took to warm up five cups of beef vegetable soup.Believe me, I've put these containers through my personal torture tests and they have come out smelling like a rose - not like the garlic salad dressing I kept in one for three days in the refrigerator.  I almost hate to give the product five stars because consumers (such as myself) tend to think something received free is going to automatically garner a five star rating.  No, not from me it won't.  However, try as I might, I just can't find anything wrong with this set of 4 round plastic containers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3MKHKXL19AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013YNZRXE#wasThisHelpful","R1V3MKHKXL19AT","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After seeing her three girlfriends killed, then being held hostage by that psychopath, Evelyn Talbot decides to devote her adult life to trying to understand why they do the horrible things they do. Now a Psychiatrist, Evelyn has received the funding necessary to build an institution devoted completely to trying to unravel the psychopathic mind. Her Hanover House is being located outside Hilltop, Alaska and Evelyn is making the final preparations to leave Boston and take up her position as head of Hanover House. Unfortunately for her, the person who terrorized her years ago has found her again.The author describes this prequel as a long novella and at almost 200 pages I can certainly agree with that. Readers will have a full understanding of what came before the beginning of WHITEOUT, the first full length novel in this series which will be released in September 2016, with a second due out in September 2017. This novella zeros in on an area of psychiatry which I am very curious about and since the author has obviously done a lot of research to craft not only her characters but also the facility to house them, it will be interesting to watch how she handles the subject.There is a sneak peek at the first chapter of WHITEOUT in this novella along with the first chapter of THE SECRET SISTER.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILXLZB5TFYZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013F9NVY4#wasThisHelpful","R3ILXLZB5TFYZC","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read many of the Burren mysteries by Cora Harrison set in 16th century Ireland I already knew how well she writes and how interesting and challenging her plots can be. I was eager to find out how a more modern character, a Catholic Reverend Mother, would fare in a more modern time setting, here in Cork, Ireland of the early 1920s. I found some positives and some negatives which caused me to enjoy the story only a moderate amount. I do think I would be willing to read a second book in the series but I'm not breathlessly awaiting word of its publication date.Reverend Mother Aquinas is the head of St Mary's of the Isle convent who finds the body of a dead young woman close by the convent chapel. The victim is obviously a member of the upper echelon of Cork society as evidenced by her expensive clothing, Rev. Mother sends for her friend Sergeant Patrick Cashman of the civic guards, the equivalent of a policeman in the turbulent political world of Ireland at this time. It is obvious the young woman has been washed ashore on the flood waters caused by heavy rain just as it is obvious she was in attendance at the social function of the year the previous evening, the Merchant's Annual Ball. What is found in her evening bag will rock the Cork social world's foundations.I enjoyed reading the novel, but it wasn't as engrossing as I had expected it to be. The Rev. Mother has been established at over 70 years of age in order to fit her place into the history of the events which take place in this novel. That also makes some of the things she does seem out of character or to be difficult for her to do. Being over 70 in 2015 is quite different from what it most likely would have been in 1923. Also, the character of the Reverend Mother is not very well established as to her duties in the convent. She is in charge of the convent yet seems to have unlimited amounts of time to spend on investigating while spending very little time attending to her job. She also doesn't show a very religious nature which I would certainly expect from the nun in charge of a convent. Probably the most obvious problem I had with the story was the blatant disclosing of clues which would form the entire focal point of the mystery. If I could see that answer so early in the novel, why in the world did it take those investigating it so long to catch up? As I said before, I would probably give a second novel a try if this becomes a series. I just won't be waiting impatiently.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDXF08RLN3J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130C8YIO#wasThisHelpful","R1IDXF08RLN3J5","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pair of cargo shorts by Wrangler definitely fall into the casual category.  The pockets are many (9) and most of them are made to hold a lot of items.  (That means they are big.)The fabric is well softened so the shorts are not stiff at all.  This pair is size 38 and if my husband had been trying them on in a store he would have gone down to a size 36.  He has to wear a belt with these or they won't stay up.  The color is a dark gray.  My husband is tall, over 6', and the shorts cover his knees.  Perhaps this pair is mis-sized or this particular Wrangler Cargo shorts style just runs large.  The shorts themselves are very well made with Velcro type closures on all pockets except the two front slash pockets.  The shorts have the metal closure in the waistband.As long as you want to wear these shorts exclusively as sporty, active wear they will work fine.  If you want to try to iron them to get all the wrinkles out of that excess pocket fabric.......good luck.  They went through the washer and dryer just fine, but they do come out wrinkled.  To go do his exercising in, they will be great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQARCXN90APT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKYLKFM#wasThisHelpful","R1GQARCXN90APT","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I took this shirt out of the plastic packaging I was impressed with how soft the flannel is.  This is one of those shirts that will be worn a lot because it isn't such heavy weight that you can only wear it in the extreme cold of winter.  I can see this being a favorite to wear around the house with a nice t-shirt on underneath to give just enough warmth as the days begin to cool down.  I like the blue indigo color, it is a rich, deep color and not faded at all.  This size is the XL and the fit through the body is not snug, but it definitely isn't cut to be full either.  The sleeves are exactly the right length for my husband who has long arms so I will be watching this shirt carefully as I launder it more times.  I'm hoping the sleeves won't shrink even if they will usually be worn rolled up.  So far it has gone through the washer and dryer once and come out looking great.  The two patch pockets don't match the pattern lines of the shirt so that's a little distracting, but acceptable for a casual wear shirt.  This is the first Wrangler flannel shirt for my husband and I'm definitely impressed so far.  The seaming and finishing of the shirt are well done, the buttons are sewn on securely, and the buttonholes are stitched all around and fit the buttons.All in all, a good flannel shirt for casual or work wear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMVOMLSL8B42S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH7J7NO#wasThisHelpful","RMVOMLSL8B42S","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm finding myself in the ""caught between star ratings"" situation with this book. I've read some novels by Anne Perry before but they were in a different series. This was my first reading of a novel featuring William Monk and his wife, Hester. The mystery was definitely not a standard murder mystery plot and in the beginning I thought there would be two plots taking place simultaneously, one featuring Monk and one Hester. That situation with Monk simply ended with no resolution for what had happened at all. I waited through the entire book to get an explanation which never came. That wasn't expected, nor did I like it.  If I had more choices I would assign this book 2.5 stars.The plot line involving Hester is the primary story of this book with her finding herself unwillingly involved in experiments carried out by a rogue chemist to develop blood transfusions. She finds herself so conflicted by her outrage over being kidnapped to help with the experiments and yet her knowledge as a nurse of how priceless the use of blood transfusions would be to medical practices. So the first half of the novel is taken up with these two non-connecting story lines and then a seemingly whole new set of characters are added in. If you are a follower of this series, you will know if these are new characters or not, but it felt strange to suddenly be presented with them at this stage of the novel. I felt as if I was standing out in left field all alone.This book was alright, just not so good that it made me want to go back and read all the previous books in the series. I felt that Hester and Monk were both a little distant as characters for me to try to fully understand them and my curiosity was not engaged at all to uncover their histories. If you are already a fan, I'm sure you will enjoy it. If you are new to the series, it might be a better idea to start with the first book so you understand how Monk and Hester met and formed their relationship. Unless you want to come stand with me out in left field so I won't be alone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HIXE4PI8CHO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391380#wasThisHelpful","R2HIXE4PI8CHO8","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item free for review.This waterproof case will hold an iPhone 6 without having to remove it from the protective case.  If any other item is to be placed in the case, you really need to take the phone out of any protective case.  This product has come in very handy for my husband when he goes on long walks and he enjoys using it very much.  I find it to be heavier than I am comfortable wearing so I prefer to use something like a waterproof belt when keeping track of valuables in as small a space as possible.  The case is very well made and the snap closures do snap very securely closed; in fact I have to have help getting them opened again.  My husband doesn't have that trouble so he is now the one who uses this Frieq bag.  The product comes with a lanyard in case you want to use the waterproof bag that way.  There is a jack attached inside the pouch to plug into your phone and then a plug on the outside for ear buds if you want to listen to music or a book as you exercise.This is a quality constructed item which will give you waterproof protection for your expensive phone.  Some of the family members are already thinking about borrowing it when they go on their next canoe trip.  That would be a great use for this product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TAAC8FNLMKJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTWNIH2#wasThisHelpful","R2TAAC8FNLMKJG","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free for review.This waterproof bag is one of those items you appreciate more and more the longer you use it.  The belt is very well made with two types of closures to make sure the items inside stay dry.  After you put in your items you push out as much air as possible, slide closed the plastic ""zip"" type of closure then roll the top down so the two pieces of Velcro meet to form a complete closure of the bag.  That ""zip"" type closure can be pretty fiddly to work with and it doesn't always close securely so make sure you have that working properly before you trust that the bag is really waterproof.  Also, if you put too much in the bag you will not be able to roll the top down so the two Velcro strips meet.My husband and I use the bag to hold different items.  He carries his iPhone 6 easily in the bag without having to remove the protective cover from the phone.  He also puts in his car keys.  It will not hold his phone and his wallet.  When I'm using the belt I put in house and/or car keys, a credit card and a small amount of cash.  The belt is approximately 34 inches fully extended, but then it stretches, so up to a 40 inch waist is no problem.  You can wear the bag in front or around on your back plus it easily goes under a t-shirt.  If you are wearing a jacket the bag doesn't show at all when you place it under a shirt or blouse.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX30J6FCQDD82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTWD9QM#wasThisHelpful","RX30J6FCQDD82","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product free for review.Both of my German Shepherd dogs are showing their age.  Both are rescues but we know one is 11 years old and the other is probably 8 or 9.  Both dogs are beginning to show signs of joint problems, the older, heavier male quite a bit more than the female.  We decided to try the liquid Glucosamine supplement and have seen really good improvement for both dogs.  This is the first bottle of Dog Dream we have tried and I'm glad to say the quality is excellent.  This is a glucosamine, chondroitin, and MSM formula which we use twice a day.  One of my dogs weighs 85 pounds and the other 100 pounds so they both get 2 teaspoons of the liquid twice per day.  Even using a combined 8 teaspoons per day this 32 fluid ounce bottle goes a long way.  I usually plan to re-purchase the product about every thirty days.  The instructions say to refrigerate the container once you have opened it and I also give it a little shake before measuring out the dosage because the liquid will separate as it sits.  Neither of my dogs objects to the taste at all and even though the female has a very delicate digestive system, we haven't had any tummy upsets since using the liquid glucosamine.I'm glad to have found a product which will make my dogs more comfortable as they get older.  Nothing that I've found can stop the joint problems from happening as a dog grows older, especially large dogs such as my Shepherds, but it makes me feel better knowing I am giving them something that is making it easier for them to go up and down stairs, get into the car, and get up from off the floor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIC9227EFLOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XZQUYMK#wasThisHelpful","RIIC9227EFLOZ","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What the manufacturer means when they say this fan is 100% Recycled is that everything (except the motor) is made of plastic.  This makes the fan  very lightweight which in turn makes it easy to move around.  There are the high, medium, and low settings and the fan will tilt to any position you want and stay there.  You can even position it so the air is blowing straight up.  Assembly of the fan only requires that you snap the two feet into position, plug it in, and turn it on.  When the fan is on the lowest setting I can still feel the air moving when I am 20 feet away.  We find this fan on the low setting to be so quiet that it does not interfere with our television watching.  This 20"" fan is especially nice to have outside on the porch because it means that area can be used more in the Southern heat of August.If you are looking for a lightweight, quiet (especially on the lowest setting), efficient way to move the air around in specific spaces in your home, this fan will fit the bill for that.  I'm already thinking about how I can use it to help shorten the time it takes for the carpet to dry when I have to spot clean from doggy accidents.  This is an appliance I am expecting to get a lot of use out of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNA4BDFIAYLMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLXSF2U#wasThisHelpful","RNA4BDFIAYLMJ","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People kept telling me I would love these Bose in-ear headphones and while I did believe them, there is just nothing like experiencing them for yourself.  They have given me nothing but quality sound and usability so far and I'm looking forward to that continuing for a long time to come.  I didn't understand that the three sizes of earphone tips have nothing to do with the physical size of the user so it took me three tries to figure out that the large size is perfect for the configuration of my ears.  Please be sure you try all three sizes (small-white, medium-gray, large-black) to get the best quality sound possible for you.  On the cord there is a control for volume up and down and the center button is for beginning and ending telephone calls and moving back or forward when listening to music or audio narration.  The mic is on the back of this set of controls.  The cord also has a tiny clip for your clothing, but that didn't stay attached very well for me.  There is a definite right and left designation for the tips and I find that easy to keep up with by making sure the Bose logo is facing outward where the two sound cords join.  These headphones come with a tiny storage case (good quality, I just hadn't realized it would be so small) which holds the headphones as well as the two extra sets of ear tips.iPhone testing:  I don't use a cell phone so I asked my husband if I could borrow his phone for the morning to test out these headphones.  Then I asked some friends and family members to call me so I could experience the hands-free aspect of the headphones.  The sound quality was excellent, it was easy to receive and end calls once I became used to finding where the control center sits when I have the headphones in, and I was able to adjust the sound volume easily.iPod testing:  I used the headphones for listening to music and for listening to an audio book.  In both cases it was pretty easy to use that central control button for skipping a song or repeating a portion of the book narration I had missed.  This is definitely going to be where I use these headphones the most.iPad testing:  I used the headphones to watch a movie and several episodes of an old television comedy series and they worked very well.  The sound quality was absolutely amazing.I'm not usually very interested in ""sound"" quality but it was very apparent that the sound I hear through these headphones is excellent.  Unfortunately for me my husband is very interested in sound quality and I've already had to use the ""ownership"" card to get my headphones back.  Interesting how they somehow became public property.

"I absolutely love this bag.  It is definitely a backpack, but with the handle on the top you can also carry it at times like a large purse or book bag.OUTSIDE:Made from heather blue boiled wool with gray leather closure straps and gray woven web for the backpack straps and handle.Unbuckle the main compartment and you will find an industrial size gray zipper with a leather zipper pull.The two lower straps on the front are decorative but the flap opens to roomy storage with a magnetic closure.The two buckles on the sides are decorative only.The entire back is boiled wool so it is smooth against your body.The backpack straps are 1 1/2 inches wide and adjustable so the bag sits where you want it on your body.INSIDE:There is one deep main compartment lined in a soft vinyl type of fabric, a muted burnt orange with orange and gray dots.One deep zipper compartment.Two deep pockets.One strap with a metal clasp for keeping track of your keys.The outside of the bag is very attractive with the soft, supple leather, vintage style hardware, and the boiled wool fabric.  The stitching is very even and all the seams are completely finished off.  I'm not positive what the lining material is (I suspect vinyl) but it looks as if it will resist moisture and stains.  No information about the lining material came with the bag.  One of the leather patches on the front has the name of the brand (Sherpani) but this bag is one of those understated accessories which will catch everyone's attention!  The bag is definitely roomy because I have put three bulging file folders in it and could still easily fold down the flap and buckle it closed.  I've also put in a 1 1/2"" three-ring binder which was full of notebook sheets.  That was a little harder to buckle.  In both cases there was still plenty of room for a phone and personal items.  This would also carry a tablet, e-reader and/or small laptop with no problem.  Or you could go in a totally different direction and use it for an overnight bag for a casual trip or even carry it as a purse when you go shopping.  The product picture was a little misleading for me because I was expecting more of a briefcase style which could also be worn as a backpack.  Instead, the bag is longer than it is wide.  The dimensions are given on the product page, but once I saw the picture I wasn't paying attention to the measurements.One final super good thing.....this bag comes with a lifetime warranty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMPAURD501UM0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUGICCW#wasThisHelpful","RMPAURD501UM0","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always amazed at how an author can change the 'voice' of their novels from one book to another. I have read many of the Elly Griffiths novels featuring Ruth Galloway and have enjoyed them very much.  The Zig Zag Girl has an entirely different feel to it.  Not just because this one is set in 1950, but also because this one isn't as stark and it doesn't verge on the darker feelings I get from the Galloway novels.  Even though this book has the focus on murder, and the first murder is especially brutal, there is still a lighter feeling about this set of characters.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there are magicians and comedians and stage performers involved which kept the book from getting that oppressive feeling that can happen with murder mysteries.There are two main characters in the novel and they are quite different but each has strengths needed by the other.  At this stage in the series there is no partnership between these two, they are just reunited from their days of serving in the military during World War II.  This particular mystery very obviously concerns the group they were in during the war and now that one is a policeman and one is a famous magician they team up to figure out who is killing off the members of their old unit.  Someone has every intention of extracting revenge for something that must have happened during the time the team spent in Scotland.I liked this novel well enough to look forward to the second book in the series.  One of the major characters was a little weaker than I would have liked and I hope that will be addressed in the next novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZ943ADBWET0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544527941#wasThisHelpful","R3SZ943ADBWET0","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is going to be a good product for us to use to change up the food flavors in our dogs bowls.  We use canned food as something to perk up jaded appetites at the early morning feeding when the dogs get tired of the kibble they are eating and there is still 10 pounds left in the 28 pound bag.  Using this Nutro adult food with chicken, rice and oatmeal has been a good addition for us.  I have two large dogs so it would be extremely expensive to try to feed canned food exclusively, but by putting some of this in their morning food bowl and adding water to it I make a gravy that then moistens and flavors the dry kibble.  The dry food we give them is high quality but the dogs have 'trained' us to augment their picky palate with an equally high quality wet food.  This Nutro is working well.  The food is ground so don't expect to see recognizable pieces in the food, however, it really does smell like chicken or chicken stock.  According to the label if you are going to use this as the exclusive food for your dog, you should feed between 1/3 to 2/3 can per 10 pounds of body weight.The positives about this food is that our dogs both really enjoy it, there have been no tummy upsets since they have been eating it, and according to the label, there is no hidden corn meal.  This food is not the major component in their diet so I would be very surprised if it began to have any negative or positive effects on their skin and coat.  This is a great way to supplement the feedings for our dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NNOYS0N2SMCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZSENWE#wasThisHelpful","R3NNOYS0N2SMCT","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was amazed at all the information in this book.  Concentrating on the types of poisons used by Agatha Christie in her novels had to be pretty much a labor of love for British chemist Kathryn Harkup because you can tell immediately that she is also a fan of this great icon of crime fiction.  The book is written from the British point of view with changes in book titles noted for the American market.  I really had my doubts that this subject matter could be presented in such a way that it held my attention for the time it took to read the book, but by the end I found myself wishing there was just one more chapter.  But then I would have wanted another and another.The book is very stylishly presented with artwork which is wonderfully evocative of the 1930s art deco style that I somehow assign to the Christie novels even though they were not all written during, or for, that time period.  Maybe the really good television series has something to do with that.  Each chapter deals with one specific poison beginning with arsenic, then belladonna, cyanide, digitalis, eserine, hemlock, monkshood, nicotine, opium, phosphorus, ricin, strychnine, thallium, and veronal.  Each chapter leads off with a brief synopsis of the major novel, or in one instance a short story, the author will be using as an example of the use of that specific poison, then moves on to the story (history) of the poison, how the poison works in the body to kill, whether there is an antidote, some real-life cases, and then how Christie used the poison.  I had been afraid the chemistry associated with where the poison comes from and how it works within the body would have been either too technical or too boring for me to enjoy.  Wow, was I ever wrong.  I discovered all kinds of wonderful facts.  This book is wonderfully readable by those of us who aren't trained in the science of chemicals.  Plus Kathryn Harkup has a very wry sense of humor which caused me to get some strange looks when I was sitting in a doctor's waiting room laughing out loud while reading a book about poisons.  Let's just say the chairs on each side of me became vacant when someone asked what book I was reading.  This is the type of book Agatha Christie fans will keep right on the shelf with all their copies of the novels for reference during future re-readings of the novels.  Because let's face it, if you love Agatha Christie novels you don't read them just once.Another fascinating section of the book is Appendix 1: Christie's Causes of Death.  This is a chart listing each novel and short story written by Agatha Christie and the method of the murder in that story.  Sometimes, with multiple victims there are multiple murder methods.  I found this absolutely fascinating and used the list to make sure I do own each story Christie wrote.  Actually I own them multiple times over, but there is no need to go into my personal addiction here.In discussing how Christie used the poisons the author has revealed some spoilers, but she always warns the reader to skip ahead to another section if they aren't familiar with the story and don't want to know who and how.  I really appreciated how Harkup complimented Christie on her thoroughness and knowledge when it was warranted, but she didn't hesitate on several occasions to point out that Christie had gotten some things wrong.  Interesting for me was how seldom Christie made mistakes in her information.This book is most definitely aimed at the devoted Agatha Christie fan.  I found it fascinating and if you didn't, well........I challenge you to a duel with the infamous Calabar bean!Added Sept. 10, 2015:  I received this book as an ARC through the Amazon Vine Voices program.  Often ARC copies don't hold up very well over time and they will have portions omitted because it is not the shelf-ready book.

"There is a new edition of this novel by the British Library Crime Classics and Poisoned Pen Press released in 2015.I thought this was a wonderful book but that is probably because I am a fan of the older mysteries and enjoy seeing how authors approached the genre in its young days. In this case, not just an infant but practically it's birth day. You might appreciate this novel more if you forget about it being billed as a detective novel because it definitely is not that. Instead you have an investigation presented from the point of view of an investigator for an insurance company into the death of someone the company he works for insured. As you read more and more of the letters, journal entries, statements and reports compiled by Mr. Henderson you watch his case build up.The first of the letters concerning the characters were dated in the 1830s and the story concludes in about 1856. Watching Mr. Henderson line up his evidence regarding Baron R** and the mysterious happenings going on with those whose lives he touched was fascinating for me. Granted, this style of novel can be rather bland and dry but if you appreciate watching an expert gather his evidence you will be more likely to enjoy this novel. Knowing this story was published in 1865 gives readers a wonderful example of how the genre has evolved over time and how remarkable it was for Charles Warren Adams to have written this ""first"" so well. This is a novel for the reader who enjoys the language of the Victorian era and the meticulous gathering of evidence and presentation of that evidence in summary form.

"For me, this novel had such a thin mystery plot that it almost didn't even qualify for that genre designation. If Pru Parke had insisted on straight answers to her questions the first time she asked them the entire story would have fallen apart and the book would have then consisted of nothing but the romance portion. I don't read mystery novels for romance portions.Approximately one fourth of this novel is concerning a mystery and the remaining three fourth is all about Pru and Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Pearse with London's Metropolitan Police. Pru has taken a job researching the authenticity of a portion of a rare horticultural journal excerpt so she and Christopher are apart for the three months the job is supposed to last. The person Pru is supposed to report to makes it very clear he is dissatisfied with her and on we go from there.Don't worry if you haven't read the previous two novels in this series, they are very well detailed so you will be able to pick up the threads of the relationships Pru - originally from Dallas, Texas - has made in England.

"Evidently I like to read novels in the horror genre which have a completely different emphasis on that subject matter from what I found in this book. I prefer the author to use subtlety and finesse to illustrate their craft, not bludgeon me with a sledgehammer. I understand this is not the first book in the Harry Erskine series, but as far as I can tell it isn't necessary to have read any previous books prior to starting this one.The novel is treated almost as two books with Professor Anna Grey, a research scientist at Saint Louis University Hospital featured in one portion. She is trying to find an antiviral medical solution to an aggressive virus which is attacking people all over the Saint Louis area. As her research and investigation continues she finds the victims have been bitten by bedbugs before they become ill and die horrible deaths. The second portion has Harry Erskine in southern Florida plying his trade as a fortune teller who does something really stupid and gets himself kicked out of the state. I only kept reading this book to find out when in the world these two portions of the novel would finally intersect. I had to read all the way to chapter 25 before Anna and Harry met to fight this gosh-awful plague of blood and gore; there are only 28 chapters in the entire book!I didn't enjoy reading this at all, it simply isn't the style of horror novel I enjoy. I can understand the use of the profanity and sexual references used in the novel, principally by the demons, but the two sexual episodes in the Anna Grey segments were offensive and repulsive to me.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZ6KBNUL7DFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SWR4BM#wasThisHelpful","R1XZ6KBNUL7DFB","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I discover that a novel is set in 1829 in an area of small villages in Worcestershire I have come to expect certain things from that novel. I love to read historical mysteries and especially those where the author has conveyed the time period and the atmosphere existing among the various levels of society. What I do not expect is to find the ""f"" word thrown around by the villagers as if they are impelled by some psychological malady to use that word repeatedly, by men and women alike. It was not only unexpected, it became a serious detraction from the novel for me. I've not read any previous novel by Sara Fraser so I have no idea if this profanity is common in her historical mysteries. I also felt very uncomfortable with the villagers being so needlessly cruel and harsh in their attitude and treatment of Constable Thomas Potts. These two devices used by the author caused me to only marginally enjoy the novel even though I think she used some interesting and different elements to cause her criminal activity to take place.I'm giving this novel three stars, but I would definitely tell any friend of mine the drawbacks which kept me from liking this book and certainly will keep me from reading previous or future novels in the series.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D6CHDWKFMDTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010SWR430#wasThisHelpful","R3D6CHDWKFMDTY","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the Acknowledgements section of this novel the author describes his main character as mouthy and recalcitrant. Who am I to differ with the author? Quintilian Dalrymple is a new character for me and I was fascinated by this world of the city-state of Edinburgh in 2033. A lot has changed, but the Council of City Guardians has come to realize they were holding the reins in just a bit too tightly on the regular Citizens, so the ban on football (among other things) was overturned a few years back. The revival is most welcome to the citizens but the Guardians can't possibly let them become aware of what was found in the center of the pitch in one of the stadiums. Call in Quint Dalrymple, demoted a long time back down to the rank of just plain citizen. Quint's job is to solve the riddle of the object found on the pitch without disturbing the bustling tourism industry that is keeping Edinburgh's financial head above water. He certainly can't let gang warfare or an upcoming referendum to rejoin Scotland get in his way.This story was especially interesting to me since it deals with how this individual city had coped with the collapse of the governing countries as we know them now. I have to say this imagined world sounded perfectly logical to me. Not that I would want it, but I can certainly imagine it turning out this way. The character of Quint was a pleasure to watch unfold along with his sidekick Davie. There is a lot of humor in the book along with Quint's love of blues music. The only criticism I have is that Quint made a lot of declarations of probable wrongdoing only to have the challenged person respond with ""prove it"" and there was not any proof.

"Yeah, the Youth Boost is working!  I'm 72 and now my hair doesn't look a day older than 69!!  Seriously, though, if you shampoo and style your hair every day this product is probably going to be just as good for you as other mousse hair styling products.  At first it is a little hard to know how much to use and that isn't helped by the fact that I get a different amount of mousse in my hand each time I press the dispenser.  I'm hoping that will even out as I use more of the product out of the can because I feel I am wasting a good bit -- I seriously don't need all the mousse that is being dispensed right now but it is so hard to control.I apply the mousse to towel dried hair and work it through before combing.  I like to allow my hair to dry naturally, but for the first time using this product I did use a hair dryer.  There was definitely more volume when my hair was dry and it actually was quite a bit softer.  I don't shampoo every day so now I just allow my hair to air dry each time.  I get exactly the same results with and without a hair dryer.  Unfortunately, the added volume seems to only stay in my hair for the first day.  The softness stays really well and the mousse isn't causing my hair to become oily between shampoos.  I do not notice any particular scent, but since I have just finished using a tea tree oil shampoo which has a wonderful minty smell, I might not notice anything from the Tresemme unless it was just overpowering.Overall I will definitely use the remainder of the product in this can and buy another to have it as a ""sometimes use"" alternative to the product I use most often.  The container is very stylish looking with the combination of the black and lavender colors so it looks nice sitting out on the vanity.  Really, this works as well as any regular hold strength mousse I've used before.  A nice addition to my product shelf.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JS4K6TJV4C1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJOCQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JS4K6TJV4C1","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is why I wanted to read this book: there is a teen in my family with this diagnosis and I wanted to understand more about the condition. Ive never read any other books on this subject.The first five chapters are introductory to a great extent, but they do put some emphasis on young children and teens with this diagnosis and how the number of kids now having this designation has grown to nearly epidemic proportions. Dr. Archer provides some good ideas for how families can learn to incorporate their treatment plan of an ADHD child within their family. He discusses when he feels medication is most appropriate and when it might be better for the child to not medicate. He also discusses the do medicate/do not medicate issue regarding adults. He comes down probably a little more firmly than I had expected on the non-medicated side. There is a test within this section to find your personal number if you know you are ADHD or if you just suspect you might be. I'm afraid this test might make it easy for someone to come up with their own diagnosis concerning ADHD. Frankly, none of this information was new to me simply from standing on the sidelines and watching one daughter deal with ADHD children in her teaching classroom and the other daughter exploring every avenue for her child with ADHD.Beginning with Chapter 6, what stands out to me the most was Dr. Archer saying that he had diagnosed himself as being ADHD. It is not stated in this book if he consulted professionals in the proper field to help him confirm his own self-diagnosis. Since he has written another book on this same subject, perhaps the information is contained there. Many of the individuals Dr. Archer uses as examples for how a person can use some of the manifestations of their ADHD to do great things in their lives are either very famous or very rich or both. There are only two examples of what I like to think of as ordinary people, both of whom have achieved their own levels of success utilizing strong ADHD qualities. Because there appears, to me, to be such an emphasis put on the rich and famous I soon began to feel I was reading one of those magazines you can pick up in the check-out line of the grocery store. With so very many of the references the doctor was using coming from non-medical sources I lost the feeling I was reading a serious, medically oriented book dealing with a complex condition. The New York Times, CNN, and his own previous book seemed to come up much too often as sources with some references to scientific research, just not enough to give the book the weight I would have expected.I can certainly understand an adult with the medical diagnosis of ADHD finding many examples of their own trials in dealing with this condition in this book and being inspired. Maybe there will be enough examples to help someone deal with their hyper ability to multitask, or perhaps it was new information to have someone suggest they make written lists for their constantly bingo-brain activity and this will help them look and see what is truly important to do next. Or perhaps they had not noticed that having physical exercise prior to an important event can calm them down enough to deal with situations better. But, really, boredom cannot be alleviated for every person with ADHD by suggesting changing the location where they live. I understand that advice was not stated, but it certainly was implied and given examples of so often it began to seem like advice. I think I was most disappointed in the fact that this book was  to my perception  not a serious look at ADHD. Rather it was a way to show how some very wealthy people with connections readily available to most of them have coped and even thrived while dealing with their ADHD. Can the ordinary ADHD person benefit greatly from most of this advice in anything other than a pep talk manner? I would say, probably not. Certainly I would not think this book would be of much practical help to parents of a young child when they are simply trying to understand what is happening in their offsprings brain.I received an e-ARC of this book through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTV11998HJAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ0TMLY#wasThisHelpful","R3FTV11998HJAQ","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit to being out of my reading genre comfort zone with this novel, but I have noticed Jennifer Estep's name come up on several book lists lately so I decided to take a chance and read this book. Obviously she has a very large fan following and there are many novels in this series.The concept of having people empowered with elemental magic (here Gin Blanco has control over ice and stone) made it very interesting to watch the characters, both our heroine and the super bad guy, try to eliminate each other. Gin has taken over the top spot as the leader of all the criminals in her town since she took care the previous crime boss in the previous novel.  Obviously a promotion based on strength. Gin's not finding it an easy job to get a handle on, mostly because her personality makes it difficult to trust and work easily with others. So now someone has tried to blow up a riverboat where she is holding a meeting and she's pretty darned steamed up about her friends innocently being in the line of fire. Let the hunt begin for who and how, but mostly, why.If you are already invested in this series, you will like this one too. If you are looking for something new to read in the urban fantasy genre, you can easily begin the series right here  because the author pretty much fills in the blank spots from the past as she goes.  As with all series, if you want to get the full background on the characters it is probably best to at least read the first book in the series before jumping around through the remaining books.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS65XZ1MLUYG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42WOWG#wasThisHelpful","RS65XZ1MLUYG3","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My family is liking this set of Motorola T460 two-way radios for lots of different situations.  The product description says these are blue, but that blue is so dark it might just as well be called black.  I like the way the radio fits in my hand (medium size, female) with easy access to the controls.  We tried these out here in our suburban neighborhood and got about one mile of reliable reception.  There are just too many traffic lights and other electrical interference issues.  Out on the greenway, though, they were wonderful for keeping contact between the bike riders and the walkers.  Last week we had to have a new air conditioning unit installed for the upstairs of our home.  That means one technician in the attic and one in the backyard where the compressor sits.  Those guys absolutely loved using our radios to keep from doing the double staircase routine too often.The NOAA weather function works well and is easy to use.  The ""trouble"" alert is a good feature and the sound is loud enough for it to be easily heard, especially if you were in the woods camping or hiking.  The LED flashlight is built into the unit and is activated with one press of the button.  The clip on the unit works well for hooking to a belt or strap of a backpack.  The units will withstand rain and snow conditions, but they aren't ""waterproof"" so try not to drop them out of the canoe.  The units arrived with a light charge so we could play around with them for a while, but then we let them fully charge overnight.  So far with all our usage over three or four days the battery indicator still shows 'full'.  There are two micro-USB charging cables included.Our family is finding many different uses for these two-way radios just around the house, not to mention when we leave home but need ways to keep in touch.  Even if you have never owned two-way radios before you will find them valuable tools to have and use.  There was no users manual included, but you can access the website to get the answers to your questions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUC5VII33INJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BKQ4#wasThisHelpful","R2SUC5VII33INJ","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My standard way of testing out a cookbook is to try three recipes just as they are written in the book and see what happens.  The reactions I get to the finished product as suggested by the author makes the basis of my usability for that particular cookbook.  I'm afraid my results with the three recipes from this book were not successes, each for different reasons.I made Loaded Chicken Casserole (page 18) and will make it again, but by deconstructing the recipe and doing it my way.  Garlic powder is not one of my favorite flavorings to use and this was twice as much as my family likes.  The bacon sounds like a nice accompaniment but made the overall dish much too salty for my family.  Sixty minutes cooking time was much too long for my 400 degree oven.  Next time I will cook the potatoes first, then add in the chicken, then add the broccoli last.Thanksgiving Shepherd's Pie (page 58)  makes for a pretty picture on the page but my family did not care for the dish because of the Boursin cheese.  If I ever make this again I will definitely find a different cheese ingredient.Polka Dot Lasagna Skillet (page 83) doesn't resemble lasagna at all because it uses bow tie pasta and is cooked in a skillet.  This recipe was okay, but I have a large assortment of recipes that are so similar that it had nothing new to offer me.  If I ever use this idea again, I will probably use the no-boil lasagna noodles but still prepare the dish in a skillet.This cookbook makes no pretense to specialize in low calorie or low fat main dishes or desserts.  What I found most interesting, in a confounding kind of way, is that there is no nutritional information at all.  There are no tips for cutting down on the calories so if you are trying to restrict your caloric intake, be aware this book will not help you there.  I like the concept of picking up five ingredients in the grocery store and having the choice of three different recipes to make from those ingredients.  That is what will make me think about going back to this cookbook and flipping through it to see if anything perks up my ennui with menu planning.  But I will definitely rework the recipe to fit what my family likes and not lean so heavily on garlic and onion powders.  The layout of this cookbook makes it very easy to work with and each recipe has a full page color picture.  Almost every recipe has a ""tip"" or ""hint"" supplied by the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YQJK6C90IJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1624141145#wasThisHelpful","R35YQJK6C90IJL","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've come to the Kathy Reichs series of Temperance Brennan novels pretty late since this is book #18, but am I ever glad I finally tried one. A story about a forensic anthropologist written by a forensic anthropologist can't help be anything but completely realistic. I like the way Reichs plotted the novel so that it flowed very logically. I also liked her sparse wording for the technical material while still giving me the chance to understand this information I'm not familiar with.This story begins with a woman who uses the Internet to try to find missing people. She comes to Dr. Brennan with information she feels is pertinent to human bones found and data entered into an official database by Dr. Brennan. Hazel ""Lucky"" Strike is a Websleuth who spends her time trying to solve missing person cold cases. She thinks the digital recording she located at the site of human remains holds the voice of Cora Teague an 18 year old woman who disappeared about three and a half years ago in a nearby North Carolina county. Dr. Brennan finds it hard to believe the search team who found the small number of human remains would have missed the voice recorder, so what exactly is Lucky Strike after and where did she get the recorder?It was interesting to watch the case unfold little by little and to see how Brennan worked with colleagues from her own county as well as the county where the bones were found. Even coming into the series at this late time I was able to pick up easily with the family and personal relationships which are ongoing in the series. Brennan needs to make a decision in her personal life and it looks like she's ready to finally do that. I really enjoyed reading this novel and look forward to catching up on other mysteries presented in previous books.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R47YFUI5XQW0Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKVWOLA#wasThisHelpful","R47YFUI5XQW0Y","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fourth book in the Davis Way Crime Caper series was absolutely laugh-til-you-cry funny, but it wasn't all cute and cozy. There is a serious problem that happens in the life of one of the recurring major characters and that has the potential to lead in some interesting directions for the series.Davis and Bradley have been married for nine months but are still living in the voodoo suite at the Bellissimo casino in Biloxi, Mississippi because Bradley is the general manager of the casino and someone in authority has to be there all the time. Richard Sanders, who owns the Bellissimo, is off-site while he oversees the building and opening of his new casino in Tunica, Mississippi. His totally crazy wife Bianca is shopping all over the world. Both of them make it back to the Bellissimo on occasion long enough for Richard to clear off his desk and Bianca to stow her shopping goodies, so Davis and Bradley are truly stuck living in the luxury suite - reportedly haunted - and decorated by the wife of the former casino manager in truly tacky rusting wrought iron New Orleans ""found"" objects. You know it is bad when your coffee table is an actual headstone with a clearly readable inscription.So our story begins with a missing Events Planner (who would have thought a Hello Kitty wedding cake could cause so much trouble?), a completely secure casino vault which has been breached and robbed, conventions and weddings planned for every minute of the day, and a Siamese cat Davis rescues which even the owner would have trouble loving. Now all we need is for Davis' ex-ex-husband to make an appearance.....which he does. Davis was married to and divorced from him twice but everyone is entitled to make a few mistakes when they are young and foolish. It all gets very tangled up, utterly hilariously at times, and filled with action. These novels are absolutely well written which is what keeps me coming back to read each new one as it is released. This one came very close to crossing the line from humor into silliness at several points and I still don't believe what happened with the cat would have ever happened with a real cat, but I tend to forgive the minor irritations because I really like the character of Davis Way Cole. These are books written for entertainment purposes so allow yourself to be entertained. And just maybe you will be inspired to learn from Davis the (almost fully revealed) ways to hack into computers and computer systems.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRY5NQ9D883HG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941962807#wasThisHelpful","RRY5NQ9D883HG","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are loving this shredder.  Because I knew it was on the way I saved all the things I would normally shred and had a stack of over 60 items by the time this shredder arrived.  It was a great way to test out the product.  We are using this in a home setting so will not have as much use as an office setting would, but it handled my bundle of saved up ""trash mail"" like a champ.  I tested out the 12 sheet capacity by shredding a bundle of standard copy machine paper with three sheets stapled together with a household stapler.  The machine reduced those sheets to a micro-cut just the way it is supposed to.  We tried one CD just to test out that function - it worked fine - but probably will not use that portion of this shredder very often.  I also put a credit card through for testing purposes and am so glad to know I will never have to worry about anybody being able to recover any data from that card.The feature which sold me on this machine in the first place is the removable wastebasket.  At 5 gallon capacity it will hold a lot of micro-cut paper.  The see-through window on the front lets me know how much debris is in the basket and pulling it out (which automatically disables the machine) and emptying it into a brown paper bag to put in my recycling bin is super easy.  No paper bits strewn all over the floor and just slip the bin back into the machine and you are ready to perform your next shred job.  According to the very good manual which comes with the product, if you allow the bin to get too full you will have a problem with the micro-particle pieces being sucked out of the basket and back up into the cutter blades causing a jam.  Just keep a watch on the clear window and don't let the bin get too full.  I like that the entire machine is on rollers so it can be positioned exactly where it is most convenient for regular usage.  The only small problem I'm encountering is learning exactly how to place the paper in the slot to activate the shredding motor.  I find I need to be standing over the machine so I can ensure the paper is exactly straight to begin the shred.  Luckily for me, this machine is taller than any of our previous shredders so it is easier to perform this operation.  I'm sure I will adjust to the angle needed within a short time.  We haven't used the machine in one continuous shredding session for it to overheat, but there is an indicator light which will come on if overheating happens.  There is also a light to indicate when the waste paper bin is not in position.The manual says to use a shredding lubricant sheet or shredder oil after 30 minutes of shredding or at least every 30 days.  Our home use will not require more than lubricating every 30 days so we will stay with the oil instead of the sheets.  The noise level on this machine is much less than any other shredder we've used (72 dB) so I am quite happy to welcome this machine into my home office environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R267P5X9Z3ZXK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ1VZGY#wasThisHelpful","R267P5X9Z3ZXK5","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If youve never read any of these mystery novels presented from the point of view of a canine investigators perspective, it might take you a while to catch on to Chets tone. Actually, Chet isnt the investigator, Bernie Little of the Little Detective Agency is, but we all know Bernie would be lost without Chet. The pair are back home in Arizona after their last trip to visit Bernies girlfriend in someplace Chet knows was called Foggy Bottom, he just doesnt spend much time trying to figure out why it was called that. The Parsons next door are having serious health issues, but even so Bernie was surprised to learn, after such a long friendship with them, that they have a son. They also have a saguaro cactus in their front yard which is being repossessed by an agent with the Department of Agriculture. It seems the Parsons new cactus has an ID chip showing it is illegal for them to have it without certification papers. You wouldnt think a stolen cactus would lead to murder, would you?I had to be convinced to read my first Chet and Bernie novel years ago but Ive never regretted starting the series. It helps if you either have dogs of your own or have been around them enough to watch their facial expressions and their body language. When I finish reading one of these novels it takes me some days to stop trying to interpret what my own dogs are trying to tell me when they give me those looks. You might expect the book to be less than serious in its approach to crime investigations because it is told by Chet, but that doesnt happen. You get your full value criminal investigation by a rather unorthodox duo and in this case, both Chet and Bernie have some pretty dangerous situations to contend with. Now I really, really need to read the next book so I can check up on Bernie and both Mr. and Mrs. Parsons.I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4JOONHG5FD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P434DEC#wasThisHelpful","R2H4JOONHG5FD2","A33J2VWP9HXDU9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33J2VWP9HXDU9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've always been skeptical about the micro needle rollers and, frankly, just thought it was hype until I was asked to review one. I'm a semi-retired NMD, but had never read any research on them so before I agreed to evaluate them, I did my homework and found that there's many double-blind US studies on their efficacy. Even the NIH (US National Institutes of Health) has research available showing how well they work to reduce scars. So I agreed to review one and I'm glad that I did.ProsSuper durable titanium micro needles. Titanium is a metal that will not wear down like stainless steel, yet has many of the same properties desired in medical tools/devices: easily sterilized, durability, not corrosive-no rust, etc.Great price. Titanium is very expensive so I was surprised at the amount of it used in TinkSkyGreat ergonomics - the handle is design to fit comfortably in your hand as you use it on yourself.IT WORKS! Just based on studies alone, micro needle rollers reduce scar tissue. Most of the studies were done on the face and all of them showed excellent scar reduction.I'm using it after I use anti-aging skin care, no studies on this, but I know that I'm delivering the much needed anti-aging products deeper.ConsPlastic handle (at this price point I will not take off a star, it's just that I don't like plastic)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5S6MARPEF49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V87ZTRI#wasThisHelpful","RL5S6MARPEF49","A1CETDMS9MMFNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CETDMS9MMFNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used 250 mg Forskolin 2X per day for a little over 1 month and at first I noticed a slight increase in energy and reduced hunger, lost 1.5 lbs but after 2 weeks I couldn't feel any more changes for the rest of the time but I didn't gain the weight back.  As a doc in alternative medicine who knows that this herb has some impressive research behind it, Ive ordered more to try it again, this time using a higher dose to see if that helps to maintain the benefits and if not I plan to take it with an adaptogen.Because the manufacturer had a free first bottle sale going on, I asked several people I know to try it and some had pretty amazing results that I wanted to share with you. I asked them to take the highest dose recommended on the label since they have been diagnosed with health issues.Female diagnosed with hypothyroidism whose main complaint was fatigue and weight gain, she takes 2 Forskolin 2X per day along with Lugols Iodine and the adaptogen, Rhodiola. After 1 month of taking them every day her energy levels improved and she lost weight.Male with asthma, taking just Forskolin noticed an immediate improvement and at the end of 1 month hed lost weight without any changes to his diet.Female with Chronic Fatigue did a juice cleanse for 2 days when she began taking the Forskolin.  She added daily freshly made veggie juice to her new diet of no processed foods and reduced starchy foods. At the end of the month she reported feeling lighter not only did she have more energy it felt as if a heaviness has begun lifting both mentally and physically.Female with fibromyalgia added Forskolin to her normal supplements and lost 5 pounds and doesnt have as many carb & sugar cravings.The reason that I recommend and trust this manufacturer over other people selling Forskolin on Amazon and elsewhere is that they listed the important contraindication information. The information regarding who should and shouldnt take Forskolin doesnt change between brand names, but its only the most conscientious manufacturers who care more about the wellbeing of those who take their products will list this important information. Companies just selling it to make a quick buck dont provide contraindications and they usually make over-the-top health claims.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7JTZFAUTY2JO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L1H4I0Y#wasThisHelpful","R7JTZFAUTY2JO","A1CETDMS9MMFNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CETDMS9MMFNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Boston's they've been my favorite go-to Birkenstock style for years. The adjustable arch strap makes for a perfect fit even for people with high arches and/or high insteps. The strap keeps them from stretching out the leather when you wear socks no matter how thick the socks they are.

As a doc in alternative medicine who knows that this herb has some impressive research behind it, Ive ordered more to try it again, this time using a higher dose to see if that helps to maintain the benefits and if not I plan to take it with an adaptogen.Because the manufacturer had a free first bottle sale going on, I asked several people I know to try it and some had pretty amazing results that I wanted to share with you. I asked them to take the highest dose recommended on the label since they have been diagnosed with health issues.Female diagnosed with hypothyroidism whose main complaint was fatigue and weight gain, she takes 2 Forskolin 2X per day along with Lugols Iodine and the adaptogen, Rhodiola.

She added daily freshly made veggie juice to her new diet of no processed foods and reduced starchy foods. At the end of the month she reported feeling lighter not only did she have more energy it felt as if a heaviness has begun lifting both mentally and physically.Female with fibromyalgia added Forskolin to her normal supplements and lost 5 pounds and doesnt have as many carb & sugar cravings.The reason that I recommend and trust this manufacturer over other people selling Forskolin on Amazon and elsewhere is that they listed the important contraindication information.

"I've had several openers of this type and I will say that the Peak Reserve is the best, highest quality corkscrew of them all.  The last one I bought at around the same price wasn't nearly as smooth as this one,  and the others were huge, clunky, and difficult to operate,  requiring some muscle on behalf of the user. It is easy to spot the superb quality of this opener upon examination.  It is heavier than my previous openers in hand,  and it's components are top notch. The screw is extremely sharp and moves through the cork in a flash like butter-  with practically no effort from the user.  There is no pushing the lever.  A simple nudge does the trick. Within a matter of 2 seconds your cork is out without struggle.  The second inner handle holds the opener secure to the bottle with very little pressure from the hand during the two stage up and down motion of the outside lever.The foil cutter is equally as excellent in quality and performance ,  with the 4 sharp cutting wheels aiding the task.  Again,  the best foil cutter I've had the pleasure of owning.On top of receiving a top quality corkscrew and foil cutter,  you can expect a beautifully packaged set.  The black box has a magnetic flap,  and is reminiscent of a box that contains  finely packaged expensive cigars.  What a great gift this set would make!  (especially at this price)I definitely give this set 5 stars,  and recommend wholeheartedly. If you enjoy wine and your face quinces while opening your bottles,  you will really enjoy this opener. :)  You can say goodbye to broken corks.  This opener will take even difficult corks out easily.***Sample provided***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UH5821DF7Q0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z4D1P3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1UH5821DF7Q0D","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As usual Folkmanis delivers with the best hand puppets ever.  ""Harbor Seal""  is no exception and I am delighted to add him/her to my grandson's  Folkmanis delighghtful collection.  I have so much fun interacting with my grandson as the puppeteer.  It definitely sparks my creativity and he thoroughly enjoys himself.  My grandson seems to especially enjoy sticking his finger in seals mouth.As to the other reviewers  that say Harbor Seal is not a good hand puppet,...  I disagree.  No- you can't control the flaps in front  other than by shifting the seal from side to side to flap them,  but one does have total control of the mouth.  Realistically the front flappers would be too far from your fingers if you were to control the mouth.  I think Folkmanis know what they're doing.  The seal is life-like in proportion so I can see why the puppeteer would have difficulty spreading their hand wide enough to reach flappers and mouth at the same time,  unlike the owl which gives the puppeteer control of both wings and head because the wings are close enough to the head to accomplish this.This is an awesome hand puppet and my 10 month old grandson adores it.  5 Stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KG62ZCQI7O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EF5JEI#wasThisHelpful","R12KG62ZCQI7O9","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brush is extremely nicely finished and well priced for what you get.  The Bamboo is superb. (love Bamboo)  Speaking of Bamboo, ...my brushes in the past have ended up rotting,  and Bamboo should be more resistant to rot,  so that's a good thing.  (my Bamboo cutting boards have held up much better than regular wooden boards...)Bristles: are just the right softness and length to get the blood circulating without irritating the skin. They are a bit longer than half inch,  which I presume enables them to stay straight without folding,  yet soft enough not to irritate the skin. Nubbies: I've owned a lot of natural bristle brushes but never rubber nubbies and I have to say I'm quite impressed with the nubbies.  They offer a deeper message with a bit of friction that stimulates by tugging on the skin somewhat without stretching too much.  It feels totally different than bristles.  I'm for anything that gets blood to the surface!  (and deeper tissue)  With the skin being the largest organ of the body,...it only makes sense to increase circulation to it.  The nubbies go a bit deeper into the tissue.  (ie cellulite....)Handle: Thought has been taken not only in the use of Bamboo wood,  but in the shape of it  to insure a comfortable grip near the bristles as well as the end of the handle for length.  There are two ergonomically shaped places in the handle for the hand to fit,  depending on what you're doing with the brush.  It could be dry brushing, (near the brush head)  or reaching areas that are difficult to reach. (near the end of the handle)The true test will be how the bristles hold up over time.  For now I give this 5 stars and will update.  Awesome brush!***Sample provided***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37MKQTZV1M09K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HHX9CS#wasThisHelpful","R37MKQTZV1M09K","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are a pork butt family.  As far as I'm concerned the butt is the tastiest cut of pork on the pig these days since so much has been done to take all the fat out of today's pork products. (well ribs are good too!)  My husband, the griller--usually has a couple/few stages he goes through when he cooks a butt,  which require moving the butt around.  He loves these gloves because he says they just make everything so much easier.  (moving the butt around on the grill,  transferring them off the grill )  We wash them in between the different stages while they are still on his hands. (much easier than washing them off of the hands!)  He just goes to the sink with his hands still in the gloves and I spray the gloves down for him while he washes and rinses them.Protection:The gloves are super thick (yet pliable)  and substantial at protecting from heat.  We haven't experience too much heat coming through them to burn as yet.Fit:They fit both myself and my husband comfortably and still offer control with their bulk.  Not so sure how they would fit very large hands.  Mine are medium women's size and my husbands a bit larger than mine but not big.Picking with claws:I usually am the picker helper.  The claws are hefty and sturdy.  (they make good backscratchers too :)What used to take us quite some time-- (shredding and picking out fat) --we are able to do a whole lot faster with the claws than with fingers.  It has cut at least half off the amount of time we used to spend picking.  Less time equals warmer meat.Brush:The brush is fine.  Simple and does the trick but not as good as some other silicone brushes I have.  (doesn't hold as much sauce...)All in all it's a very good set for the money.  I give it an A.***sample provided***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IT5K8MDVV2A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q6IUMC#wasThisHelpful","R1IT5K8MDVV2A3","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using this little light for a couple of weeks now.

"Love these lights by Minger! We have a cabin up in the mountains and when it gets dark there, it is pitch black inside the cabin.  (no street lights there!)  We do have night lights but they are the type that must be turned on manually and it can be a hassle to do before we go to bed and turn out the lights,  so instead we keep a little flashlight on the table next to the bed for night time bathroom trips.  I took the two pack Minger night lights up there and placed one in the bathroom and one in the living room (it's a small cabin) and between the two of them they offer all the light we need to navigate ourselves around the cabin without the need for a flashlight at night.  I'm going to purchase one more pack of two so that I can plug two of them into the kitchen area.The lights a small,  not obtrusive,  and look to be very well made.  I love the fact that they come on only when it's dark,  and there's no need to mess with them at all once they're plugged in.  This is the first light of it's kind that I've seen that lights up from both sides.  The light is soft and pleasing.The Minger LED Night Light is a real winner of a night light!

"Having purchased several Folkmanis hand puppets for my now 10 month old grandson,  I can't rave enough about the excellent quality of these puppets. His favorite up until now has been the Folkmanis Ostrich Stage Puppet,  but Snowy Owl is absolutely a huge hit with him.  The 360 degree head rotation simply amazes him,  as well do the flappy wings.It's hard to say who's having more fun with this owl,...the puppeteer or my grandson!  The other great thing about these puppets is that they will give years and years of entertainment from babyhood through childhood,  making them a great investment in the long run.  My son plans on building my grandson a puppet stand when he gets a little older.

"What is the first ingredient in Perfectly Simple Oatmeal Chocolate Chunk?The answer is Soy Protein Isolate.  Soy Protein Isolate is a super-processed offspring of the soy bean.  It may have started out as a plant,  but once it gets to you,  its far from it.  To create SPI soybeans are chemically engineered to isolate their protein,  and in the process this strips out all of the other nutrients the original bean contained.  This chemical process used to isolate soy protein often leaves behind substances like aluminum and hexane.The soy is probably genetically modified.  Over 90 percent of the soybeans grown in the US are genetically modified.  (according to the USDA)For the reasons mentioned above I am unwilling to partake in these delicious little bars that pretend to be made of quality ingredients.Here is a partial list of the other ingredients in order:2.  Brown Rice Syrup  (it is basically just 100% glucose,the same sugar that raises blood sugar levels)3.  Rolled oats that are gluten free.  (thats nice)4.  More sugar5.  Chocolate Liquor6.  Cream7.  CORN SYRUP.  (No doubt GMO corn.) Before I examined the list of ingredients I ate one and did think it was tasty but too sweet.  The  sugar content says 10 grams.  The 10 grams of sugars in these bars is equal to 2 1/2 teaspoons of sugar.  For women it is recommended not to go over 25 grams of sugar per day,  so eating one of these bars will use up nearly half your allotted daily amount if you are a woman.Conclusion: These Perfectly Simple bars are far from being perfect and simple,  and I hardly doubt nutritious according to the list of ingredients.To the inventors of this product,  bring us some bars that are REALLY healthy and stop trying to fool us.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31XZZ056QK3NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLCD9PC#wasThisHelpful","R31XZZ056QK3NY","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:42 Mins This is a rugged little water resistant speaker that you can attach to your bike.  It looks like something you might find at REI.  I think a bike speaker like this is a great idea and much safer than listening to headphones when riding so you can hear what's going on around you. My husband attached the speaker cradle to my bike with no issues,  and the speaker fits securely in the cradle.  The speaker is straightforward and easy to operate as many other reviewers stated. One feature that stands out amongst other bluetooth speakers of it's type is the volume control disc at the top of the speaker,  which makes it much easier to control the volume than searching for volume control buttons amongst other buttons.  This makes it especially handy when riding around to just reach down and control the volume safely without fidgeting around.The sound comes out of the top and bottom,  as well as two very narrow cut outs on one side of the speaker. A rubbery coating is covering a majority of the speaker, and I feel that this inhibits some of the sound from coming through. The speaker sounds good,  but I do think it's missing some oomph compared to other blue tooth speakers I have tried in this price range,  however- none of the others I've tried will attach to a bike, nor are many of them water resistant.

"We recently discovered our 9 month old grandson is intrigued and totally entertained by hand puppets. Being new to the hand puppet scene, I did quite a bit of shopping around and reading reviews before finally deciding to kick off his collection with a Folkmanis. Almost every one of their puppets has high accolades from their owners and it's no surprise, as each one of them is so very charming.It was difficult to decide on a species, but ultimately I chose the ostrich because it struck me as one of the sillier puppets. I find real life ostriches to be somewhat ridiculous and borderline obnoxious, so this puppet with her long lush eyelashes and sweet expression is particularly funny to me. It was a good decision, as my grandson's little toothless mouth broadens to his widest possible smile at the sight of this puppet. Now I just have to summon my inner hand puppeteer and come up with some interesting ostrich scripts/shows.It will be a real pleasure to build my grandson's puppet menagerie. I am now a true Folkmanis fan and if you're in the market for hand puppets look no further! Quality craftsmanship and classic, whimsical character assure your puppet will be treasured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO02HA5ZPVAS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034CJAES#wasThisHelpful","RO02HA5ZPVAS6","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this toy as much as my grandson!  He is 9 months old now, and I regret not having purchased it when he was much younger, as we are all enjoying having it around. It's simply beautiful to look at and a joy to hold. It's perfect for tiny baby hands to explore-- so much to marvel as the beads rotate around each other-- and the soft texture of the natural, unvarnished wood is a sensory pleasure. It's hues are rich and simply extraordinary, giving it an almost magical appearance. It just looks like something you can't resist picking up.In the vast world of toys and baby products, the beauty of simple wooden toys is a welcome relief from hollow chunks of plastic and overwrought design. I think pure and simple toys of this nature are a boon for a developing child's imagination and motor skills, as well as as adding to the well-being of a ""toyscape"" and the individuals who share its environment.I'm now a huge Grimm's fan and plan to show it with future purchases.

"My husband and I strolled our grandson through a local farmer's market last weekend, which was the ultimate way to put the Bugzi stroller hooks to the test. We typically purchase quite a bit of heavy produce and end up looping bag upon bag over the stroller handles, which is neither convenient nor safe, as essentials like the diaper bag end up buried under purchases and the stroller can become unwieldy and imbalanced.  Our stroller company offers storage bags that attach to the stroller, but the Bugzi stroller hooks proved to be a very functional and economical option and greatly enhanced our stroller's carrying capacity while allowing us to conveniently access items.I was concerned that our stroller has no horizontal bars on which to hang the hooks, but the strong Velcro loop made it possible for us to hang it from the vertical handle which is wrapped in a spongy material which added extra grip for the Velcro. This may not be ideal for some users, as the hook hung at an unexpected angle, but the curvature of the hook itself held our grocery bags sturdily.This hook's best feature is its double-hook design.  One can use both hooks together for an extra sturdiness to use with heavier items, but it's extra handy to be able to separate them for lighter individual items. This feature certainly improved the organization factor of our market visit.All-in-all, if you're in need of a stroller hooks, these are a great option. In my travels I've not yet come across another hook with similar innovation in design. These Bugzi's were very functional, but I knocked off one star because I feel the hard plastic they're made of could've been finished a little more smoothly. Let's just say the finish doesn't do the functionality justice, and if they were a bit sleeker a huge fan base might develop. Another reason I took the fifth star away is because my two hooks were stuck together on arrival and when I pulled them apart the logo stickers that identify the brand came off. I was able to reapply them, but these (very) minor details could improve.I would definitely purchase these again and certainly recommend them!**Sample provided**","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UEYB7JZODPZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWBY7MS#wasThisHelpful","R1UEYB7JZODPZ4","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good  little selfie stick at a reasonable price.  It's light weight yet sturdy,  super easy to operate,  great quality- and works well-- just as advertised.  The handle is comfortable to grip while snapping a photo.  I much prefer having the release button built right into the handle verses a separate remote.  The extension ranges are perfect for our needs.  There are longer poles out there but the Coolreall is quite long enough in my opinion.  (It is easier to hold the camera steady if the pole doesn't get too long..)I like that the poles screw to lock.  Makes it easier than fiddling with a clasp.  The spring head clamp that holds the phone grasps it tightly and securely.  I was able to get my iphone5 Otterbox fitted but had to pull up on the spring clasp a bit more than I wanted to..and was afraid that I would spring it but it did not.  In the future I will probably be removing the outer portion of my case when I use this selfie stick.Other things I like:-Pairing was a piece of cake after charging.  No problems there.-Nice little storage pouch makes with attachable cloth handle make it easy to store with charging wire and transport. It fits in my purse.-Plenty of angles with the head.Economical, excellent choice for selfie stick.  Recommended.You can't go wrong with this selfie stick.  The Coolreall  has everything I need or want,  other than I wish my Otterbox fit with a little less effort from me,...but seems like most selfie sticks are not designed for the hefty protective phone cases these days.**Sample provided in exchange for honest review**","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWAKXF1V4K69/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z5D2DFW#wasThisHelpful","R3NWAKXF1V4K69","A1U8VI6I2MFEU8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1U8VI6I2MFEU8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little light makes me smile. :) -  It's very bright and really packs a punch of light for it's size. A very simple light with a magnet and a hook,  it runs on 3 AAA batteries.  There are no instructions at all,  but it's pretty easy to figure out so you don't really need any instructions.  The red covering has a rubberized feeling to it,  so it feels good to grip either to position the rotating head or to unscrew to place new batteries.  The swivel mechanism is tight so that it will hold the light at the angle which you place it without shifting placement position.  The hook has a nice little home around the magnet when not in use and it's easy to grasp the hook with the tip of a fingernail and pull it out should you wish to hang the light.  (the hook swivels also and is not stationary...)  The magnet's pretty strong.  It sticks to my fridge without issue. I can see this little light really coming in handy for odd jobs as well as emergencies.Others have mentioned that the price seems a bit steep.  It may be by a few dollars or so but to me it looks like it's made pretty well except the hook looks like it could break off easily if not a bit careful.  The plastic is tough enough on the rest of the light,  and the rotating mechanism seems pretty sturdy to me.I think it deserves 5 stars.**Sample received in exchange for honest review**Update August 18-2015:  This little light is awesome....we are finding that we use it all the time.

"Adele is on the cusp of musical history with her third album ""25"". Following up her album ""21"" which sold over 30 million copies worldwide, it's more of what we've come to expect from Ms. Adkins which should please most, and infuriate those willing her to experiment. But why should she when it's worked so well so far, and when what we have is this good?Lead single and opening cut ""Hello"" is a haunting piano ballad building to a bombastic chorus, her vocals a force to be reckoned with - effortless or explosive as the need arises with some soulful raspiness. There's more where that came from; the heartfelt ""When We Were Young"" (which finds her singing ""You look like a movie, you sound like a song... My God, this reminds me of when we were young""), the spare and resonant piano ballad ""Remedy"", the enchanting and theatrical ""Love In The Dark"", the incredibly stunning Chanson-tinged guitar ballad ""Million Years Ago"" (""I miss when life was a party to be thrown, but that was a million years ago"" - my favorite), the yearning ""All I Ask"", and the ode to her 3 year old son Angelo ""Sweetest Devotion"" (""There is something in your living that tears down my walls"" she sings to a bluesy groove).The Max Martin-produced ""Send My Love (To your New Lover)"" has a playful pop lilt. ""Treat me soft but touch me cruel, I want to teach you things you never knew"" she sings to a staccato of skittery beats and whisps of Gregorian chants on ""I Miss You"". The haunting gospel-tinged ""River Lea"" is co-written and produced by Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton, the most out there offering on this collection but in an understated way, and lyrics touching on her Tottenham roots. ""When I was a child, I grew up by the River Lea, there was something in the water, and now that something's in me"" she sings.Lyrically, we find her embracing growth and adulthood, with some fleeting glances behind. Musically, she eschews current trends and does her own thing. I did mention she's on the cusp of musical history. ""Hello"" is the first single to sell over a million downloads in a week in the US, while the album is expected to shift over 2 million in a week. It might not be groundbreaking, but she's sure to move the earth with this. Beautiful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZM8VPK4N7MJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WW10SA#wasThisHelpful","R1XZM8VPK4N7MJ","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For album number 5, Editors self-produce and largely ditch the guitars for a dark electro sound. Opening cut ""No Harm"" perfectly encapsulates this, stark swirling synths which gradually build and lead singer Tom Smith's vocals flitting from baritone to falsetto and back. Very Bowie meets Depeche Mode.""Ocean Of Night"" is a brooding ballad featuring Slowdive's Rachel Goswell adding some ethereal harmonies (she appears again on the similar guitar-sprinkled ""The Law""), followed by the even gloomier (but still melodic) ""Forgiveness"".Upping the tempo is the catchy eighties-sounding indie pop ""Life Is A Fear"" (with Bowie-sounding vocals) much like a ray of sunlight after all that darkness, while the falsetto-sung hypnotic synth-pop of ""Our Love"" takes another leaf from Depeche Mode as well as Bronski Beat. ""Don't stop believing"" they repeat in the songs piano-sprinkled coda. The stomping ""All The Kings"" is fittingly triumphant in feel with a tender piano coda (""Send me to Venus, send me to Mars""). Closing is the hymnal ""Marching Orders"" which slowly builds, falls back, then levels off.This isn't a commercial collection, but repeated play reveals its beauty. Fans of the band's earlier sound may frown as there isn't any ""Munich"" or ""Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors"", but those willing to allow the band spread their wings should enjoy the ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNZUCJJYNQ6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CHHEAO#wasThisHelpful","RPNZUCJJYNQ6R","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Birmingham producer Joe Flory is Amateur Best and his new album ""The Gleaners"" comprises harrowing fluttery electro soul grooves. Vocally, he recalls Seal or Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals, while sonically the album has a late night club feel.Opening is the gloomy ballad ""Rely"" which finds him crooning ""Cool cats love attack, stab yourself right in the back, I was never catching, I was always falling with you"" against haunting synths. It contrasts sharply with bouncy songs like ""Marzipan"" which sounds as sweet as its name suggests (""You shouldn't worry about your figure, you should worry about your soul"" he sings to dizzying synths and club beats), or ""They Know"" which rides on clipped beats, alternating between somber verses and euphoric bursts.He lets the electronics shine on the upbeat cascading instrumental ""Part Timer"", and the gloomy tempo-shifting ""Night Shifter"" (with beats and his melancholic vocals ebbing in halfway through the song), while the tender ballad ""Hey Darlin'"" has lovely Beach Boys-style harmonies and a bridge that sounds other-worldly.Closing is ""No Sleep"", the album highlight, a soulful synth ballad with warbled effects and a shiny undulating tempo.A serene, yet interesting experience from start to finish.

"""Unbreakable"" is Janet Jackson's first album in 7 years and finds back with Jam and Lewis who produced most of her hit-filled career from ""Control"" to ""20 Y.O."" It more than lives up to expectations as we get back the fun Janet who made us dance as well as pensive Janet making us think.The retro neo soul title track opens the album and finds Janet in a reflective mood telling us ""Anytime I get lost in the world, you'll always be there"". The groovy electro dance number ""BURNITUP!"" features Missy Elliott getting Janet and everyone hyped up, and showcases Janet's duskier sounding vocals. ""Dammn Baby"" is a funky midtempo number and is absolutely brilliant. The gently swinging electro ""The Great Forever"" takes the tempo down with Janet sounding very much like brother Michael as she pleads ""Hate will only divide"".""Shoulda Known Better"" builds from a hush to anthemic pop/EDM and back as Janet takes a look at the state of the world and borrowing some of Michael's vocal tics, as well as name checking her ""Rhythm Nation"". ""When you're young, you feel like I can change the world... and then you look 25 years later and you go; Okay, I should have known better"" she explains in an interview. ""After You Fall"" is a tender piano ballad with tremulous affecting vocals and lovely guitar solo that should please fans of ""Again"". ""Night"" is a magical club number with heavenly harmonies, jazzy piano and sprinklings of guitar. Lead-single the laid back ""No Sleeep"" features J. Cole and recalls ""That's The Way Love Goes"". ""Dream Maker / Euphoria"" is a trippy soul ballad with shades of Shuggie Otis. ""Take Me Away"" is shimmery dance/pop with a squealing guitar coda. ""Black Eagle "" is a finger snap-driven ballad with lyrics about resilience; ""You'll never know, unless you've been there"" she croons. ""I've come a long way, got a long way to go"" she sings on the hymnal ""Well Traveled"", while closing the album is ""Gon' Be Alright"", a raucous jam with Janet vocally recalling Diana Ross in parts (and singing in different voices in other parts) as she sings to a horn-laced Motown-style bounce.The album is sonically diverse and Janet thankfully does away the with overtly sexual lyrics of her recent past (you know, songs like ""Warmth"", ""Moist"" or ""Love Scene""). ""Unbreakable"" is a solid work, I daresay her best since ""Velvet Rope"", and it's great to have Janet back showing how it's done. ""Hello, it's been a while, lots to talk about, I'm glad you're still here, I hope you enjoy"" she says after the title track fades, and we sure do enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R137SP93Q9Y556/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DL1AVO#wasThisHelpful","R137SP93Q9Y556","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Love + War"" is UK soul singer Kwabs' debut, and his sound can best be described as brooding synth soul with a touch of jazz and dance. It also helps that he has an incredibly beautiful smoky and sonorous voice.The mournful title track opens the album with a gospel-style chorus joining in towards the end. ""Save yourself while you can"" he pleads. ""Fight For Love"" is left-of-centre, starting off beguilingly in a soul direction then veering into clubby territory.""Perfect Ruin"" is a somber piano ballad with barely there percussion and hushed strings, ""Forgiven"" sounds like blues and a black spiritual simultaneously, while  ""Layback"" is jazzy Neo soul.Upping the tempo is the groovy ""Make You Mine"" reminiscent of The Weeknd's smash ""Can't Feel My Face"" with a euphoric gospel-tinged chorus and a retro feel. ""Father Figure"" isn't the George Michael hit but a hymnal ballad, as is the heartfelt ""Cheating On Me"". ""I don't want to be your leader, I don't want to let you down"" he sings on ""Wrong Or Right"" as synths stab and cascade over electro beats.A soulful delight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYHBTALH19GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REF0XAQ#wasThisHelpful","RHYHBTALH19GY","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Very White Stripes.""Lose The Right"" is a reggae-tinged rocker with Mosshart on vocals, while ""Rough Detective"" is an exchange between White and Mosshart, an interrogation of sorts. ""Be Still"" is dark alternating between calm and explosive bursts with both again sharing vocals. ""Mile Markers"" finds Mosshart turning in a spoken delivery over playful beats and buzzing guitars.Other standouts are the slinky groovy ""Cop And Go"", the gritty quivery ""Too Bad"", and closing cut  ""Impossible Winner"", a piano/string ballad with a theatrical bent, very much a curveball coming on the heels of all the blistering rockers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6HGI965YJLVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013X0JEAK#wasThisHelpful","R6HGI965YJLVK","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Philips Shoqbox Bluetooth speakers packed up after two and a half years of use so I looked out for a replacement. I travel a lot and like to have all my music with me always so portable speakers are a must for me.I saw the Harman Kardon Esquire Mini in a store and fell in love with it, tested it and was pleased with the sound.It is tiny, small enough to put in ones pocket. The design is stylish, eye catching and sturdy with a leather back and lanyard, steel edges, and either a black, silver, gold, or brown top.On top is a power button (a white light comes on when powered with a beep), a Bluetooth button (light turns cobalt blue when Bluetooth is in use with a series of beeps), a phone button (to take phone calls), and volume control.Left has 5 lights which show charge (it takes about 3 hours to charge fully and a charge lasts for about 8 hours), and the microphone. The right has 3.5mm audio jack (for non-Bluetooth devices), the charging port, and a USB port (to which you can connect your phone or iPod to charge).At the rear is a kick stand which can be pushed out. Connecting to Bluetooth is a breeze, turn on the Bluetooth, search for speakers on your phone/iPod, pair, and you're good to go. Unlike other speakers I have used, the speakers always remember my device(s) so no need to keep pairing. The connection is strong and steady.Now, onto sound. For such a small fellah, it packs a big punch. Clear and sharp, pianos, guitars and horns sound almost live. I've played different genres from Dance to Funk to Acoustic to Rock to Jazz and I like the sound. It could go with a bit more bass though. To counter this, I change my phone/iPod equaliser settings to Dance or Bass boost. Also, placing it on a solid surface, in a corner, or against a wall helps to bounce and improve the acoustics.The speakers do show up the defects in low quality music files, with a discernible hiss and some distortion. There is also some distortion at high volume, so best to keep it moderate. It's definitely no replacement for a powerful home stereo.Perfect for the office (my workmates never want me to take it home), hotel room, bedroom, and anywhere else one may go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFP0IIAWQ4D3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N11CKMG#wasThisHelpful","RFP0IIAWQ4D3C","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bilal's fourth release ""In Another Life"" continues the prolific spurt he's experienced since 2010. It is More of what we've come to expect from the Neo soul singer, which is the unexpected. Vocally, he darts from a fragile croon to falsetto to yelp, depending on the mood.He turns in a haunting vocal to match the spectral sound of ""Star Now"", while ""Open Up The Door"" has a Stevie Wonder feel; ""It's a long cold winter, but when it rains we grow"" he sings to the light Cuban-tinged bounce. ""Pleasure Toy"" features Big K.R.I.T has electro beats with Bilal channeling Prince in parts, while ""Lunatic"" is an abrasive groove with smidgens of rock guitar and yelping Prince-style vocals.""Money Over Lover"" is a retro ""Shaft"" groove featuring spit-fire verses from Kendrick Lamar right after a sudden break. ""Love Child"" isn't The Supremes classic but a trippy blissed out ballad, as is ""Holding It Back"" which features Kimbra perfectly blending in. The horn-flecked ""Spiralling"" is breezy soul with skittery beats, while ""Bury Me Next To You"" takes the tempo down even further to a bluesy trot.Produced by Adrian Younge, a perfect match to Bilal's uncompromising style, the album has a live jazzy limber feel, as though recorded in a single take.

"R&B singer Miguel is a supremely talented singer who should be bigger than he is, much like Janelle Mone. Fittingly, he appeared on her last album ""Electric Lady"", while his last album ""Kaleidoscope Dream"" peaked at #3 on the Billboard charts and won a Grammy for the million-selling single ""Adorn"".His new album ""Wildheart"" should see him continue on the upward trajectory his career has been taking. It's more of his Soul/Funk/Rock/Electronica sound, you know, that hazy reverb-filled sound juxtaposing ragged guitars and heavenly harmonies. There's a heavier rock influence on songs like the woozy ""A Beautiful Exit"", the gently galloping yet gritty ""Waves"", the funky ""Hollywood Dreams"", the spare echoey ""Leaves"", and the tender ""Face The Sun"" which builds and builds and features Lenny Kravitz serving up a squealing guitar solo.The upbeat ""Deal"" is a retro groove with a deceptively downbeat intro, a live party feel, and a slowed-down coda, while the trippy electro ""The Valley"" drips lascivious lyrics (as does much of the album really). Lead single ""Coffee"" is a dreamy pulsing affair with the line ""I wish I could paint our love, these moments and violet hues"", while ""NWA"" features Kurupt and a falsetto-singing Miguel channeling his inner Marvin Gaye. ""...goingtohell"" alternates between garage rock and woozy R&B, ""Flesh"" is a smouldering slow jam that wouldn't be out of place on the ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" soundtrack, while ""Destinado a morir (enter.lewd)"" is a moody interlude.Highlight has got to be the questioning confessional ""What's Normal Anyway"" which finds him singing ""Too proper for the black kids, too black for the Mexicans... In a crowd and I feel alone, I never feel like I belong"" against clipped beats, acoustic guitar and cascading spectral harmonies.The deluxe edition features 4 additional tracks, the ominous hip hop-laced ""Gfg"", ""Destinado a morir"" (which gets stretched out into an ominous ballad), the moody ""Simple Things"", and the thundering rock-driven ""Damned"".What an exciting piece this is, treading the path led by artists like D'Angelo, Stevie Wonder and Prince. ""Wildheart"" is a genre blurring classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTEEWX3PAPNQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIQNKK0#wasThisHelpful","RQTEEWX3PAPNQ","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"British indie band Everything Everything burst into the scene in 2010 with their quirky and eclectic sound.Album number three ""Get To Heaven"" is no different, opening almost acapella on ""The Blade"" before bursting into life and making several angular detours. Lead vocalist Jonathan Higgs sounds brilliant, deftly moving from falsetto to a yelp at the blink of an eye. ""Distant Past"" is a funky rocker with spoken/sung lyrics and skittery beats, followed by the even groovier ""Get To Heaven"" with a whistle refrain and exotic guitar sounds.The album is laden with catchy danceable tunes, produced by Stuart Price, they sound like Duran Duran meets Radiohead. Inspired by shootings, ISIS and other current world affairs, the dark cryptic lyrics contrast the bright melodies. The retro ""Regret"" recalls Edwyn Collins. The galloping ""Spring/Summer/Winter"" finds them declaring that they ""don't want to get older"", ""Fortune 500' is a gently pulsing number with twitchy guitar effects. ""I've won I've won they told me that I've won"" goes the echoey refrain, while the nervy sounding ""Blast Doors"" has the line ""I can smell your fingerprints all over my computer, you can fire a rocket, it's the future"".""No Reptiles"" is spatial with haunting synths and keys with an insistent thump and the menacing line ""I'm going to kill a stranger"", while pleasantly discordant almost jazz/funk ""Warm Healer"" closes the album.The deluxe edition has 6 extra songs, the charming ballad ""We Sleep In Pairs"", the skeletal groovy ""Hapsburg Lippp"", the Duran Duran-aping ""President Heartbeat"", the choppy groovy ""Brainchild"", the pulsing glitchy instrumental ""Yuppie Supper"", and the jerky rocker ""Only As Good As My God"". All are vital.Like their name goes, they throw everything but the kitchen sink into their sound. Chameleonic rock of the first degree.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SVE1BU8ZAVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQNMCKS#wasThisHelpful","R22SVE1BU8ZAVA","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leon Bridges is 25 and grew up listening to Usher and Ginuwine, but you wouldn't know it listening to his debut ""Coming Home"" which sounds like it was recorded in the fifties or sixties. His simple organic soul/blues/gospel sound recalls Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke with references to New Orleans and The Mississippi.Concise at 10 tracks, his smoky world weary vocals shine on every track, from the bluesy title track, the Doo-wop-laced ""Better Man"" which finds him declaring that he loves her ""Better than all those Jezebels lurking under perfumed sheets"", while ""Brown Skin Girl"" is a horn-peppered slowly swinging piece.Upping the tempo are the bouncy ""Smooth Sailin'"" and ""Flowers"", while ""Shine"" is an organ-driven blues/hymnal ballad. Highlight has got to be the autobiographical ""Lisa Sawyer"", an ode to his mother set to a strolling pace and soothing harmonies (of ""Pa pa doos""). Closing is the acoustic tambourine-garnished gospel-tinged ballad ""River"" with a lovely bridge which finds him harmonising with some haunting female vocals.Produced by Austin Jenkins and Joshua Block of indie rock band White Denim, the album was recorded on vintage analogue equipment virtually live. Right from the retro cover art to the throwback sound, this sounds like a lost classic rediscovered.

"""The Bright Side"" is Australian singer/songwriter Lenka's fourth album. Concise at 10 tracks, the tone of the album is sunny and optimistic.The uplifting gently swinging ""The Long Way Home"" opens the album comprising mainly piano, horns and percussion. ""Blue Skies"" is more dense, electropop laden with pulsing and shimmery synths and a melancholic mien. ""Free"" is rhythmic and bouncy, sprinkled with hand claps. ""I like to move around to a different beat... I don't really mind what you all think"" she sings on the sunny folky ""Unique"" and that's just what she sets out to do on this album.The sugary sweet ""Get Together"" sets a xylophone and ukulele to the bouncy beat, while the enchanting ""Go Deeper"" is a moody synth R&B-ish ballad with wispy vocals, as is the similar ""Hearts Brighter"". ""We are invincible, we are unique, we are incredible, we are free"" she sings on the whistle-driven ""We Are Powerful"".

""Levitate For You"" features Ofei, a brooding piece with haunting synths sweeping in and out dramatically.Everything else is instrumental; the gentle ""Dark Matter"" which ebbs and shimmers beautifully, the soothing ""Storms End"", the cinematic acoustic-laced title track, and the upbeat discordant yet satisfying ""Shaker Obsession"".Good to have him/them back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNTS7X7XZ264/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQRAP0S#wasThisHelpful","RUNTS7X7XZ264","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to believe it's been 8 years since UK singer Mika made his technicolor debut with his fun piano pop sound. ""No Place In Heaven"" is his fourth album and opens with the piano-driven disco-tinged ""Talk About You"". ""All She Wants"" is a bouncy clap-filled Beatles-meets-Beach Boys affair.""Good Guys"" is a lovely ballad which appears again on the deluxe edition as the ""Night Time Mix"", a groovier fuller sound, while the title track is a lilting folky song. ""Staring At The Sun"" isn't the U2 hit but a gently pulsing pop number on which he declares ""my love is blind from staring at the sun"".For the most part, Mika has capped his hyperactive vocals and turns in a calm, almost lifeless delivery. The pretty ""Hurts"" is a spare piano ballad, while the tender piano ballad ""Ordinary Man"" with the line ""spent the day playing Nina Simone, reorganised every record I own"" recalls Elton John in his seventies hey day. Absolutely enchanting!Other tracks on the deluxe edition are the glam pop/rock ""Promiseland"", the falsetto-sung trippy synth ballad ""Porcelain"", and the catchy string-swathed disco ""L'amour Fait Ce Qu'il Veit"" sung in French and co-penned by Pharrell Williams. To be honest, the bonus tracks are much better than most of the album, injecting much needed life and fun. I'm a big fan of Mika and I hate to have to give this 3 and a half stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CGY2B6I860RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHZZBJ6#wasThisHelpful","R2CGY2B6I860RD","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Lantern"" is Scottish electronic act Hudson Mohawke's sophomore album. He's one half of the duo TNGHT and has also worked with Drake and Kanye West.His album is an eclectic mix with guests from different genres yet still giving a cohesive sound. The general sound is wispy and light on bass. The hip hop-laced ""Very First Breath"" features Irfane, while ""Ryderz"" incorporates sped up soul samples sounding vintage, much like early Kanye West.The mellow soulful ""Warriors"" features Ruckazoid and Devauex and an uplifting choir chorus. The moody ""Indian Steps"" features Antony Hegarty's mournful croon. Miguel features on the ghostly apparition that is ""Deepspace"" singing lines like ""All my anger spilling over pavement, please don't go"" against faintly wailing guitars, while Jhen Aiko appears on the floaty soul ""Resistance"" with soft skittery beats.Everything else is instrumental, highlights being the tinkling and cinematic ""Kettles"", the tinkling Oriental-tinged ""Lil Djembe"", ""System"" which starts off widescreen before pounding beats take over, and the constantly morphing ""Brand New World"".This fittingly titled Lantern leaves an incandescent glow on the dancefloor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TOIUDQQEPXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V2XWRQO#wasThisHelpful","R29TOIUDQQEPXX","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Indie band Fun. don't do subtle, and lead singer Nate Ruess' solo debut ""Grand Romantic"" is more of the same, comprising grandiose Queen-sounding ballads. His love for bombast recalls Killers' frontman Brandon Flowers.The brief choral ""Grand Romantic (Intro)"" leads to the theatrical ""AhHa"" with thundering martial beats, while lead-single ""Nothing Without Love"" finds Ruess belting his heart and lungs out to the triumphant tune.Things get more tender on the retro sounding ""Take A Bow' which features Wilco's Jeff Tweedy on guitar, while ""You Light My Fire"" starts off sounding somewhat like Beyonc's ""Single Ladies"", but it's a bouncy pop song. ""What The World Is Coming To"" features Beck and is a folky song recalling John Lennon.Everything stands out really, the big catchy ""Great Big Storm"", the piano ballad ""Moment"" (""I'm fine, I just need a moment to cry""), the Elton John-style piano heartbreak ballad ""It Only Gets Much Worse"" (my favourite), the freeform hymnal title track (with Ruess hitting some big and high notes, it also incorporates the chorale flourishes of the intro into its coda), the cinematic ""Harsh Light"", and closing cut ""Brightside"", a charming piano ballad adorned with soft strings and ""La la las"" (another favourite of mine).Nate Ruess' solo debut is fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYICH479TIY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6BXAL6#wasThisHelpful","RIYICH479TIY2","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Way"" is Macy Gray's 8th album, coming on the heels of a pair of cover albums in 2012; the delightful eclectic ""Covered"" and the Stevie Wonder tribute ""Talking Book"". Her latest is more of her brand of kooky Soul with her distinctive raspy delivery unchanged by time. Featuring several producers on ten tracks, the sound is cohesive, from opening moody ""Stoned"" (with hand-tapped percussion), the Bluesy ""Bang Bang"" with an abrasive riff and gangster video, to the uplifting ""Hands"" (with lovely harmonies), everything fits like a glove.""I Miss The Sex"" is an interesting experiment, an African-ish groove with a Jazzy lilt. The string-swept ballad ""The First Time"" is co-written by Booker T. Jones (who produced Bill Whithers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"") and sounds like a classic. ""Hey baby, I've called to say I gave up that narcotic"" she sings on the lilting title track ""The Way"". ""Queen Of The Big Hurt"" is reminiscent of earlier songs like ""I Try"" or ""Still"". Album highlight ""Me With You"" appeared online in a soulful incarnation a few years ago. Here, it gets a sublime Disco makeover with a haunting feel. Brilliant.Closing are the acoustic ""Need You Now"", and ""Life"" which finds her declaring ""Life is beautiful"" over rattling percussion. It's a real shame Gray doesn't have the success her unique sound and hard work deserves. This is a good album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRK6IYSIYOHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M28XYV0#wasThisHelpful","RGRK6IYSIYOHO","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Flying Lotus's new album ""You're Dead"" is more of his futuristic Jazz/Hip Hop/Electronica sound. Horns traipsing across skittery beats, sudden bursts of guitar, and other-worldly bleeps, it's a free-for-all jamfest.The first four tracks are brief and fly past fast sounding like different movements of a single piece. ""Never Catch Me"" is a trippy piece with Kendrick Lamar. ""Dead Man's Tetris"" features vocals by Flying Lotus (as Captain Murphy) and Snoop Dogg. ""Turkey Dog Coma"" is a shimmery tempo-shifting piece. ""Siren Song"" features Angel Deradoorian's vocals against a quivery backdrop. The brief ""Descent Into Madness"" features Thundercat. Captain Murphy appears again on ""The Boys Who Died In Their Sleep"". The shimmery ""The Potential/The Beyond"" features Niki Randa (with her voice sounding like a cascading waterfall), while Kimbra features on closing cut ""The Protest"".The only other album I've heard this year that's in a similar vein is Taylor Mcferrin's ""Early Riser"".

"31 year old Kat Edmonson is a one time American Idol contestant. Rather than go for big showy songs and belting, she goes for a more intimate sound similar to Norah Jones', Jazzy Folk with a touch of Country. A fan on classic black and white movies, she tries to make her music a sonic equivalent.She co-wrote 11 of the dozen tracks, and her nuanced nasal delivery perfectly suits the songs. Highlights include opening cut the gorgeous ""Rainy Day Woman"" (drenched in theatrical strings and sprinkled with horns), the slinky Bossa Nova ""You Said Enough"", the tender acoustic Bluesy ""Oh My Love"" (which finds her singing in a smoky lower register - absolutely brilliant), ""Crying"" (with lovely harmonies), the elegiac ""Till We Start To Kiss"", the playful cabaret Pop ""The Best"" (with Jazzy scatting), the quivery Country-tinged ""Dark Cloud"" (""They settled it up in Heaven, now I'm just waiting on you""), and closing cut the Country ballad ""Who's Counting"".My favourite though is ""You Can't Break My Heart"" (the one song she didn't have a hand in writing), delicately plucked guitar, magnificent strings, and barely there percussion, and a quivery guitar solo, it wouldn't sound out of place on a spaghetti western - incredibly beautiful!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROEPSDQWEUCJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LWLZSGM#wasThisHelpful","ROEPSDQWEUCJE","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The announcement ""Welcome home class, you've come a long way"" opens Prince's new album ""Art Official Age"" leading into a four to the floor propulsive track titled ""Art Official Cage"" garnished with choral flourishes, a Dubstep breakdown, and a rap.As with most recent Prince releases, this will divide some who will compare it to his eighties classics. While not quite up there with those classics, this has its moments if one gives it a chance. It's a concept album of sorts finding Prince awakening sometime in the future after being in suspended animation, with UK Soul songstress Lianne La Havas's sensual voice guiding him on what to expect in the new society in a series of string/piano ""Affirmations"".""Clouds"" is an incredibly funky midtempo electro groove with a Jazzy lilt (""You should never underestimate the power of a kiss on the neck which she doesn't expect"" - it also features Lianne La Havas), the incredible ballad ""Breakdown"" which starts off with a soft falsetto croon leading to a screeching/yelping climax. The horn-punctuated ""Gold Standard"" has a retro feel, while the floaty ""U Know"" (punctuated with ""Uh-huh uh-huh"" said by some female) shows he's aware of the Frank Oceans, Weeknds and Miguels.Other highlights are the moody ""Breakfast Can Wait"", the beautiful semi-biographical ballad ""Way Back Home"", and the skeletal Hip Hop-tinged groove ""Funknroll"" which races frantically towards the end with Camille on vocals.There is much to love here, and the album grows on you the more you listen to it.

"""I Need Church"" is a blistering rocker with stomping beats and sawing guitars, that is until The Eminem-esque vocals come in and you realise it's Professor Green. ""Growing Up In Public"", his 3rd album, comprises 10 tracks, getting straight to the point.The pensive ""Lullaby"" featuring an angelic Tori Kelly looks at his battle with depression. ""I don't want to do what my dad did with a rope"" he raps recalling his Dad's suicide. It reminds me a wee bit of Diddy's ""Coming Home"". Not everything is weighty though. He takes aim at The Script's Danny O'Donoghue and Robbie Williams in the afore mentioned ""I Need Church"" (even appending an irate voice mail from Williams at the songs end), includes the line ""Millie I'm gonna be with you forever, or until the day that we divorce and I get taken to the cleaners, probably for  getting caught fondling the clean...er"" in ""Dean Man Shoes"" (Millie being his new bride), and takes a look at his arrest for drunk driving in the bouncy title track. ""Little Secrets"" features a creamy sounding Mr. Probz, while the bouncy ""Name In Lights"" featuring Rizzle Kicks recalls The Streets. Slowing things down is ""Fast Life"", a look at his past hedonistic living, a thing of the past now he's settled down.""Can't Dance Without You"" is Drum & bass with juddering bass and featuring Whinnie Williams.

"UK Indie band Alt-J's debut ""An Awesome Wave"" won the 2012 Mercury Music Prize with their inimitable style, a folky electronic rock blend. Their sophomore album ""This Is All Yours"" opens with ""Intro"", a theatrical instrumental garnished with choral flourishes. ""Arrival In Nara"" has a lovely piano intro that takes up almost half the song before transforming into a cinematic acoustic ballad, while the brilliant ballad ""Nara"" about a Japanese city with roaming deer has a magical timbre and builds to an incredible crescendo. The last part of the trilogy ""Leaving Nara"" is a beautiful Sigur Rs-style warble, with a trippy and delightful cover of Bill Withers' ""Lovely Day"" tacked on as a hidden track.""Left Hand Free"" is a Bluesy rocker with vocalist Joe Newman slipping (as he often does) into what sounds like an extra terrestrial language at times, while the tender falsetto-sung ""Choice Kingdom"" has an other-worldly aura. The acoustic ""Hunger Of The Pine"" features a sample of Miley Cyrus repeating ""I'm a female rebel"", whimsical and absolutely enchanting. The Bon Iver-like ""Warm Foothills"" features Conor Oberst, Lianne La Havas and Sivu sharply alternating vocals and adding whistles to the folky ballad. ""Bloodflood Pt II"" is the sequel to ""Bloodflood"" from their debut, a mysterious ballad with haunting synths and guitar and gently clattering percussion, swelling and ebbing to dramatic effect, an absolute highlight!With the bar raised this high, it will be interesting to see how Alt-J can follow this up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SI1O1SLRPI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2XWHNW#wasThisHelpful","R21SI1O1SLRPI1","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For their third album, The Drums find themselves reduced from a quartet to the duo of Jonathan Pierce and Jacob Graham (the empty space for two on the sofa on the cover art should be a big clue) and adding a darker tint to their Indie Pop sound.Opening cut ""Magic Mountain"" is a raucous punk number which keeps stopping and starting, taking one on a jerky but fun ride. Filled with distortion, yelps and harrowing effects, it at once distances itself from the band that gave us sunny Pop like ""Let's Go Surfing"". Slowing things down are ""I Can't Pretend"" and ""I Hope Time Doesn't Change Him"", pretty and calming belying the dark lyrics (the latter is a charming tune about killing someone), before the lean bouncy Smiths-esque ""Kiss Me Again"" raises the tempo again.""Let Me"" (""They might hate you, but I love you, they can go kill themselves"" - inspired by homophobia in Russia) and ""Face Of God"" are a frenetic pair with sawing synths, racing beats and ghostly harmonies which find the pair channeling their inner Robert Smith.""U.S National Park"" is a lovely ballad that wouldn't be out of place at a sixties prom. ""I don't want to die alone by the campfire"" croons Pierce. ""I buried you deep in my heart"" he sings on the pulsing upbeat ""Deep In My Heart"". ""There Is Nothing Left"" is driven by jangly chiming guitars, while closing is ""Wild Geese"", an enchanting ballad with haunted whistles, dreamy synths, and echoing harmonies. ""You and me, we're like wild geese that fly through the thunder"". Incredibly beautiful!Through even the sunniest sounds runs a thread of melancholy. Gloomy yet beautiful all at once.

Terrified of being alone?""), the tender acoustic ""Pigeons"", the experimental ""Slow Love"" (with gently crashing beats, eerie effects and a pseudo Jazz feel), ""Nobody Dies Anymore"" (with its wall of Ooohs), the upbeat ""I'll Sing It"" (with catchy Yeah yeah yeahs), ""Where My Love"" (with lovely piano breaks), and closing cut ""I'll Never Know"", with tenderly plucked guitars and accidental-sounding horns.Inspired by Jeff's wife's battle with cancer, the album is named after her (Sukierae is her nickname), It's a beautiful collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9PCUH8N0WI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLK406S#wasThisHelpful","R3B9PCUH8N0WI1","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

""I'm A Believer"" isn't The Monkees hit but a bouncy clap-filled rocker with catchy chants of ""Hey!"", while the sax-peppered sing-along ""Happy Birthday"" recalls Springsteen.For ballads, we have ""The Pleasure And The Pain"", ""She's A Beast"", the Bluesy ""I Never Want To Let You Down"" (on which he pledges allegiance to the flag of love), and the lovely Doo-wop ""Ooo Baby Baby"" with such gorgeous harmonies, a Miracles cover which really displays his soulful chops.As good as all these are, the triptych of highlights are the galloping Funk/Rock ""The Chamber"" which is so dancey, the groovy ""New York City"" (""She's lived and died so many times... She's a queen that stands her ground, nobody can take her down"" he sings affectionately about the big apple, there's also a nice spoken section and he also throws in a few yelps), and the brilliant Bluesy ""Frankenstein"" which feels like a familiar friend.Doesn't break new ground, but sometimes all you need is to do what you do very well. To appropriate one of his album titles, Let Rock rule!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0HAE6MG554R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8DB6T2#wasThisHelpful","R3K0HAE6MG554R","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jennifer Hudson digs out a disco ball and her dance shoes for ""JHUD"", her third album. Most of the album is upbeat and at 10 tracks, concise and to the point. Compared to her last album which was recorded under a pall of tragedy, it is a major improvement and Hudson sounds like she's having fun.The titular ""Dangerous"" kicks things off with funky Chic-style guitar and the lyrics ""I do it for the thrill, even if it kills"", followed by the R. Kelly penned and assisted ""It's Your World"", a smooth groove with a powerful vocal performance from Hudson which dares you to sit it out. ""He Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" has a baseline reminiscent of ""Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"" by In Deep. Penned and produced by Pharrell, it features Iggy Azeala. Pharrell also provides ""I Can't Describe (The Way I Feel)"", an eighties-sounding groove featuring T.I., and the irresistible piano-sprinkled ""Just That Type Of Girl"" which reminds me of Mariah Carey's ""Make It Happen"".""Walk It Out"" is a more modern sounding slinky midtempo number produced by and featuring Timbaland. My favourite song is the haunting Eurodisco-sounding ""I Still Love You"" which sounds like Donna Summer meets The Supremes. ""Bring Back The Music"" is a lilting retro-sounding midtempo song with lovely harmonies. The bouncy Pop ""Say It"" sounds like eighties Whitney Houston.Closing is the near seven minute-long ballad ""Moan"" which if it were on a Janet album would mean something entirely different. It is a Gospel-tinged song, a collaboration with Mali Music, reminiscing about her mother and the power of having a good cry. Starting off gentle, she gradually builds on the emotion and power, especially as a choir comes in to assist the jazzy piano backing. This performance alone reminds one why we fell in love with her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PPHERKBLZLEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M856DJC#wasThisHelpful","R1PPHERKBLZLEN","A24N1BAS3CU27H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24N1BAS3CU27H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this to replace the original blade on my MM875 lawnmower that wore down over the course of five years. I used the original for 5 entire years, never bothering to sharpen or maintain it one single time (oops!). Quite a testament to the blade though, that it still seemed to function great after being neglected for half of a decade. It still cut fine at the time of replacement, but if the grass was slightly wet, the mower began to bog down and not be able to keep up with my lawn.I purchased this new blade, followed the safety instructions and swapped it into my MM875 in about 15 minutes time, and the mower was back to being good as new. One bolt and bracket off, one bolt and bracket back on, and your mower is good to go. It cuts great and restored my faith in my mower to last me for many more years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XPNEOUJ9JD57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R9TA#wasThisHelpful","R1XPNEOUJ9JD57","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In what ended up being one of the best decisions we made in terms of product purchases since becoming parents, my wife and I discovered the glory of the HALO SleepSacks when we bought the newborn sized ones with the built in velcro swaddle. The swaddlers sleepsacks took the headache, hassle, and difficulty out of swaddling. We were sold and have been buying SleepSack products in larger and larger sizes as our son grows up.He has slept in a HALO SleepSack product every single cool or cold night since the day he was born. They are extremely high quality, they hold up perfectly wash after wash. He looks comfortable and sleeps soundly while wearing this sleepsack. We have this micro-fleece version for the coldest nights, and the thinner cotton versions for the more mild nights. The design of these SleepSacks is incredible. The SleepSacks zip from the top on down, keeping the zipper at the bottom of the SleepSack where your child cannot easily find it and unzip it, and it also won't be a bother for children who sleep on their stomachs. And it's nice knowing that this product is much safer and provides way more peace of mind than putting a blanket in the crib.This particular one now marks the sixth HALO product we have purchased in the first 14 months of our sons life. We will no doubt be purchasing the larger sizes as he grows, and are sold for life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EC3WH4JFB63/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069EXQ#wasThisHelpful","R23EC3WH4JFB63","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chances are if you are buying this replacement Carafe, you are doing so because you broke your original one that came with the coffeemaker. Our original carafe lasted about a year, until one night while washing it in the sink, the side of the carafe ever so slightly touched the edge of our granite countertops and the carafe shattered to pieces. Because we can't live without coffee for long, I quickly logged onto Amazon to check the cost and availability of a replacement carafe.I was a little shocked to find that the replacements are as expensive as they are. For $22, you could almost buy a cheaper replacement coffee maker. I was hesitant, but after some discussion, we decided we loved our coffeemaker enough to buy the replacement. This replacement is identical to the original carafe that came with the coffee maker. These carafes honestly has a very cheap, minimalist feel to them. The glass feels like it is about as thin as physically possible, and the fit and finish of the plastic components isn't super high. It's a shame, because the coffeemaker itself is a top notch appliance and feels like it would last a lifetime. It's a shame that instead of making these out of cheap glass, that they couldn't instead come up with some kind of BPA-free polycarbonate that can handle the heat of the coffee, or some other kind of less shatter-prone material.I have a feeling that I will be getting roped into buying a replacement carafe again in the future. And that's unfortunately not a great thing to say about the product in this case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FBON181FKSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CFNE3#wasThisHelpful","R2FBON181FKSR","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These handkerchiefs are of a higher quality than I expected based on some of the other reviews I read beforehand. They feel like they are stitched well. The designs are simple but elegant.

"We bought this musical table for my son when he was very young, about 3.5 months old. We left it without the legs in place, so that we could hold it up in front of my son, and he would hear the sounds and see the reactions when he reached out and smacked any button or object his hand could hit. He seemed to love it and he would always laugh and smile when he was able to play with it. As he grew up, and began to sit up and crawl, we attached the legs (which you can attach and detach very easily with no tools). He was able to stand up and hold himself up, and over time, he even used the table as a device to help him cruise and step around while on his way to walking. He's now 14 months old, and still to date, loves to play with his musical table for many minutes each day.So you can see where I am going with this; not only is this a toy that brings a ton of enjoyment to my son as he plays with it, but it is a toy that helped him grow and develop in other ways. It is built to take a beating too; this table has been smacked, pushed, and whacked over and over again for a year now by my son, and you can't tell any difference from the day it was new. The battery life lasts surprisingly long, we've only had to replace the batteries about once every 3 or 4 months so far. You can quickly adjust the volume to two different positions, and you can even switch the audio from English to Spanish to get exposure to different languages if you so desire.If you buy this table, prepare to have the sounds and songs stuck in your head for a long time, because this toy will likely be loved  by your child for a long time. The one and only thing I would caution to parents as a potential negative, although the build quality is high and sturdy, this table can be pushed around by a child if they attempt to do so. The legs give it a wide base and it is very tough to tip over, but if your child is able to walk, he/she will be able to grab hold of the side and push it around on a hardwood floor or very low pile carpet. It hasn't been a safety issue for us, and in fact it has acted at times like a walker to help my son learn how to walk, but I think it's worth mentioning to any potential buyers out there. Overall, a sure fire 5 star toy that is well worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEB95X3ZICY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NX72D4#wasThisHelpful","RXEB95X3ZICY3","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a doctor or medical professional, so I won't waste time talking about the perceived benefits of taking fish oil tablets or what they may or may not help you achieve from a health standpoint. I have been taking fish oil tablets daily for almost a decade now, and for the first 5 or so years, I wasn't brand loyal; I would buy whatever brand was for sale at the grocery store I was in at the time, and use them up. Having bounced around so many brands over the years, I grew very tired of the tablets that had a foul taste to the coating, and even worse, the dreaded ""fish burps"" that would follow shortly after taking them.Then one day I happened to pick up the Barleans fish oil tablets with the orange flavored coating from a local health supplements store. Loved them. The coating on the pills is a very mild but pleasant flavor. And most importantly, I take the pill, and never taste it again once I swallow it. I've been using Barleans for about 5 straight years now, and not once during this time did I have a single case of the fish burps. Not sure how they accomplish this where others fail so badly, but it works and I am a very satisfied customer. I now reorder regularly on Amazon when I need a refill and I have finally become brand loyal to a fish oil tablet. Highly recommended five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZX1CZSINBCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VLZ8AI#wasThisHelpful","R1UZX1CZSINBCD","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams mattress is an incredible value for the money, and we couldn't be more thrilled with it. It's not just worth it as a value purchase; I know not everyone is on the same budget as everyone else, but you don't want to go into buying a product like this solely because the cost is low. It's a product that involves the health, safety, and comfort of your child which is something that is worth the consideration at any price. We have two cribs; one at our own house, on which we have a Moonlight Slumber foam mattress that cost us in the neighborhood of $180 (purchased from Amazon as well). The Moonlight Slumber mattress is incredible and we have had no problems whatsoever with it. This Safety 1st mattress was purchased by us to keep at a relatives house for when they watched our child on occasion.Our thoughts were, because this mattress would be used very infrequently, we would just buy a cheaper one and hope for the best. We were incredibly surprised by the quality we received in this product for less than 1/3rd of the cost of the one we used ourselves at home. I would have absolutely no problem recommending this mattress to anyone with a child of any age, from the week they were born on forward. It is firm enough that a newborn can safely use it without undue fear of SIDS risk, but yet just slightly giving enough that it seems like it would be comfortable for the baby. We've been using it for almost a year now as our secondary home for our child and it has performed and held up wonderfully, and my son sleeps great on it.If you're looking for good value in a mattress, this is the one for you. If you're looking for something that appears and feels like it will be safe and comfortable for your child, this is the mattress for you. Highly recommended, and we will be purchasing one of these without hesitation when we have our second child in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MC2BQE6VBM5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004044LD4#wasThisHelpful","R1MC2BQE6VBM5F","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use this product in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata sedan as a holder for my cell phone to allow me to use it as a GPS device while driving. The cell phone I currently use in this mount is a Google LG Nexus 5, which is encased in a Spigen TPU case. The Mountek mount is very easy to install and remove from the CD player slot in my car. I just push it into the slot, turn the knob a few times, and voila, in seconds the mount is ready to go and stable. The ""arms"" that encase the phone are spring loaded and open with the touch of the top button with surprising force. Then you just sit your phone in and push the arms shut until it is snugly fit around your phone. The mount is adjustable enough that I could see almost any phone fitting fine in this, even something huge like a Galaxy Note phone. They even thought to put a hole on the bottom plate of the mount, which I can run the charging cable through for my phone and charge it while it is on the mount. I've been using it for months now, and never once had the phone or mount dislodge while in use, so I am happy with it in that regard.The one and only caveat, which is mentioned in many of the other reviews, is that this mount will very quickly cause some permanent warping in the fabric ""dust cover"" that protects your slot loading disc player in your car. Even after just an hour or two of use, you'll notice some permanent misshaping of the dust cover. It doesn't have any effect whatsoever on the performance or functionality of my cd player, it's merely a cosmetic issue, but it happens fairly quick and I can't think of any easy way to fix it. It's barely noticeable, but worth pointing out to any potential future buyers. For this reason, I deducted one star, but overall still highly recommend this mount to almost anyone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLD3B1ME5JYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G1L52Q#wasThisHelpful","R2CLD3B1ME5JYK","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is certainly the one and only time I've ever placed a pre-order on a children's book, and it was well worth it. Ever since my wife and I came across the ""Pigeon"" series by Mo Willems, and bought the first one for our son, all three of us have been crazy about his books ever since. My son owns and loves all of them, including the pigeon activity book.The Pigeon Needs a Bath is another great hit in the series, and honestly I feel is the best book yet in the series. The story is humorous; my son especially loves the very impressively thorough page where the Pigeon is coming up with his excuses as to why the water in the bath is too hot, too cold, and the many other reasons he justifies not wanting to get in. The story was humorous for both adults and children alike. It's longer than some of the other pigeon books, but still short enough that it can frequently be read and reread in a reasonable amount of time. And like the other Mo Willems books, on top of being great and wacky stories about the adventures and misadventures of the pigeons, the artwork is phenomenal and humorous as well. The artwork is simple yet very expressive. It's easy on the eyes, and I have a feeling that both the comical stories and artwork in these books will make them fairly timeless. Our son is still young, but I can already imagine myself taking these books back out to one day read them to my grandkids and I don't feel as if they will seem aged or out of date.Overall, whether you are completely new to the pigeon series, or a long time reader, The Pigeon Needs a Bath is an outstanding addition to the Mo Willems collection and a book that I can imagine almost any child being excited to read and laugh about over and over again. Bonus points too, it even seemed to make my kid more excited about bath time as well!Thank you Mo Willems, and please keep the Pigeon series coming!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJROJ182F4D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1423190874#wasThisHelpful","RPJROJ182F4D6","AB0ZI13CLWPL6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB0ZI13CLWPL6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have another light like this one, and it is one of my favorite designs.  While it doesn't look fancy, it is compact and lightweight, making it easy to mount pretty much anywhere.  There is no articulating arm for the solar panel, which limits where it can be put, but also removes a potential point of failure.  Once it is turned on, it will output a dim amount of light once it is dark outside.  The light is sufficient to see the area, but also conserve battery life.  When motion is detected, which it does surprisingly well, the light is much brighter, which is nice for security as well as walking safely or parking.If you are looking for something inexpensive with a long battery life, this is a good choice.  There is nothing particularly fancy about it, but it survives a lot of rainfall and keeps going.Thank you to the company for a review unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14D1RY84D99KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130286K0#wasThisHelpful","R14D1RY84D99KZ","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many factors to take into account when designing wireless networks. As such, it is hard to predict exactly what, if any, benefit these antennas will give you. What I can say is that they have a much higher build quality than those included with standard routers, with durable connectors and an internal ratcheting mechanism to hold them in the correct position. That is important, since these are omni-directional along a horizontal plane perpendicular to the antenna. If it isn't angled correctly, it may give a worse signal than the cheapest antennas.For a standard home or small business network, the most efficient solution might be to use repeaters or a custom firmware to increase signal strength. With my relatively high end router, which includes decent antennas, these did not make much difference. However, when a higher build quality is important or for replacing poorly designed antennas, these are a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19SI39BC0OTUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJJAYLI#wasThisHelpful","R19SI39BC0OTUB","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a bit scared to try this after reading the reviews, but I found it surprisingly good and a nice upgrade over the standard canned soup.  First, the packaging eliminates the metallic flavor that can come with tomato based products.  It is creamy, with a white tint, rather than the bright red of classic Campbell's tomato soup.  The carries over to the texture and flavor as well, adding a bit of richness and some slight herb flavor.  I do wish that there was a brighter herb flavor.

"I have a couple closets with no lighting, so I end up using a flashlight to navigate them pretty regularly.  While I would eventually like to install strip lighting to illuminate all the shelves, this iHomeSet motion sensor light was a surprisingly effective quick fix.  The build quality is good and it is nice and small, but still puts out a good amount of light.  Others I've used had a button, but this one is automatic, and smart enough to know not to turn on if the closet is lit up already.  I like that a lot and have increasingly been automating lighting where it makes sense.In short, a small and attractive light way to quickly add light to a small closet or pantry.Thank you to the company for a review unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTV7O6ZQLU0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MH1V8GK#wasThisHelpful","RKTV7O6ZQLU0X","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know how the world of merchandising works, but there are few different models of humidifiers being sold under different brand names.  I've tried the main variations (as gifts from my mom or, in this case, because they sent me one to review), and this is my favorite.  The primary reason is that it creates a lot of scent with a relatively small amount of scented oil.  The larger units water down the oil too much, making them humidifiers more than appliances for aromatherapy.  Apart from that, the design is attractive and compact and it is easy to operate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZI037Q951T4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PQ6EXA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZI037Q951T4W","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:21 Mins Light bars change the whole feeling of driving in the woods at night and make it safer, but are also a relatively cheap way to add dramatic landscape lighting or light up tight spaces like attics.  My interests are mainly the latter, and this light bar does an excellent job.  It is super bright and the angle lights up a wide area rather than the tight directional beam that some create.  The design and build quality are high, with metal fins to keep things cool and it feels surprisingly solid for the price.  I see that some people have issues with broken LEDs, but all mine are functional so far.  I will update my review if any stop working.Thank you to the company for a review unit.

"Overall, I am really impressed with the quality of this artwork for the price.  The wood frame is nice, and the canvas is wrapped without any defects.  These particular paintings are beautiful and versatile, working with a lot of colors and room styles.  Standard mounting hardware is also included.  My only critique is that the print is a bit too glossy, which gives it less of a ""canvas"" look and more of a glossy photo print aesthetic.  Still, they are a nice way to add art to a bare room.Thank you to the company for a review unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XA02X79Y4BKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SV0ASQC#wasThisHelpful","R2XA02X79Y4BKX","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philips has made waves with their recent headphones, with the A5Pro being a catalyst.  They compete well with headphones from other brands that cost more while doing some unique things to set themselves apart.The build quality of these is the highest I've ever seen.  They are metal (aluminum and steel), with no obvious weak points.  That means they are ready for many nights DJing or just surviving travel.  The earpads and cord are also easy to replace, making this substantial investment more palatable.All of that durability does come at the cost of a little weight.  But, at over 400 grams, I still find them very comfortable because of their design.The sound quality is impressive and not what you might expect from DJ headphones.  Rather than boomy, with exaggerated bass, there is an intricacy and accuracy that is breathtaking.  At the same time, they are fast and adept with more fragmented sound.  At the same time, they create an openness and intimacy that, again, I would not expect given the branding.Overall, the A5Pro headphones show that Philips is serious about taking market share from the audiophile crowd.  The build quality is exceptional, and the audio quality doesn't fall short.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K3VAN8HAIYPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU2KJSO#wasThisHelpful","R2K3VAN8HAIYPP","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have saved a lot of money using space heaters, but they can be dangerous around young children.  This Vornado heater does a lot to mitigate that, though it isn't perfect.The general build quality of this fan is good, if not unusual.  It is all plastic, which prevents the surface from heating up.  The cord is thick, with a convenient hidden storage loop.  In order to prevent tipping, the base it wide.  It looks like the fan should be able to tilt in different directions, but unfortunately it is static.The first safety feature I noticed was the toggle switch that prevents the heater from being turned on by a baby.  A toddler may find this pretty easy to figure out (slide the arm out of the way before turning on), but it is a nice feature regardless.  On the bottom of the heater is a button that must be depressed for the heater to work.  So, if the heater tilts or is picked up, it will stop.  The grill is also designed to not allow small fingers to reach inside.Otherwise, the heater has the standard features, including two heat modes and fan only mode.  The controls are analog, which I like because it can be used with a thermostatic timer.My only critique is that the fan developed a rattle sound within minutes of my first use.  It is not terrible, but also disappointing for this higher priced fan.In short, this fan really is safer for children to be around, and is otherwise a standard fan heater.  If not for the rattle, I would give it 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVM9QEAMWJ5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PD6#wasThisHelpful","RDVM9QEAMWJ5H","AAA0TUKS5VBSA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAA0TUKS5VBSA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have to use my regular facial wash afterward to ensure that it removes all makeup and the greasy feeling that this product leaves on my skin. I would suggest this product for very dry or mature skin.Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"The Soft Skin Synergy Pre-Diluted Essential Oil Roll-On 10 ml (1/3 fl oz). Ready to use is a unique blend of essential oils with a potent fragrance that I do not personally like. My husband on the other hand, loves the fragrance and used it on his dry elbows until they softened up. The roller bottle is very convenient and painless for him to apply. Low maintenance, moisturizing, softened his rough skin and callused hands. Time for a new bottle!.Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"G.G.Martinsen 32 GB Mini Usb Port Slim Small Multi-lingual Selection 1.78 LCD Portable Mp3/Mp4 Player is a very compact media player that can display photos, play your music (various formats), videos (Im not sure what formats/untested), and ebooks. It comes with instructions, USB cable, and earbuds. The earbuds are average on sound quality and so I prefer to use this with much higher quality buds and cans but then all of those cost much more than the media player itself so that isnt at all surprising. With higher quality headphones the audio quality is excellent. The player itself works very well once you get used to the menu system (its not too difficult - I didnt need to read the instructions). I tested connecting this device to my Linux and Windows systems and it showed up right away. Transferring files to it was a breeze and just like transferring files to any USB stick. The now nearly ubiquitous control ring has menu, next, previous, and play/pause buttons. You control the player using those buttons with short and long presses. Where this unit really excels is in a low cost music player and voice recorder for note taking (mic quality is passable imo). I have a phone that can do all of these things better, however I dont always like lugging my much bigger phone around and sometimes I work in areas where my phone might be targeted for theft so I like to keep it out of sight. This thing is great for athletes working out who dont want the weight and bulk of their phones on them.Note: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"The Solar BBQ Light from Carol Wright Gifts is truly a must have for my grilling adventures, as I grill in a mostly dark area.  Until this arrived, I used a typical flashlight.  Sometimes, I dragged the grill to the corner of the house where the floodlights arethose that understandwell, you understand. With this nifty light, it was easy installation of 1 rechargeable battery (included) and off I went to the grill.  Aside from the on/off button, the motion sensor is activated which is nice when your hands are full of stuff.  With 10 LEDs, the lights are plenty bright to grill anything and the swivel unit is great to position it properly.  The only issue that I have is the swivel point for the light seems a little light.  It positions nicely but, it does tend to move slightly under its own weight.Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

" 1:59 Mins The WinBridge Portable Voice Amplifier Waist Support MP3 Format Audio for Tour Guides, Teachers, Coaches, Presentations is in the mediocre-good range for such a device, for which I've never really had to compare it to. I like that it can clip onto the waistband. This is going to be a gift for my brother, who teaches high school Science. Currently,  he is using a small microphone that he attaches to his lanyard from his cell phone.

"This thermal flask will hold a close temperature of either hot or cold drinks for up to six hours.  And you can boost the effect by pre-heating or pre-chilling the flask.  Its double wall construction is the genie in the bottle.  The most interesting thing about this thermal flask, however, is the cap.

"This small waterproof battery is a champ.  With 5600mAH, it recharged both my cell phone and my iPad with just a little power to spare.  An overnight charge will be it back to full power in storage. Other batteries can perform just as well, so whats great about this one?Its the size (about four inches long and one inch thick) and the waterproof covering.  Its a terrific battery for sports.  I keep it in my bike bag where its small size still leaves room for a tool kit, keys, and other essentials while I ride.The waterproof covering is especially important because theres often a puddle you cannot avoid, and you end up wet with your bike and bike bag wet as well.  No worries about this battery.  If you make certain youve closed the door that houses the input and output ports, youre safe from splashes.  And youve still got the power you need to make a call in case of trouble.In addition, this battery offers two lights, one white with steady and flashing modes, one red.

"Just What I NeededThis 4-in-1 socket adapter has solved a long-standing problem in my car.  How can I use my independent GPS, my air purifier, and my recharger for electronic devices  all at once.  This adapter has three sockets and a usb interface in case I need an extra port. Included as a part of the socket adapter is a long cord, so Im able to move the adapter away from the cigarette lighter and out of the way of my gear shift lever.  When Im not using it at all, I stow it in the console, ready for the next trip.In addition to my need to use all three sockets at once, I also enjoy the temperature reading for each of the sockets.

"Heres a surge protector with something new and very, very useful  the outlets rotate.  What this means is that you dont have to replace all the plugs to make room for a very large plug like those that sometimes accompany electronic devices.  Simply rotate the outlet, and your large plug will fit on the outside of the surge protector, no longer interfering with other plugs. This is an innovation that really helps when your surge protector is full.  Now you can use all the outlets at once, regardless of the size of the plug.In addition to the six rotateable outlets, there are two usb ports included with this surge protector.  Charge up the many devices that use usb cables without adding extra charging devices.Im really pleased with this surge protector.

"Wow! Im impressed with this flashlight.  It offers five light modes:1) super bright;2) normal light;3) low light;4) strobe; and5) slow flash.A brief tap on the green switch on the end of the flash light will change the mode.The flashlight is constructed of a sturdy metal, and it is a tactical type flash light.  Included with the flashlight is a holder that will allow you to use the light on your bicycle.  I attached it to the handle bar on my bike and compared it to the light I had been using.  This light is much brighter than my old light and allows me to see much farther into the distance at night, so I feel more secure riding at night. I'm leaving it on my bicycle, but it can be easily removed without the need for tools.The flashlight is small enough to fit in a pocket, less than six inches in length.  It is powered by a battery that can be recharged, and the charger is included with the light.Im amazed at the modest cost of this light, less than 20% of the cost of my older tactical flash light.  When you need a new flashlight, get this one.  Small, bright, rechargeable, and very sturdy.  I'm delighted, and I feel sure you will be as well.FIVE STARS!Sample provided for impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T28CZ1EQENCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OGL5U2#wasThisHelpful","R3T28CZ1EQENCJ","A240FRPD4MEXND","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A240FRPD4MEXND?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If youve got a dog who grows hair like mine (Yorkie), youve got to pay a monthly grooming fee (expensive for a Yorkie) or learn to trim the dog yourself.  I decided to learn to trim her both for the savings and for avoiding the trauma that she feels every time we go to the groomers.  These grooming scissors help make the job quick.Included in the set are straight scissors, curved scissors (especially helpful for trimming the feet), and thinning scissors.  Molly has so much hair that the thinning scissors are used most often, in fact every time shes bathed.  She has heavy hair on her rump, and thining out that thick hair there makes it easier to clean her up.  She might not agree, but she does love doing her business without getting it stuck in heavy hair.All three pairs are sharp, so I can easily remove hair that needs trimming without hurting the dog.  Tips are almost blunt, very rounded with no sharp points.  While Molly is no fan of grooming, she also sits quietly while I do it, knowing that it will soon be over.Give this scissor set a try if you decide to groom your dog.  They are modestly priced but work very well.

"This small waterproof battery is a champ.  With 5600mAH, it recharged both my cell phone and my iPad with just a little power to spare.  An overnight charge will be it back to full power in storage. Other batteries can perform just as well, so whats great about this one?Its the size (about four inches long and one inch thick) and the waterproof covering.  Its a terrific battery for sports.  I keep it in my bike bag where its small size still leaves room for a tool kit, keys, and other essentials while I ride.The waterproof covering is especially important because theres often a puddle you cannot avoid, and you end up wet with your bike and bike bag wet as well.  No worries about this battery.  If you make certain youve closed the door that houses the input and output ports, youre safe from splashes.  And youve still got the power you need to make a call in case of trouble.In addition, this battery offers two lights, one white with steady and flashing modes, one red.

"If youve recently shopped for a new laptop, youve undoubtedly seen versions that are smaller, thinner, and lighter for sale.  While they may offer the latest in components, these laptops do not offer an optical disk, thus the manufacturers can keep them smaller and thinner.Lately, I have seldom used the disk reader/writer in my own laptop.  Nowdays, many software manufacturers offer downloadable versions of their software.  Downloads can be saved on an independent drive, so I have little use for the optical drive  except when I do.  Some of my critical software is available to me only on a disk and not on an internet site, so Im not yet ready to give up an optical disk.Here are the choices Ive been offered:1) full sized laptop with an optical disk (more expensive, heavier, and thicker) or,2) lighter sized laptop with no optical disk (less expensive, lighter weight, thinner.Given those choices, Id chose the second, except that Id have to do without certain critical software, so Ive chosen the first option.  Now I have a third choice:3) lighter sized laptop with an external portable optical drive.The Ruban optical disk serves well as the external portable disk in option 3.  It is easy to install.  Plug it into a usb port using only the cable included with the drive. Load the software from the disk included in the package, and youre ready to go.  The disk runs very quietly and accurately.

"Several years ago I gave up Christmas lights in my yard.  Oh, they were cheery, but the cords that littered the ground were a safety hazard for family and guests.  And they were expensive to run.  My electric bill told the tale.This year the lights go on again.  LED lights on a long string will do the trick with no increase in my power bill and, more importantly, no wires stretching from tree to power outlets, no extension cords waiting to trip someone.

You can have all the lights flash.  You can have the lights on with no flashing at all.

"Wow, I love this charger!! It's the fastest multi-charger I've owned yet. Finally, I can charge two of my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3's in one device with both being 2.4 A!! My tablets have never charged faster (and both of them have faulty connection ports and always took forever to move even one percent). Using this charger, I was able to get to 100% much faster and so I am definitely very happy. I can also attach two Androids and my one iPod Touch and they all charge lightning fast. Just amazing and such a great price for the speed it gives you. I'm very glad to have a charger that doesn't give different ports or charging speeds to different devices; it's much easier to just attach everything to any spot for easy convenience. I highly recommend this product. Needless to say, I am never going back to my regular multi device charger and will buy from miiMODE from now on.

"My little cousin LOVES this cereal. The taste doesn't compare to warm out of the oven cookies of course, but it's not a bad alternative. The cereal is crunchy with a few chocolate dots on them and are lightly sweet and taste delicious in milk. I'm not a huge fan of the cereal, but my little cousin is and as long as she likes it, I'll keep buying it for her. She's always a big fan of how the cereal is shaped and it's this huge box is perfect for her snacky moods when she wants to just grab some and try to dip them in milk haha.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXY29DE75BG7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMYMH3E#wasThisHelpful","RXY29DE75BG7W","A3JHZBO67WSMAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JHZBO67WSMAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:19 MinsWow, this spinner is so much fun! You do need batteries for it to work, but it's very easy to use and glows brightly. Simply plug in the batteries and press the button to turn it on. After pressing the button for a few seconds, it stays on until you turn it off. It is EXTREMELY bright - it's great and after a while, the balls actually spin in different patterns for endless fun.My little cousin actually plans to use this when trick-or-treating and it's great for parties as well. I would just beware that trying to touch the balls when they are in motion can hurt, so be sure to keep this a good distance away from your own face and other people's bodies to prevent any harm. Otherwise, this product is very simple to figure out and loads of fun to play with for a cheap price!

" 2:29 MinsI was so surprised how big these tools were! Since it was only $15, I expected something actually toddler size, but when this came in my mail, I was definitely shocked at the size. This is such a cute kit and it's absolutely wonderful. My little cousin is obsessed with play shopping and cooking, so I wanted to get this for her birthday which is coming up soon.You get utensils, a knife with a cutting board, pots and a stove, as well as salt and pepper shaker with matching mugs. They are very nice and bright colors and well made. They are lightweight, but they are also thick and nothing is too sharp. It's a great play kit for kids to learn and play to their imagination and I know my little cousin is going to love it.

"I am obsessed with adult coloring books right now and I received this one a few days ago and love it!! The designs range from sort of simple to very complex, and so it is very interesting! I love how abstract all the pages are, and no two pages are the same at all. Every single one has its own unique aspect to it and so for that, I give it an A+!I use pens to color in my drawings, 0.5 mm sometimes, but despite the pages being a bit thin, nothing bleeds through to the next page (although when I look at the blank page on the back, I do notice the color) ! Each page is wonderfully made and it's really up to your imagination of how you want to color it. Coloring relaxes me a lot, but I hated children's coloring books because you could maybe color in the person or animal with one color and 50% of the coloring would be done. I get bored easily, so if I color with one color for too long, I lose interest. However, with all the little spaces in details in this book, it's hard to get bored. This book is lots of fun for a great price.

"This is beyond adorable! I was initially worried about the mess that would come with this product since it is sand and my cousin loves to make a lot of mess when playing around. However, once I received the kit, I was surprised to see that the sand was actually quite dense so that you don't spill bits and pieces of sand everywhere. The density was quite nice, and it had a nice texture for molding. It's not sticky at all so once you pack some sand in the mold,it's very easy to get a clean mold and the molds are very easy to clean if anything.I love all the little animals that came with it (elephant is my favorite), although my little cousin loves the roller. This toys provides a lot of imagination really, and my little cousin kept requesting to play with it and refused to stop until she just had to go to sleep. Nothing in this set is too sharp and it is 100% safe although I would be sure to keep an eye out so that nothing gets eaten. Overall, I have no complaints.

"Flashcards are a great study tool and I've learned a lot using these flashcards to flip through and learn some quick facts and pick up some basic things that I had forgotten. However, the flashcards are not updated for the 2015 MCAT and the fact that it's so much more expensive for an oudated set is very off putting. It's definitely detailed and very helpful for those who don't like to study by reading, but you definitely need a lot more than flashcards to study for the MCAT. It's hard to tell how much of this will be helpful for the MCAT, but it's at least decent in review for the science sections. The cards are quite thick and the way the information is organized is very helpful and makes it an easy read for those like me who don't always have the best attention spans.The diagrams and points made are very helpful and give me some great quick lessons and summarize important lessons and tips very well. However, as stated, it's missing the sections for the new updated MCAT, so I would personally not buy these if you're looking for a good and detailed flashcard system for the sections of biochemistry, psych, etc. Still, it's definitely a good support for some of the science sections that make it easier to study than reading huge books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8H3TD0WHIL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610720091#wasThisHelpful","R1I8H3TD0WHIL4","A3JHZBO67WSMAA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JHZBO67WSMAA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I've always bought cheap paintbrushes in the past, so I was very impressed by this quality set of brushes. I knew they were going to be long from the picture, but the actual size of the brushes when I got to opening the case just made my jaw drop. The brushes are longer than half of my arm!I love that the brushes have the sizes on them too. There are many varied brushes for different sizes, making it easier to paint in the larger backgrounds for different canvases as well as layering on intricate details to a piece. The bristles are a bit tough at first, but they soften up with water and spread the paint very well. The hard bristles actually are a good thing since they don't seem to shed easily.However, one thing that got to me was the very strong smell when I first removed the case. I left it to air for a few days, but there's still a slight smell coming from it. Although it's not nearly as strong now, I was quite set off by it. There was also slight damage to my size 10 brush, but it wasn't a huge deal. However, that was my only complaint with the brushes. I love how you can make the paintbrushes stand up with the pop up velcro tabs that support the brushes. It definitely makes it easier to grab the brushes and it's quite sturdy so there's many ways it minimizes possible mess. Overall, the case and brushes are very nice quality, and I can imagine these are going to last a very long time. My sister has already requested that she wants to use it for her next art idea, so that's how I know they're really good since she's much more knowledgeable about the arts than I am.

"This is so cute and fun to play with!! I absolutely love all the different flower shapes and they definitely make vegetables more fun to eat. I have a picky little cousin who absolutely hates vegetables because they look and taste icky. But, once she saw me trying to cut carrots into the shapes of pretty flowers, she wanted to join in! My mother put them into her dish that day, and I told her that my mother used the vegetables we cut - and she immediately ate them because she was so attracted to the shape!The cutters do require some force to push and cut down if you have thick slices of vegetables, but the cut precisely and always make the same size shape of the cutter you are using. I really appreciate the hand guards because the edges of the cutters can be quite sharp and sometimes vegetables can be very slippery - so I also recommend wearing some thick gloves in case you are dealing with unsteady pieces of food. Beyond vegetables, I plan to use these for dough as well so they work very well as cookie cutters! Lots of versatility and fun with this product, and no complaints.

"I've never had a memory foam pillow before but WOW, I can't imagine why I never even bought one despite having read all types of good reviews. When I first got the pillow, it came in a round cylindrical bag - I nearly thought I had bought a yoga mat and didn't even remember. However, upon inspection, I realized it was my bamboo pillow! I got really confused and was wondering why my pillow was shaped like this. I took it out of its bag and unwound it, and after taking off the layers of plastic, I realized it was just very flat. I didn't see any instructions for it, but I remember the description said to let it air out for 24 hours - and so that is what I did.There was a smell coming from the pillow, most likely due to the tight wrapping of the plastic, but that all quickly disappeared to a minimal once it had aired out completely. It was really neat watching the pillow grow near me and after about 12 hours, it seemed to have grown to full capacity - although I did let it sit for 24 hours just in case.The pillow is extremely soft! I kept pressing my hands on each side just to test it, and I love how cool it is. In the summer, my house usually doesn't run too much air conditioning anyway, so we need all the cool we can get. I felt very relaxed lying down on it, and it felt like I was sinking into a cloud. I don't sleep too easily due to various reasons, but I definitely felt more at ease and ready to sleep with this pillow when I took a nap earlier. I woke up to see that it had left an imprint of where my head had stayed, so that was very interesting. I'm definitely going to buy memory foam pillows for the entire family now.

"Although I just got the mouse today, I am already loving it! It's super easy to install and extremely easy to use. The only thing I had trouble with was finding where the USB receiver was - but thankfully due to another reviewer posting a video instruction, I found that the USB receiver is actually on the bottom of the mouse, and you pull out the brand name to reveal your USB receiver. I thought that storage idea was very cool, although it would have been nice if that information was stated somewhere.You do need 2 AAA batteries, but once you stick them in, you should see a flash of red light on the bottom which means that it's ready to use. I was able to use my mouse immediately after turning on the mouse and plugging in the receiver. It's easy and the mouse feels very comfortable in my hands. My hands are quite small and so the mouse is only slightly smaller than it, but it's still an easy grip and everything is within easy access for me to reach. I was only interested in getting a wireless mouse, so I have no idea how it works for gaming - although it states that it's only for basic gaming.

Teenage daughter - freshman in college with no interest in neatness or order.The mission: 15 minutes max to put together the vacuum and do the whole house.Mission a-c-c-o-m-p-l-i-s-h-e-d! Super easy to put together (you'll need a Philips screwdriver only). This thing sucks like a champ, is easy to maneuver, covers a wide path, and tools can be used to pick up lint/dust/corner stuff. No rug pulling nor issue with going from laminate to rug (it did not immediately spit out all the stuff like a regular vac would do). It is lightweight - but it's not light guys. So you'll still be carrying it upstairs - it's not going to carry itself. The bag seems doable - I've had bagless for many years but I really do detest cleaning them out so we'll give this a go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXE6IG3C36BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DM27H4K#wasThisHelpful","R1LXE6IG3C36BB","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I live in a 1937 concrete block townhouse with baseboard heaters from 1971. It's also all open concept downstairs which means there are no ""rooms"" to heat where you can shut off space. That means it eats money for heating like crazy in the winter and fall. It's a tragedy. So I try to find ways to economize. I use radiant heat via space heaters and we dress warmly. I normally run very hot - but my daughter and her friends are perpetually cold. Enter this blanket. It works for all of us.This is seriously the most plush blanket I've ever had. You wrap yourself up and you want to cocoon and not come out until Spring. I'm not kidding. The heating element is great - it doesn't get so hot that it makes you sweat and the controls are easy to use. It's a great size for lounging around. I'm probably going to buy another so we can have two. This is one of those purchases that your mother in law might give you for Christmas or you might think about for a relative. Contrary to so many hokey lame gifts - this one would be a big score putting you in good graces for many years with those you love!

"I've been reading Ally Carter books since I was in middle school. I have always loved the world of espionage and intrigue, and combined with some badass teenage girls kicking butt I was in love with the Gallagher Girls series. Heist Society was just as good, looking at the less legal side of the intrigue coin, but with the same charm of the Gallagher series that I loved. Cammie Morgan and Kat have been with me since I was a kid, and I was beyond excited when I heard news of Ally's new book All Fall Down. Overall, I was not disappointed by this read. The story takes a more diplomatic approach to drama, set in the political peak of Embassy Row in the land of Adria, where Grace- the granddaughter of the American ambassador- is trying to figure out the truth behind her mother's death years ago. She makes friends with other kids on the row, and together they try to figure out whether or not Grace's belief that her mother was murdered is true or if she really is- like all the doctors say, in the nicest terms- crazy. The plot of this story kept me reading like a fiend. There were moments where I wasn't sure the doctors were wrong about Grace, and others where I was sure she had to be right. Grace's character as a whole had me in tears some moments from her frustration and self-doubt about what she was doing and the fact that nobody seemed to be listening to her. The entire story had a dark undertone, one that reminded me a lot of the second to last Gallagher Girls book (if you read it, you know what I'm talking about) and the truth behind what happened to Grace's mother genuinely surprised me. The characters were fun, and I loved Grace's ragtag team of youths that she got together to help her solve this mystery and catch her mother's killer.However, I had my fair share of gripes with the story. First, Grace's relationship with the cute Russian boy next door, Alexei. Though Grace recounted knowing him as a kid, and how he was her brother's close friend on the Row, I never really got a sense for how their relationship developed in this book. I was never sold that they had any real interaction when they were kids, though she mentioned it a few times, and when a ""relationship"" seemed to develop between the two I found it all sort of... Random. Especially considering for half the book she just kept pushing him away. They had a few large interactions, but his presence in the book overall felt scarce. I couldn't understand how such a deep bond had formed by the end, and even though he had helped her keep cal during her attacks and tried to keep an eye on her throughout the book, I just didn't see enough of an interaction there. I'm hoping that in the next book we'll see much more development if that relationship is planned to continue.The last thing that bothered me was some repetition and a few aspects of Grace's character. A lot of serious phrases in the book just felt overused, and they lost their impact as the story went on. For example, a phrase like ""I'd never feel safe again"" would be used like five times. A line like that loses impact when used so often, and it wasn't the only one. Grace would say things like this like virtually every chapter, and I understood she's been through hell and back these past few years, but at times it just felt unnecessary to state it over and over again. It didn't detract from her character majorly, though, and I still enjoyed reading from such a dark perspective. I just wish things like that would've been used more sparingly, and I feel it would've made her character more solid.Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this book- just like all of Ally Carter's work- and I can't wait for Embassy Row Book 2!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24FQVU8SVT92I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545654742#wasThisHelpful","R24FQVU8SVT92I","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After receiving Corel Painter 2015 last year, I was very excited to see what changes would be made in the new 2016 edition. As an art student, I've used several types of software for art and illustration including Corel Draw, Manga Studio (now Clip Studio Paint), Corel Painter 2015, and of course Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Of all these products, Corel Painter 2015 definitely had the most resources and tools focused on digital drawing, painting and illustration- and that holds true in Corel Painter 2016 as well. There are a multitude of tools and mediums, all categorized by their sections (such as pencils, oil paints, acrylic, gouache and more) that span essentially the entire spectrum of traditional mediums. The textures of the brushes and the tools are beautiful, and on the canvas layer look exactly as they would if they were being used traditionally. As in most art programs, there are several other windows that can be utilized as well including the navigator, layers, and color tool (all digital staples). Overall, this program has an impressive amount of tools (especially the various brushes, pens, pencils, etc. which are my favorite thing about Corel Painter) and on top of that, they've added a few new features to this edition. The most interesting one was the ability to turn music into patterns and brushes that could be integrated into your work. I've never seen a feature like this before, and while it is not perfect (as the it is very sensitive to the sound and beat of the music and not every song translates well into a digital pattern), it opens doorways to several very interesting designs, projects, and opportunities. A gripe I do have with Corel Painter though, and have since 2015, is the Undo feature. The program I use the most often is Manga Studio 5, because of its simple interface and tools- including a very convenient and easy to use Undo button. I am not someone who enjoys using keyboard commands, so having an Undo option somewhere on the screen is a big plus for me, and Corel Painter doesn't seem to have that. Going to the command bar and clicking on the Edit tab and clicking Undo is a tedious process in my opinion (especially if you have to use it more than once in a row), and something as simple as an Undo feature would be nice to have displayed in my workspace, versus under a tab in the command bar. One other issue I have is, while the tools look absolutely gorgeous when used on the Canvas layer, they lose all their texture in any other layer you create. Perhaps there's a way to edit this that I don't know of or haven't figured out yet (I'm still experimenting with digital illustration and design, so I don't claim to be an expert in this field) but it is very frustrating when I want to color or draw something on a layer that isn't the base canvas layer and all the tools I use lose their gorgeous textures. Since the large array of tools and the way they look when used is my favorite part of this program, it makes me sad that I can only see what they really do on one layer. Finally, there is one large feature I have yet to experiment with in this program and that is the Animation feature. I have looked at it, and it seems like it has some potential for basic animation, but I haven't actually created anything with it yet. Overall, this edition of Corel Painter is just as good as the old one with a few new tricks added in. I'm excited to see what Corel puts out next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KF59549KX8I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C648Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KF59549KX8I6","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perhaps best for hair that is not super long and thick. My daughters hair is very thick but she just got it cut to below shoulder length. That made a big difference for her with this brush. When her hair was longer this brush was a bit more difficult to get through her hair. It's not huge - and it seemed to lack enough umph to push itself through without some amount of constantly going over the same area more then once.

"I am a runner and, as such, always seem to have a time or two per year where I need extra help. I regularly go to the chiro and get ART and Graston Technique done as well as adjustments and I foam roll, use yoga therapy balls, and otherwise do fascia release.

I find it more flexible then KT Tape - and not quite as thick which means I have an easier time of maneuvering it over curves and bumps on my legs. I also don't ""feel"" it quite as much as the other tapes. However this tape is really painful to remove - more so then other tapes. It does last longer though so there is a trade off.

"Even for those who enjoyed the home decorating aspects of past Animal Crossing Games this will rapidly demonstrate that it lacks any form of depth or breadth.As a huge fan of the AC games (I still have every one of them and play them all even many years later!) I was aware that this Happy Home Designer (HHD) focuses solely on designing homes. I eagerly anticipated getting home design requests and finding out how I did on meeting the villager's goals. I thought of all the hours I spent collecting unique items in the other games - often traveling to stores to download limited time special items and happily enjoying visiting so many other players' towns hoping to find a rare piece of furniture at their Nook's. How I loved to send letters to my villagers and eagerly wait for their letters back - with the attached presents - some of which would be items I wanted for my house. As I progressed in the games and catching (or purchasing) needed museum items became more rare, my attention turned to satisfying Lyle and the Happy Home Academy. Pursuing expansions, going to flea market's, and exchanging thousands of bells with other players just to get that last item in a set were weekly activities. I feel like AC should come with the warning that you *might* need to go to a 12 step program before long as I found myself hopelessly addicted within minutes of every new offering.So - 2 stars. One is just because it is Animal Crossing and there is some, albeit limited, charm in designing in this game. However the long list of woulda, coulda, shoulda built up by the minute of playtime - until I was spending much more time noting everything that could have been but isn't. Incredibly disappointing. So below I've expounded on all the things things that could have been.I could have my own house to decorate - and perhaps I could have unlocked items or received special items from villagers for doing an outstanding job (vs an ok job) decorating their house. I could have had interesting, funny, sad, inspiring, or affectionate conversations with villagers while designing their house and when I finished. While there are a few gems here and there this game utterly lacks the charm of the characters. They can practically be interchanged - not much sets them apart personality wise. I could freely roam my town - visiting the folks for whom I've designed their home -- so happy and proud of my accomplishment. I can do that - but I cannot walk around to do so. It's only menu driven. HUH? Why wouldn't you be able to walk around your town and enjoy it? I do get that designed hundreds of homes would be a big town and rather expansive - but I still wanted to feel like I was part of the game (rather than an employee who goes home to a different town every night - I wanted to live there too!). To compare the equivalent in ACNL would be if you could only walk in the museum/shops area and the entire rest of the village (below the tracks) you could only get around to via menu and choosing a character to visit. It leaves a dead and disconnected player - without any connection to the greater whole of the players creation. Epic miss here.OK so then I thought, well, focus on designing. Except I can do no wrong. I'm stuck in a Groundhog Day on a loop where I am perfect. It's pretty satisfying the first few times - but after that I must confess I wanted to start deliberately sabotaging what I was doing. Apparently the ""everybody gets a trophy"" construct has now invaded Animal Crossing just like the blob did the theatre in the old movie. No matter what I do the animal loves me. I can do no wrong. That makes me boring, vapid, and lame. I'm not a fan of those feelings. This is the part that is most painful to me. Sure take away many other elements to focus on the core of home designing - but for goodness sakes make it have some level of challenge or reward! Something, anything to reward my hour long work in designing the perfect home. Instead I'm met with the same ""I love it"" reaction from every.stinking.animal. This, IMHO, is the game killer. As others have noted perhaps a scale of ""that's ok"" to ""super awesomeness"" should have been offered. You could even OPT IN to this when you set up the game. Much like choosing whether you want to go easy or grindingly difficult in games that offer that option. Let the kiddies parents tell them to choose the ""easy"" setting if they cannot handle realistic criticism and encouragement. There is being creative and stretching your artistic muscles and then there is just mindless wandering without any aim. So far I don't even get a badge for doing so many homes or any sort of recognition beyond every villager loving what I do. That might work for 6 year old - but I want to have some sense of satisfaction. Even if the villagers had a scale - I would go back and re decorate just to move higher on the ranking scale. Anything to reinforce the value of my work. Yeah yeah - intrinsic value. I like both my own satisfaction and an external indicator.To be fair there were enjoyable elements but the lack of connection I felt to the game (you cannot even change your clothes!) overshadowed all the positive stuff like a black cloud and it became pretty monotonous and repetitive very quick. It seems like a few choices could have been made that would have had a real measurable impact on my enjoyment of the game. In an effort to see if I can interject some more love for me for this game - I'm going to get some amiibo packs and go online to see and rate others. However I'm not a fan of rating others and them rating me. I want Lyle to do that - and I want to have to work to get a better rating.  EDITED: I did buy several Amiibo packs. For the special characters like Isabelle you can make her appear but she does nothing. You cannot talk to her, she does not interact with the villager nor the homes. She just stands there - like a hologram without a voice. I LOVE the cards (they are giving me the satisfaction I'd hoped to get from this game because of course I want them all).I bought this with the new 3DS unit and I'm very happy with the unit itself. I love the faceplates and the smaller size for travel. However I'll be loading in my Animal Crossing New Leaf to take with me on my travel this fall. I think I'll start a new game (I almost always have at least 2 carts of each game - I like to have multiple games going at the same time) there. The bottom line here is no risk, no reward. It leaves you with a hollow feeling - like seeing a whole table full of plastic food - it's pretty and if you don't look too closely it looks appetizing but it's never going to satisfy. At this price point I cannot recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIQ2WCNDBKHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZS2HFVW#wasThisHelpful","R1YIQ2WCNDBKHW","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both my daughter and I tried these panties. We are not quite the same size (I am a 6 and she is a 7) and we have different body shapes. These did not fit me but she liked them a lot. I would give them 2 stars and she says 5 as she really likes them - so we compromised on 4. For me they ride up and I don't like how the elastic feels - it almost seems to cut into my skin. I have sensitive skin. My daughter wears a larger variety of different panties and she says these covered well and did not ride up. They seem a bit larger then a 6 - so perhaps if you are a size 7 these are a good option. For me, as a 6, there seemed to be a little long and big. The fabric is standard and the panels are not super soft but neither do they scratch. These are very thin underwear for a cotton blend - and the bands are also think and narrow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26TWQPB0ZURZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTV8C54#wasThisHelpful","R26TWQPB0ZURZ4","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line: You can finally be the person who says their you-know-what does not stink!Seriously. This really does work. It's a strong smell - however not all strong smells will mask poop. I do have to say that, once I went vegan, my poop (and farts) smell way less nasty then they used too with animal products. People in my house remark on this all the time. I remark on it when I have to use the bathroom after they are done. No lie. It's like a reason to go vegan man. I'm trying to craftily find a way a way to gift my ex a bottle of this when he comes to visit (we share our kids...so we end up in the same locale occasionally). I think if you have a guy and his diet is full of stinky stuff this would be a required element. Possibly before food. I'd even hold out sex. Yes. Yes I would. NO ONE should have to go into the bathroom after a guys been in there doing his business and reading the paper or whatnot. That could be considered a form of domestic discipline. Who needs spanking when you can use poop stink? No one. That's who.This actually works as well on cat poop as human. It doesn't erase smells from carpet or anything. But if you have a multi cat household and the litterbox is somewhere you will smell it - like in a bedroom closet by your bed - this will do to banish that stink as well. As a general rule I just ignore it (after all my cats ignore it..they seem not bothered by it at all) but there are times I just cannot let it lie. I scoop and throw - but the smell lingers. For that this works good too!When this bottle arrived my daughter was overjoyed. She just started college. Think dorms and other situations where you don't want to stink. She loves it too. I will need to purchase more. I'm not overly bothered by the strong smell and she is not either. Most of the women and men I know are so over perfumed/cologned you can barely tell anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CY3UGYWVDTBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW25UMC#wasThisHelpful","R3CY3UGYWVDTBV","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the red one's and they are excellent. There are 4 to the package and they are super easy to use and clean. Considering I'm a vegan I cook a lot. I also make a lot of messes because I have a small kitchen and so there is little room to really spread out and cook. Having 4 of these is a lifesaver. They work great to not only rest a spoon but also to rest other things like measuring cups, measuring spoons, and I've even used them to hold some crushed nuts when I ran out of little bowls. They wash up easily by hand (I have no dishwasher). I like silicone because I have a flat top stove and these don't scare me like some of the other types. Metal gets super hot and I've had ceramic break (not sure what caused that..but it was not fun!) and these are simple to stack and pull and use. They are flexible so don't expect this hard spoon rest that is easily moved with a spoon on it that's heavy. They won't do that because they are not super thick silicone. For all my uses these are outstanding. I received these in exchange for a review. I think they'd make a great gift for a newlywed. I often create a big basket of fun kitchen gadgets for wedding gifts and these would be excellent put in one of them. They are better then anything similar I've gotten at IKEA (my normal shop for gadgets place). Plus - the colors! How great they come in so many!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELZM0HMX1NXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012213NR6#wasThisHelpful","RELZM0HMX1NXV","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easily a top 5 of the year book for me. While I enjoyed the first one in this series I was not as thrilled with #2. #3 definitely blows them both out of the water. And that's saying something. Complex characters, great action, and a story spanning over a decade mean you get to spend a ton of time with these boys and you really know them. They speak to you and their lives are utterly irresistible. There is a train wreck going on - but you cannot look away.

"Firstly this is one of the best tasting supplements I've ever had. It's got a fresh citrus'y taste that is not strong nor overly sweet. I like stevia but I know others do not and this did not have a funny after taste. I mixed it with rice milk. At this point I cannot tell a specific benefit but I am using it as part of an overall fitness routine while training for a marathon. I used this in place of one of my recovery drinks and felt just as good as I do with the other drink in terms of muscle recovery. I'm hoping this boosts my immune system so I do not get sick. So I'm going to continue using it daily and see what happens. I will update my review as time goes on.

"I've got a few of these types of units and this is a favorite and one I travel with frequently due to it's pro'sPro'sIt is a surge protector (SO many of my USB hubs are not!)It can handle universal input which is super helpful to me with international visitors (we are a host family for foreign students)It has enough power to do at least 2 IPAD's (though they say 3 - in the USB port area - two ports are only 1A so IPAD's would probably take longer to charge)It can charge and provide power to 6 at once. YES!!It feels pretty heavy dutyConsThe plastic unit itself does not feel as sturdy as others I've got - however I've had no issues.The reason this is such a fantastic item for me is that my daughter and I work together on opposite sides of the table. In fact we're ready to ditch the smaller kitchen table for a larger desk with some filing cabinets underneath to give more space to work. She's an artist and I'm just a ""spreads out'er"". This is placed between us and it can handle everything we've thrown at it from phone's to handheld gaming systems to IPAD's to regular PC and my MacBook and no issues! This is a case of you don't know what you are missing until you have it and this makes our life so much easier. Additionally our cats often play under the table so having an assortment of cords was providing some chewing opportunity that we didn't want them to have - and this solves that by allowing us to just have the one cord. Although I got this item in exchange for my review I would happily, willingly pay the asking price. If you have this type of need this is a must have. I gutted and remodeled my house before I moved in and I put USB outlet's in but even they aren't enough and this works better for everywhere they aren't (AND they are protected in this one..all the better!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F0JHGMU663E2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141YXRVO#wasThisHelpful","R2F0JHGMU663E2","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very cute scrubbers! They match nicely with my black and white kitchen and they are made of material that is washcloth like. They work on scrubbing most things but not the heavier baked on items - they don't have the type of fabric required to get at tough to scrub food remnants. Because they are cloth (think cotton feeling) they are also a little awkward to hold while scrubbing. There is no ""heft"" to allow you to get a great purchase vis a vis a thicker pad you can double up or similar. They do work well for when you've soaked an item in water and for general sort of everyday type situations - but I wouldn't reach for them for heavy duty scrubbing action. You'll want to maintain another cloth or scrubber for those areas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SKQ25YEI1KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6PK30U#wasThisHelpful","R35SKQ25YEI1KR","A3TP31S61PPE3G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TP31S61PPE3G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been rolling my own cigarettes with a manual Topomatic machine for a lot of years. I consider the topomatic to be a very good manual machine. As the years go by my arthritis makes it harder and harder to roll cigarettes with a manual machine so I decided to try this machine despite the mixed reviews. Here is the things to avoid on this powermatic 2 machine. When you get down to the last 1 inch of tobacco in the bag DON'T use it. Instead mix it a little at a time with new tobacco. The reason for this is the last amount of tobacco has very small pieces in it and it is easy to over pack the machine and jam it. There is no doubt if you jam the machine you will eventually strip the gears out of the machine. I use one pound bags of pipe tobacco. The most important thing to remember is if you feel a lot of resistance when you press the lever down STOP and take out some of the Tobacco. You should only feel slightly more resistance on the lever then if there was no tobacco in the machine. Now when it comes to rolling 100 size cigarettes here is the way to do it. Put the tobacco in the machine normally and then with your two fingers in the center push the tobacco into both corners of the machine, then add a little more to the center, presto perfect 100 size cigarette. I have no idea how long the machine will last so for the time being I am going to only give it 4 stars but after 3,000 cigarettes I will update my rating if it proves to be reliable. There are two good video reviews on YouTube about this machine. One video is about rolling the cigarettes and the other one is how to completely tear the machine down for maintenance. So far I think it is GREAT!Update: 9/18/2014 three thousand cigarettes rolled and still working great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214L6Z8OM11IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ETNV2LK#wasThisHelpful","R214L6Z8OM11IU","A26DG05WFGH2V0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26DG05WFGH2V0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Thus the final edit of the episodes are on analogue video tape.  So unless the original camera film negatives are re-transfered to HD Video and re-edited to match the original edits (like Star Trek TNG, Seinfeld, That 70's Show), this is the best it will look.I notice that there is no continuity to the run times of each show, which indicates if a song was cut out.As far as the show itself, Fred Savage & Danica McKellar give amazing performances as Kevin & Winnie.  Every subtle nuance of their personalities is perfectly portrayed.  The stories themselves capture the 1960's era perfectly.  The original music included is essential to the mood of the show and thankfully most of it is here.This is much more affordable than the cheaply packaged complete series sold at Time-Life's website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B9REAKNVIWGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9OPFTC#wasThisHelpful","R3B9REAKNVIWGW","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]This is the same excellent HD transfer used in 2008 Blu-ray release, minus the second Bonus Disc.It is too bad that Disney decided not to include those bonuses in this release (as well as the bonuses in the 1997 deluxe 3-disc Laserdisc).If you don't care about extras, buy this it looks great.If you enjoy watching all of the behind-the-scenes material, seek out the original Blu-ray release.

"As pointed out by another reviewer, this movie doesn't follow the original book very well. And that is the problem.This new story of the master's baby being beamed up to mars just doesn't work.  The dialogue and direction is routine, worse than a TV cartoon.The original story had the hearing aid intercepting a message from Mars that the abandoned appliances on Mars were about to attack the earth.The Toaster and his friends decide to defend the earth from the mars attack.True, the element of destroying the earth happens later in the movie, but it is played out with such cliche that it loses its impact.Some creative directing could have saved this movie, but it appears to be quickly stamped out to make a quick buck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16GV5KBSZZTDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009YXAX#wasThisHelpful","R16GV5KBSZZTDI","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you already own the 90th Anniversary DVD set and are wondering if it is worth the upgrade to this edition, IT IS! Each film has upgrades varying from modest to major. See individual titles below for details.I wanted to clear up a few things some reviewers have issues with. THIS IS MORE THAN A 5 STAR SET!a) The Blu-rays are NOT widow-boxed.b) The sound effects & music are performed LIVE as they would have been in a hollywood theater in 1913, so it would not be perfectly synced.c) Since no original title cards survive today, nobody knows what they would have looked like. So plain blank cards with white letters were created.  All previous DVD releases used title-cards from various re-issues.d) The film speed feels correct. These are not knock-about Keystone comedies, they are more thoughtful Mutual comedies that rely on Chaplin's subtle expressions to convey the humor.I may sound like I am repeating myself when I talk about all of the improvements over the previous 90th Anniversary DVD, but much searching through archives has turned up superior film masters for this new HD release.We are getting very close to seeing these as Chaplin meant us to see them back in 1916 & 1917.Blu-ray disc 11) THE FLOORWALKER (29:19) The improvement I could see here is the sharper image on the new 2013 HD transfer for this Blu-ray release.  I would love to do a split-screen running the two releases side by side, but I can't do that right now.- Chaplin's first short for Mutual is pure slapstick fun in a department store. Villainous store manager tries to frame innocent Charlie for the money that he stole.2) THE FIREMAN (26:24) Right from the start NEWLY FOUND FOOTAGE can be seen in this new release. First an introductory card is restored informing us that the ""Captain Calls The Fire Drill"". We then see a shot of Eric Campbell thinking, looking at the fire bell, then getting an idea.  This is all missing from the previous DVD release, that version fades up as Eric is walking over to the fire bell.  Later another descriptive card is restored informing us that the sleeping Chaplin is the driver, we don't know this in the previous DVD.  I could go on & on, but you get the idea: more footage & cards have been restored. The image on the new Blu-ray is much sharper.- Another knock-down hilarious slapstick comedy reminiscent of the Keystone & Essanay films.3) THE VAGABOND (26:37) Big improvement here!  The older DVDs came from a sound re-issue print that cropped off the left side of the picture to add the soundtrack. This new transfer comes from a newly discovered full aperture silent print.  In addition to more picture on the left side, we have a sharper image on this new 2013 HD transfer for Blu-ray.- Chaplin's delves into more drama with this film, not to say there aren't any laughs.4) ONE AM  (27:22)  Fully restored from a pristine sharp 35mm print, includes the 7 minutes found in 2006.  This version looks like it was filmed yesterday!- This is almost a 1-man show displaying Charlie's performance perfection.  His drunken character does battle with the objects in his house in an attempt to go to bed.  This is one of my all-time Chaplin favorites.5) THE COUNT (25:11) Big improvement here!  The older DVDs came from a sound re-issue print that cropped off the left side of the picture to add the soundtrack. This new transfer comes from a newly discovered full aperture silent print.  In addition to more picture on the left side, we have a sharper image on this new 2013 HD transfer for Blu-ray. Some people may like the darker contrast of the sound print, but I find the slightly lighter silent print fully acceptable. There is also a few more frames of NEW FOOTAGE just after the title cards that got lost in the sound print (used for the old DVDs) when a fade-up was created.6) THE PAWNSHOP (26:41) In comparing the two releases, right from the start you think you are watching different films. NEWLY FOUND FOOTAGE with the pawnshop owner waving his arms & pacing around, looking at his pocket watch and then repeating his movements is all missing from the old DVD.  When we get to the first matching shot of the girl in the kitchen, each release seems to come from two different camera negatives. The old DVD cuts off the top of her head as well as heavily cutting off the right side of the picture and a little from the bottom.  This new HD transfer has plenty of head room & much more image on the right side, but there is some image missing from the left side,  Overall the new release framing is much more appealing, it must be the ""A"" Negative.  After this shot of the girl in the kitchen, the framing seems to be similar.  Just as Chaplin is about to enter a new title card instructs us that Chaplin is late, this appears later in the old DVD as a line of dialogue.  Studio records indicate this is the correct location for the card.  Again, the image is much sharper in this new HD transfer.7) BEHIND THE SCREEN (25:23) A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT over the old 90th Anniversary DVD. The first thing I notice in the very opening shot is more picture on all four sides of the picture, the old DVD is heavily cropped.  On the far left there are two ladies talking, the lady to the left is unseen on the old DVD. It is as if the image first got heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack, then the top & bottom got heavily cropped to restore the aspect ratio back to 4:33-1. To top it off the old DVD lost some image on the right side in the process.  The cropping varies from severe to minor on the old DVD, depending of what surviving source was used.  This new HD transefr is more consistant on showing the entire image.  The old DVD is also soft where this new HD transfer is sharp.- Behind the scenes at a movie studio (I love to see these early silent studio workings) Chaplin improves upon his previous Keystone offerings ""A FILM JOHNNY"", and ""THE PROPERTY MAN"". His timing is honed to perfection here to make one enjoyable comedy. Chaplin is almost burlesquing his days at the Keystone Studios.8) THE RINK (25:47) Another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Some may have issues with the newer print being lighter than the sound re-issue print.  Maybe the black levels could have been brought down a little on this new transfer, but it is not over-exposed.  If you compare the loss of details in the white objects, you will find this happens on both versions, this problem seems to have occurred early in this films history, maybe some time in the 1930's.  Until a camera original negative or an earlier nitrate print is found, this is the best we will have.  To include any footage from the previous release because of better contrast would mean giving up image on the left side.  So it is a little bit of a trade off here, a fuller frame but lighter print with more image on the left side or a heavily cropped print with better contrast.  It is a matter of the source print used.Blu-ray disc 29) EASY STREET (26:58) Yet another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Some may have issues with the newer print being lighter than the sound re-issue print. But if you look at the interior shots of the Police Station you will see that the shadows are too dark and details are lost.  The first inter-title has also been changed, based on Keystone copyright filing records.- Charlie joins the police force of Easy Street to restore law & order to this disruptive part of town.  How times have changed, gas street lamps are still in use in this short.10) THE CURE (26:26) The big improvements keep coming.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Needless to say, the image is sharper with more details in the dark areas.- A good sequel to ""ONE AM"" as Charlie enters a sobriety spa with a spring holding magical curing powers. He packs his wardrobe full of liquor to help him through the treatment.  You'll howell as Chaplin does battle with a revolving door.11) THE IMMIGRANT (24:58) Another big improvement.  The old DVD was mastered from a sound re-issue print that was heavily cropped on the left side to add a soundtrack. This new HD transfer comes from a silent full frame aspect ratio print.  Take note of the opening scene with the ship in the water. The old DVD has the ship going off screen on the left, now with this new full frame transfer the ship is perfectly centered on the screen with plenty of ocean on both sides..  The new HD transfer is over all sharper.- A more thoughtful comedy as Charlie and Edna Purviance along with others are immigrating to the U.S. from Europe.  The first half deals with their nauseating boat trip across the ocean, the second half deals with Charlie & Edna trying to afford a meal at a restaurant.**Note: Out-takes & bloopers from ""The Immigrant"" with changes in the cast can be seen in the included documentary ""The Birth Of The Tramp"".12) THE ADVENTURER (26:55) So much more detail has been restored to the picture it makes the old release look like a Madacey DVD (which Image has now merged with).  In the opening manhunt sequence, the details in the foliage and shrubbery is amazing, the old DVD was just murky shades of grey.  Now you can see every twig & branch! The old DVD also had some left-side cropped insert scenes from a sound re-issue print.- A comedy more in the style of the Essanays. While on the run from the law, Charlie manages to rescue a drowning woman. In gratitude Charlie is brought back to their mansion where he passes himself off as a rich adventurer.Bonus Material:THE BIRTH OF THE TRAMP (2013) 63 minutes - Historian & film preservationist Serge Bromberg & Eric Lang co-produced this documentation of Chaplin's early period prior to becoming his own producer. Illustrated with newsreel clips & highlight moments from his films.CHAPLN'S GOLIATH (1996) 54 minutes - A Scottish TV production celebrating who they feel is the first big Scottish movie star, Eric Campbell, known around the world as Chaplin's best villain.SADLY MISSING is the 1975 film ""The Gentleman Tramp"" that featured the Chaplin home movies and some of the last film appearances of Sir Charles Chaplin at his Switzerland home.  It is narrated by Walter Matthau with readings from Chaplin's ""My Autobiography"" by Laurence Olivier.You may find yourself keeping this separate disc from the old DVD set.David Shepard is now busy working on a new restoration of the Chaplin Essanay Comedies!Paul MularArchivist: Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CSNBDLGUHSSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JSB19YI#wasThisHelpful","R1CSNBDLGUHSSY","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two BIG things I really like about this collection.1) These are the best presentations of these comedies I have ever seen.2) This is ""Volume 1"" indicating there will be more volumes to come.One needs to understand that most Mack Sennett films survive today because of the 16mm home movie market which started in the late 1920's and became the home to many silent films when sound hit the theaters and theatrical re-issues were not likely.To avoid double-dipping, Charlie Chaplin appears only twice in this set. Charlie has his own Keystone DVD set.  Charley Chase is also hardly seen here, his Keystones are in the Becoming Charlie Chase DVD set.Image quality ratings:***** = very sharp with excellent contrast (equal to the way it looked in 35mm Nitrate projection)**** = sharp image with good contrast. Lines will be a little softer that above & gray-tones will exhibit a slightly higher contrast.*** = image has s slight softness & contrast is higher, grey[tone scales are more limited to dark & light.--No prints in this set exhibit any picture quality less than 3 stars, this is not a ""Alpha Video"" or ""Madacy"" low quality release. All images went through image stabilization.Studios mare mentioned when Mack Sennett worked for other studios.Disc #11) THE CURTAIN POLE (1909)  (10:02) Biograph w/ Mack Sennett (directed by D.W. Griffith)*** Image Quality, some fogging & scratches.**** Comedy ValuePrimitive comedy spending 10 minutes demonstrating how to knock people & objects over with a curtain pole while driving a horse drawn wagon as the angry victims give chase.  Primitive, but still fun.2) THE MANICURE LADY (1911) (11:22) Biograph w/ Mack Sennett, Vivian Prescott**** Image Quality**** Comedy ValueA more subdued comedy with Mack as a love-loran barber with eyes for the manicurist.3) A DASH THROUGH THE CLOUDS (1912) (10:16) Biograph w/ Mabel Normand, Jack Pickford**** Image Quality*** Comedy ValueThis is more of a novelty to see the early aeroplanes than a comedy.4) THE WATER NYMPH (1912) (8:20 *the menu says 18 minutes) Keystone w/ Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett, Ford Sterling.*** Image Quality, contrast a little high.** Comedy ValueOne of the earliest Keystone Comedies released.  Sennett's indoor studios have not yet been made, so most filming was done outside.  This is more of a curiosity than a comedy.There is a lot of talking without any dialogue cards5) A GROCERY CLERK'S ROMANCE (1912) (7:38) Keystone w/ Ford Sterling.*** Image Quality, better than ""Nymph"" but still washed out.* Comedy ValueThis is more of as spoof of melodramas of the time and not a comedy.  It does not play well today, the ending does not satisfy.A Grocery Clerk (so the title implies) is in love with a married woman and plots to kill her husband and marry her.See ""The Great Toe Mystery"" (below) to see how it is done right.6) ON HIS WEDDING DAY (1913) (6:16) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling, Mabel Normand, Helen Holmes.**** Image Quality, though there is some double image blur in the last few minutes. This is a problem in the source film print.**** Comedy Value.While Ford Sterling's mannerisms spoof now forgotten melodrama stars, his performance as well as the comedy itself is still a lot of fun to watch.  Some early comedy cops appear in this Keystone comedy, but not quite yet the ""Keystone Kops"".  Filmed at Echo Park where Chaplin's ""Recreation"" would be filmed later.7) BANGVILLE POLICE (1913) (6:27) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Fred Mace, Mabel Normand, Nick Cogley, Dot Farley.***** Image Quality***** Comedy ValueWhile the title may suggest this is a Keystone Kops comedy it is really more of a comedy of rural cops who do not wear the traditional Keystone Kops outfits.8) A FISHY AFFAIR (1913) (7:10) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling. Laura Oakley, Bert Hunn, Rube Miller.**** Image Quality, some heavier negative wear.***** Comedy ValueFord Sterling goes fishing at the California Alligator Park.A pratfall comedy cop is thrown in for good measure.9) THE SPEED KINGS - EARL COOPER AND TEDDY TETZLAFT(1913) (8:33) Keystone Comedy w/ Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, and real life racers Barney Oldfield, Earl Cooper, and Teddy Tetzlaff (note correct spelling).***** Image Quality, but with some nitrate deterioration.** Comedy ValueFilmed at the Santa Monica Road Race.  Typical of to Sennett use a local event to make a film.10) A THIEF CATCHER (1914) (8:00) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Rube Miller, and Charlie Chaplin as a cop.***** Image Quality***** Comedy Value-The discovery of this `Lost' film in 2010 by Paul Gierucki was a BIG deal. Not only is it an excellent comedy with a big star cast, its discovery also re-wrote the books on Charlie Chaplin by adding a 36th Chaplin Keystone film appearance! Look for Charlie in costume as a cop.While this is the same one-and-only surviving print used in the ""Chaplin at Keystone"" DVD release, a new HD transfer has been made with better black levels and no compression artifacting.11) THE GREAT TOE MYSTERY (1914) (10:51) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charles Parrott (aka Charley Chase), Alice Howell, KEYSTONE KOPS.**** Image Quality***** Comedy ValuePossibly Charley's first starring comedy.  Shoe-salesman Charley falls for a beautiful, but married, female customer.  He woos her in the park as her jealous husband comes after him.  Notice how much better this story line plays than it did in ""A Grocery Clerk's Romance"". Add a little bit of innocents, and a lot more comedy, throw in the Keystone Kops and you have a 5-star comedy!12) RECREATION (1914) (5:24) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charlie Chaplin, Peggy Page.This very short film made at Echo Park has Charlie getting in trouble with a sailor & some cops over a girl. While the `half-reel' length doesn't allow for much character development, Charlie is still fun to watch.*** Image Quality (Most of this a MAJOR improvement over the old Chaplin at Keystone DVD, now there are grey-tones & face details. BUT the 35mm footage presented in the old DVD is not present here! What a shame. I don't know why the crisp footage was not included here.)**** Comedy ValueDesolate Charlie is about to throw himself off a bridge in a park when a lady passes by and changes his mine.13) SHOT IN THE EXCITEMENT (1914) (11:49) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Alice Howell, Al St.John, Rube Miller, Josef Swickard.*** Image quality, contrast is a bit high.**** Comedy ValueTwo men cause mayhem fighting over Alice while her dad fends them off in this knock-about comedy.14) THE NOISE OF BOMBS (1914) (11:33) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charlie Murray, Edgar Kennedy, Lucille Ward, Josef Swickard, Charles Parrott (aka Charlie Chase).***** Image Quality***** Comedy ValueIt is fun to see some of these up-and-coming stars in their early beginnings. Why throw bricks when you can throw cannon balls & bombs! Top notch Keystone slapstick farce complete with cops.15) AMBROSE'S FIRST FALSEHOOD (1914) (11:14) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Mack Swain, Minta Durfee, Edgar Kennedy, Charles Parrott (Charley Chase).**** Image Quality**** Comdey ValueIn a story re-used by many (even Laurel & Hardy in The Sons Of the Desert), Mack Swain sneaks off to a night club instead fo taking a train trip. His wife reads in the newspaper that the train wrecked and all were killed, so how did her husband survive?16) A BIRD'S A BIRD (1915) (12:50) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Chester Conklin, Minta Durfee, Dutch Ward, Bill Hauber, Alice Davenport.*** Image Quality, contrast a little high & image a little dark. Window-boxing is more extreme here.**** Comedy ValueChester searches around the house for something to cook for dinner.17) GUSSLE'S DAY OF REST (1915) (21:47) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Syd Chaplin, Cecile Arnold, Slim Sommerville, Phyllis Allen, Eddie Cline.**** Image Quality, but window-boxing seems more extreme.**** Comedy ValueGussle spends a day in the park with his overbearing wife. When she falls asleep, Gussle slips off to be with a younger girl.18) DO-RE-MI-BOOM! (1915) (11:40) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Chester Conklin, Charles Arling, Harry Booker, Fred Fishback**** Image Quality**** Comedy ValueChester's music teacher is interested in the same woman as Chester. So Chester decides to try to plant a bomb in the teacher's piano to eliminate the competition.19) A LOVER'S LOST CONTROL (1915) (22:20) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Syd Chaplin, Phyllis Allen.**** Image Quality, but window-boxing seems more extreme.***** Comedy ValueSyd Chaplin shows he has some of the talents of Charlie.  He gets into more trouble while shopping with his wife in a department store.  I won't ruin any gags by mentioning them here.20) A SUBMARINE PIRATE (1915) (24:23) Triangle-Keystone w/ Syd Chaplin, Phyllis Allen, Glen Cavender, Wesley Ruggles, Louise Fazenda.**** Image Quality**** Comedy ValueSyd Chaplin is at it again, this time he overhears a plot to rob a ship by submarine.  Sennett is starting to use more story plot in his films.21) FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT (1916) (30:38) Triangle-Keystone w/ Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Al St. John, Frank Hayes, May Wells, Wayland Trask, Glen Cavender, Luke the Dog.***** Image Quality from a tinted 35mm print!One of the few tinted prints in this set.***** Comedy Value.A cinematic triumph! Roscoe puts the D.W. Griffith touch to his comedy. Serious thought went into the camera angles, lighting, shadows, in-camera effects and animation.  The acting is `realistic', the story is timeless.  One can imagine this story being shot today.  Roscoe & Mabel meet, fall in love, get a home by the sea, and a storm brews as Al St. John also has his heart set on Mabel.  If by chance you are seeing this for the first time, watch it without the commentary as there are spoilers in the commentary.22) HIS BITTER PILL (1916) (19:35) Triangle-Keystone w/ Mack Swain, Louella Maxam, Ella Haines, Edgar Kennedy.**** Image Quality**** Comedy ValueSome of the humor in this western spoof may be lost today as it has fun with the popular westerns of that time.  However, the humorous inter-titles are just as fun today.23) MADCAP AMBROSE (1916) (21:44) Triangle-Keystone w/ Mack Swain, Polly Moran, May Wells, Edgar Kennedy, Frank Hayes, May Emory, Louise Morrison.**** Video Quality***** Comedy ValueIts romance on the farm, Keystone style. Add a traveling female artist looking for male models to the mix and you have a Mack Sennett merry mix-up.24) TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE (1917) (26:36) Triangle-Keystone w/ Bobby Vernon, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, May Emory, Blanch Phillips, Charles Bennett, Teddy the Dog.*** Image Quality, the contrast is a bit high & the focus a little soft.***** Comedy Value.Bobby will only get his rich inheritance if he marries. Scoundrels plot to marry him. Then a second will turns up to add more confusion.  The confusing title to this film may be based on the popularity of car racing at that time. The Teddy in the title is the family dog, and he doesn't drive a car.  Teddy is essential to the film in this spoof of melodramas complete with dastardly men tying fair maidens to the railroad tracks.***Bonus Material***Silent out-takes & Rushes from ""The Water Nymph"" & ""Bathing Beauties"" (9:01) These out-takes have quite a bit of sex appeal!Rare silent footage of the Edendale Sennett Studios exterior (1:03)Original 1922 theatrical trailer for ""The Crossroads Of New York"" (1:22) it is fun to see a rare silent movie pre-view.A Blu-ray PDF of ""The Sennett Story"".

The laughs are milder today until the grand climax.27) HEARTS AND FLOWERS (1919 *the menu says 1912) (21:18 & *the menu says 10 minutes) Triangle-Keystone w/Ford Sterling, Louise Fazendale, Phyllis Haver, Billy Armsrong, Jack Ackroyd.**** Image Quality.*** Comedy Value.One of the rare surviving Paramount Mack Sennett silent shorts.An orchestra leader thinks he is marrying an heiress. The most amusing sequences come from the beginning at a nightclub.  The rest of the film gets a little tamer until the old `brick-in-the face' gets thrown and mayhem is the result.  Just why these old comedies thought throwing a bring in someone's face was funny is beyond me, but it does liven things up.28) DOWN ON THE FARM (1920) (United Artists feature film 51:02) w/ James Finlayson, Louise Frazenda, Bert Roach, Harry Gibbon, Billy Armstrong, Ben Turpin, Teddy the Dog & Pepper the cat.***** Image Quality.*** Comedy Value.Introduced as "" A Special Feature In Five Parts Produced By Mack Sennett"" with an areal shot flying over the Sennett Studios.29) DON'T WEAKEN (1920) (21:27) w/ Charlie Murray, Ford Sterling, Jimmy Finlayson, Harriet Hammond, Fanny Kelly.**** Image Quality.*** Comedy Value.Another rare Paramount Mack Sennett silent comedy. The picture has a little more contrast, but we are very lucky to be able to see this recently found print at all. This is a boxing comedy performed by Charlie & Ford, with Jimmy refereeing.  While their ring antics are fun to watch, I still prefer Jerome ""Curly"" Howard of The Three Stooges in the ring.30) GYMNASIUM JIM (1922) (19:19) w/ Billy Bevin, Mildred June, Kewpie Morgan (often mistaken for Oliver Hardy), Marvin Loback.***** Image Quality, with some **** inserts.****** Comedy Value.O.K., while I am using a 5-star rating system, I have to give this 6-stars because it is so wonderful.  The creative gags are just non-stop.  Billy plays a car mechanic who enters a boxing match with Kid Ryan.  This is equal to anything Chaplin or Hal Roach has done.  You will watch this one over and over!Produced at First National Pictures.31) THE EXTRA GIRL (1923) (Associated Exhibitors feature film 72:44) w/ Mabel Normand, Ralph Graves, Vernon Dent, Harry Gibbon, Billy Bevan, Max Davidson, William Desmond, Teddy the Dog & Dunk & Duma lions.***** Image Quality.***** Comedy Value.This HAS to be my all time favorite Mabel Normand picture!The presentation looks perfect, I have not had time to compare it to my various other copies.32) THE DARE-DEVIL (1923) (19:56) w/ Ben Turpin, Harry Gibbon, Kewpie Morgan,**** Image Quality, with *** inserts.**** Comedy Value.The 8th Pathe' film by Mack SennettA behind-the-scenes comedy gives a good insight on how early silent films were made.  Ben is always fun to watch and he does not fail here. Director Del Lord would reuse many of the clever gags from this films in his sound Columbia comedies with the Three Stooges.  Beware of a KKK poster gag that has a black man run in fear.33) BLACK OXFORDS (1924) (19:32) w/ Sid Smith, Vernon Dent**** Image Quality.***** Comedy Value.Vernon Dent gets to be a star in this gag-filled comedy.  An arial prison break picks up the wrong prisoner, Sid, forcing Vernon to break out on his own.  Both prisoners join up in their early comedy version of ""The Defiant Ones"".34) GALLOPING BUNGALOWS (1924) (1918) w/ Billy Bevan, Sid Smith, Andy Clyde, Jack Richardson, Sunshine Hart.*** Image Quality, window-boxing is heavier on this title.***** Comedy Value.The ultimate Sennett car chase involving a house on wheels.35) HIS MARRIAGE WOW (1925) (21:17) w/ Harry Langdon, Vernon Dent (in heavy make-up), Natalie Kingston, Ronald Tilley.**** Image Quality.***** Comedy Value.Groom Harry waits for his wedding at the wrong church and must find his way to the right church.  Harry is at his best, and you can see how he influenced Stan Laurel in developing the innocent mayhem causing character.This is a BIG video improvement over the washed out copy on the ""HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND"".  That old transfer looks like the old Xerox copies where the blacks fade to light gray. And the video grain is unbearable on that old DVD. Now this new Blu-ray has perfect blacks and no video grain.***Bonus Material***Radio shows:Texico Star Theater (30:00) 12/13/39Excerpt from The Lawrence Welk Show (3:00) 1949Meet The Stars Past & Present (6:39) 7/29/41 Dedication of Mabel Normand Sound Stage.Erskin Johnson `s Hollywood Reel (2:57) 1950 TV newsreel of Mack Sennett's 70th birthday, includes out-takes.Disc #336) SUPER-HOOPER-DYNE LIZZIES (1925) (17:47) w/ Billy Bevan & Andy Clyde.**** Image Quality.

Some sections look like 2nd generation 35mm.***** Comedy Value.I just love watching Harry Langdon's antics, and he is in top form here.  Costarring with Vernon Dent, married Harry gets talked into hanging out with some flirtatious women after work.Comparing this transfer to a previous transfer in the ""HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND"" I find a vast over-all improvement. That previous release is riddled with video noise, a graininess caused by the video transfer, and not film grain. While the old transfer has a mild improvement on detail in dark areas, the whites are over-exposed.  This new HD transfer has no video noise, the whites are not over exposed, but the shadows in a FEW scenes have a little less detail. I emphasize that this is just a few scenes and a little less detail.  The overall presentation is a vast improvement.39) A SEA DOG'S TALE (1926) (11:15) tinted sequences, w/ Billy Bevan, Andy Clyde, Vernon Dent,**** Image Quality.**** Comedy Value.40) HOBOKEN TO HOLLYWOOD (1926) (20:22) w/ Billy Bevan & Vernon Dent**** Image Quality. .**** Comedy Value.41) ICE COLD COCOS (1926) (18:34) w/ Billy Bevan & Andy Clyde**** Image Quality.**** Comedy Value.Billy must deliver a block of ice up along flight of stairs! If these stairs look familiar it is because a year later Laurel & Hardy would try to deliver a washing machine up the stairs in their lost film ""HATS OFF"". The five years later they would deliver a piano up the stairs and win an Academy Award for ""THE MUSIC BOX"". In 1945 Edgar Kennedy visited the stairs in ""IT'S YOUR MOVE"". The Three Stooges borrowed the story line for ""AN ACHE IN EVERY STAKE"" but used a different staircase.42) BROKE IN CHINA (1927) (20:21) w/ Ben Turpin, Don Maines & Andy Clyde**** Image Quality.**** Comedy Value.43) THR PRIDE OF PIKEVILLE (1927) (20:21) Ben Turpin, Andy Clyde, Vernon Dent.***** Image Quality. with some inserts from a **** Image Quality print.

That previous release is riddled with video noise, a graininess caused by the video transfer, and not film grain. While the old transfer has a mild improvement on detail in dark areas, the whites are over-exposed.  This new HD transfer has no video noise, the whites are not over exposed, but the shadows in a FEW scenes have a little less detail. I emphasize that this is just a few scenes and a little less detail.  The overall presentation is a vast improvement.This new transfer is very slightly cropped on all four sides compared to the previous release. Nothing really to worry about.45) RUN, GIRL, RUN (1928) (19:53) a Sennett Girls Comedy w/ Daphne Pollard, Carol Lombard, Andy Clyde*** Image Quality, blacks are a little murky with some details lost. It still looks good. The Technicolor sequence mentioned in the titles is long missing.**** Comedy Value.46) TAXI FOR TWO (1928) (16:47) the Taxi Cab Series  w/ Jack Cooper,Otto Fries, Andy ClydePresented in worn sole surviving 16mm print that was lovingly restored and fixed up for us to enjoy.  A disclaimer at the start of the film calls this ""Fragmentary"" but I would hardly call it that, it runs quite fine without any real jumps.**** Image Quality, with scratches.*** Comedy Value.-More of a novelty that a classic comedy. Combining Taxis & Mack Sennett brings images of car chases, but no such thing happens. Like Hal Roach's ""Taxi Boys"" series, the budgets were cut and very little happens on screen.47) THE BLUFFER (1930) (11:06) Sennett-Color & Sound w/ Andy Clyde***** Image Quality.**** Comedy Value.The thrill here is seeing Andy Clyde in natural looking color!48) THE DENTIST (1932) (21:47) A Mack Sennett Star Comedy in sound w/ W.C.

"Beautiful presentations of restored silent French (although directed by Russians) films. The picture quality is fairly clean with only a few specks & lines that let you know this is old film.  But is minor wear for their age.  I indicate the focus is sharp, but only ""Gribiche"" is HD sharp which may be why no Blu-ray is released. The accompanying music is well prepared.The discs default to English subtitles under the original French title & dialogue cards.  But these are not hard subtitles, they can be removed in the menu set-up if you are fluent in French.All of these films are new to U.S. home video, so I will talk about the films as well.Disc 1:""LE BRASIER ARDENT"" (The Burning Crucible) June 8, 1923 (filmed in 1922) 108 minutes (the booklet & jacket say 110, but that is wrong).  Color tints.  Music by Neil Brand.Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Nicolas Koline, Nathalie LissenkoThe film was restored on 35mm film back in 1997 by Cinematheque Royale de Belgique, this new 2013 digital scan is off of that negative.The film master is sharp and clear with perfect contrast. Pre-print wear is quite minor on this film.The color tints, which serve the film very well, are based on a surviving tinted & toned nitrate print.The original main titles have been lost and re-created for the 1997 restoration.- The first 30 minutes of this film are amazing!  Full of surreal nightmares, & secret societies that equal anything Max Fleischer did in his heyday of Cartoons.  There is also a bedroom full of gadgets that would make Buster Keaton happy.  Then suddenly the director loses all creativity and we drop into a slow melodrama of lost love.  Just why the director, Ivan Mosjoukine, lost steam is anyones guess, but the liner notes state that this film lost him his career as a director.  It was a resounding commercial failure.  Since Ivan was also one of the stars of this film, maybe it was too much for him.  Ivan's acting career would continue onward, and he appears in the next two films in this set.Disc 2""KEAN ou DESORDRE & GENIE"" (Kean or Wilderness and Genius) Feb 15, 1924 (filmed in 1923) 136 minutes, B&W.  Music by Robert Israel.Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Nicolas Koline, Nathalie LissenkoThis film was restored on 35mm film back in 1989 by Renee Lichtig, this new 2013 digital scan is off of that negative.The film master is sharp & clear, with perfect contrast but occasional flicker. However the masters used for the restoration negative show a bit more wear with negative splices and occasional lines.  Wear is a bit more heavier around the original reel changes (about every 10-12 minutes).  There are re-issue reel change cue marks every 20-22 minutes in the top right corner, if these were from the original issue they would have been every 10-12 minutes.No color tints, just beautiful B&W.- The first 20 minutes is a basic filming of a performance of ""Romeo and Juliette"" by the cast. This may have been interesting in 1924 when some audience members didn't have access to a Shakespearian Theater, but today we have seen this enough to speed past the silent performances.  The real story starts after this, the story of a Shakespearian actor, Keen, on the run from creditors and pursuing his true love.  Told with the right mix of humor and pathos, this is an enjoyable tale.The movie has no surreal or magical elements as the first film, the acting carries this story, but there are many optical effects to show how cinema technology was advancing.  Ind Ivan Mosjoukine shows his ability in changing acting style between playing Kean and Kean as Romeo or Hamlet.  One wonders if someThe music pieces chosen to accompany this tale are familiar classical pieces.Disc 3""FEAU MATHIS PASCAL"" (The Late Mathias Pascal) Feb 12, 1926 (filmed in 1925) 171 minutes, Color tints. Music by Timothy Broch, recorded in a live performance on June 28, 2009 by The Orchestra of the Municipal Theater of Bologna.Starring Ivan Mosjoukine, Marcelle Pradot, Lois Moran, Marthe BelotThis film was printed in 1964 off of the original negative.  Sadly that original negative is now lost.  The color tints were added based on a vintage Nitrate print deposited at the Cinematheque in 1958. Unlike the other previous films, there are still B&W sections to this film.The image is HD sharp with excellent contrast and there is a separate Blu-ray release:The Late Mathias Pascal (Feu Mathias Pascal ) [Blu-ray] .  The negative shows some wear, but is overall clean.  We are fortunate that this 1964 print was made while the negative was in existence.- This tragic comedy of epic length (almost 3 hours) is told in three parts.  The first half of the film tells the stories of how Mathias Pascal searches for ""Liberty"" in life by first getting into a bad marriage and then by taking up gambling.  The title of this movie doesn't apply until the second half of the film. After a dead body is mis-identified as that of Mathias, Mathias takes the opportunity at anonymity to leave his old life behind and takes off for Rome to start a new life.This would be Ivan Mosjoukine's last film for Films Albatros, he would try to pursue a career at the new larger Cine-France-Film where film buffs feel his creativity started to decline.Disc 4""GRIBICHE"" April 2, 1926 (filmed in 1925) 112 minutes, Color tints.  Music by Mont Alto Picture Orchestra.Starring Jean Forest, Francoise Rosay, Cecil Guyon, Rolla Normand, Armand DufourThis is a new 2009 digital scan off of two vintage 1920's nitrate 35mm TINTED prints.  The prints are in almost pristine shape, and they were printed off of the camera negatives before any damage had occurred to them.It gets no better than this.  This presentation is worthy of a Blu-ray release.  The only drawback is that the picture is slightly window-boxed.- The story is a melodrama about a poor boy who returns a lost wallet to a rich woman. In repayment, the rich woman approaches the poor boy's mother and offers to adopt the boy and give him a rich life.  The trouble is that the rich life is very regimented and not fun.These are the dramas that evoked many ""Our Gang"" (The Little Rascals) rich kid rescue comedies such as ""Washee Ironee"" and ""Free Wheelin'"".  One just wishes for Spanky and Stymie to come to this kid's rescue.BONUS SCENE:A 2:48 scene that was in the foreign export prints but was not in the French Domestic prints.  We can not be sure why this scene was in the export prints and not in the two French domestic prints, the existing dialogue card is in French!Disc 5""LES NOUVEAUX MESSIEURS"" (The New Gentlemen) April 5, 1929 (filmed in 1928 but delayed due to a censor ban requiring some excisions of political humor) 124 minutes (the booklet claims 135 minutes which might be the original uncensored version). The censored footage is lost. Music by Antonio Coppola.  B&WStarring Gaby Morlay, Henry Roussell, Albert PrejeanA new print was made in 1960 off of the original negative followed by a fine grain master which only had flash frame titles. In 1990, Renee Lichtig prepared new French intertitles based upon the flash titles and prepared a new printing negative.  In 2011 Cinematheque francaise made fresh preservation material incorporating the 1990 titles.The image is sharp enough with perfect contrast, but not as sharp as the previous two films in this set.  I wonder what happened to that original negative used in 1960.This appears to be a tele-cine transfer and I have some issues with MOTION BLUR at the 17 minute mark lasting about 4 minutes. The problem returns for the last 10 minutes of the film.  In these sections of the film every video frame contains two film frames creating a double image. The rest of the film only has every third frame containing two images and is not as noticeable when watched at normal speed.There are some brief appearances of Nitrate deterioration at 9:00, 54:40, and 106:00.  Fortunately they are brief and do not wipe out the entire frame. These are probably around reel changes.- The story starts out as a love story between a stage electrician and a dancer, but quickly becomes a political tale of labor v.s. government as the transport drivers go on strike.  The electrician and dancer get caught up in the labor dispute.This 1928 production is just calling out for sound, as noise is used to evoke some humor.  As a speech is about to be made, someone turns on a music box and drowns out the speaker.  This is convayed by showing the listeners moving their heads back & forth to the rhythm of the music and close-ups of the music box.  At this point the new music track falls short and should have switched to a music score more appropriate for the music box.  This was the only time I was disappointed in the soundtrack.Some of the humor is still intact, but i wonder what the French government made them cut out.BONUS MATERIAL:This set comes with an extensive 28 page booklet giving background on the directors and their films.One complaint: I wish the English subtitles were yellow and not white as the white over the original French dialogue cards tends to be difficult to read if the original cards have lettering from top to bottom.Commentary tracks would also have been nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KLKXO9EHCPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGF7VDC#wasThisHelpful","R17KLKXO9EHCPK","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"6 Pre-code cartoons and 7 that the Hays Office got their hands on (running only 93 minutes). Like volume 3, there is no slipcase.First up are the wonderful pre-code cartoons.Stopping the Show (1932) first cartoon in the official ""Betty Boop"" series, Features a cartoon within a cartoon starring Koko The Clown & Bimbo!Snow White (1933) featuring Cab Calloway! - wonderfully erie cartoon (previously released by A2ZCDS) *Paramount Logos have been restored on this cartoon*Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934) with music by Rubinoff and his Orchestra, (previously released by A2ZCDS)She Wronged Him Right (1934) introducing Fearless Fred in a melodrama spoof, (previously released by A2ZCDS)Red Hot Mamma (1934), Betty sings ""Hells Bells"" in this sequel of sorts to ""Snow White"", after she goes into a cave with fire & brimstone.There's Something About a Soldier (1934) with Fearless Fred, Betty sings ""There's Something About A Soldier"" with the shortest army dress ever. Her underwear shows with every step. The animation was already completed when the Hays Office took control as it looks pre-code.  It was withheld from release while the Color Classic below was rushed into theaters.And then some that had to be confined by the Hays Office:Poor Cinderella (1934, in color), A Max Fleischer Color Classic in 2-color Cinecolor. Interesting that Betty Boop is given red hair in this one. (previously released by Echobridge) *Paramount Logos have been restored on this cartoon*.  It is believed that this is the first Betty Boop cartoon in production after the Hays Office Production Code took effect.  The next cartoon was produced earlier but released after.When My Ship Comes In (1934), Betty's garter belt still shows up on her leg, but her skirt is longer. My guess is that the animation was already completed when the Hays Office took control and the animation cells were quickly modified with a longer black dress. Watch the length of her dress shorten in the every last shot as she tosses the pot of coins in the air.Zula Hula (1937), musical with Grampy - racial stereotypes abound in this African head-hunter episode. I guess this was O.K. by the moral minority.Riding the Rails (1938) Oh no, its Pudgy and he is lost in the subway tunnels! Fortunately the animators forgot to draw the third rail.The Swing School (1938) with Pudgy in one of the few musical Betty Boop cartoons that is dreadful.  Betty should have called Grampy in to brighten up this cartoon.Pudgy the Watchman (1938), - Oh, another 'Pudgy"" cartoon. Since Pudgy is not good at catching mice, Betty hires an alley cat.  It is hard to believe that these are the same people who did ""Snow White"" five years earlier.(Introducing) Sally Swing (1938).  - Betty discovers the school room cleaner has swing talent. The musical Hays Office releases are always still fun to watch. Betty's dress seems to have gotten very long!Some Hays Office cartoons are strangely missing from this final entry and are not in the public domain:""Whoops! I'm A Cowboy"" (1937)""Honest Love & True"" (1938) - this one appears to be lost, neither Paramount, UM&M, nor NTA have it in their collections.""Pudgy The Lost Kitten"" (1938) - this one was not on the Republic laserdisc but it does exist.""Buzzy Boop"" (1938) - this one was not on the Republic laserdisc, but it does exist.""Buzzy Boop At The Concert"" (1938) - this one appears to be lost, neither Paramount, UM&M, nor NTA have it in their collections.""On With The New"" (1938)Now if we all could convince Olive Films (who just loves to hear from us fans) that Betty Boop also appears in the pre-code TALKARTOONS series we will get an additional 16 cartoons for release!If we get that, then lets shoot for the SCREEN SONGS that Betty Boop appears in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CZ6JH8DZTSH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LN874VQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CZ6JH8DZTSH3","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have seen reports from others that say they got copies missing the original opening theme song and Ed McMahon stating ""From Hollywood..The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.."" and then he recites this evenings guests.  Well my copy that I just purchased at Costco HAS all if this intact.So I wonder if after all of the complaints, Carson Entertainment re-mastered the Volume 1 DVDs?Both of these are great shows, but are out of order.  The proper sequence would be to watch the second show on the disc, then the first show (the 10th Anniversary show).  The second show on the disc makes references to the upcoming 10th Anniversary show.I just love to watch these with the original National Commercials.  Note that when we watched these, th elocal station would insert their commercials in after the 60 seconds of national commercials.  Since the local commercials are not here and the stand-by bumper has been shortened, these 90 minute shows run only 76:30 BUT they ARE COMPLETE.One thing I am not sure of is the music over the end credits, it is not the music that I remember.  But this is over 40 years ago and I may not remember a different theme over the credits.  Applause from an audience can be heard over most of the end theme, but that could have been mixed in.  But I can assure you that the original theme is in the opening with Ed announcing.I am surprised to see the NBC Peacock color opening, I thought NBC had dropped this by 1972.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CL9MPDYK8QXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJW1S34#wasThisHelpful","R2CL9MPDYK8QXM","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Every second time the hour hand passes the ""12"" it catches on the disc top change the day and date.  This means before setting the clock you need to experiment by turning the arms through an entire 24 hour time period to tell if you are in AM or PM (the clock doesn't tell you).  Otherwise your day & date will be changing at NOON.Once you have synchronized the AM or PM with the time of day, with your thumbs turn the plastic geared discs in the back until the correct day & date appear.Now the BAD NEWS!

"Charley actually brings some of his silent comedy antics to these Columbia Comedies.Some fans have felt that some of Charlie's sound Hal Roach films lost some of the slapstick magic that his silent films had.But this magic reappears in his Columbia Comedies.  Columbia was the refuge for classic short subject comics in the 1930's & 1940's.I even caught a nod to Laurel & Hardy as Charlie outwitted a villain and crosses the trolly tracks. He does an Oliver Hardy smirk and we hear a suggestion of the Cuckoo song on the soundtrack.One suggestion I would make when watching these gems, don't watch the first two in a row.  Their subject matter is too similar to enjoy back-to-back.  These are presented chronologically and that is why they appear together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335LA6Z8G2LSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNRA7VW#wasThisHelpful","R335LA6Z8G2LSM","A42GFMF12V7XR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A42GFMF12V7XR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really nice transfers form original vintage films.  The only drawback is that it is DVD-R and not a manufactured DVD.The content is VERY RARE and, out side of the Charlie Chaplin Cartoon, the casual comedy fan will not know who these people are.As I work for the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum, I was in my glory watching these.  I wish some other silent comics got the same great careful treatment that these comedies were given in creating this DVD.There was some IMAGE STABILIZATION used to create a steady image which greatly helps the enjoyment of these rarities.But thankfully DNR was avoided. The films used are rather clean of major scratches and splices.Apologies are made by Undercrank for the Chaplin cartoon, the image is good but some of the words in the balloons are hard to read.  This is apparently in the master film used.Careful notations are made about any recreated titles to keep the presentation honest & authentic.Ben Model created the music & expertly performed it for this release.  His love for these films comes off in his music compositions,I am looking forward to a possible volume 3.

"The newly minted RESTORED version is wonderful!  To my naked eye the difference is obvious.  I did just view the 9 minute new featurette on the restoration that I give a mixed review to.  The executives spend half the time patting themselves and their studio on the back for undertaking the job. Between those frivolous moments there is knowledge to be gleaned about the original film  being shot sideways so the 35 mm film element is more like 70 and the process of other fixes as well as an all too brief moment of the soundtrack , which is spectacular, and North's score has always been a favorite of mine.  The 9 minutes with Kirk Douglas is actually better than I expected given his health challenges , and I give him loads of credit for putting himself in front of a camera.  Mr Douglas , as they usually do in these, takes a lot of credit for hiring Kubrick as well as for another debate on the film with Kubrick (I don't wish to spoil the story).  He also in a simplified way tries to say that hiring Dalton Trumbo and giving him credit was the singular reason for the blacklist ending.  There are non removable subtitles during this featurette that aren't too distracting as Mr Douglas works hard to be precise in his diction.  It seems all the past bonus features have been kept , making this a very very easy one for me to recommend a double dip as it is called or an upgrade from your older version on blu ray.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28L8P8D70DPEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011KME7FU#wasThisHelpful","R28L8P8D70DPEI","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW.... I just picked up a copy at a local store not afraid to break ""street dates"" and here's the 411 on the CRITERION Edition BR.FIRST .. to confirm what the other reviewer noted there was a recall you need to see on the back of the case in very hard to read red type against a black background .. Second Printing 2015 .... to know you have a corrected edition.NOW... back to the Blu Ray... does it look better than the original yes, but for me the bonus features on this have reached a new level!  ALL the bonus features (around an hour total) from the previous Blu Ray and special edition DVD have been thankfully put on this release , and that is no longer a given so appreciation to Criterion is deserved.  Now on to the new supplements ...  a 20 minute interview with De Palma is terrific, the new interview with the body double Penthouse Pet of the Year Victoria Lynn Johnson, is a treat as well. Producer George Litto makes for a good interview but easily bested by the new interview with Nancy Allen. The three that really caught me by surprise and I enjoyed were with legendary composer (subtitled) Pino Donaggio, and the producer of the famous one sheet Stephen Sayadian, as well as the tribute to the cinematographer Ralf Bode by Michael Apted and others.  I'm not about to go into details of these wonderful interviews and tributes , why spoil the fun?  Suffice it to say if you have the current edition of this film on Blu Ray and are wondering if a ""double dip"" is worth it.... well, It isn't even close for me, the wealth of bonus material should come with college credit they are so definitive.  The movie itself?  I saw it in theaters in my early 20's when it initially was released and it seemed the perfect combination of thrills, suspense, comedy, sex, .... goodness , my friends and I quote some of Dennis Franz's lines to this day.... he blossomed in this part and began to develop his snarky gum chewing cop.

"This is a review of the recent Blu ray edition , not the movie itself.  Kino and Olive take advantage of us classic film fans and sometimes the results are like this one.... a very sub standard blu ray , sold at a very premium price to those like me who can not resist a Robert Mitchum film.  This blu ray is just horrible in quality. Scratches and other glitches in the picture (resembling laser rot) abound.  The color is weak and shifts ... and the sharpness is suspect as well.... truly this isn't anything better than a marginal DVD release would offer.  I'm glad I own it as I do collect Robert Mitchum films , even bad ones like this, but I'm also glad to have found a seller anxious to get rid of their copy. I suggest fans wait for the inevitable price drop or be prepared to be doubly disappointed if you pay much for this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Z8A0BLUVE6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQTC8ME#wasThisHelpful","R12Z8A0BLUVE6L","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've seen a demonstration copy of this release and if you are a fan this IS the one you've been waiting for.  When I was given this to view I had no idea that Mr Lynne had put together such a massive show , by that I mean, this doesn't look like a ""one off"" but a well thought out show that should be and what I understand now WILL go on the road.  For the most part the set list is very satisfying.  Of course there are songs I wish they'd done and every fan will feel the same way, but that is a minor gripe.I'm assuming my copy is the final one, but they sometime make minor changesAll Over the WorldEvil WomanMa Ma Ma BelleShowdownLivin' ThingStrange Magic10538 OvertureCan't Get It Out Of My HeadSweet Talkin' WomanSteppin' OutHandle With CareDon't Bring Me DownRock N Roll is KingTelephone LineMr Blue SkyRoll Over Beeethovenand Mr Lynne is shown between many songs in interview mode discussing the song and his career.The film is great, not the short headache inducing cuts of many of these recent concert DVDs and Blu Rays. The crowd is massive and very into the show. The bands' performance is terrific and they are augmented by an orchestra which takes it to another level.  There is a large screen behind the band with cool graphics... this is just a top notch show in all regards. It was filmed Sept 14th of 2014 so the release is just about a year later and I understand a new album is finishing which will be the tip off to an American tour!My copy also contained the documentary Mr Blue Sky, which I feel alone is worth the price of this disc... I didn't include that in my review originally out of fear it may not show up but it is confirmed that it will indeed be a bonus feature! Also, Mr Lynne himself mastered this project and the sound is wonderful!UPDATE:  Just viewed the finished product and they made an important change... instead if inserting the interview segments between songs they've separated it into it's own section.. I think this is a brilliant decision and so now we have a tight 70 minute concert, a smart interview section and then the 80 minute documentary... all told a solid value for money and very very well done!  ONE BAD NOTE... as I worried, they lost Roll Over Beethoven which closed my demo copy... I'm sure that the publishers of Mr Berry's music just wanted more for the synch rights than they were willing to pay ... shame that.  On other ELO videos in the US they often drop that tune but in the UK it is on the video (different synch rights for different countries) it is possible the UK or EU version will have it as it WAS the finale and a real winner.. the only false note on the finished BR in the US is it's sad deletion... I'm glad to have my demo with it in!9/24/15 UK version arrived, plays fine in my player and the true finale Roll Over Beethoven is included as are the other songs and bonus features... go to the amazon site in the UK and get this superior version... (love the piano break in ROL where he plays a bit of Rock Aria!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13E15F7WJCFR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012GKHYCS#wasThisHelpful","R13E15F7WJCFR3","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very interested in this exceptional writer on film.  Perhaps other than Peter Bogdanovich , McBride is my favorite, and like Peter he knew and interviewed many legends before their passing.  This is an interesting 50 minutes IF you are interested already in Mr McBride so I'll say it will be limited for most potential viewers.  I'd like to give it 5 stars but the production values are substandard.  The display is very grainy/low resolution, which simply should not be the case for something filmed so recently.... but other than those marginally amateurish production values , for me , the content was very worthwhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHNGI5D8RUZYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P8AOUG#wasThisHelpful","RHNGI5D8RUZYE","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just watched this (excuse me) amazing documentary and loved nearly ever minute of it.  Being middle aged, I remember The Amazing Randi from the Tonight Show and others and also his feud with Uri Geller, but this put a new coat of paint on that as well as his own lengthy career.  The side story of his personal life touched my fiancee , but I could have lived without as much.  That said, the hour and a half went by very fast and we also eagerly gobbled up the extensive bonus interview footage and some very wonderful deleted scenes that are exclusive to the Blu Ray.  Interestingly enough Penn & Teller are hardly in the documentary but have about 30 minutes of unused interview footage in the bonus section. Alice Cooper features in both.  I can't really go into the details without SPOILER alerts on the overall story of this film, but if you are interested in Magicians, and or alleged psychics etc... this should fascinate you.  If you are a big time believer in mumbo jumbo , faith healers, mystics , etc.... avoid this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXH6IXQFB2WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GLAMNM#wasThisHelpful","RXXH6IXQFB2WR","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find it often difficult to review products I'm supplied for free through the Vine program.... as I'm sort of indebted to the company for giving me the item!  In the case of this lamp... reading light, magnifier ... it was easier than other items as it truly is worth the retail price.  Assembly is very easy, and the base has enough weight to assure firm placement regardless of the extension of the arm/light.  The whole thing has a feel to it of something that will stand the test of time.  The light itself isn't overly bright but effective, and easier on the eyes because of same.  The magnifier option actually for someone of my advancing age, has already been helpful so it elevates this over the other similar lights in my house.

"Unlike the other ""reviewers"" my $60 Samsung Blu Ray player from Costco had no issues with this ALL REGION blu Ray. It is what it advertises itself to be the full 3 plus hour BBC telecast of the match from the nearly 15 minute warmup to the conclusion. It is the widescreen HD broadcast and nothing to fault (excuse the pun) that.  My only wish is that the US broadcast would have been more exciting with John McEnroe and gang calling the match... these Brits can be .... boring in comparison in the booth.

"I'd like to give this 5 stars.... but it's not as great as I'd hoped.  Alice is fine, the band is cookin' and it's a pretty great set list... I saw this show ..well a show on this tour. It's called ""Raise The Dead"" as a tribute to his old drinking buddies ""the Hollywood Vampires"" John Lennon,Keith Moon, JImi Hendrix, and other famous stars and he plays their music in the third act ... you can hear all of it on the 2 CD set that is included but the songs Revolution and Foxy Lady are not in the film. The reason is that Hendrix family  make it very very expensive to get synch rights for his songs (I know this from experience) and I'm going to assume the same was true with Revolution because it isn't in the film portion.  Speaking of the film , while it is HD .... the show started off in daylight and moves to dark and sadly the set looks crappy in daylight and throughout the show the camera angles chosen by the director are usually on the musicians / guitarists NOT playing the killer licks we are hearing.... and they are in LOVE with the shot from behind the musicians into the audience and go to it over and over and over.....Am I glad I have this on BR and the two GREAT sounding CDs that come with it... YES... OH and a 20 minute interview with Alice as a bonus is terrific.... do I wish it was complete , Yes. Do I wish the cameras were on the players who are playing the notes we are hearing and Alice more than his audience.... yes.

"I just picked this up at Costco for $89.  I figured I wasn't taking a huge gamble because they have a liberal return policy.  I think that Duel in 1:85 looks wonderful!  I actually think it moves better with the wider angle and am not the kind of purist who wants to see every bit of every frame ever shot (see Stanley Kubrick for more on that).  Duel was the main driving force for me and my purchase (excuse the pun) and thinking it may not come out in the distant future as a stand alone BR.  1941 was my next interest/test and I thought it looked much better than the DVD... I should add here that it seems all previous bonus features have been used on these films and nothing extra or new has been added, but at least if you have some of them you can get rid of the dupes.  I own Jaws (how could I not?) but I hadn't picked up the two Jurrasic Park flix or ET so I wasn't double dipping very much so that makes it a better purchase for me than many others.  Always was a film I thought was sweet and I'm glad to have it, and it looks terrific in HD , but Duel was my big ""want"". The Sugarland Express looks nice in BR (although it does show grain so don't expect it to look like a more recent film) and I always appreciate Ben Johnson when I can find him in my library.  I can't possibly give this set any less than 5 stars... I ended up paying about $10 a movie for a terrific set of films housed in a compact and attractive box with a bonus booklet. This is a lot like the treatment Alfred Hitchcock received.... but that had several more films.  At $89 a five star rating.... at $200 .... given all the duplicate movies.... for many folks, I'd be hard pressed to give it better than a 3.  If Duel and the other few films eventually come out on BR I won't feel burned... unless they find extras or do something to them they didn't this time (that HAS happened)... but reviewing what we have and at the price it can be owned...... it would make a staggeringly great gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERFOYC317M2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFHYX2I#wasThisHelpful","R3ERFOYC317M2Q","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a mostly excellent program covering the only American to ever win the Tour De France and his battle with previous winner/legend Bernard Hinault. I remember watching in 85 when LeMond nearly in tears was asked to ""stand down"" and not try to win to support Hinault winning his 5th Championship. I was confused as to why an athlete that seemingly could win would be asked to sacrifice himself for another athlete.  The next year I watched with high expectations that LeMond would prove too strong to be defeated.  Well, little did I know at the time all the scheming that was going on to get Mr Hinault number 6 and keep LeMond down.  This program is a great reminder of a great athlete and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The bonus interview footage is also nice to have.  In it LeMond talks about Lance Armstrong a bit more than they needed in the program and also goes through some of his old jerseys.  Hinault also admits to messing with Greg in '86 with his comments (he's a jerk) and there is more.  I would add that although Amazon.com doesn't mention it ... my copy is a DVDR.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGSYBLSZS5IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MI4WQNU#wasThisHelpful","R1LGSYBLSZS5IT","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just picked this up and watched a big chunk of it. While others are cutting and pasting from WWE websites to give you the contents I wanted to give you the perspective of an owner/viewer.  The listings of the others are correct and there is a ton of stuff here.... the GOOD NEWS... is that WWE tries to make this something of an autobiographical production.  Without new STING interviews , what they do as links is present new interviews with folks like Hulk Hogan  who goes back to 84 knowing him as a weight lifter in CA.  They also are repurposing the autobiographical interviews STING did for WCW on some home view VHS tapes in the mid 90's so STING is also speaking on camera about his career... without his participation this is the best one could hope for so it's more than just 8 hours of matches strung together. They also (on the BR) have loads of promos.... so it's really the definitive STING item for the time being.  There is a cool best of Sting DVD from the promotion he's been with since WCW and another sort of bio movie as well that would make your STING collection inclusive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for old school wrestling buffs.

"I'm reviewing the new Criterion Blu - Ray DVD combo release which arrives on Tuesday but I was lucky enough to pick up a couple days early.  The transfer is a splendid 4k .... the best it has ever looked.I'm so sad that Mr Scheider isn't around to have participated in any of the newly created bonus features but he does live on a scene specific commentary track from some time back.  That said, one of the main things that separates Criterion from everybody else is their relentless pursuit of making not only the definitive audio and visual release but scouring the globe for bonus content!  I am not an expert on Fosse or dance, but after viewing the bonus features feel truly knowledgeable.  There are new supplements with the author of the definitive book on Fosse, Sam Wasson, there is a recent interview with the editor of the film, a couple of the stars and a semi recent half hour doc on Mr Fosse.  If that isn't enough there is a half hour with Gene Shalit, a half hour from the UK and another half hour interview of Mr Fosse with Tom Snyder!!  They seemingly have left no stone unturned in their drive to make this package something that can take pride of place in ones collection of great movies.To summarize, the movie looks the best it has and if you are considering owning (in a world of streaming or downloads) and are a fan, then the wealth of bonus content about and featuring Mr Fosse make this a prime candidate for physical purchase.  This is not a disposable movie but a work of art and Criterion has presented it well and surrounded it with terrific bonus content... oh and a lovely booklet with essay.HIGHLY recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29SMSFABBX25H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B6NI#wasThisHelpful","R29SMSFABBX25H","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up at Best Buy today and here are my thoughts.....Very good show, intimate, don't expect the same scope and quality as the Greek Theatre Moodies BR. It actually was more appealing the second run through as I began to appreciate the different colors the small group brought to the songs as opposed to missing John Lodge and the gang.  In actuality just imitating the Moody Blues with a band would be boring and why film it?  This is a lovely ""in addition to""  and not an ""instead of"" purchase. This isn't a true ""unplugged"" affair, but it is primarily an acoustic night and that also is a plus for me.  The only slightly bum note is the 1 hour documentary which is really an extended behind the scenes of this one gig.... and for the most part a one time watch only.  If you view it as ""extra"" or simply a  bonus instead of looking forward to it as the highly touted tour documentary... you may be less disappointed.  As a long time fan I must say I'm thrilled to add this to my collection of MB and Justin Hayward films and I can't imagine anybody not enjoying this first rate show , which makes for a lovely (there's that word again) play in the living room on the big screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFT0M986FUN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6EQCY#wasThisHelpful","R2YFT0M986FUN6","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a  problem for me,  Amazon.com sent me a copy early, so I could review it.  I can say I finished it within 2 days of it's arrival, but I can't remember ever being able to put a Lee Child / Jack Reacher book down once I have begun.  Reacher Creatures, fans of this series, will not see the problem in receiving the soon to be released book for free, but here goes.  The problem is I'm obligated to review it.  We are talking a mystery book, and as Mr Child has described his process.... ""ask a question and then answer it 400 pages later"" ... with smaller questions answered in pages or chapters.  So, other than talking about the cover design, I really hesitate to discuss ANY of the story or plot points for fear of ruining it for true fans.  I speak from experience in that I'd clobber anybody summing up a mystery I was intent on reading in a few paragraphs or blurting out to me in conversation the story.  So .... at the risk of being labeled ""unhelpful"" for not spitting out a couple paragraphs of ""Spoilers"" I'll write this review for someone who maybe hasn't read any of the books, and is curious for whatever reason... maybe catching the poorly cast but nonetheless enjoyable  ""Jack Reacher"" movie on the tube.For fans, I'll say it's not my favorite of all  of them, but it isn't my least favorite either (that might be ""Nothing To Lose"", but it followed ""Bad Luck and Trouble"" which was set near where I live and of particular enjoyment for that as well as the partial reunion of his old team).  I think I can mention that this is one of the rare ""first person"" Reacher books , without spoiling anybody's fun.  I will add that Mr Child touts that John D MacDonald wrote 21 Travis McGee thrillers without a bum note and I feel the same about this series and this didn't let me down at all.For the person stumbling across this review and curious without knowledge.... our hero is a 6'5"" 250 lb. (see more Dolf Lundgren than Tom Cruise) former MP. Sure , there is always some action in the books, but it is never gratuitous and Reacher is a righteous man who sticks up for those not able themselves.  Reacher's  physical strength however, is not what propels these books through hundreds of pages, it's his mind, his analytical process ....and Mr Child's ability to dangle us along with big and small questions we can't wait to get the answer to.  I think every one of his books would make for terrific mini series or HBO type series as they feature many twist endings on chapters or cliff hangers.... and false leads etc.  Mr Child is a brilliant author in his knowledge of his subject as well.  I know as he's more than once written about a technical subject that I have personal knowledge of and isn't common place and he's done so with accuracy and intelligence.... the man does his research!  His protagonist is the seemingly perfect specimen of the phrase ""brains and brawn"".  If you are a female and curious I would add that this series has attracted a strong female following, not that common for what could be perceived as a macho male hero series.  Reacher has many affairs, but they are all mutually beneficial and he respects women , and often finds himself often working WITH rather than FOR them , the sex is never gratuitous and thankfully occurs with little description after begun.  Don't get me wrong.... this guy is a white knight... and does come to the aid of more than one female in distress in this series.Highly Recommended .... oh and I'd like to add, another reviewer in a sort of casually superior way (as critics who have never created anything themselves do) referred to this series as ""formulaic"" ... to that I'd say, I hope Mr Child never loses that formula!!* bonus note for true Reacher Creatures.  I just read an old issue Number 85 of Mystery Scene Magazine from 2004. When asked who could play Reacher , if a movie ever happened, Child replied, ""Oh, anyone with a SAG card , really- except maybe Tom Cruise.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQVEUQXLXE5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178747#wasThisHelpful","R3FQVEUQXLXE5N","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a legendary Oscar winning film, and there are many reviews of the film so I'll review the BR as I just watched it. Like Olive Films , KINO has begun releasing classic films on BR.  The first one I received was ""The Scalphunters"" and it was like Olive films... over priced, not a great print, without any restoration or even moderate cleanup.  Separate Tables, an award winning film from Burt Lancaster's own production company is a different story however, perhaps it is that black and white film is more stable than color, but the transfer on this BR is sharp , contrasty, with brilliant mid tones... in a word fantastic!  Unlike the other film this does feature a commentary and trailer so .... bonus features are a plus.  The price tag keeps me from going to a 5 on my review however because for nearly a 30 dollar list price we are in Criterion films territory and they are in a whole different league from restoration to bonus features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19J0QYUOZ588X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6D1SAC#wasThisHelpful","R19J0QYUOZ588X","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Larry is a great host and unlike normal travelogues this show features a very odd look at our wonderful country.  I didn't pay close attention though when ordering and was surprised to see that the 3 DVDs are not finished but DVD Rs from Amazon.com.  They look great but need to be handled with extra care or they will more easily scratch than finished DVDs.

"I stumbled across this mysterious DVD while looking for more Shark films... it is unlike all the others and for that reason alone deserves attention in my humble opinion.  This is the story of world record holding fly fisherman Conway Bowman, and his obsession. Mr Bowman lives on the beach in Southern California, as he points out , 700 miles from the nearest fly fishing destination!  He read in a book about fly fishing that  the most challenging of all ... is to catch Mako Shark with a fly .... and that is where his obsession and this 50 minute program begins.....The footage is great, (wish it was on BR as it looks like it was filmed HD)... and the 50 minutes went by far too fast for me. I'd have liked a longer program and perhaps some additional bonus features for the hefty price, but It seems this was an independent production and I understand how that relates to huge outdoor networks and those like Discovery that have massive budgets and by the time a product is released for physical sales has likely been aired innumberable  times and profitable... so I do not deduct stars for the hefty price of this and limited time. The unique and honest content overcomes those in my opinion. I should also add that there is a STRONG educational content to this program, it isn't all underwater shots of sharks being ""hooked"" as it were. A serious discussion of catch and release , as Mr Bowman practices, as well as Catch and Kill is presented.Interesting, unique, fast paced, well presented and always involving.... recommended to fans of fishing programs , and Shark content..","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUICAU3PLMYU0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H308M5A#wasThisHelpful","RUICAU3PLMYU0","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just returned from Best Buy and watched this start to finish......First off, the reason for the 5 star reviewexcellent video and audio quality (all the more recent Montreux films are tip top) and at 16 bucks retail ... heck I can't even buy parking at a concert around here for that price so to have this any time in HD .... excellent value for money.While the video run time IS 93 minutes... only 80 minutes is concert.  Eagle Vision does this a lot , they include any and all bonus features in their run time.  There are two light weight interview segments that take up the rest of the listed ""run time"".  Normally I look for more than 80 minutes, but I think it might have been their full time slot (it is a pretty excellent 17 song selection including a couple from their latest).  On top of that Billy Gibbons doesn't gobble up a lot of time , if any, between songs.... bantering with the audience and that adds a lot of time to other concerts.Is this a perfect concert BR?  No.... many solos are missed by the camera men/director , but does it have a lot of great songs? Yes. Does it feature a pretty excellent performance? Yes.  Is the group engaging the audience?  Yes.  There is a bit of an  annoying plug (excuse the pun) for Basic Amplifiers ... that keeps illuminating the stage set.... but did I mention the very tasty guitar tones?  I could listen to Billy vamp on a simple A Chord with that fuzzy distorted sound for hours on end...Bottom line from an owner.

"For Beatles and Paul McCartney fans, this latest read will fill in many blanks regarding McCartney, his family, and his band, Wings.  To say that the 1970s were ""dramatic"" for Paul and Company would be an understatement.""Man on the Run - Paul McCartney in the 1970s"" could laughingly be retitled as ""Bong on the Run.""  Much of this book pertains to Sir Paul and his often cavalier love affair with the Almighty Weed.  He and Linda pretty much made it their very own fifth food group. ""Don't leave home without it"" was the credo for their habit and they found very creative ways to take it as a required carry-on during all of their touring and travels.For those fans who have only been privy to news reports of the McCartneys' drug busts in the '70s, this book shed light on the details. It also gives the reader (more interestingly, for the non-stoners) a look into the last days and demise of the Beatles, and the ongoing legal battles with the anti-Christ Alan Klein, who ""handled"" the Fab Four, causing as much mayhem and bad blood between them as Yoko and Linda put together.  The author also goes into great and interesting detail about McCartney's escape to farm and family life in Scotland during this time (when they were still eating meat). These ""human"" aspects of this book really show how wounded and depressed Paul was over the break up of his beloved band and musical soulmates. But he had Linda - and she most definitely grounded him and helped him heal and move forward to the next chapter of his amazing career.It is interesting to read about, in more detail than most books about Sir Paul, the members of WIngs and how they, for the most part, were honored to be working with McCartney and his ""musically naive"" wife, despite Team McCartney's frugalness and ability to believe that ""the rules don't apply"" to them when in came to not breaking the law and being more prudent in following the rules any NON-Beatle would have adhered to.This is yet another glance into the world of ""rarified air""  celebrities feel entitled to breathe.  McCartney KNEW that taking grass into Japan in 1980 was a guaranteed crime with severe punishment, but believed that he was above the law and that since HE believed smoking grass wasn't ""any big deal"" his arrogance trumped the Japanese laws.  Ah, celebrities ...Interesting insights about McCartney and Lennon's legendary falling out. We find out that they actually WERE in touch throughout the years - and for the most part, on good terms. The chapter telling the story of what really took place  when Lennon was murdered and McCartney's reaction to the news  is heartbreaking and proves, once again, that when you're at your lowest ebb, don't speak to the press. McCartney's legendary comment (""Yeah, it's a drag') came after an entire day of sobbing over his slain friend and he was simply running on fumes at that point.This is a great read for any Beatles fan and the author's one on one interviews with Sir Paul throughout the years makes it more credible on every level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDS9DHYHX9P7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417914X#wasThisHelpful","R2PDS9DHYHX9P7","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Picked this up early at my local record store (thank goodness I have one of those) and WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW... what a gift! I'm ordering one on amazon.com for my gal.  between the two discs we have over 4 hours of content.  Some of this I have owned on bad bootleg compilations so seeing it in first rate state is a revelation.  After decades of languishing in vaults this is such a treat for any of us baby boomers who remember the DC5.  I don't want to get into political debates like some reviewing this as to Dave Clark's business practices... I'M REVIEWING this product.... and for me the only thing better would be if 4 hours of The Kinks was to be unearthed and put out on BR.... these guys were so essential to the British Invasion , yet as Bruce Springsteen so accurately notes... they were much bigger sounding that the Beatles and the Stones.  Mike Smith's vocals are unique and instantly identifiable yet, when I play DC5 for friends they have NO idea he's British.... you've heard many of their songs on commercials and the radio and likely not even known who you were listening to if you are not a fan.This is a TREASURE ..... if you are a fan you shall not be disappointed.  This was done right with loads of bonus content.... and deserving of a higher price.EXTRA NOTE:  I don't like offering up spoilers in my reviews , but in the nearly 2 hours of bonus footage there is a wonderful ""Out Take"" interview with Mike Smith , that is frankly worth the purchase for me alone!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJFN8UYTXZAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVLRC88#wasThisHelpful","ROJFN8UYTXZAJ","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't ""Nebraska"" or to be confused with the films of David Lean..... it's what my fiancee calls ""a boy movie"" .. in music it would be Dumb Hard Rock, but heck AC/DC is fun isn't it?  Unlike the dozens of direct to video films that have come after , this is a full on  widescreen Joel Silver high production value action flick.  You can't be too literal when viewing , Seagal's  fall from grace is set up by saving the Vice Presidents life for goodness sake if that gives you any indication of the backflips done in the screenplay alone!  Seagal was thin, no pony tail and full of classic one liners.  This movie also features a really top notch supporting cast and I actually always get a kick out of Tom Arnold as the comic foil. If you liked his first half dozen big time films from Above the Law through Marked for Death , you will enjoy this one and the BR edition looks great , ports over the few bonus features from the DVD and I picked it up on Amazon.com for under 10 bucks...

"A wise and famous guitarist once said that men treat guitar strings like razor blades.... they use the same brand forever, until someone gives them a free alternative to try.  I'm guilty of that and gave these a try instead of my trusty GHS Boomers, and have been pleasantly surprised and happy with the results. It is always hard to compare fresh strings to older ones and it is a bit unfair to rate them before they've had a chance to age .... so after I've played these for a bit I may amend my review up or down depending on how well they last.  I like 10's on my electrics and some feel thinner and some thicker ....these feel about right, bend well, have stayed in tune well and seem to sustain as well as any I've used.

"Picked this up a bit early, and am delighted to say it looks terrific and is a huge upgrade from the Full Screen DVD and Widescreen Director approved Laser Disc I've held on to forever.  It was a misunderstood and brilliant film by Friedkin , following the Exorcist and has been quite a cult object.  WHY only a 4 star rating?  Because WB hasn't included anything in the way of bonus features for an admitted cult classic that has been terribly misunderstood, reviled, and with time revealed to be a missed masterpiece.  Friedkin appears on seemingly any documentary about any film the studios ask him to participate in and has contributed large features to NARC and The Manchurian Candidate as well as commentary for Vertigo.... so where is he on this BR?  Oh, the new DVD is just a repeat of the full screen Universal edition (WOW WB are cheap and nasty aren't they?).  Back to this edition... we get a very high priced BR (nearly a 30 buck list) with NO commentary, NO Making of and just an excerpt from Friedkins brilliant autobiography as a bonus feature and I guess in exchange for that WB gave the publisher the back cover of the BR as a free AD because when you remove the paper what you have on the back of your BR case is just that a full page ad for the book!  Friedkin was just in town this week for the showing of this film at a local theater and Is making dates for signings of the BR at local venues.... he loves this film... and I can't figure out why WB missed this opportunity to ad value to the movie in their presentation , but they sure didn't mind adding price.  I'm sure they correctly figured all us fans would be suckers and not wait for them to discount these to Costco in a year like they have their other overpriced BR sets. 5 Stars for the film , and the transfer , but I have to deduct a star for the price point and lack of extras on a movie that screams for them!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FC3BSI6JFHF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HT2RTU6#wasThisHelpful","R3FC3BSI6JFHF2","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

NOT the movie, which I love.WARNER BROTHERS rescued this masterpiece for us... and has just released it on both BLU RAY and DVD.  The Blu Ray is a revelation... of sight and sound.... I just watched it!!  WHY then did WB reissue the DVD full screen and basically just duplicate the crappy Universal edition that has been out forever?  I picked them both up, because I have a friend I've been telling about this magnificent movie  for decades and sadly he's an older fellow with no desire for a BR player... and I can't believe they just duped over the old Universal DVD without even changing the menus..... just lazy and greedy.... they obviously have the master as the BR is widescreen and stunning!  The reason I can't rate the BR higher than 4 stars is that it is a 5 star movie for me, but at nearly a $30 list price and NO extras? No making of, no Friedkin commentary?  Friedkin doesn't seem to be a hard guy to get to comment on .... ANYTHING... goodness he even has done commentaries on other peoples film like Vertigo and made special feature interviews for others movies like NARC, and Franhenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate... but WB couldn't get him to do anything for perhaps his most misunderstood classic and a film he loves?This seems to be WB taking advantage of film buffs by issuing a cult classic, overcharging for it and screwing the DVD only buyers..

I picked this up at Best Buy for ten bucks and thought I just made a great deal as I enjoy the movie and remember a pretty good version on DVD sometime back.

"I picked this up a couple days early at a local record store and have been glued to my set enjoying the film and the extras!Unlike others , I enjoy the BR / DVD sets.... I have a DVD player in my computer and in my office so the ability to watch the recent Criterion releases in both Standard and hi definition with a single purchase I find helpful ...and a space saver for my collection, but I digress.Normally I cringe when I hear Harold Lloyd described as ""the third genius"" with Chaplin and Keaton.  In my humble opinion at his very best he approaches what the other two did as a matter of routine and I even wondered if I should buy this.  I think what put me over the top was that I rate ""The Freshman"" as one of his best and I know his films are in good state so it should look much more like a vintage Chaplin and much better than (sadly) most of the Keaton classic films of the 20's and the print does not disappoint.I do believe that this was Lloyd's most popular film and while not of the ""thrill"" variety that he popularized shows his character at his most earnest and likeable. This also predates Buster Keaton's ""College"" by a couple of years.But this is very expensive for a film of just over an hour in length (76 minutes) so how can I rate it that high? As I said, it is a good film , one of his best and a classic of the silent era.  The bonus features are another thing all together and why I rate this a 5 star value. The first one I checked out was a delicious 7 minutes from Mr Lloyd's appearance on ""What's My Line?""  where he displays such charm and humor.  The nearly 40 minute interview with archivists and friends of Mr Lloyd , Kevin Brownlow and Richard Correll had me thoroughly entertained as well.  Author John Bengston , as he has done for others like Keaton, presents a visual essay on the various locations used for filming.  I should add that as a lifelong resident in Southern California that feature may appeal to me more than those in other parts of the world.  There is a half hour segment from the film ""Harold Lloyd's Funny Side of Life""  which contains an introduction from Mr Lloyd to The Freshman and a chunk of that  feature film featuring many greatest hits clips from his career!  The bonus features continue with 3 very classic Lloyd short films ""The Marathon"" from 1919 , ""High and Dizzy"" and "" An Eastern Westerner"" both from 1920 with newly created scores.  There is a great audio commentary for the main feature with the previously noted Correll, Leonard Maltin and Richard Bann. I almost forgot another half hour of film where Mr Lloyd was being honored by USC fraternity in 1963 ...featuring Steve Allen and Jack Lemmon paying tribute to him and his own appearance.So... what we have is a legitimate silent classic, lovingly presented and surrounded with a plethora of bonus features that enhance the experience for me to a great extent and I can say have made this a very treasured part of my film collection.

"I just watched the Blu Ray version ....I guess I could go on about this movie but it's been reviewed over and over in the DVD and VHS categories so I'll just say , I like virtually all the Wyatt Earp flicks , from the classic My Darling Clementine starry Henry Fonda to the ones starring Jim Garner, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.  They all seem to be cinematic products of their time and the folks making them and all offer differ pleasures from the elegant black and white of John Ford's early classic to the greatest hits approach of ""Tombstone"" and the nearly David Lean epic treatment by Lawrence Kasdan ""Wyatt Earp"".  John Sturges made two attempts and this was his first.  Filmed in glorious VistaVision (a huge negative resulting in tremendous detail of image) ""Gunfight At The OK Corral"" features always scene chewing but lovable Burt Lancaster as Wyatt Earp.  If this movie falls a bit below the others for me it is in the casting and performance of Kirk Douglas as Doc Holiday. Douglas at this time in his career just couldn't play it weak enough and struts around with his chest out far too much for my taste.... far to much the rooster.  Victor Mature played against type and did it well, and both Val Kilmer and Dennis Quaid made remarkable performances as Doc Holiday in their outings.All that said, why I wanted to weigh in was to tell everybody that is wondering.... YES, it is worth dropping another 15 bucks because the BR transfer is very very good and at times shockingly crisp.  Did I also mention that Rhonda Fleming looks like the movie star she was in this transfer as well.  It may not be the best version but it's a classic and props to WB for releasing it on BR at all!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJ63FBI43DD8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM4YB8K#wasThisHelpful","R3VJ63FBI43DD8","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hi Folks,I LOVE Heart, have since they first shook up the established male driven rock world.  I also own all their DVDs and BR discs and have seen them many times.  This looked to be another interesting addition to their growing catalog but goodness at 1 hour and 11 minutes it's Heartly .. er hardly a whole show is it?  The ""Bonus Feature"" is ""Magic Man"" ... why not just include it in the concert and make it a cool 1 hour and 15 minutes of music?  Of course these gals are getting up in age but they still routinely put on 2 hour plus sets ... so why all this production value and pages of credits in the booklets and release half a show?  My guess is this is from a TV production ... but I've purchased many other BR discs that were done for TV/Cable and they often on the BR put all the songs not broadcast but filmed .... just  a thought ladies.I agree with the other reviewer who found the sound a bit less than expected as well and the set chosen to put on BR included more ballads than I'd prefer.  I'd also say the string ensemble backing them on some songs , didn't add anything for me and in fact lessened the songs impact....I'm glad to have this as a long time fan but it isn't terrific as it could have been and as these Hall of Famers deserve.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PL5P7H5MFVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4BVY3K#wasThisHelpful","R3PL5P7H5MFVY","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm going to risk angering a million wonderful Rick fans.... and I include myself in that group as well as my fiancee.  Don't just mark unhelpful because you don't like my lower than 5 star review, I'm trying to give a realistic view to many potential buyers who love Ricks music.  We've met Rick and seen his show several times so I'm NOT a hater.The reason I can't rate this any higher is I view this as a missed  opportunity at a stone cold 5 star mega hit.  While the film is very fun, and shows a unique relationship Rick has with his fan base, or the super fans to be more specific, it is not something a music fan of Ricks would want to watch over and over.... it's just too FAN heavy and too MUSIC light.  To make things worse they do cut away to some incredible HD, high volume rockin' tunes during this documentary but then back to the stars of the film, the fans... and the story of the doc which runs the gambit from sweet and touching to creepy imho.  For me, instead of a bonus disc of more super level fans... a bonus disc containing a full tilt music only show either from one night or culled from the excellent footage we music fans of Ricks get teased with during the documentary would have made this a desert island collection.If you are like me, a fan of Ricks music , and I am a big power pop fan and consider him a true musician , not a soap star wannabee rocker..... you run the risk of being tantalized by music used as a link to more fan following, than you may want to sit through. The second disc.... unless you're on it , and many many fans are... is superfluous.Just keeping it real for the folks who may be music fans and want a clear picture of this film.... hoping for a concert video on blu ray.. heck his most recent was on the HD network, why not put it out on BR?","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDR6R05E6MB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHYSOQO#wasThisHelpful","R2SDR6R05E6MB6","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I bought this with great trepidation , figuring the more recent concert would be a mess, conducted by a semi drunk fool with lame support musicians but the older show may be worth the money.... WRONG!First , let me get to the money for value question... two complete shows of about 100 minutes each '78 and '08... wow, a 30 year span between them.... so historically it's cool and time on disc per cost... pretty high... but it's the quality of those 200 minutes that pushes this to a stunning level for me!The '78 show is better than I hoped for with very good video, playing and a pretty good song list.... but the '08 show is simply mind boggling for me. How the man leading this band and playing with such melodic soul on his gold top Les Paul could be fired from ANY band much less the Allman Brothers is beyond comprehension ....it is such a great show.If you've only heard about drunk or otherwise screwed up Dickey Betts and didn't want to take a gamble.... buy with confidence and cherish the long lovely melodic playing of this Les Paul toting savant!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWG7NO566CKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S21N1Y#wasThisHelpful","RWWG7NO566CKC","A81P47EIXM8HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A81P47EIXM8HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This eye mask is great!  I have used it both hot and cold, and it feels so good (cold) when I have a migraine, or (hot) when I had a head cold.  Also, it smells very good -- but if you don't like scents, you should find something else.My only suggestion would be to add a strap or something so that it stays on your head.  The way it's currently designed, the mask just lays across your eyes, with gravity keeping it in place.

"I chose this mascara because I wanted something that would give the impression of false lashes, and I wanted something waterproof.  Here are my reactions:-- QUALITY:  This is an excellent mascara if you want to build up your lashes and make your eyes pop.  The trick is to keep reapplying coats of mascara before the prior coat dries.  The mascara will build its fibers, so your ""lashes"" really do get longer and thicker.  I was very pleased with the effect of about 3-4 coats -- it really did look like I had on fake lashes, and my eyes looked great in photographs.-- WATERPROOF: Well, the good news is that this mascara is definitely water proof, and it won't streak if you cry!  But the bad news is that it is really, really, really waterproof, and so it's hard to remove.  I have used so many different mascaras in my life, and this really was by far the hardest mascara to remove.  If you use this, make SURE to have some eye makeup remover or baby oil (or some sort of oil) on hand so that you can get this off!-- IRRITATION:  This mascara makes your eyelashes really stiff, and because they're so thick and stiff, I found that my eyes get really dry when I use this mascara for a few days in a row.  I don't think it has to do with the formula, but rather is because of how stiff my lashes get.

"This wallet is great!  I mostly use it as a wristlet, although there is a gold chain that you can use to make this a cross-body bag.I like how much stuff I can fit in this, and that there are lots of compartments.  There are three separate pouches inside this purse, and then there are also spaces in between the pouches.  There's a little zippered section on one wall of the purse, and a spot for credit cards at the other end.  I have a pretty small wallet, and I can just pop my wallet inside of this.I really like the croc styling.

"This deodorizer spray is one of my new favorite little products.  It's a small little bottle, and the name explains exactly what it does!  When you need to use it, just shake it up and spray it right into the toilet bowl.  The label says that the spray will form a shield on top of the water in the bowl, holding the scent inside.I am not sure whether it really coats the top of the water, but that may be!  I definitely noticed the scent, though -- so it may just be that it's a really concentrated air freshener.  Either way, it does its job!I found that 2 sprays was more than sufficient.  This spray is quite strong, so I definitely recommend giving one or two sprays, and then wait about 5 seconds, so you can decide if you need more.  I found the scent to be quite pleasant - -a fresh smell.I recommend this.  I gave it to my husband, and he got a kick out of it!

"First off, be aware right away that you should be ordering the special battery when you buy this flashlight!  I got these 2 x UltraFire 18650 3000mAh 3.7V Rechargeable Battery + Charger, which weren't too expensive (especially considering that it's rechargeable).  The pamphlet that is in the flashlight's box says that you can also power it with 3 AAA batteries, but I haven't figured out how to fit them in -- I think the 18650 battery is the right choice.Aside from the battery issue, this is a really good flashlight for the outdoors.  It is solidly built, will withstand the elements.I also like that it is small & lightweight enough to carry around.  The pamphlet that comes with this flashlight says that the battery will last one hour.

"I had heard a lot about Jag Jeans before I finally decided to try them.  They lived up to my hopes!  These jeans are very comfortable, particularly in the waist.  I have a ""pooch,"" I guess you call it, and I hate how the waistband of pants digs in, especially when I sit for long stretches, like during car rides.  These jeans are a big improvement.They do stretch out some, although I haven't had the problems with a ""saggy butt"" that I see other commenters describing.  To me, these jeans don't stretch out more than my ""regular"" jeans that have stretch in them.  I have learned to deal that it -- when the stretch gets a little bad, I throw the jeans in the washing machine.  If it's really bad, I will put them in the dryer, too.  That takes care of it.A note on sizing:  I am between a 10 and a 12.  I ordered both sizes, and I decided to stick with the 10.  I didn't notice a huge difference in the waist -- with both pairs, I have to kind of work them around my hips, which makes sense, given that they don't have a zipper or belt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCHK24QA5IY1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D41HBP4#wasThisHelpful","RCHK24QA5IY1H","AO16D5VV91API","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO16D5VV91API?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Perfect size jar to keep my winter mulling mixture fresh. This jar is indeed air tight. When I put my heavily scented mulling mix in here, I couldn't smell a thing around the lid. I use fresh cloves, cinnamon sticks, star anise, allspice berries and orange peel in the mulling mix and if the jar was not air tight I would have smelled it. That makes me more confident that other things stored in these Oggi canisters will also be kept fresh and air tight.

"I finally splurged and bought this. Now I know why everyone loves this system! For summer bounty from your garden, for premade meals,  for pantry items and emergency supplies, for hunters and those who hunt for bulk sales of meats at the store, there is just nothing like this system for keeping everything fresh. If you read the directions, it's very easy to use and works every time. Seals in less than 30 seconds with no waiting to seal the next bag. No wasted bag edges either, it seals very close to the end.I use a regular zip type bag (with the zip area cut off),  inside all the foodsaver bags to make it easier to re-use them. Usually no washing necessary! For long term storage, I use the rolls and premade bags. For short term, and frequent opening and closing, I use the ones with the vacuum hole.  Although I was told that the vacuum hole type were ""not recommended"" for the freezer, I have found that they work just fine. All that is required is very careful sealing technique and a small piece of freezer tape over the hole for added security.For soups, sauces, pie fillings, and other liquids, I freeze them first in lock n lock containers, then I transfer the food into the bags. If you are going to boil the contents at some point, it may be better not to use an inner bag. No telling if it would melt.  For real economy, and longer term storage,  I use Ball freezer jars with the wide mouth vacuum  attachment. Cook that big batch of spaghetti sauce or soup once and enjoy it all winter!At first the cost of the bags seemed to be more than the savings on the food, but with inner bags, or better yet wrapping portions in cling or even sandwich bags, all bags are re-usable, and even easy to wash if desired. For added cost savings on premade and rolls of bags check out ""food vac bags"" they are sold here on Amazon, and are just as good as the name brand. What an invention! This is the best purchase I have made this year!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KR1SCKEQJMGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DI342B4#wasThisHelpful","R3KR1SCKEQJMGS","A3977OZLNA8LCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977OZLNA8LCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These, work perfectly if you remember to do a few simple things:  1. Wrap moist food lightly in plastic wrap, cling wrap or press N seal. If freezing, freeze liquids like sauces in flat containers (like lock n lock), remove when frozen and wrap, or place into a regular zip bag with the zipper cut off, then put into the foodsaver bag. This enables you to reuse the foodsaver bag later.  2. Press some of the air out of the bag. Press the zip strip firmly on a hard surface two or three times. Use the back of a butter knife or spoon to ensure the bag is tightly sealed.  3. Place the sealer firmly over the vacuum hole.

"This is the best of both worlds. No clunky food processor to take up space on the counter or that you have to drag out of the closet to use.  My Kitchenaid is kept on the counter and this attachment is right under it in a drawer with the small box of blades. Better than that? The dicer on this model!  I cook a lot and I've spent far too many hours hand slicing,  dicing  and shredding vegetables. This makes quick work of it all!The blades are very easy to install into the main assembly and then attach to the mixer just as you would any other attachment. Clean up is easy, sometimes with just a quick rinse and dry with a paper towel. I don't put these in a dishwasher, it's really doesn't seem necessary. The blades are super sharp and best of all you're not limited by the bowl size as with a conventional food processor.I got a terrific deal on this from Amazon warehouse. Saved almost $40. They always say there is a little ""cosmetic damage"" on the product, but all I have ever experienced is a slightly dented box with no damage whatsoever to the product. No manual for use was included however, but that was quickly remedied on line at Kitchenaid where I downloaded the manual.

"I was pretty skeptical about this, but after years of overflowing coffee grounds,(using Bunn filters)  I had to try it.  IT WORKS! Not a single bit of the 2 overfilled scoops of fine grind decaf (enough for 10 cups) overflowed the basket into the pot. I was also concerned that the filter would not remove the bitter tasting oils or whatever they say the paper filter removes to make good coffee. IT DID.  Amazingly, the coffee tasted smooth, clean, and definitely un-bitter. Compared to this, my coffee used to taste like heavy, leftover-from-yesterday stuff.Regular filters are 2.25 inches tall, Bunn filters are 2.5 inches tall and this filter is 2.75 inches tall. I have an old NHB Bunn coffee pot, and even the Bunn filters weren't tall enough. This is. There is even room to spare at the top.  I do have a special flow regulator for high altitude; free from Bunn.This is so easy to use. Just dump the grounds into the trash after brewing, rinse it out, and you're ready to go again.

"Terrific for 2 very large entrees, (or smaller portions with leftovers!), generous side dishes for 4, and a very nice artisan loaf of bread with crusty goodness.  Details: The lid has nice deep indents for easy removal even with oven gloves. The bottom part is glazed, the top is not. You can spray the bottom with cooking spray, but do not spray the top. Soak the top for about 20-30 minutes. Pat dry.For food other than bread: place the entire cooker with your meal in it into a COLD/unheated oven. Set the temperature and time for cooking. Remove the lid for the last 10 minutes of cooking time if you want to crisp the contents. For bread: Spray the bottom, soak the lid, and place the entire EMPTY cooker in the cold/unheated oven. Set the temperature desired. When it has reached proper temperature, carefully transfer the risen dough into the cooker (Raising on parchment helps) put the lid back on and set the time desired. Remove lid for the last 20 minutes of cooking time to obtain a crisp crust.I read somewhere that to convert a recipe to the clay cooker you can raise the temperature 50 degrees and decrease the time about 20 minutes. I have not tested this because there are plenty of good clay cooker books and recipes everywhere to use.Details: The cooker base exterior is approx. 8 3/4"" x 8 3/4"" at the top.  The interior diameter is approx. 7 3/4"" x 7 3/4"" at the top and 6 1/4"" x 6 1/4""  at the bottom. It is about 3 1/2"" deep.  The height of the base alone is 4"". The entire cooker is about 6 1/4"" tall with the lid on.The most fun thing about using this is the feeling of the connection to the ""old days and old ways"". These clay pots have been used for hundreds of years, maybe thousands and are still used today in all parts of the world.

"The best book to come along in a long time! I love to make home made crackers but was tired of trying to roll out thick dough into thin crackers, This method is one of those ""why didn't I think of that"" things.  Well, Alice did think of it and you will be glad she did. The book is relatively small for the price, only about 73 pages. She spells out in detail a lot of things you probably already know about flours, supplies, baking tips, and why you should make your own crackers, but there are still things to learn here.The recipes are pretty simple, and very inspiring. Once you understand the process by making her recipes, you move on to being creative, and that's where the fun begins! I did not go out and purchase all the specialty flours, I only had organic whole wheat and buckwheat flours from my bread baking supplies, so I substituted a little organic white bread flour for the spelt etc. (horrors! I know), but it was only a couple tablespoons.The fun is looking around your kitchen and finding fun things to use in your cracker creations. It really does only take 5 minutes from mixing to baking The pictures in the book are really beautiful, but let's just ignore the goofy hat and costume that is her Alice in Wonderland persona.  As she says, you will never buy store crackers again. This method is so easy, any kid can do it and it would make a great gift for all aspiring kid chefs! (Don't forget to get them their own chefs hat!)PS, I almost forgot to mention the sweet crackers! How about chocolate for example, and with NO OIL, they are easy on the calories.

"It was hard to believe all the different types of cakes that were in this book. I figured I had thought of them all. Not even close. There are several ""special diet"" variations and substitutions too,, like dairy free, sugar free, gluten free, vegan etc. I did not see a substitution for oil or butter, but I have always used banana, avocado, pumpkin puree, mayo, or my favorite, yogurt. I choose, depending on the cake flavor. (Gotta keep those calories down). The first cake I made was (yogurt) chocolate cherry, with fresh cherries.

It's worth the wait. (I use the small ramekins, not mugs,  in the microwave too. They cook faster)I think that the whole point of this book is to inspire you to think up your own combinations and be creative. Satisfying your sweet tooth with a small gourmet treat is sure better than making a whole cake and ending up eating too much of it. If you use the substitutions, you can really create a nice dessert with very few calories. and.....if you're so inclined, a TB of liquor (say, Grand Marnier?) in that chocolate cake wouldn't hurt either..","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108UYHGJGM62Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125002658X#wasThisHelpful","R108UYHGJGM62Q","A3977OZLNA8LCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977OZLNA8LCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these for their terrific health benefits, especially for my eyes. They taste somewhat like cranberries, but a little more tart and just a little more chewy. I put them on my yogurt and toss a few in my salad. I have incorporated them into my homemade granola too. 1/4 cup contains about an ounce of dried berries, and is considered a daily serving of about 100 calories.I understand these are very easy to grow in containers and I am looking into purchasing a few plants. I have a dehydrator which will be vey useful, I'm sure. I'm very pleased with these overall, but they are expensive and if I can learn to grow my own, I will be even happier.P.S.

"Perfect for fancy hamburger buns, and individual desserts too!  I was trying to make relatively uniform buns but not having much success. I use a rich egg bread dough and shape them like a pretty Kaiser roll. Unfortunately the dough always seemed to have a mind of it's own. I didn't want them bakery perfect, but I thought a little consistency would be nice. I now measure out 3 1/2 ounces of dough, shape, and place in the pan. They come out just perfect.  The straight sides of the pan keep the dough contained and my rolls are not spread out and flat any more. They rise to just a little over the top. Unfortunately this pan is too big for most toaster ovens, even my large Breville toaster oven.  If you're using a mix or scratch cake or muffin batter, fill the wells only 2/3 full.  I like this pan even better than a muffin pan for corn bread and biscuits. The larger flat bottom really makes it easier to use those things in the bottom of a bowl with chili or stew over the top. as compared to a regular muffin pan.Mini pies with pie crust, filo dough or puff pastry work great. Meringue shells also turn out perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A400X5ZJQVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QXW3Q4#wasThisHelpful","R22A400X5ZJQVB","A3977OZLNA8LCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977OZLNA8LCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was leery of the smell of these with chamomile as I prefer unscented things, but the scent is very light and surprisingly pleasant.

"This is the moisturizer you have been searching for! Thick and rich, creamy and luxurious, it has every ingredient you need for terrific skin. The first ingredient is organic aloe, used for hundreds of years  to treat skin conditions and dryness. I live high in the mountains (8,200 ft) in a ski resort. The dry mountain air has really made my face look dry and  dull. After only a few days of using this cream, I am starting to see a difference. I have tried almost everything on the market (organic) and I am sold on the ingredients in this. The harsh exfoliating chemicals in the other creams  made my face burn. This has no smell, nothing to irritate your skin, only natural moisturizers. The price seemed a bit high, but the jar is a very generous 4 ounces compared to the others who have only 2 ounces for the same price, and you only need a small amount.Recap: The best things about this are the excellent line up of natural ingredients. It has no offensive smell, you get double the amount for the money compared to other organic creams. It has no harsh exfoliating ingredients, and it's thicker and creamier than most of the others, I will be ordering this again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UQTWRTMKS1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZWV0WY#wasThisHelpful","R34UQTWRTMKS1O","A3977OZLNA8LCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977OZLNA8LCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the best thing since the sliced bread you will use the jam on!  (Homemade bread, if you can). Prepare your fresh ripe (or frozen) fruit, no need to cook it,  just clean and remove any stems etc. Mash or cut in small pieces and mix with the pectin and sugar if using. Splenda and Stevia also work perfectly. I found that my fresh strawberries needed very little added sweetener. Pectin is used at about 1 TB per cup of fruit. All you do is mix for about 3 minutes (or until your hand gets real tired!). There is a bit of confusing information as to how many jars of jam this will make, but that is because you may need to add a little more to some fruits to get the consistency you want. I would say there are between 15 and 20 cups worth of pectin. It makes the best jam you have ever had! I tried this with juice and it didn't work very good for making jelly. The Ball web site ""doesn't recommend it"" for jelly, but I just had to try. I used the Wood's Boiled Cider, (available here on Amazon) and diluted it 1 part cider to 7 parts water. I tested it with two cups of the cider and 2 TB of the pectin. It really didn't set up at all.  I will use the low/no sugar pectin next time, and boil the cider as recommended by Ball. I will add a drop of LorrAnn cinnamon oil next time to get that apple/cinnamon jelly taste like the kind I had purchased at a local orchard. (it was $15 a jar, yikes!)In summary, what could be easier than crushing some fruit a little, stirring in the pectin and letting it sit a few minutes to thicken?  The entire jar of jam will cost about 50 cents and the best part for me is that you can add any herbs or flavorings you want, to create one-of-a-kind gourmet jams. Grandma never had it so easy!***UPDATE***: I found a recipe for caramel apple jam and altered it to make with instant pectin. 4 cups apples (peeled ,cored and chunky-chopped). lightly boil to just slightly tender, crush a little and cool, then and add 1 tsp  butter flavoring and 1 tsp caramel flavoring, (or to taste)and 3-4 TB of instant pectin. and sugar, splenda or stevia to taste.Stir for 3 minutes or so. For apple pie jam, use vanilla instead of the caramel flavoring and add apple pie spices, and raisins if you like. These are not only good on toast, but terrific on yogurt and ice cream too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IHU43DQSDNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U8R0ME#wasThisHelpful","R32IHU43DQSDNT","A3977OZLNA8LCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3977OZLNA8LCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you complaining about the directions being inside and no way to remove the top...they have added directions on how to open the top, on the handle bar of the lid. They point to where to release the latch and flip the top open for easy removal of the infuser. This item is very versatile because you can remove the infuser and use as a plain pitcher. It does look very pretty with the infuser in and filled with lemons or strawberries when having company.For every day use, this 3 quart size is just right. I found a 4 qt too heavy and a 2 qt was empty too fast. The directions also tell you how far to turn the lid to open it for pouring. There is an arrow to guide you. I also love the handle on the lid because it's so easy to get your hand under it to turn the lid. (The red lids on other pitchers are not deep enough, and very frustrating). My only little gripe?

"This does tan nicely, but even though I was careful, I got some streaky and uneven areas. My fault, not the tanner. I will try to put it on more carefully.

I am pretty pale, and ""over 60"" so I didn't want to look like I had used a tanning bed or heavy sprayer. Those of you my age group remember the baby oil and iodine routine that we all got burnt from using. This is more natural and very subtle provided you do not over do it.

"I received this product at a discount to test and give my honest and unbiased opinion. Well, after years of living in the mountains at 8,000 feet elevation,  my hair was so dry it crackled with static and flew in all directions when I tried to brush it. What a mess. Nothing from the drug store worked to tame the fly-away strands. So many people said this made their hair softer, but I didn't need soft, I needed hydration. The first two times I used this, there was only a small improvement. I had let it sit on my hair for 5 minutes or so before rinsing. The third time, I got a phone call, and it ""accidentally"" stayed on for 45 minutes, covered with a plastic shower cap, before I had a chance to rinse it off. That did it!  My newly moisturized hair was sleek and manageable, not dry and out of control. Yes, it was soft too, but I was looking for an answer to my crackly dry, stack filled hair problem, and I got it.

"ALEX Toys Craft Do-It-Yourself Card Crafter was a perfect product for my seven year old niece, I must say that the quality of the, corresponding, parts of the merchandise was of a good standard  which in turns means that older children as well as adults would enjoy this crafts based creations. I was actually surprised by how much this kit contained. I love the aesthetic too - the colors and print blocks she loves it and we had so much fun creating with fun greeting cards. The colors are vibrant and everything is good quality. There is something really special about receiving homemade crafted cards. This is a product that really helps a childs creative process. There is also a process which reinforces manual dexterity, the use of shapes, layering, as well as the ability to pursue personal expression through positive play as well helping a childs imagination.I recommend this for anyone whose children are interested in and making homemade crafted cards! Please note not suitable for very young children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBTAW8WH2AOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV0Y57C#wasThisHelpful","R3UBTAW8WH2AOM","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Cat People evolved way back in prehistory. As certain tribal groups sacrificed/offered up young women to leopards who seemed to have been deified, who coupled with them. These Cat People look similar to humans (or can they be described as unwilling shape shifters?), however, they must mate with other Cat People before they transform into panthers. If they do not mate with their own kind, the results are bloody and terrible.The initial narrative is Irene Gallier who was raised by adoptive parents and meets her older brother Paul for the first time since childhood. We follow brother and sister - who seem to be the only ones of their kind. It soon comes to the fore that for Paul to attain any physical relationship with a woman, he must contemplate an unpalatable truth.The underlying principle in both the 1942 Cat People and the 1982 remake are the same: A striking Anglo-Saxon beauty is given to metamorphosing into a black panther when she is sexually aroused. The caveat here being that the remake also deals with a mans sexuality and his possible social transgressions from what is acceptable, and what is not in todays society, such as incest and violence.For me the 1942 original is a real classic and was a daring film for its time. Moreover if you consider the powers and tenets of Hays Code; which were meant to preserve public morality, from overzealous film makers. The film can truly be called daring and original. The 1982 remake, in certain circles is much lampooned. Many site thematic inconsistencies in the plot, the non-cohesiveness of the narrative. A film that is more skin, then horror and then there is the growing misogyny that seems to go unfettered. I do not want to even try defending against these accusations. However, for me the combination of a good OST and David Bowies classic song made this film haunting and certain aspects a very cerebral experience, and hence my five star rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YXTZQ13H2618/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000069HZO#wasThisHelpful","R1YXTZQ13H2618","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is always good to know from other reviewers whether sizing for clothing is as expected, so our thanks to the other reviewers for heads-up because the 6XL fits, although, it is a snug fit. All in all, this is an OK sports themed hoodie. The weave of the garment is not as thick or as substantial as some other similar hoodies we have bought in the past.

".This is pretty much partners' review.The Merumaya Overnight Recharge Night Cream is rich yet not overly-so and it sinks in relatively quickly leaving skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. As Im very dehydrated lately, I use two pumps, but oily to normal skins would only need one pump. This really does go rather well with the Treatment Toner, as it contains a lot of similar ingredients that can continue the good work of the toner and I would really recommend this if you have skin that has areas of dryness and then may be oily patches, as its one of the few night creams that really nourishes without blocking pores.It still early days with this product  but so far seem to going well, as with most things only time will tell how good and productive this Merumaya Overnight Recharge Night Cream is. From my limited look on the internet Merumaya products have a good and mainly positive feedback. As with all products that are applied to the body, best to do a patch test, on small area first just to ensure no negative reactions.

"Sony have launched their new h.ear (pronounced hear) series  a range of fashionable headphones and a Walkman that support High Resolution Audio (HRA). They are a minimalist design and come in a variety of colours with a metallic finish. As there bumf says the Sony h.ear in NC High-Resolution Noise Cancelling Headphones comes with two microphones which are used to detect ambient noise, which is offset by opposing frequencies, this then supposedly delivers clear audio without disturbance from background noise. The earphones come with an in-line remote and microphone on a 1.5 m cable to ensure ease of access to the device. It makes answering calls and browsing through playlist, on the go, a breeze. With just the click of a button you can answer your calls and speak without having to hold the phone in the hand.The key thing here is that Sony MDR-EX750NA earphones are equipped with the Hi-Res Audio technology, which purports to offer the highest quality music. As they go on to say this feature plays sounds in the exact range as the artist intended to hear them. This provides higher sound quality than you will find in a CD. From my understanding of things, and I may have got my facts muddled. Due to the features outlined above, then these headphones are mainly designed to go with SonysNW-A25 and NW-A26HN series of Walkmans.Key Features & Highlights 9mm high-sensitivity drivers 16 hours battery life Inline remoteWearing Style: In  earNow on the subject of how they sound, I believe sound reproduction can be a very subjective discussion - that said, for me, the sound here is equal to its design, supplying the listener with good reproduction, which offers good balance, rich in detail and a deep bass in equal measure. The headphones sit comfortably in the ear (for me anyway). I am rather particular with my headphones and for me they must sound good and should be robust and have a good quality build - to a certain degree these headphones fit the bill hence my four star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJ2T77AVWWSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01538V4SU#wasThisHelpful","RDJ2T77AVWWSK","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Possible spoilersThinking this will prevent war; the US government gives an impenetrable supercomputer total control over launching nuclear missiles. But what the computer does with the power is unimaginable to its creators.The film is based upon the 1966 science fiction book of the same name Colossus, by Dennis Feltham Jones about a massive American defence supercomputer, named Colossus, becoming sentient after being activated, and the resultant consequences. This is one relatively uncommon movie. It deals judiciously with multifaceted scientific concerns and does so without dumbing down perceptions, nor making any painful errors in trying to keep up with its own narrative. This is a film that shows how Mankind is given the stark choice between the ""peace of plenty"" or one of ""unburied dead"".I first saw this movie as child, and really had impact on me  if anything I found it a scary concept. Returning to the players of piece; the choice Eric Braeden, as Dir. Charles A. Forbin, was excellent he really brings presence to the screen. He does not suffer fools, even if it is the United States President. His co-star Susan Clark as (Dir. Cleo Markham) makes for an intelligent love interest, and their on screen chemistry is very good. As for Colossus, it is at its spooky best when the viewer reads his short to the point Q and A. When Colossus gains a voice I feel it detracts from the overall menace of sentient behavior. If it is not already the case, then this film should be a Cult classic. Lastly its interesting to note the computers shown were not mock ups, but the real thing. A film worthy of a good five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TBT3PYJBABZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0003JAOO0#wasThisHelpful","R30TBT3PYJBABZ","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The whole landscape of the previous book has changed as we find Thomas in Barbados, in the Caribbean. Not only did this give the author the opportunity to show the corruption of Cromwell's Republic. The republic's existence was initially declared through ""An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth"". Swanton brings the Civil War to the fore, which did not just affect England and its close neighbours such as Ireland and Scotland, but its colonies too. Here we are usually shown the reverse position, where trouble in the colonies undermines the situation at home. The difference between the rigid, strict nature of Cromwellian society and the more relaxed, less parochial Barbadian planter society is shown, and used to good effect, but Swanston doesn't paint Barbados as a utopia, in fact he stresses the unpleasant conditions of slaves and indentured domestics were forced to live and work in.The King's Exile is a good sequel to The King's Spy, Andrew Swanston to prove that the theme of cryptography was not his only strength he can still write a compelling story, without it being the central tenants. The King's Exile is very much a character-driven story and all the stronger for it. I am looking forward to getting my hands on The King's Return the third segment in the trilogy.The narrative here is very different from last book, with far less conundrums and decrypting and more surviving and action, yet all very entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5FB93C50UMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011T82W52#wasThisHelpful","R1R5FB93C50UMG","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".Criminal Justice can be summed up as the, structures, institutions and processes involved with the deterrence, analysis and prosecution of crime, the workings of the criminal law and criminal court system and the handling of offenders within society. As with other titles in this range of A Very Short Introduction series, are intended to give the reader a jump start in subject, a primer if you will. This is done in a reasonably short, straightforward and concise fashion in the form of bite sized chunks.The author is Julian Roberts, is Professor of Criminology University of Oxford. His narrative gives a good overview, as well critical analysis, on most subjects that are covered. The book also does a decent job at trying to attract the reader into each topic field. The book draws upon the latest examination and current practices from various countries around the world. He, mainly, looks at the adversarial system or adversary system, which is a legal system, used in the common law (also known as case law or precedent) countries, for example, such as the United Kingdom, United States and Australia. The adversary system is a legal system used in the common law countries where two advocates represent their parties' positions before a neutral person or group of people, usually a jury or judge, who try to determine the truth of the case. This is in contrast to the inquisitorial system used in some civil law systems (Roman law or the Napoleonic code) where a judge or group of judges investigates the case. It is interesting to note that mainly through the British Empire, the adversary system found its way across the world.This text would be of interest to lay readers interested in the topic, as well as all students of law..","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3NZG00U4GDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0198716494#wasThisHelpful","R2F3NZG00U4GDX","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The path to victory is littered with snow trolls, sea monsters and a gang of particularly hungry yetis.There are some other interesting characters, but I do not want spoil it for potential readers, sufficed to say they are exceedingly interesting. Humour is the crucial element of this book; this is yet successful collaboration between the authors Philip Reeve and Sarah McIntyre. They form a comedic double-act, and as they have very different personalities the resulting collaboration really works. Only Philip Reeves imagination could make snow so interesting and so varied. This book will leave adult and child alike chortling for some time. The drawing of the yetis making noodles are truly enthralling and so very well by Sarah McIntyre.Look out for the 50 types of different snow.

"To be perfectly honest I had heard of the brand, but I had never owned a pair before of their shoes. So when I was offered this Mizuno Wave Ultima 7, Men's Running Shoes I got a pair in size 11. I found the fit to be very good; in particular I like these because I have wide feet and appreciate the spacious toe box. It has the perfect amount of cushioning and support where you need it in a running shoe. I really have no other experience with this brand, but I find that this particular model seems light weight. While appreciate that these shoes are for running, I feel they will also be great to use in cross training, which something I enjoy doing. They are excellent build quality, and feel robust too.

"This is my most recent foray into the series A Very Short Introductions. I have always been fascinated by the proposition that these titles are intended to give the reader a jump start in subject. In a reasonably short, straightforward and concise fashion, and how this is accomplished. The topic here, being Social psychology. This discipline had traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology. The definition of the subject is; the scientific study of how people's point of view, emotional state, and behaviours are predisposed by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.The author tells the narrative of Social psychology. He gives a good account of its history, its key thinkers, major breakthroughs and what has made this subject one of the most important and relevant subjects of the 21st century. For mankind is gregarious by nature. We as people do interconnect, whether it is through families, our working relationships, our attractions, prejudice and persuasion  in short the whole gamut of the social universe, can be looked at analysed. This AVSI primer is done in a very manageable fashion. There are monochrome diagrams and pictures to best exemplify point. This edition is readable without getting too technical in its approach.

".This is a beautiful book for some great illustrations from the natural world to color at your leisure and using your own imagination. This is a very creative and relaxing way to rid yourself of the stresses and strains of a busy day. On first inspection we felt it was too beautiful to spoil such a lovely, detailed and well-designed book. This coloring book can be appreciated by all ages to share. This book has quality written all over it, the binding is tight and firm. The quality of the paper is good, and as the guide lines suggest you only use dry drawing media such as coloring pencils. There are also supportive tips and methods on how to use coloring pencils, by layering and blending color so you can get the most out of your coloring book. This then means you should not have any bleed through of colour. Please don't be misled - by the books' size, the involved detailing will require that any half interested user will be kept absorbed for hours, as there is plenty to do. This is very much a cross-generational coloring book that should keep all ages happily occupied. Over all the Flora and Fauna theme is done rather well.Considering what you are getting in this beautiful book, the pricing - in my humble opinion is fair. My family and I will certainly be getting more of these books in the range, both for our coloring-in pleasure as well as sending them out as presents, over the festive season..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13E1AK5BSWHH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=099337980X#wasThisHelpful","R13E1AK5BSWHH1","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".Many gamers are zealous about their gaming, and thus demand the best that budget allows. Whether it's having a purpose built gaming PC, or upgrading to the latest PC hardware for better gaming involvement. Thus many look for ways to make the most of the gaming experience. Logitech has produced the G633 headset, which caters to those who request high-performance audio and cross-platform compatibility.Logitech's wired G633 Artemis Spectrum gaming headset supports 7.1 surround sound and are designed to connect with mobile devices, home theatre systems, game consoles, and PCs. As opposed to speakers, these headphones are easy to carry. In addition the Artemis Spectrum headsets offer both Dolby and DTS Headphone compatibility.With 7.1 surround sound, your gaming experience is heightened by creating a full-on gaming environment, which enhances movies - and mission critical to many types of games these days. Having correct spatial cognizance and being able to clearly hear the direction of subtle sounds can mean the difference between preventing a surprise gunman attack and losing the game.This is only my second, only, foray into the realms of gaming headsets, so I have no real base line to judge them against (as my first set were rather basic fare). I have always used bog standard headsets for my gaming needs. However, Logitech's wired G633 Artemis Spectrum gaming headset has really been a game changer - no pun intended. I have found them comfortable to wear, although I am not one to play any one game for more than a couple of hours. So I cannot attest to how comfortable they are - after a really long gaming session. I really love the bass on these headphones and overall the sound fidelity is very good as you get the full on immersed effect. The surround sound effect is a surprising experience when you hear it for the first time. My only gripes are the overall design could have been more refined and certain types of music do not sound well through these headsets..","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXA1KBGN2LMGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013P0K8OE#wasThisHelpful","RXA1KBGN2LMGF","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a former arm chair general I have always been fascinated by the Rebels defeat at the battle for Hoth. The Imperial forces mainstay assault on the ground was the AT-AT Walkers, which seemed effective, although there were losses due to Luke Skywalkers ingenious counter attack.The AT-AT (please correct me if I am wrong) is the second edition produced by Lego. So my nephew and I went ahead and purchased this newer version. Much to our surprise, this unit is a huge improvement over the older version. The build quality is really solid, although the main command module at the front seems to be disproportionate, in size to the rest of the body. The Lines, of this significant battle unit, are nice and tight; the head unit is solid and won't come apart. The overall design is exceptional showing lots of detail.My nephew and I love the spring loaded laser guns; the projectiles can travel at least six metres. The inside of the body is bland; there is not real detail in there, but plenty of room to store a couple of imperial storm trooper mini-figures.We added the AT-AT to our Hoth battle scene simulation, and it was soon apparent that one AT-AT Walker was insufficient for an accurate demonstration on the field of battle. My Nephew informed me that either we would have to wait for Christmas, his birthday, or I could purchase the additional unit. My answer was short and to the point, I said that I only gave strategic advice  and my valuable time to help build the Hoth Lego simulation, financial assistance is not within my remit.Overall a good unit worthy of a good four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9GP0H7C5H8A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KT16X0#wasThisHelpful","R9GP0H7C5H8A6","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".This circular cutter style is the best option of any shaver. It has a good feel and is easy to use and gives very close shave and the head glides smoothly - definitely one of their best, now this is probably not as good as a full on wet shave but it still does a sterling job, and you get the feel that the blades on this shaver are very sharp. The battery life lasts for a good long time. The attachment that is used as the side burn trimmer is pretty good and performs that aspect of the shaves well and you get rather neat results. The spring-loaded cutting head glides smoothly over the skin and adapts perfectly to the contours of the face. It handles hairs in such problematic parts as the upper lip, chin and neck easily. On average, the shaving is done after about 5-10 minutes without any strain to the skin. If one uses the shaver as a wet razor with foam or cleansing cream, the results are clean and notable.To achieve, the best possible results, and achieve a close shave I would recommend also using light shaving oil. The oil helps to penetrate the skin easily to protect it from damage whilst enhancing shaving, especially when used before shaving cream/foam.When it comes to shaving beard growth that is longer than four days, this shaver will easily tackle it with no effort at all. In fact, on the first pass you will already start seeing remarkable results that from a distance seem to be satisfactory. To achieve a truly good shave, you will need to go over the skin a few more times. Cleaning is by simply rinsing under running water, brushing regularly and applying a drop of oil occasionally.Overall a good solid product which does its intended job well and therefore recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTK3JGBHLFS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FBPE79Y#wasThisHelpful","R3OTK3JGBHLFS2","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Philip Reeve is a very accomplished writer for children, which adults happen to read too. Both my partner and I love his work. The book is affectionately fashioned with some charming effective graphics from Sarah McIntyre and their partnership is a real force multiplier as the narrative and the pictorials enhance the story. A book that would be a bright and notable addition to any bookshelf - be it, for a child or adult.Sarah McIntyre has lovingly produced some gorgeously effective illustrations  that are lovely and zany I hope we get to see the colourful edition when it comes out.

"As the blurb says these books are designed to be readable, a way to get ahead in a new topic rapidly. The narrative gives a good overview on most subjects that are covered. The book also does a decent job at trying to attract the reader into each topic field. This is the second edition of British Politics VSI and is quite up-to-date. The narrative talks about the current position of British Politics and the coalition government that we have at this time (as of 2013).However, there is a problem here, in a book that should remain neutral in its delivery, and as other reviewers have commented the author's politics seem to influence his writing as it progresses.

".Possible spoilersBoth my partner and I saw this film at the BFI London Film Festival October 2014Film makers Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz's latest film, is supposed to be the third in a trilogy films exploring male-controlled undercurrents in an Israeli family. However, the viewer need not have seen the other two films to be able to understand the subtext of their narrative. This film was exhibited at the 2014 London Film Festival under the `Dare' category and has since, in the case of the UK, gone straight to DVD.This production has its attentions zeroed in on Viviane (played by director Ronit Elkabetz) and her five-year journey to obtain a divorce from her husband, after her 15 years of marriage. However, she is forestalled - in that in Israel, there is no a straightforward civil marriage or divorces. For a wife to wish to live her life independently it is wholly reliant on the acceptance of either her husband or the sternly conformist rabbinical courts to agree. This is a film, which at times has ridiculous hilarity of the human condition within the context at hand, and is countered with its heart-breaking humiliations. The filmmakers approach in their direction takes an uncluttered and Spartan approach. The narrative conveys the atmosphere of rigidity in the courtroom - right down to the strict and appropriate dress code. All the film's scenes take place in the courtroom, a small claustrophobic room with white walls. It is the former wife Viviane - who is the key issue of the piece, and Elkabetz's portrayal is one to be applauded - as we see her go through frustration after frustration and her resilience.One of the themes that really got under my skin was the fact that the court session cannot get underway until the husband is present! By using this stratagem Elisha played by (Simon Abkarian) declines to present himself in court. He uses his influence to delay the court in order to wear out his wife and force her to withdraw her annulment request. In reality this tactic is unfortunately used by Israeli men who want a postponement or curtail a divorce, and is a cognitive act of revenge, or a way to illicit child custody.For me a `Gett' offers a deeply troubling view of a system whereby misogyny seems, as if it is, codified into the court system.Review update____________________________________________________________________________(12/21/2014)'Gett' fails to make it into Oscar finals for 2015 - Sad really as it is a important film.Review update____________________________________________________________________________(02/19/2015) For those interestedA rabbi has gone on trial in the United States accused of plotting to abduct Jewish men who refused to grant their wives a divorce(""Get"").

".The year 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and NagasakiThe narrative is about Amaterasu, who along with her husband leave Japan after the war. Amaterasu is living in a retirement home in the United Sates, her daughter Yuko and grandson Hideo died when the Americans attacked Nagasaki with an atom bomb. Amaterasu is truly alone as her husband has passed away and there is nobody else who is close to her, in her new homeland. When one day someone, who is badly burned, shows up on her doorstep and tells her he is Hideo  the grandson she presumed died during the horrific events of August 9, 1945.The last conventional U.S Air Force raid on Nagasaki occurred the August 1, 1945, and was deemed effective to a degree. The damage from these few bombs was relatively small, it, however, created considerable concern in Nagasaki and a number of people, predominantly school children, were evacuated to rural areas for safety, thus reducing the populace in the city at the time of the atomic attack on Thursday, August 9, 1945. On that day, a plutonium bomb code named ""Fat Man"" was used by the U.S Air Force. In fact, Kokura province was the primary target, or intended target for the ""Fat Man"" bomb. However, due to poor visibility the secondary target of Nagasaki was chosen (Major Charles Sweeney, commander of the B29 bomber, had orders to drop the bomb visually and not by radar, hence he diverted to the secondary target, of Nagasaki)  and thus the cities fate was sealed.After 53 seconds from its release, the bomb named ""Fat Man exploded at 11:02 a.m. at an approximate altitude of 1,800 feet - some 39,00080,000 people were killed. About half of these died instantly, while the other half suffered prolonged deaths.Jackie Copleton, the author, paints a sensitively told narrative about an absorbing woman with a heart-breaking past, who also suffers from guilt. This is a narrative, which is encapsulated within a complicated history, much of which remains secret until the end of the book. At times, it is quite intriguing and the reader is left wanting to know more. Jackie Copleton tells us a poignant tale, which is done with great sensitivity, thus making it even more striking..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1448SLGQ25COE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0091959063#wasThisHelpful","R1448SLGQ25COE","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".The Deep Sea Submarine in this set is a beautiful piece, which would look good on any shelf. The build, itself-went quickly, and all parts were bagged by step, directions, for the build were clear and everything came together nicely. My one main criticism (as usual) is about the stickers, they are difficult to apply for a nice finish. The assembled sunken treasure chest/bone cage display are OK in the set, their adequate, but it's just kind of generic, especially when compared to the sub itself. Now the addition of two divers and a shark was nice touch and affords some room for play time scenarios. The submersible, though, is the jewel of the set and everything about the sub looks marvellous. Everything looks good in this set as whole, and if you can afford to marry up either the smaller sets in the theme, or one of the larger then you have a great set piece and lastly this beauty, meaning the sub, can float and it floats real well!.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHYLDHG#wasThisHelpful","R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"-1519 and the Aztec Empire is at its zenith, their Empire is perhaps the most powerful in the America's, their `age' is dominated by human sacrifices. Although human sacrifice is practised throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs for their part took to this bloodthirsty practice to new levels of religious zeal. The architecture of the Aztec Empire is truly impressive, as can be seen by the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. For the Aztecs their decadence saw no bounds, as they seemed to have conquered all in their wake.When the Spanish appear on the scene, almost by magic, they appear in their fleet of strange looking sea faring vessels and land on the coast and begin their headlong journey into the Aztec hinterland. You get a feel for the way in which these, Europeans who are almost alien peoples to the Aztecs, sweep away all that oppose them. Corts and the rest of his Spanish invaders wield carnage and inflect defeat after defeat on the Aztecs, as they destroy in a few months an Empire that had been around for nearly one hundred years. For me, Mr Hancock artfully recreates the biggest clash of civilizations, revealing aspects that only a scholar in the field would have the knowledge to put together, couple this with his skill as a great story teller. Then throw into the mix the `characters on the ground', minor players in the history of the time.

"A nice affordable starter set in the series with many good details. The large dark red octopus looks amazing, and definitely does not disappoint. The diver has good detailing with a nice print diving suit, some of which is in bright silver. On the back and front there is black-and-red upper body, the figure has a red helmet, red flippers, a grey air tank, and a transparent light-blue diving mask.The yellow-and-grey scuba scooter has great detailing with rotating propellers, two harpoons and bendable arms which the diver can use to explore the sea floor and possibly to poke at the poor octopus. Lastly you have included in this set, is one light green seaweed-type plant on a round plate.All in all a nice little set on its own, or great point to start collecting and adding to new Lego City Explores set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC3KPUZ93AVPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHZ6ZR8#wasThisHelpful","RC3KPUZ93AVPK","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

".As a former arm chair general I have always been fascinated by the Rebels defeat at the battle for Hoth. The Imperial forces mainstay assault on the ground was the AT-AT Walkers, which seemed effective, although there were losses due to Luke Skywalkers ingenious counter attack.The AT-AT (please correct me if I am wrong) is the second edition produced by Lego. So my nephew and I went ahead and purchased this newer version. Much to our surprise, this unit is a huge improvement over the older version. The build quality is really solid, although the main command module at the front seems to be disproportionate, in size to the rest of the body. The Lines, of this significant battle unit, are nice and tight; the head unit is solid and won't come apart. The overall design is exceptional showing lots of detail.My nephew and I love the spring loaded laser guns; the projectiles can travel at least six metres. The inside of the body is bland; there is not real detail in there, but plenty of room to store a couple of imperial storm trooper mini-figures.We added the AT-AT to our Hoth battle scene simulation, and it was soon apparent that one AT-AT Walker was insufficient for an accurate demonstration on the field of battle. My Nephew informed me that either we would have to wait for Christmas, his birthday, or I could purchase the additional unit. My answer was short and to the point, I said that I only gave strategic advice  and my valuable time to help build the Hoth Lego simulation, financial assistance is not within my remit.Overall a good unit worthy of a good four stars..","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19N1TA03FPE5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1MM63E#wasThisHelpful","R19N1TA03FPE5F","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this stimulating comic allegory, Peter Sellers plays Chance who is brilliant as a slow-witted, innocent gardener who becomes destitute when his employer dies, as a former house cleaner of his said that that boy had rice budding between his ears and was short-changed by God. The gardener's only understanding of the world comes from watching television, for he had never been allowed to leave his home. As the narrative proceeds, the audience are shown that through an odd series of circumstances, Sellers ends up being a close personal advisor to the President of the United States (Jack Warden). His Nave pronouncements are professed as reflective insights, to such a degree that he is seriously considered as a Presidential contender.--------""Life is a state of mind""---------- (One of the pronouncements from the film) ------------Sellers made this film, a timeless comedy - but wittier than most of the comedy we see in film today. This performance is second, to maybe his role in Lolita and in the Pink Panther series, Sellers is not only funny, Sellers turns in one of his most skilled performances ever, in what would also be one of his last before his sudden death.Not matter how small your movie tastes are; this is a film that is really worth seeing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKXX0U47Z82JN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001IHJ988#wasThisHelpful","RKXX0U47Z82JN","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Possible SpoilersAn examination of sexual predator, which is framed against the locale of, post-Troubles Belfast. This is Where a cop has to deal with sectarian riots outside a murder scene. In addition, where a serial killer's painstaking plans can be confounded by Loyalist thugs?Dornan plays Paul Spector grief counsellor, former Samaritans voluntary helper and serial killer who is terrorising the city of Belfast. This series revolves around a PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) investigation in Belfast into a string of Murders. Detective Superintendent Gibson played by Gillian Anderson, who is on secondment from London's Metropolitan Police Service, heads the police investigation. This is a gripping cat-and-mouse series, where Dornan plays an intelligent, articulate - but deeply flawed character who gives into his deep dark desires, yet his misogyny seems rather selective or maybe he has a degree of self-control. Whatever, the case, vis--vis his predilections each episode of the five part episodes of this first season is a rather addictive to watch, as we see Detective Superintendent Gibson trying to find him and stop predatory killing spree. The provided Mise-en-scne of Belfast after the troubles, is none the less still a potential tinderbox, where sectarian gangs still hold sway. Some may be less satisfied by 'The Fall' finale - or feel that they were left hanging, whatever the case this series leaves enough mileage to run into season two.This series as with the first exhibits disturbing voyeurism, where the audience is placed in the uncomfortable position of watching the killer, as he carries out his perverse crimes. Unlike other shows in the genre, the audience is precluded from a synopsis of dangling different suspects to maintain suspense - as we already know the psychopath from the onset. The figure we are given is a humanised psychopath because the homicidal sadist was not some socially pathetic loser, but a softly spoken man called Paul Spector, with a wife and a loving daughter, and a career as a bereavement counsellor. The Fall, has been called the most popular drama in the last two decades (the in UK media) and has returned for series two very much as a slow burn thriller as opposed to a bang.This is a series that stands accused of misogyny, and of portraying the glamorisation violence against women. The first episode is set some 10 days after series one's unresolved, if not vexing, finale. The episode follows a prolonged hunt for a murder weapon in a Belfast river, and a hospital bed testimonial from Spector's half-strangled victim Annie Brawley, there is Spector's return from self-imposed exile. There are a total of six episodes in series two, for me a cleverly crafted series that on one level or another makes the viewer pretty uncomfortable - and poses some very disturbing questions about for example relationships, the effects of 'grooming' on children, as well as adults, and at times seems to come close to crossing the line - my humble opinion.---------------Review update 03/16/2015----------------------The BBC(UK) have announced that there is to be a season 3","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26FQEM9W54BV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7UKR7C#wasThisHelpful","R26FQEM9W54BV5","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".Both my partner and I were able to see this film at the 59th BFI London Film Festival in October 2014.Possible SpoilersThe Duke of Burgundy is not really for fans of soft-core naughtiness.Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna) is a housekeeper in the employ of Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen, best known for playing the Danish Prime Minister in the television political drama Borgen), a keen collector of butterflies and moths who lectures at a local institute. On first impressions the dynamic seems straightforward where we seem to have curt and dominating employer with a somewhat submissive employee. While the premise of the narrative is their relationship and it's changing dynamic, there is a fair amount of close up filming, as well as specialist audio, relating to the topic of Lepidoptera, which is interesting - although both my partner and I were lost on the symbolism.This film can be unpromising and deeply sensual while it explores the formalised but affectionate realms of fetishism. There is not a bit of nudity and most of the sexual acts are behind closed doors, or obscured by soft-focus. You, the viewer, are left with the audio and your imagination to fill in the `gaps'. The camera work, is at times soft focused, well lit and almost filmed in style that would be recognised from the 1970s.The scenes are further enhanced with mood and at times otherworldly setting music. Nevertheless, between those scenes it has an oddball sense of humour. It is a grounded film, and has dry humour - one where we are laughing at them for their sexual quirks rather than with them. Such as during an anxious discussion about the construction times of various extravagant bondage apparatus, the would-be creator of these imaginative contrivances is played by Fatma Mohamed, who offers, for the purposes of saving build time, the rapid construction of one gadget and suggests: ""Would a human toilet be of interest?"" There is a lot to appreciate here, mainly with the bold performances, the dress and lingerie by Andrea Flesch and it does raise thought-provoking ideas about the subtleties of control in relationships and sexual fulfilment. For this couple live in their own enclosed world and seem to only venture out to attend talks by the self-important Dr Schuller due to their mutual interest in entomology.For this viewer the film was more a fable-like tale of two people locked into what looks like an ailing S&M relationship, but boiled down in its constituents it's about a relationship, based on trust and love. I am sure That Duke of Burgundy will certainly have its critics - but who cares?.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J7Y80XD2SWWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTSH21Y#wasThisHelpful","R2J7Y80XD2SWWX","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".Possible SpoilersWe saw this film at the London Film Festival October 2014 (in the Love Gala section).Kate Winslet (Sabine De Barra) plays a landscape gardener employed by King Louis XIV, via the chief gardener Andr Le Ntre (Matthias Schoenaerts) to design a fountain that will be a centre piece of the gardens at Versailles. Her boss is a man who prizes order above all. Sabine is the breath of fresh air that the stuffy geometry of Versailles needs. To gain her position she needs to overcome gender politics, where her skills are belittled, by her so called colleagues, who see her invading their work place. This unfortunate theme continues, although she is soon charming all she meets and innovating with fresh approaches to horticulture. Never the less, Sabine struggles with class barriers as she becomes romantically entangled with the court's renowned landscape artist."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Stanley Tucci is in fine glitzy form """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""This is a narrative where there is scheming at the Court of King Louis XIV, a vipers nest of gossip and shenanigans, where Helen McCrory is bristling with predatory feline feel as a woman who believes she is scorned and thus holds great resentment towards Sabine. There is much for the viewer to take in, with colourful back drops, and the even more colourful characters of the court. Rickman himself plays King Louis XIV, the Sun King at Versailles, with a dry befuddlement. Stanley Tucci is in fine glitzy form. This is a film, which at its core deals with women and their relationships. Winslets Sabine is a woman fraught with her own inner demons, as well as the world at large. This then is a film that has its detractors, although my partner and I thought the film was an enjoyable fun period piece  and believe it is worth seeing..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWF690ON2SKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7R9FWQ#wasThisHelpful","RCWF690ON2SKJ","A3RMEU4GNP60BM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RMEU4GNP60BM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
".Possible spoilersAs season 2 comes into its own, as ever Penny Dreadful, continues to provide sumptuous sets and gothic atmosphere. This is a season, where Helen McCrory comes to the fore; she plays the head of a Lucifer-worshipping coven, her singular mission to deliver Vanessa (Eva Green) to the Prince of Darkness. I am still at loss to understand the role of Reeve Carney as Dorian Gray, as his character continues to indulge his carnal needs. While Harry Treadaway as Dr Victor Frankenstein continues to have problems of his, with his two creations Lily Frankenstein and Rory Kinnear as The Creature, his first creation that loathes his creator for numerous reasons.This is season where we see some of Vanessas back-story. Timothy Dalton as Sir Malcolm Murray seems to go off the rails, with a little help from Helen McCrorys character. Danny Sapani as Sembene, a long-time assistant of Sir Malcolm, his main role, as ever, still remains a mystery. While Josh Hartnett as Ethan Chandler becomes more Canis lupus during certain lunar phases.While not a central character, Simon Russell Beale as Ferdinand Lyle, an Egyptologist with an unhealthy interest in the occult and a certain duplicity when it comes to his friends, - at times his character is a real scene stealer. There are other characters of interest, but enough on the spoilers front, return to the tenets of the seasons narrative. The story telling as ever, is unhurried in nature.

"Probably the biggest annoyance of the PS4 is the lack of good remote control options for dvd/bluray watching. Sure, you can use the dualshock but good luck trying to remember the button functions and by all means, avoid bumping it causing unintentional skips and spoiler alerts.

"I have 3 kids that are in varying stages of train track building ability so I was able to get a good gauge for how well this toy works.My thoughts:-EZ track is a very good idea as it does make it easier for little kids to get going and is much easier to clean up also.-The EZ track does not hold together securely. The yellow attachments are too easily pulled apart by my 2 year old.-The EZ track is only long enough for a single small oval. Even the most enthusiastic child will get bored of it pretty quickly.-Pedestals are lightweight and flimsy which means they are hard to position and fall over easily. A child who needs the EZ track won't be able to use the pedestals.-Trains are large-sized and decent quality but nothing special.-Includes enough single track pieces to complete a figure 8 but not enough pieces to really get creative.-All the track pieces look great with impressively detailed graphics.CONCLUSIONYou are basically paying a lot of money for a small oval-sized EZ track. The other pieces included are things you can get much cheaper in any generic train set.This toy tries to make it easy for a child who has difficulty putting a track together. However, the toy still tries to cater to more advanced kids by throwing in a limited number of pedestals and separate track pieces. This leads to a product that doesn't work well for either child demographic. There aren't enough EZ tracks for a beginner child and not enough single pieces for an advanced child. All this wouldn't be so bad if the price was far cheaper (currently $50) so that getting multiple kits wouldn't put you into poverty. As it is, other train kits offer far more pieces for far less money which outweighs the benefit of the EZ track.This product would be better if it had gone all-in on the EZ track idea by including multiple EZ tracks and skipping the pedestals and single track pieces entirely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N46096IJ9U3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV0SS7W#wasThisHelpful","R3N46096IJ9U3J","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm pleased that Yamaha is entering the whole-home audio market as I've been happy with my Yamaha receivers over the years including the Yamaha RX-A3050 with MusicCast.DESIGN-I have the white finish which looks good with its brushed metal accents - a good fit for a modern house.-The cabinet shape is a bit bland.SOUND QUALITY-Not superb, but pretty good for such a small speaker. The clarity and crispness of vocals is not great but acceptable. Not much bass but that's expected in a speaker this size. The volume can fill a large room reasonably well.-Most will be happy with the sound quality. Audiophiles probably will not.MUSICCAST APP-Fairly intuitive and straightforward to use.-Allows independent volume adjustments for each speaker,-Linking speakers is easy to allow for simultaneous play. I have this WX-030 speaker linked to my RX-A3050. My testing revealed that playback on multiple speakers had no delay which allows you to put speakers as close together as you want.-I was unable how to configure my speaker to use my wired connection instead of wifi. Not a big deal as most people will use wifi.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIONFunctions very well as a bluetooth speaker for your phone. Any phone media (podcasts, Google Music, etc.) can be streamed to the speaker. However, you can't stream your phone media via your wifi network unless the music files are actually stored on your phone. This means I can't use Google Music or Podcast Addict unless I am bluetooth connected.An interesting feature: If you are bluetooth connected to one speaker, your music can simultaneously play in other speakers in the house that are not bluetooth connected. Nice.WHOLE HOME AUDIO via HOME NETWORK (wifi)The benefit of a home network connection vs bluetooth is the significantly larger range of the home network. Assuming your wifi mojo is strong, you can take your phone anywhere in your home and not lose connection to the speaker.If you are a Google Music user or just want unfettered ability to stream any phone media, MusicCast will not give you whole home audio. If you are on Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody, Airplay, or Sirius, then you are good to go. If you have mp3s/playlists on your computer or phone, you are also fine.CONCLUSIONLife would be much easier if a whole-home audio solution allowed all phone media to be streamed to the speakers. Unfortunately with the MusicCast (and the Denon Heos which I also tested), we aren't quite there yet. If you are a Google Music user like me, then the MusicCast system requires you to be within bluetooth range which is a severe limitation.If you are totally fine with one of the supported music apps or are happy streaming local files, then the MusicCast system is a great choice. This WX-030 speaker in particular is a worthy product at an excellent price point considering it includes both wifi and bluetooth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSMLCWJA335Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01429SJL6#wasThisHelpful","R3KSMLCWJA335Y","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I also own the Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 and will do some comparisons.AESTHETICS-The K830 looks modern and elegant with its brushed metal accents on the front and back. Even the font on the keyboard looks decidedly modern which is a nice touch.-The K400 is ugly in comparison.TYPING-The K830 keys are not concave but rather perfectly flat. The keys are also silky smooth which makes it a bit slippery. All this means it can be slightly difficult to keep your fingers in the correct position. Not a big deal if you are only doing minimal typing on it.-The K400 feels easier to type on because the keys are concave with a slight texture.IN THE DARK-The K830 illuminated keys look great in the dark. Unfortunately, there should be illumination of the touchpad and touchpad buttons.-If you have a home theater or a very dark environment, the illumination makes the K830 the obvious choice over the K400.BATTERY LIFE-The K830 is rechargeable with standard micro-usb and lasts 1 year without backlighting and 10 days (2hrs/day) with backlighting. This will be fine for most people.-The K400 uses 2 AA's.CONCLUSIONThe K830 stands out with its modern beauty and illumination. It's a great choice for a dedicated home theater. If the keys held your fingers slightly better and the touchpad was illuminated, it would be perfect. If you don't need the illumination or want to save some money, the K400 is a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103EHU8AMP55N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOPVSKW#wasThisHelpful","R103EHU8AMP55N","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does the MotionSense work? Yes, but there are some negatives.PROS-Installation was straightforward and easy. The motion sense contraption adds minimal difficulty to the installation.-Love how it is battery operated and the batteries are included. Batteries supposedly last 1 year.-Having both the top sensor and the front sensor is very convenient. Both are reliably responsive within about a half a second.-MotionSense works pretty well if you let it run through the setup process properly. The range reaches just to the faucet output. Hands will trigger the sensor but clear plastic bottles don't.CONS-Build quality is average. Metal thickness is on the lightweight side. Disappointingly in this price range, the pull-down nozzle is made of chromed plastic. I currently use Hansgrohe Talis S  and Hansgrohe Axor Starck which are made of heavier gauge metal and have a metal pull-down nozzle.-There is no hot/cold indicator on the faucet. This is a surprising oversight.-The sprayer button can only activate the spray. It can't deactivate it. You can't change back to full flow unless you turn off the faucet.-Faucet arc is fixed at about 150 degrees which works for most people. Hansgrohe gives the option of a 150 or 180 arc with each faucet.-On full cold, the handle sticks a couple inches out into the sink area which can get accidentally bumped by large pots and pans.CONCLUSIONIf motion sensors are what you want, this faucet is pretty good. However, there are drawbacks compared to other faucets at this price point. If you don't care about the motion sensing, you'll do better with the Hansgrohe Talis S or Hansgrohe Axor Starck.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LBZ1KZCIKOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VT2RXDU#wasThisHelpful","R3LBZ1KZCIKOQ","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way back in the day, I got an Asus eeePC because of its low cost and compact size. It served its purpose as a simple, internet device. This HP laptop is reminiscent of that eeePC.BUILD QUALITY-The all plastic construction feels rigid and durable. Screen does not flex much.-Keys are solidly responsive.-Overall, impressive build for this price point.TOUCHPAD-Nicely responsive. Comparable to most touchpads I've used.-Uses hidden hard-click buttons which can be problematic as you don't know exactly where the left and right buttons are. You must click way to the far right to activate the right button. Dedicated hard buttons are preferable.FORM FACTOR-It's a very thick, heavy laptop.-Using it as a tablet is not a good experience because it is extra thick with the keyboard folded back. If you need a viable tablet option, look for a laptop with a removable keyboard like the Surface Pro.AESTHETICS-Despite the chunky size, it is quite attractive.-The wedge shape on the front and back makes for a sleek look while the metallic, white finish and mirrored HP logo give this laptop a luxury, modern look.-Overall, it looks like a high-end device.SCREEN-The large bezels (~1"" on all sides) make the screen look smaller than it actually is.-Contrast ratio of the screen is poor but still perfectly acceptable for internet use and viewing casual photos.-Resolution and sharpness is below average. Pixels are subtly visible in text and pictures. No dealbreakers here but you aren't getting ""retina""-level resolution like with higher end tablets and smartphones.-Tapping the screen causes it to vibrate significantly. The screen hinge could be a lot stronger.SOUND-Quite good. You can definitely enjoy youtube music videos on it. Lacks any semblance of bass but that's to be expected in a laptop.PRELOADED SOFTWARE (aka JUNKWARE)-I hate preloaded software on my computer which is one reason I build my own desktops. Thankfully, HP kept preloads to a relative minimum.-McAfee antivirus is preinstalled with a free ""trial"". Evernote, Avast Security, WildTangent Games are hidden.-I immediately uninstalled all these programs using the Windows control panel. (Search for ""remove programs"" if you're as confused by Win10's control panel as I am).OVERALLThis HP is reminiscent of the eeePC which I have fond feelings for. You are getting a totally, functional internet device at a fantastic price point. Simple computing tasks like word processing are also well-suited for this HP. The nice build quality and aesthetics belie the low price.You don't want to be doing hard-core computing tasks like GIMP, Sketchup, etc given its processor limitations.If you want more processing power, a better screen, or a thinner, lighter form, consider a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 or Surface Pro 4. I've been using the Surface Pro 3 for many months and it is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30D20PPBTT29R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KKFEPC#wasThisHelpful","R30D20PPBTT29R","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have an Asian face, you know how difficult it can be to find sunglasses that sit on the nose bridge while avoiding contact with the eyelashes and cheeks. In my entire life, I have only been able to find 1 other sunglasses that have fit well (Nike Skylon old model that was discontinued years ago.)These ""Asian fit"" sunglasses fit great. The scooped out lenses allow clearance for the cheeks. The nose bridge protrudes out far enough for low nose bridges. The arms are plenty wide enough with a nice curve to prevent any pinching or tightness.Construction quality is excellent. They look good too.Overall, these sunglasses are expensive but totally worth it if you have trouble finding ones that fit.I also tried many of the other Oakley Asian fit models (Radar Pitch, Radar Path, Flak Jacket (non XLJ), Half Jacket 2.0) and none of them fit as well as these Flak Jacket XLJ Asian Fit.Note: Make sure that the glasses you receive are labeled Asian Fit. I ordered a white version from seller Extreme Supply and it was NOT the Asian fit model and fit completely differently.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXT17O7TCBPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016OCHFK#wasThisHelpful","RIXT17O7TCBPB","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is of the bluetooth version:I typically use Logitech keyboards which all require the little usb receiver. I sometimes wish that I could forgo the receiver and just use bluetooth. I build all my computers myself and use Asus motherboards with integrated wifi/bluetooth.Pairing with my computer bluetooth was incredibly fast and easy. I was up and typing within seconds.Pairing with my Samsung Note 4 was just as easy. Again, I was typing within seconds.-Keys are comfortable.-Key travel is pretty minimal like a laptop computer.-Keyboard is very thin and low profile.-Keep in mind that this is a full-size keyboard so it is pretty wide (17.5"").

It only takes seconds.Comparison to Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System which I have used for weeks.-Panasonic takes much longer to get all the hairs because the blade is hidden behind a guard with only a few perforations for hair to get through. The Norelco has more exposed blade area which requires fewer passes. To put this in a time perspective, the Panasonic would take about 60 seconds to trim nose hair; the Norelco, 10 seconds.-Both trim comfortably with minimal to no pain.-The Panasonic has a wider, blunter tip so which is good if you are prone to shoving things too far up your nose.-Overall, the Norelco is superior because it is so much faster and more efficient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBK1UVY06P3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSK9E#wasThisHelpful","RXBK1UVY06P3L","A2507ZYWGMY9BK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2507ZYWGMY9BK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a dress-up toy that bridges the gap between cheap paper and expensive dolls, this TS Shure set is a decent option.Overall construction quality is mediocre. Using the term ""wooden"" to describe it is a bit misleading in the same way paper shouldn't be described as made of wood. The pieces are made of a dense, fibrous, cardboard-like material and bend easily. They will not stand up to abuse. The magnets are weak but are good enough if characters are laid flat. The carrying case is flimsy and doesn't hold the pieces well.Despite the negatives, this set is a decent value given the reasonable price of <20 dollars.

"Not adhering to the official motherboard ""qualified vendor list"" is playing with fire. Sometimes you won't get burned, but don't even try this ram with the Asus X99 Pro.

"I raise miniature sheep and have been testing the Myfox Wi-Fi Security Camera in the barn.

No coyotes yet but I've tested it several times and it works perfectly.The other camera is aimed inside the pen where all 10 miniature sheep sleep. This has been especially important for me when I am on vacation: It provides piece of mind that the people I hired to care for the sheep in my absence are doing all of the tasks I've arranged for them to do.I know this is an unconventional use of the Myfox security camera but it has met a huge need for me and I love it.

"I've been battle-testing the Char-Broil Charcoal Kettle Grill for the past month and it's by far the easiest to use grill I've ever owned. And I've own quite a few.I love the hinged lid... where to place a super-hot lid has always been a pain with other round grills and the people at Char-Broil hit a home run with this feature. I also like the over-sized vent on top, which lets me heat things up cool temps down fast.The porcelain-enameled cooking grate is also instrumental in evenly distributing heat. I've found that I need about 25% less charcoal on average due in part to this added efficiency. By positioning the coals in a ring or to one side, I'm able to low smoke pork shoulder for excellent pulled pork. That has been a family favorite this summer.This grill has so far been a huge hit with my family and I recommend it for yours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0H0676CVPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O06YMGI#wasThisHelpful","R3M0H0676CVPM","A379DLIAF0MFM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A379DLIAF0MFM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been testing the PDP AG7 True Wireless Headset for Xbox One for a few weeks. The first truly wireless headset that I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable -- even with my large head. All of the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It connects automatically so you don't have to struggle with those awkward BlueTooth connection processes.One feature I especially LOVE is the separate dials for Chat and overall game volume. No more messing about with the plus or minus tabs trying to strike a balance. The PDP AG7 gives you the control to dial down (or up) chat with a dial. The same with game volume.The overall sound during gameplay is amazing. I can now hear when enemies are behind, to the left or right -- or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound.The on/off button is on the outside of the left hear piece. Just tap during game play to mute your microphone.The only ding for the PDP AG7 is that the mic is way too sensitive. It picks up everything -- the ceiling fan included in my case. I wish the mic were only calibrated to picking up your voice. Not a huge deal but annoying. Also, when you mute yourself the tip of the microphone (which is blue or red (extra bass)) flashes periodically to let you know you're on mute. I could see it out of the corned or my left eye (even when retracted) so I put a little piece of duct tape on it. Problem solved.Overall though this is by far the best headset for Xbox One I've come across. Comfortable. Excellent sound -- and truly wireless.

Because while the earphone looks huge and like it would block out all other sound - it is light, comfortable and enables me to hear everything normally (as though I weren't even wearing it).Best of all it puts the chat into a single speaker, which I am used to from back in the Xbox 360 days. It's simple, easy to use -- and it works. Two thumbs up from me.

"I've tested the Little Griddle Kettle-Q KQ17R Round Griddle on my round Char-Broil Kettleman as well as my more traditionally shaped Master Forge grill/smoker. So don't limit use to the recommended round grills is my advice. Once the griddle is hot, just add olive oil and throw on some veggies. My favorites to cook on the Little Griddle Kettle-Q are asparagus, green beans, mushrooms, garlic. I have been using two metal spatulas and found this system to work the best.I also grill up delicious burgers using a bacon press. For steaks, I still prefer the traditional grill but have finished up ribeyes on the griddle to give it that extra seared goodness. I've also had great success with hash browns.I'm still exploring new foods to cook up with the  Little Griddle Kettle-Q. It's like having a diner griddle at your disposal on your BBQ.

"Last summer an age spot appeared on my cheek and it really bothered me when I looked into the mirror. My doctor confirmed that it wasn't cancerous... just a ""sun spot"" she called it (I like that term better). :)I started using Nia 24 Rapid Depigmentation Serum a few weeks ago and the hated spot is indeed fading! I have been using a small amount on my entire face each night but add a bit extra to the spot. It is a very gradual process so I am looking forward to the day when the spot is gone. As I get older I am making sure to slow the visible effects of aging as much as possible (without surgery) and the Nia 24 serum is now part of my daily regiment.

Their verdict: Delicious!In this short video review they are eating, for the first time, the shredded natural salmon. We slowly introduced them to this variety of Hill's with the shredded natural chicken; and then the shredded natural beef the following week. We always mix the boys' (as we call them) wet food with dry. In this video we used Hill's Science Diet Adult Advanced Fitness Small Bites dry food.

"The Polk Audio Striker Zx is the third and by far the best gaming headset for Xbox One.Here's why:* Comfortable. I have a huge head (7 5/8) and this headset is light and fully encloses my ears.* Sound. The audio is amazing. Clear, crisp and I can hear every detail (for example, shell casings falling to being me to the right). This enables me to detect enemies and eliminate them in the heat of gaming battle (Titanfall, Call of Duty).* Mic. The boom microphone tucks in when not on Xbox Box Live (or when you don't feel like chatting there). When in use, this mic performs perfectly. It even broadcasts a little bit of your own voice (like old-fashioned telephones) which eliminates the ""talking inside a bubble"" effect. I can hear people well and they tell me my voice comes through loud and clear, too.* No battery. Since the Polk Audio Striker Zx connects directly to your controller, there is no need to worry about another battery. I haven't noticed a significant drain on the handset battery.Dings* The only ding is in my opinion an Xbox One software issue. And that is that periodically (maybe once every three hours of game play) the sound cuts out for a few seconds. I have seen this occur in the other 2 headsets I've tested for Xbox One that do not use a separate base station (connect directly to the controller).If you've been looking for an exceptional headset for your Xbox One, you've found it with the Polk Audio Striker Zx.

"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera.

My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots.

"I work from home full time and I've been testing the Holmes HAP9240-NWU HEPA-Type Desktop Air Purifier for several weeks. I have extremely bad allergies, particularly to tree pollens and weeds. And now that spring has sprung here in central Ohio, I am seeing the benefits of the Holmes desktop air purifier.The unit rests on a small table next to my desk and it is so quiet on the lowest setting that I can barely hear it over the wrrrrr of the two computers running each workday. My wife and I have been using a larger Holmes HEPA air purifier in our bedroom for a couple of years and that's when I really learned the value of these machines.The desktop version, like it's big brother, has two filers: one HEPA and another sponge-like carbon filter. I haven't had to change either yet but based on my experience with the larger version, the carbon filters generally last one month and the HEPA anywhere from 4-6 months.I did test removing and replacing both filters in the Holmes desktop air purifier and it only takes a few seconds. Fast and easy like the larger version. I've also been using the ionizer but haven't noticed a difference with it on or off. I believe it's designed mainly to mitigate smoke.While early yet in allergy season the Holmes HAP9240-NWU HEPA-Type Desktop Air Purifier is keeping my eyes and sinuses clear -- two thumbs up from this allergy sufferer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8NTZ4GNEIML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDTKEE6#wasThisHelpful","R2D8NTZ4GNEIML","A379DLIAF0MFM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A379DLIAF0MFM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My indoor flood-lights just got skinny! I tested 2 of these lights in our kitchen, which has several recessed lights using traditional 65-Watt indoor flood-light bulbs. Upon first opening the package I was doubtful that the Philips SlimStyle bulbs would 1) fit and 2) match the rest of the lights. To my surprise, they did on both counts!I replaced 2 of the kitchen lights with the Philips SlimStyle and asked my wife if she could tell which ones were the new bulbs. She wasn't able to even tell the difference! The thinness reminds me of those old TV westerns that used thin store fronts along main street -- props with nothing on the other side. The only difference is that these thin light bulbs deliver the goods, too.It is not easy finding a good, dimmable LED light bulb. I've tested several brands and the light is too white -- overwhelms and creates a bleached out look. The Philips SlimStyle delivers here with a more natural light that matches the light from our traditional 65-Watt indoor flood-light bulbs.A closer look at light qualityI couldn't tell a difference between traditional 65-Watt indoor flood-light bulbs and the Philips SlimStyle bulbs. However, compared to another (65-Watt equivalent) LED flood-light (of another brand, which was traditionally shaped), the light from the Philips had a slight yellow hue. When looking at them side by side, I preferred the slightly softer yellowish hue to the extreme white light of the other (65-Watt equivalent) LED bulb.I'm slowly replacing all of the lights in my home with LED bulbs and now the Philips SlimStyle bulbs are on my shopping list for our 65-Watt indoor flood-light bulb replacements.

"Our family has two large dogs, both rescues. We were using a different dog food so gradually introduced increasing portions of Natural Balance's Potato and Duck Formula to their bowls. They are generally finicky but both love this new dog food. And my wife and I love it because of the wholesome ingredients and the fact that it's made in the USA and not imported. I called Natural Balance (there is an 800 number on the bag) and spoke with customer care - the rep told me that all of their products are made in the United States. I think Natural Balance's marketing team should emphasize this fact (just some advice).Our larger dog, 108-pound Hachi, has skin allergies so we appreciate that the dog food is also grain-free (we switched to another grain-free food some months ago and it did seem to reduce his symptoms). The first three ingredients are: Potatoes, duck meal and duck. There is also salmon oil for Omega 3, a natural source of DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for normal metabolism and DHA is the most complex form of Omega-3. DHA is difficult to include in the diets of dogs (and people) because few foods contain a significant amount.I highly recommend Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Lid Potato and Duck Formula Dry Dog Food (that's a mouthful to say) and our two dogs both give it two paws up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBVP4SDI4EVY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR99CL8#wasThisHelpful","RBVP4SDI4EVY6","A379DLIAF0MFM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A379DLIAF0MFM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My household has several OXO products and we like the brand because it's one we can trust to deliver quality, value and a good price. The 10-piece OXO Knife Block Set delivers here again and includes all the knifes that a regular family needs.The wood block has an interesting design, presenting the knifes at an angle that makes them easier to access. Though the the paring knife (the smallest knife) does sit a bit awkwardly in front of the four steak knifes. It's not a big ding but it is a little harder to select that one.I tested all of the knifes and have also sharpened each (even though they didn't need sharpening - I just wanted to see how they'd do because in the past I've ruined some low-cost knifes this way). I used ""Smith's Adjustable Manual Knife Sharpener"" because it has three slots (coarse, serrated and fine) and a dial to select sharpening angle - with a chart of common angles (filet knifes, for example, suggested at 16 degrees).All of the knifes sharpened up nicely - even the steak knifes, which I would usually never even think about sharpening. The handles are comfortable and designed to provide a sure grip - classic OXO. Really love that.The instructions recommend hand washing but I've had them through the dish washer a few times and they didn't come out any worse for wear. Unless you are a professional chef, the OXO Knife Block Set is all your family will need (unless you have more than four steak eaters) for preparing any meal.

"I'm just getting back into shape after several years (just joined the local family YMCA with my wife a couple weeks ago). I've always been a strong swimmer but have always had trouble keeping the proper breathing cadence when doing laps (via the crawl). Breathing was even more difficult now, years later, when I am in horrible shape (comparatively).I was thinking, ""I wish I could invent a snorkel that would let me breath while swimming..."" then did a search on Amazon and found the FINIS Swimmer's Snorkel. I love it! My wife told me I look ridiculous with my ""fancy swimming apparatus"" but I'm nearly 50 years old so what do I care what anyone else thinks? :) Without the snorkel I can swim 10 laps (Olympic-size pool); with it I can put in 20 right off the bat. (I should add that I'm also using the Finis Zoomer Z2 Gold Fins - I love those, too!) I highly recommend them to use with this snorkel.One more item I recommend is nose plugs. I've never used them before - and I've been snorkeling literally hundreds of times over the years. But since I am going so fast (well, it seems fast to me) while swimming laps with the FINIS snorkel and fins, water was going up my nose more than I cared for. So I added ""Harmony Smiley's Nose Plugs."" The trio is a swimming trifecta (well, for me, anyhow) and now I'm working on extending my workout to 30 laps within the next 30 days. LOVE this snorkel.

However, our dogs do not like going into their crates (they sleep on the sofa for the most part at night - crate doors left open), so a ""treat"" is always required to convince them to get inside.Skip, our 75-pound 2-year-old yellow lab-mix, has been getting particularly finicky about treats lately and we had been having a tough time getting him to ""take the bait"" as it were. So I was excited to test Natural Balance LIT Jumpin' Stix treats for Amazon. He loves them so much he will actually take them into the crate to eat them! (We usually have to put the treat into the crate first). Our other dog, Hachi (1.5 years old; 105 pound golden retriever-mix) also loves them but he will pretty much eat anything. :-)Since both of our dogs are large, I will continue to offer them Natural Balance Jumpin' Stix treats because they contain glucosamine and chondroitin to help support healthy hips and joints. I was also happy to see they are made in the U.S.A. and don't contain any grains: no corn, soy or wheat. (Hachi has skin allergies and we think it might be wheat-related).NOTE: On the package it says: ""Packed in pride in the USA."" I wanted to ensure they were actually ""made"" in the USA (and not China) so I called the 1-800 number on the package and spoke with a Natural Balance customer care representative who confirmed that these treats are indeed MADE in USA - specifically in Utah.And one final aside, I remember watching Dick Van Patten's television show ""Eight is Enough"" when I was a kid in the late '70s. I googled him the other day and was happy to see he's still alive and active. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVJZIFUNRCD7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWAEVA8#wasThisHelpful","RVJZIFUNRCD7W","A379DLIAF0MFM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A379DLIAF0MFM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:46 MinsMy short video review shows the TP-LINK Power Bank in action. But as I was testing it for this review I recalled the many, many occasions when, away from home, my iPhone would die (how frustrating) or when on a plane... having my Kindle's battery run dry before the end of a movie. Those days are gone thanks to devices like the TP-LINK Power Bank. This one is on the heavier side but it is solid and works very well. In addition to iOS and Android devices - I was also able to charge my digital camera.Two thumbs up but please watch my short video for details -- and feel free to ask question in the comments section.

" 4:18 MinsWhen I first started testing the BLU Studio 5.0 LTE, as a long-time iPhone user, I must admit my expectations were not high. I use AT&T as my wireless carrier and because the BLU Studio 5.0 LTE is unlocked, I simply ejected my the SIM card from my iPhone 4 and inserted it into the BLU. Connecting to my wireless network was also fast and easy. I also added a 32GB Micro SD card for storing more apps, photos and videos. It took about 2 minutes to insert both cards - then I powered up the phone, and after the initial setup, was off and running.My short video review will provide more details (along a snippet of the phone's video footage featuring our dogs). But in summary:Pros:Big, clear and bright screen. This makes the BLU Studio 5.0 LTE idea for...* Using as a GPS device (I have a smartphone holder attached to the inside of my windshield). I've been using Google Maps and it is better than my old navigation device. It even ""talks"" you through the directions. I love that feature!* Watching videos (Netflix, ""Dish Anywhere"" [Slingbox], etc. Note: Does not (at this time) support Amazon Prime Instant Videos* Excellent camera - with 2 lenses, one for filming and the other for reversing it to film/photograph you. The camera has a few cool settings, which include the following options:- HDR (High Dynamic Range)- Various picture size options (the size photos I take are usually 3,200 x 2,400 pixels)- You can choose where to store photos and videos - on the device or on your (optional) Mirco SD card (not included)- There are more options (Histogram, Picture Quality, ZSL, face detection, color effect, saturation, contrast, sharpness, auto exposure, redeye reducer, countdown timer.... and more)- Panoramic Mode (which is very cool)- Video: With up to 6X zoom- Photos and videos can be automatically sent to your cloud-based storage (DropBox, OneDrive, etc)* Auto-switches between 4G and 3G depending on availability* No typing (in many cases) needed. You can dictate map coordinates, Google searches - even emails! Just click the microphone icon and speak. Works very, very well.* Case and screen protector included* Headphones includedCons:* No visual voicemail (like the iPhone has). You can see the number of voice messages, but have no idea who they are from, so you have to slog through all of them one by one.* Doesn't support Amazon Prime Instant Videos (yet)* No native sync with iPhoto; though there is an app called ""iSyncr4Mac"" that does an excellent job of accessing/syncing iTunes.* It is a huge phone so takes up quite a bit of pocket space - though it is thin, about the same thickness of my iPhone 4.Conclusion: I love the BLU Studio 5.0 LTE and it has replaced my iPhone 4. I haven't looked back! I hope this review helps but please see the video more.

"I tested the 3M Black Privacy Filter on my Samsung XE303C12 11.6in Chromebook - the concept is good: it's always a good idea to take precautions when using a laptop/tablet in public spaces like coffee shops, airports, etc.You must choose between one of two sides of the filter BEFORE the first use:* The ""matte"" side (sort of a ""rough"" surface) is described as cutting down on glare if you are near a window.* The ""glossy"" (smooth) side is described as providing better image clarity.I tested both sides and from my Chromebook's small screen I couldn't tell much (if any) between either side.Pros:* Excellent protection of the contents of the screen - you have to view the screen straight on, otherwise all that is viewable is blackness.Cons:* Adhesive strips: You must choose between using the ""Matte"" or ""Glossy"" side... once you decide you are stuck with that side. I suggest using little pieces of scotch tape and not the long adhesive strips. Then you'd at least be able to reverse it.* It darkens the screen quite a bit when looking straight on. A bit too much....* Once the blue adhesive strip applicator is removed you can see the adhesive on the edges of the screen (through the filter).* It's heavy and has fallen off a few times. Also, I am pretty sure the adhesive will soon wear out and I'll have to use scotch tape to hold it in placeConclusion: I'd pass on the 3M Privacy Filter - unless you absolutely must ensure privacy for one or two occasions. It is heavy, falls off and you'll need scotch tape before too long. It also darkens the screen too much for my needs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY29AFNRNKTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSU4NZY#wasThisHelpful","R1TY29AFNRNKTH","A379DLIAF0MFM5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A379DLIAF0MFM5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tested an assortment of bluetooth speakers over the years but none of them match the small footprint and BIG ""vibrant"" sound of the 2014 Boombot REX. The sound is rich and you can literally ""feel"" the beat. I've never heard such excellent sound from a speaker this small.I tested the Boombot in a rainstorm on our desk (with iPhone safe in pocket) and true to the claims, it performed just as well (though much harder to hear over the rain). No noticeable damage and it dried out fine.I went to college in the '80s and I had to carry a big, heavy boombox to the  lake or to the gym. While that giant old boombox assuredly delivered more volume I would have much preferred to have had this small Boombot just for the tremendous convenience. While it does fit into the pocket of my cargo shorts, I wouldn't dub the Boombot REX officially ""pocket-sized,"" though it can clip onto a belt or strap (messenger bag strap, for example).There are also a few optional accessories available: the one that most appeals to me is the handlebar mount kit for rides along our local creekside bike path. A coupon for ""10 points"" is included in the box for use in purchases from the company's website. You can also earn point by posting photos on Instagram with hashtag #BOOMBOTIX.

The device does not come charged so plan on charging it for 2 hours prior to use. It comes with a micro USB charging cable but you'll need to connect it to a computer or have one of those small cube thingies that plug into an electrical outlet and have a slot for the USB. One of those is also available for sale (or points) on the Boombot website. An auxiliary cable is also included to use when Bluetooth isn't an option and a physical connection is required.The battery life is impressive - so far the longest I've blasted out tunes was an hour and it never ran out of steam. And again, this little box puts on some big sound. It's not enough for a party but it's perfect for ""individual use"" as my wife calls it.

"I have been a fan of ""Mommie Dearest"" since seeing it on video in 1982 a year after its release. The movie is what made me a Joan Crawford fan and a fan of camp films. Over the past 30 plus years, however, there have been rumblings that this was an extremely hard film to make and it was difficult on the actors, writers, director and other crew members. What I realized was the film was so hard to work on because of Faye Dunaway. I have never yet heard anyone from that movie say she was a joy to work with, yet people remained closed mouthed about Dunaway. That is until now!! A few months back I heard that Rutanya Alda was writing a book on the making of ""Mommie Dearest"" with the title to be called ""The Mommie Dearest Diary"". The title is derived from the fact that Rutanya (who played Joan's housekeeper/companion Carol Ann) kept a daily journal while making the film. There is a lot of amazing things in this book and I don't want to reveal anything, but let's just say I read the book in one setting! If you think you know what really happened behind the scenes of this film you don't. Rutanya proves she is an extraordinary writer and I want to thank her for her honesty and bravery in writing such a compelling book. Thank you Rutanya!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TCOSZXFD5M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515260607#wasThisHelpful","R2TCOSZXFD5M6","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Angela Basset received her directorial debut making the film that was a partial documentation on Whitney Houston's life. The movie is nowhere near as good as a film for HBO or theaters (it was shot for Lifetime TV), but it is still a good dramatization of one of the greatest stars ever, The movie deals with the difficult relationship between Whitney and husband Bobbi Brown, Whitney's battle with cocaine (way before Bobbi enter her life) and the destruction of her marriage due to Bobbi's alcoholism and Whitney's descent into drug addiction.y and pushed her into a world tour after ""I Will Always Love You ""(the Dolly Parton penned-song) hit #1 for 14 straight weeks. One really gets the impression it was Clive Davis who ultimately destroyed Whitney forcing her to do a world tour right after she did 'The Bodyguard"" and the had the biggest hit of her lifer. To make matters worse Davis knew she had a cocaine problem as early as the late '90s. Shame on you Clive...your obviously a money grabber, The film has strong acting and the script is well written although the Houston estate had nothing to do with the movie.

"OK...I was a late viewer of this show. Everything you have heard about ""Breaking Bad"" is true...the writing, the acting and the direction is superb and in this entire set you get all six season's episodes and a slew of bonus feature. I am only on Season 3 and I have to say I simply cannot watch just one episode...I have watched two or three at any given moment. Bryan Cranson (the star of the series) won a remarkable four Emmy Awards as Best Actor in a Prime Time Series and Aaron Paul won three for his supporting work. The show itself won multiple Emmys as Best Drama/ The story is simple. A father of two and a married chemistry teacher finds out he his dying and to support his family after he is gone he decides to get into the meth business and pack money away for their future. The plot twists are superb, the stories fast paced and you get to love all the characters like a real family. You understand why people do the bad things thet do: thanks to society and the way this wicked world is people have to succumb to doing illegal things to survive.

"""Love Somebody"" is Reba's 27th studio album and her first since 2010's ""All the Woman I Am"" which didn't sell well in the U.S.. That album actually became the first record in Reba's career that was not certified Gold or Platinum since 1984. Yes times are changing with a newer crop of younger singers on country radio (some I detest, but I won't mention names), but to say that Reba has dried up or her recording career is over is nothing short of asinine. Just listen to this amazing CD and you'll see why. Her vocals are top notch (she sounds better now at the age of 60 than she did in her 30's) and her collection of songs on ""Love Somebody range from ballads to heartbreak to up tempo. Favorites her are ""Enough"" featuring Jennifer Nettles, ""Promise My Love"", the title song, and her first single that flopped at #28 ""Going Out Like That"".

"Originally airing on November 11, 1977 ""Intimate Strangers"" was a Movie of the Week on ABC. It tells the story of a battered woman (played brilliantly by Sally Struthers) at the hands of her psychotic husband (played amazingly by Dennis Weaver).  Although the movie is nearly forty years old (and thank God the laws against batters are more stonger than ever) ""Intimate Strangers"" tells the viewer of what it was like for women in the late 1970's were they were being battered by their husbands with laws that were less than enforceful. The film is disturbing to watch (the movie is exceptionally directed) but a story like this one needed to be told in 1977. ""Intimate Strangers"" was written and produced by ""Dynasty"" creators Esther and Richard Shapiro and had a very impressive supporting cast including Tyne Daly (who won an Emmy nomination as Best Supporting Actress in a film made for television), Larry Hagman and Rhea Perlman.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17I5LTASIGW4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009T7R7VU#wasThisHelpful","R17I5LTASIGW4U","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Following on the heels of Lionsgate's"" release of season 4 a few months back now comes ""Little House on the Prairie-Season 5"". Like the other box sets these are the uncut and cleaned prints that are being offered. Don't get these sets confused with the cheap and cut syndicated DVD sets that came out years ago and were made by some Canadian company who didn't know their feet from their hands. This is the real deal...how a beloved show should be released to its legions of fans to joy for posterity. Season 5 of ""Little House on the Prairie"" began in the fall of 1978 and ended the season as the highest-rated show on NBC and coming in at #14 for the year. The stories this year were compelling: The Ingalls family along with other residents of Walnut Grove realize the city life is not for them so they return to their beloved Walnut Grove and rebuild their town; Charles is ecstatic that he now has a son (adopted) named Albert and he fits very well into the story.; The Garvey family is featured heavily and Walnut Grove wouldn't be complete without the Olson's especially Nellie.

"In 1985 ABC's ""Dynasty"" became the #1 series on American television. So, it was no great surprise that the network wanted to cash in on the Prime Time Soap Era that existed in the 1980's by creating a spin-off of ""Dynasty"" called ""The Colbys"" (originally the working title was ""Dynasty II- The Colbys""). The series was also created in order to get Pamela Sue Martin back as Fallon Carrington who had quit ""Dynasty"" in 1984. The reasoning was that if Fallon came back she would head the new serial while also making appearances on ""Dynasty"". Sadly, Pamela declined the offer so Emma Samms (fresh from ""General Hospital"") came in to fill the part (to me one of the worst casting decisions ever made although I love Emma). In the spring of 1985 while ""Dynasty"" was at its height in popularity Fallon showed up in Los Angeles with amnesia and had no recollection of who she was. A young handsome man named Miles Colby found her and fell in love with her. Then the story began. The Colbys were first introduced on ""Dynasty"" in November, 1985 in a two hour episode called ""The Colbys of California"". They had everything the Carringtons had, but more. Jason Colby (Charlton Heston) headed the family and was the brother to Constance Colby (Barbara Stanwyck's last role before her death). Jason was married to the beautiful Sable (Scott) Colby who was Alexis Carrington's first cousin (Sable once quppied to Alexis; ""You know darling our Mommies were sistas!). Jason and Sable had three children Myles, Monica and Bliss. The acting was top notch all the way, the sets were breath taking (the Colby Mansion exteriors were actually the same house in Brentwood where ""Mommie Dearest"" was filmed) and the story lines strong and involving ( the series really reminded me of the second season of ""Dynasty"" when you couldn't miss an episode). The series also had its really high moments, almost all of them involving the wonderful Stephanie Beecham as Sable. In one episode she told her husband what she thought of her sister Frankie (Katherine Ross); ""Trust Frankie, that tramp, that slut!"" and to her sister's face about her sister's son; ""I don't give a damn about your bastard you little slut!"" In this exquisite box set all 49 episodes from ""The Colbys"" two season run on ABC (1985-1987) are included uncut and cleaned from their masters and there will be new interviews with John James (Jeff), Max Caulfield (Myles) and Stephanie Beecham (Sable). For true soap opera fans and historians this set is a real treat when one considers that more popular prime time soaps like ""Knots Landing, ""Flamingo Road"" and ""Falcon's Crest"" are far away from having their entire library of seasons put on DVD for posterity. Luckily for us now we will always have ""The Colbys"" to enjoy!

"""Still Alice"" really holds a personal place in my heart. First of all Julianne Moore has been one of my favorite actresses ever since she graced our daytime TV screens on ""As the World Turns"". Since that time she has appeared in several successful films, been nominated for four Oscars and is regarded this year as the guaranteed winner for Best Actress for ""Still Alice"".  Another reason the movie resonates with me is beacuse as a year ago a dear personal friend of mine was diagnosed with the early onslaught of Alzheimer's Disease. He is now in a Nursing Home. He is only 53 years old. The movie chronicles the life of Alice, an intelligent woman who is a professor of linguistics at Columbia University who suddenly finds her life turned upside down when she begins to lose her memory. Gradually things get worse and she is diagnosed with the early onslaught of Alzheimer's Disease. The movie shows how Alice bravely deals with the disease in her work, with her family and with herself. For me the most daring part of the character of Alice was her bravery and staunch firmness on not allowing this disease to control her, but to control it. ""Still Alice"" is mesmerizing with exciting performances by all in the film especially Alec Baldwin who plays Alice's husband, but it is Julianne Moore who delivers the performance of a lifetime. 2015 will be the year Julianne Moore finally wins the Academy Award as Best Actress. And on February 22, 2015 Julianne Moore was indeed named Best Actress at the Academy Awards, an award that was well deserved and long over due.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R481Q9GIZCSTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSO6KU#wasThisHelpful","R481Q9GIZCSTK","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well here it is: the final film in the series of ""Final Destination"" and it's a great ending. Like its previous successors the plot is lame....a guy or girl sees signs of death in which people will die. The fun part about the films, and this one in particular, is how the characters are ""killed off"" one by one. However, what surprised me about the final film was some of the performances especially by Jacqueline Woods from TV's ""Bold and Beautiful"".

"This is really, in essence, Whitney Houston's. only live CD/DVD in her career. Her record producer Clive Davis is responsible for putting together this amazing set of Whitney's greatest appearances in her career. We see her perform for the first time on television on ""The Merv Griffin Show"" to appearances on the Oscars, Grammys and American Music Awards. These performances are flawless and really remind people of the kind of superstar Whitney Houston will always be: original, real, authentic with a voice like no other. This is what she must be remembered for. No one had a talent like Whitney Houston. On this set the DVD performances look flawless and like the accompanying CD sound impeccable. This is really a true gem for all music fans. In its first week of release ""Whitney Houston Live"" sold a whopping 90,000 copies landing it at #1 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts!.

"For those of us who can't wait until May 14th, 2014 when the Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner Box Set comes out we can always purchase this tiny little gem of a CD. ""Duets"" is a great sample of the kind of music Porter and Dolly sang"" songs about love, heartbreak, and romance. This set features nearly all their big hits like ""The Last Thing on My Mind"", ""Daddy Was An Old-Time Preacher Man"" and ""Making Plans"". The only song that appears here that was never released as a single is from their 1969 LP ""Always, Always"" called ""I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby"". What I like about this CD are the rare photos of Porter and Dolly's. The cover was taken from the photography sessions for their 1971 LP ""The Best of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton"". This pic is a little different from the LP version as both Porter and Dolly are smiling differently.

"""True Blood"" was riding high during its third season. The stories are involving, well-written and the characters are neatly interwoven with each other. The addition of the beautiful and sexy Joe Manganiello as a hot werewolf only adds to the male sex appeal of the series. However, my hat goes off to Denis O'Hare who plays Russell Eddington, a psychotic vampire hell-bent on avenging the death of his gay-lover vampire. Believe me...O'Hare ( a four-time Tony-Award winner) delivers in this part and if watching his portrayal as a maniac doesn't scare you nothing will. I have never seen a character so evil since Hannibal Lecter! All the characters get great screen time and the love story of Sookie and Bill dominates, but their love story is always tested. Also, Eric is as hot as ever, Pamela is a hoot and who can not help but love baby vampire Jessica, Oh and Ryan Kwanten still looks hot as Jason!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIFKFSO76QCD6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032JTV6A#wasThisHelpful","RIFKFSO76QCD6","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The main love story is the lovely and mesmerizing telling of Sookie and Bill, all the while sexy and hunky Eric watches who ponders over her.

"I became a fan of director Steve McQueen's work after seeing ""Shame"" starring Michael Fassbender. In ""12 Years a Slave""  McQueen was the first black person to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture. The story takes place in 1841 when Soloman Northrop is captured in Washington, D.C. (where slavery was abolished at the time) and taken to Louisiana to be a slave. The film follows Soloman's life for 12 years as he battles slave owners, watches in horror as he sees how his race is treated  and his determination to free himself. The film reminds one of ""Roots"", the TV mini-series that aired in 1977, and one cannot help but be reminded how blacks were treated and its effects on society even today. Michael Fassbender (currently my favorite actor) also stars in this movie as a dastardly slave owner who constantly rapes and beats his female salve (played to perfection by Lupita Nyong'o,who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).

"""The Help"" is simply an excellent and charming film dealing with the race issue in the South of the United States in the early 1960's. The story is a simple one in which the viewer is shown how blacks were treated by whites in a very unflattering way. Most black women at the time worked as Nanny's or housekeepers for rich white women and the movies dramatizes the kinds of relationships these were and the drama that unfolded from it. I sat through the first showing of this movie in my Entertainment Room in awe as I had not seen a film this good in years! ""The Help"" was nominated for four Oscars including Best Picture and won the Academy Award, deservedly,  for Octavia Spencer in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category.

"""August:Osage County"" is probably the most critically-acclaimed film of the year with a cast that most producers would kill for. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Actress for Meryl Streep, the movie deals with a mouth-over-the-hill woman who's husband has left her, but she believes he is dead somewhere. Si, the entire family is called in and that's where the sparks fly: it seems Violet( Streep) was never Mother of the Year and all three of her daughters have messed up lives. The film deals with the rotten dynamics of a dysfunctional family where nearly everyone is hooked on booze, pills and cigarettes. Others in the cast who also gives superb performances include Ewan McGregor, Julia Roberts (also up for a Supporting Actress Oscar and Juliette Lewis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFNPPGKGX78L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7LJ2UO#wasThisHelpful","R2AFNPPGKGX78L","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a fine cast including Ryan Gosling and Naomi Watts, ""Stay"" was a box office failure at theatres and stars Ewan McGregor who plays a psychiatrist trying to help a man (played superbly by Gosling) from committing suicide. The film cost a whopping $50,000,000 to make, but only made a paltry $8,000,000. For a film that is so good with an interesting plot and a high caliber of actors, ""Stay"" should have been more of a hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19H8U1FJAMVJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E6ESL2#wasThisHelpful","R19H8U1FJAMVJO","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Directed by Michael Bay and starring the sexy Ewan McGregor asTom Lincoln, ""The Island"" was a box office bomb when it was released during the summer of 2005 and panned by critics, but it has gone on to enjoy enormous success by its cult following. Tom finds himself in another time as he was originally cloned. He then questions this new world he lives in and the problems he encounters. More of a science fiction/ drama film the film has an interesting and original plot, fine acting and top-notch directing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNBSEHSHE5XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HALPBM4#wasThisHelpful","RCNBSEHSHE5XV","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By early 1971 Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton were at the peak of their success. They had just won the Vocal Duo of The Year Award from the CMA, their songs were all hits on country radio and even Dolly's solo career was taking off as she had her first #1 song with ""Joshua"". ""Two of a Kind"", like all Porter and Dolly albums, is an excellent example of how good this duo was. Featuring ten tracks, the real gem here is the first song ""Oh, The Pain of Loving You"" which would be shortened to ""The Pain of Loving You"" when re released in July, 1971 on ""The Best of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton"" album. Other greats here are the Dolly-penned ""Is It Real?"", ""The Fighting Kind"" and ""The Flame"". The album is a little strange in the fact no songs were released as singles from it. Look for the amazing Box Set of ""Dolly and Porter-Just Between You and Me"", a 160 song collection featuring every song Porter and Dolly recorded for RCA from 1967-1976!!! All their albums, rare songs and unreleased material in one set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2678Q2T9DHIKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047XG92E#wasThisHelpful","R2678Q2T9DHIKC","A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a microphone optimized for isolating musical instruments in performance. The microphone is 6.5 long and weighs 10 oz. The sides and grille are black metal. The mic accepts a standard XLR female cable end for use in sound systems, mixer boards, and digital interfaces. The contacts for the XLR connector are gold plated for corrosion resistance. Internally, the magnet is neodymium, and the microphone is constructed with dual-floating walls to reduce handling noise. The hypercardioid response pattern makes the mic ideal for isolating instruments in performance situations or for live recordings. Included in the box are the mic in a tight-fitting foam receptacle, a padded zippered faux leather carrying case, a heavy-duty plastic microphone clip that will screw into standard 5/8 microphone stands, a plastic adapter to screw the clip into 3/8 stands, and an informational brochure in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian. The mic was manufactured in China.This mic has a hefty feel to it, which speaks quality construction. The XLR connector has a good, snug fit, and the included clip keeps a secure hold on the mic. Most important is the microphone sound quality, which is excellent. Guitar through this mic is exceptionally warm and sweetfrequency response is true. Compared head-to-head with a Shure 57, this mic sounds sweeter and richer, especially with acoustic guitars. That makes sense since this mic covers higher frequencies than the Shure 57. You could use this microphone for vocals, but it really excels in sound isolation, so it's great for snare and percussion instruments. Yes, like other dynamic microphones, you may note some tendency for feedback, especially if you don't pay attention to placement with respect to monitors. The manufacturer notes that feedback can be virtually eliminated if you make sure the back of the mic is at least 45 degrees off axis with the speakers. This is about what I foundif I placed the mic directly in front of a speaker, I got a lot of feedback, but by moving off to the side about 45 degrees, feedback disappeared. Overall, this is a quality microphone that will be a great choice for instrumental amplification or recording, especially for acoustic guitars or percussion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI8YUR32USAYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A4WINW#wasThisHelpful","RI8YUR32USAYT","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heavy-duty plastic tote bag, suitable for carrying a variety of small objects. The sides of the bag measure approximately 11x9x4, with 2 large looping handles whose opening measures 7x4.5. The bag is made of heavy duty plastic which has some flexibility, but is generally rather stiff. The bag weighs just under 1 lb when empty. The sides of the bag are composed of circular shapes that touch each other on 4 sides. This leaves diamond-shaped holes in between the contacts that are about 1/2 across. Being solid plastic, the bag is fully waterproof. There are 4 small (1/4) holes on the bottom of the bag to allow any fluids that might fall into the bag to drain. The bag was made in the USA.I am impressed with the quality of this bagit really feels like it will hold up to heavy use. I'm using the bag in my garden. It is just the right size and shape for carrying my garden hand tools and packages of seeds. It will stand up to the elements like dew and rain showers much better than my former bag, which was made of reeds, or the old standby plastic shopping bags that always seem to get ripped to shreds by the end of the day. Other suggested uses for the bag include a shower tote, a lunch bag, or a magazine holder. Basically, this bag will hold a lot of stuff and it won't mind getting wet. The big handles are great, not only for carrying the bag around, but also for hanging it on a variety of hooks. Overall, this is a handy, well made little tote.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R596HUU044MQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DBQNBI#wasThisHelpful","R596HUU044MQE","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large format smart phone that can be used with the phone carrier(s) of your choice. It runs on the Android operating system, an open source variant of Linux adapted for mobile touchscreen devices. Android is developed by Google, and there are numerous apps (application software packages) available to add capabilities to your phone, from games to navigation to social media like FaceBook. The phone ships with Android version 4.4, nicknamed KitKat. Here is what some of the other specs mean:--6.0 refers to the screen size. The screen is a full 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. This makes it considerably larger than a phone like the iPhone 6. Thus, the Blu 6.0 has a bigger screen and is easier to read than an iPhone 6, but you might find it bulkier to carry around.--Snapdragon 400 is the make and series number of the processor, the brains behind the smartphone. Besides Blu, other manufacturers using Snapdragon 400 chips include Samsung, Motorola and Nokia. The Snapdragon 400 is a good fast chip for an Android phone, though there are some faster chips out there if you want to pay a premium for having the fastest phone on the market.--1.6 GHz quad core processor is the rated speed of the processor. This speed is plenty fast enough for most utilitarian uses of an Android phone, such as navigation, web surfing, or using social media.--13.0 Mp refers to the image quality of photos taken with the camera mounted on the back of the phone. With 13 Mp, pictures you take with this phone can be printed and enlarged to 8x10"" or larger without graininess. In comparison, the standard camera on an iPhone takes only 8.0 Mp (rear), while high end point-and-shoot digital cameras may offer 18 Mp. The front facing camera on this Blu phone (for taking selfies or using for Skype video calls) is rated at a full 5.0 Mp, which far outshines the 1.2 Mp offered on the front-facing camera of an iPhone 6.--2Gb RAM refers to the size of the working memory for the phone's computer. 2Gb of RAM is a lot of working memory for a phone, but it's necessary to run the large high definition video display.--4G LTE [up to 150 Mbps] is the latest wireless communication standard. LTE itself stands for Long Term Evolution, which is often referred to as 4G. LTE networks are supported throughout most of the Americas, Europe, and Asia and provide for the fastest voice and data communications currently available. Speed of communications is measured in Mbps; it is determined by the type of communications network. 150 Mbps is currently the fastest network speed available in North America.--Up to 32Gb MicroSD refers to the size of optional data card that can be added to the phone for additional storage. The MicroSD is an itty bitty pinkie-nail sized card which comes in a variety of storage capacities. If you are using the phone just for communications and social networking, you may not need to add a data card, since the 16Gb built in storage on the phone is already quite generous. However, if you'd like to carry around a large music or video library, or if you'd like to shoot a lot of photos or videos with this phone, the ability to add a MicroSD chip for extra storage is a great feature.The phone ships with a small protective plastic case that fits around the back of the phone, and a tailor-made transparent screen protector with cut outs for the front camera lens and speaker, as well as a small cleaning cloth. In addition, you get a 5.0 V 1 A output charger with micro USB cord and a set of ear buds with a built-in FM antenna and extra protective plastic tips for the buds, plus a small paper booklet with instructions about the very basics of using this phone and Android (they forgot to explain how to open the phone to insert the batter however!). Preloaded software is minimal, with basic Android email, calendar, camera, gallery, contacts, and browser. You can download other apps, such as FaceBook, DropBox or Skype from the Google PlayStore according to your needs and interests. The phone has a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack and slots for 2 SIM cards (to connect to phone carriers) as well as a MicroSD (for extra storage capacity). It also has full WiFi and Bluetooth connection options.I was interested in this contract-free phone because I live in a rural area where there is no cell service, so a phone contract makes absolutely no sense for me. Still, when I leave home, I need a phone to use for emergencies and to keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues, and these days, I'm finding a smart phone is essential for navigating large cities. Since this phone comes without a contract, in order to use it, you need to add a SIM card from a communications carrier so that you can access their networks. As soon as I got this phone, I took it and my old GoPhone down to my local AT&T store. The clerk at the store transferred my GoPhone SIM chip and account to this smart phone, together with my GoPhone balance at no cost. Instant service (as long I stay in the city where there is cellphone coverage)! Well, actually, my old SIM card was too big to fit in this phone, so the clerk destroyed it and replaced it with a smaller SIM card for this phone at no charge. I also had the option of signing up for a variety of AT&T plans, or going down the street to TMobile and looking at their plans. With 2 SIM slots in this phone, I could even do both--get an AT&T SIM and TMobile SIM, although I think a better use of the second SIM slot will be for an international SIM when I'm traveling out of the country. I found the sound quality on this phone quite good, a great improvement over my old flip phone, which could only access older communications networks. Even though the screen is a little large, the phone feels comfortable for making calls. Note, though, that under current AT&T policies, with GoPhone (pay as you go) service, you can't access data on a smart phone via the AT&T network unless you buy a separate data package, starting at $5/month. Yes, on an old flip phone, AT&T allows you to use data services for a few cents a Mb, but the interface was clunky, so they knew you wouldn't do it. On a smart phone like this one, data services are easy to use, so they won't let you use them unless you pay extra for a data plan. Don't you love phone companies? If you don't want to pony-up for data services via the phone networks, you can still access data over WiFi networks at no extra cost on this phone.I migrated to this smart phone from a Samsung 7 tablet that I have been using for 18 months. Although I liked the tablet a lot, the sharper screen on this phone has made the new Blu phone my go-to device for reading and social media. Until seeing the action on this new Blu phone, I never noticed how slow the Samsung tablet was. I've read a few reviews about this phone and how there are other phones on the market that are faster. I guess if you absolutely must have the fastest phone on the market this week and money is no object, you might look elsewhere. But for the money, this phone is more than adequate, plenty more. With its sharp display and speedy Internet browsing, it is a pleasure to use.Speaking of the display, this phone makes a good book reader. I've tried reading books on an iPhone and other similar-sized small devices. No fun--either the print is too small to see, or just 3 words can appear on the screen at once. With the 6x3 inch display on this phone, you can get a full column of text, even with large print. The Kindle app works well on this phone; so does the Bluefire reader, for borrowing ebooks in epub format with Adobe rights management from libraries. The Audible app for recorded books also works well on this phone, better than on my Samsung tablet (where it would turn off every time I drove over a bump or tried to use it on a treadmill). Typing is also easier on this phone than on smaller phones since the keyboard is proportionately larger.So what's not to like? I've had a few issues getting used to the power button and how it works. When passing around the phone to show friends, they kept hitting the power button on the side, and that would cause a delayed restart without warning. I had a similar thing happen when I tried to turn off the screen while listening to an Audible book. On my tablet, I'm used to just getting my book going, then hitting the power button to turn the screen off to save the battery while I listen. But when I hit the power button to turn off the screen on this phone once I got my book going, the phone did a delayed restart. Pressing the power button and holding it in just started a cycle of delayed restarting. I had to take my hands off the phone and let it restart a bunch of times before I could get it going steady again. So when I listen to Audible books, I've found I just have to let the screen time out on its own--the book keeps going even after the screen turns off. I've also noted that the standard email program oddly updates only about every 12 hours, even though I've changed the settings to every 5 minutes. (On the other hand, FaceBook on this phone grabs dozens of stories, while FaceBook on my tablet only lets me have 10 stories an hour--odd application-specific limits). I had to reset the screen brightness to Auto on this phone about 5 times before it finally stayed there for good. Still, when I'm reading the screen in a quiet room with steady illumination, with the brightness set to Auto, every few minutes, the brightness setting cycles through dim to super bright, before resettling back to the appropriate brightness. Annoying, but not impossible to live with. Battery life is about comparable to my tablet--I can usually get through an entire day on a single charge on this phone, unless I'm doing a lot of reading. If I'm using the phone just as a phone with minimal screen time, a single charge can last several days.I'd like to get a hard leather case for this phone to protect it, but such cases are not yet available. On the other hand, I've found that a Ghirardelli 3.5 ounce chocolate bar wrapper box is a perfect fit for a temporary case. I might even just stick with the chocolate bar wrapper even after proper cases become available for this model, if only for the shock factor when people see me pull what appears to be a chocolate bar out of my bag or pocket and begin talking on it! And if my homemade Ghirardelli case wears out, I can always eat more chocolate to get a new one.Overall, though, this is a great phone, especially for folks who prefer to talk to the phone carriers on their own terms. If you really want a phone contract, you can take this phone to your carrier of choice and get a discount price on their contracts, or you have the freedom to pay by the month, or pay by the use as I do. If you take the time to run the numbers, you would never, ever sign a contract that includes a phone, since you will end up paying 1.5 to 2x as much as the phone is worth over the length of the contract. Pay the money up front for this contract-free phone, and you'll be far better off, with a phone of your choice instead of one dictated by your carrier. Plus, with 2 SIM card slots on this phone, you can easily access 2 different phone networks, such as one for domestic calls and one for traveling (with no expensive roaming surprises!). The large sharp screen makes this phone a great choice for readers, making it possible to carry around just one device for calling, texting, emailing, and reading. Yes, this phone has a few quirks to get used to, like that odd power button and the random cycling brightness issue, but once you get used to these minor quirks, you will really like the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5C41BYI7SF4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKVEUP4#wasThisHelpful","R5C41BYI7SF4Z","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pair of rubber handled spring-assist clippers. The metal blade is 2 inches long, inserted into a pink contoured plastic handle that measures 5 inches long. I'm not sure where the 6 measurement listed on the package comes from, because I get 7 from stem to stern, but that's OKthe clippers fit my hand well. Since there are no loops on the handle, the clippers are completely ambidextrous. The blades are labeled titanium bonded, and a note on the package says this will make them harder than stainless steel so they should stay sharp longer. The clippers have a tensioning adjustment accessible under a plastic cover at the joint; you will need a medium sized screwdriver to use this adjustment. Included in the package are a tight fitting plastic blade cover (you will need thisthose points are sharp!), and a lanyard to hang the clippers around your neck so they don't get misplaced. There are cutouts in both the blade cover and the clipper handles that the anchor string of the lanyard can fit into. A thumb-operated lock on the upper handle locks the blades shut for storage and opens them for use.I am pleased with how well these clippers cut. In shape and function, they are most like the thread clippers in my sewing kit, and they cut thread well. They also snip tight corners in paper and make quick work of plastic packaging, mailing tape and boxboard. So they're handy to have around when you're opening the mail or the shopping! Note however, that the blade is very shortjust 2 total, so if you have long stretches of cutting to do, feet of cutting instead of inches, you're going to have to do a lot of pumping those little blades to get through it, and with so many pumps, it will be hard to stay in a straight line. So I'm not sure why this product is labeled scissors. I would call these things clippers, great little blades for making small, precise cuts. But for a big job, I would use proper scissors instead. Nevertheless, for small jobs, these clippers are sharp, easy to cut with it, and brightly colored so they can't hide!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGTFNCNJ9YSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R6FZNW#wasThisHelpful","R3FGTFNCNJ9YSE","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a case of 12 17.5 oz cans of coconut water. Ingredients include coconut water and nothing else. According to the label, one 8 oz serving provides 50 calories, so drinking the whole can (about 2 servings), will give you 109 calories. In addition to calories, there are small amounts of sodium, potassium and sugars, and a significant amount of manganese, all naturally occurring in the coconut water. The cans are metal, stamped BPA free, and have a use-by date that suggests you can store the cans for at least 18-20 months. The label notes that flavor is best if you serve the beverage chilled. The cans have push tabs so that they can be opened by hand without any need for a can opener.Coconut water is an excellent rehydration fluid, since it is low calorie and naturally lightly sweetened. Many other coconut water products have added flavors like coconut and pineapple, so if you are used to drinking those products, the flavor of this pure coconut water may surprise you at first. Sweetness in this coconut water is subtle, and not specifically fruity. I usually buy coconut water in juice boxes, and I was a little wary of this product at first because so many canned juices taste like cans. However, I was pleased to find no taste of can in this formulation, especially when served in a drinking glass. A plus of packaging in cans is that the entire can is recyclable, so you won't need to fill up your trash can if you buy a case of this beveragethe empties can just go out with the recycling. In contrast, few recycling programs accept juice boxes, so a case of juice boxes means a case of empties to send to the landfill.Note that this is coconut water, not coconut milk. Coconut milk is a creamy white product made from pulverized coconut meat and used in cooking or for making mixed beverages. It is much too thick and rich to drink straight, and it is also high in fat. Coconut water is the liquid contained in green coconuts; it is clear, thin, fat-free and suitable for drinking straight, but does not have the heavy coconut flavor that you might want for cooking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38H8AVMT9F976/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM9HN0#wasThisHelpful","R38H8AVMT9F976","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 16 foot roll of black kinesiology tape for binding common joint and muscle injuries. The uncut roll comes in a plastic container with screw lids on either side to make it more manageable for storage or travel. Also included in the package is a KT sticker and one page brochure with a list of possible uses. Instructions and photos are included on the brochure for knee support, plantar fasciitis, achilles, and calf wraps and links to a website with videos and instructions for many more uses. This black tape is KT's pro version, which lasts 4-5 days, depending on the application.I started using kinesiology tape on the advice of my physical trainer to help heal minor ankle and knee injuries. I have been really pleased with how well it works. In addition to providing support, it may also help promote the flow of lymph and thus speed healing. KT makes both precut and uncut tape, like this roll. For most applications, I prefer the uncut version since I can cut it exactly to my specifications, although the precut version can come in handy if scissors aren't available. The key to making uncut tape stick is to round the edges of each piece when cutting the strips.

"This is an LED light bulb that produces light equivalent to a 60W incandescent bulb. The bulb is shaped like a standard incandescent bulb, so it will fit in ordinary lamp fixtures and lamp shades will clamp securely to it. The outer casing of the bulb is plastic, so there is no danger of shattering if you should happen to drop the bulb. The translucent portion of the bulb extends approximately 2/3 of the way down the globe, providing light in almost all directions. The bulb is bright, providing 800 lumens of light, slightly less than a 60W incandescent, but more than a comparable 15W CFL. The light color temperature is 2700K, a warm shade reminiscent of ordinary incandescent bulbs. The bulb is rated for 15000 hours, which comes out to about 13.7 years at 3 hours of use per day. The bulb is dimmable.I placed this bulb in a cool hallway light fixture to replace a 15W CFL bulb. The CFL bulb wasn't working well in the hallway because of the cool temperatures; it was always slow and dim to start. In contrast, this LED bulb comes on instantly and is noticeably brighter than the old CFL. The LED bulb is rated down to -20C, or approximately 0F, cooler than any ordinary indoor temperature. Not only does the new LED bulb work better than a CFL at cool temperatures, but it is also cheaper to run over the long term when compared to either a CFL or an incandescent bulb:Bulb  Hours Watts Purchase 1 Purchase/25 yrs Electricity/25years Total/25 yearsThis bulb  15000 10.5  $9.99  $16.65  $31.50  $48.15Incandescent 4000 60  $0.82  $13.67  $180.00  $193.67CFL  8000 15  $3.22  $13.42  $45.00  $58.42(These calculations assume an average electricity cost of $0.12/kWhr.) Overall, I really like this bulb. It works better than a CFL, it's safer than either a CFL or an incandescent (it won't shatter, doesn't contain mercury, and runs cool), lasts longer and is cheaper to use over the long run. And it produces a pleasing bright light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O9S9Y394U3IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF0U0W0#wasThisHelpful","R2O9S9Y394U3IR","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a starter kit for creating decorative punched borders in paper or cardstock for matting artwork. The kit consists of a plastic baseplate with paper guides and a cartridge stamp cutting tool. The cutting cartridge pairs securely to the baseplate with magnets. To make a border, you begin by measuring your paper and deciding how large a hole you would like in your mat, and what the outer dimensions of the mat should be. Then you line up one corner of your paper on the appropriate corner guide on the base plate, the one that matches your chosen dimensions. Place the cutting cartridge on the baseplate, and the magnets instantly align it correctly. Press down on the cartridge and your corner is cut! Cut the remaining corners similarly, then use the guides on the baseplate to align your paper to cut the straight sections between the corners. In the box, you get the baseplate, a cutting cartridge with two flowery cut-outs that makes a lacey border, and instructions in English, Spanish, and French. For more variety of cut-out shapes, you can purchase other cartridges separately. This kit is designed for cutting single sheets of paper or light cardstock; it will not cut regular mat board. The paper guides on the base plate are set for a sheet with minimum outside dimensions of 3x3 inches; there is no limit on maximum sheet size. The paper guides accommodate mat widths from 1/2 inch to 3 inches.I was surprised at how easily I was able to get this kit up and going. Within minutes from opening the box, I had a lacey matted frame cut out. I did make one goof in interpreting the instructions on that first fame and made one cut in the wrong direction, so you might want to practice one or twice before you move on to expensive paper. But compared to cutting frames out of mat board with knives, this is a snap and joy! I was very impressed with how well the magnets aligned the cutter cartridge with the baseplate. All you have to do is get the cartridge somewhere near home and it snaps exactly into position. Do note that there is no collection device on the bottom of the baseplate, so you will end up with a bunch of tiny paper scraps on your table. Thus, it might be a good idea to do your cutting work on a table that is easy to wipe clean (not on a rough table, or over a textured tablecloth, for instance). Overall, though, this is a nifty little device, useful for crafters and framers, and simply fun to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36VPMBM3GUNXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTSCRQA#wasThisHelpful","R36VPMBM3GUNXS","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a substance designed to kill crawling insects through abrasion. The active ingredient is diatomaceous earth, which is a natural substance made from fossilized marine skeletons. To use this product, you carefully spread it where your crawling insects must travel. As they try to crawl over the powder, they acquire fatal abrasions. According to the label, this product is effective against cockroaches, ants, earwigs, millipedes, centipedes, crickets, silverfish, fleas, carpet beetles, and bed bugs. Warnings on the label note that the product can cause moderate eye irritation, and that you should avoid contact with eyes or clothing and washing hands thoroughly before eating, drinking, chewing gum or tobacco, or using the toilet.I would have liked to know more about exactly what is in the bag before purchasing the product. The label says the active ingredients are 85% silicon dioxide and 15% other ingredients. There are no notes on the label about whether the product is approved for organic gardens/farms, and not enough information about the ""other ingredents"" to make that decision yourself. Fortunately, there is an 800 number on the back of the package, so I called it to get more information. The customer service representative who answered told me that silicon dioxide is the only active ingredient and that she has no information about what the other ingredients are. She also said that this product is ONLY for surfaces, indoors and out, and not for gardening of any kind. In my own further research, I found that inhaling crystalline silicon dioxide can cause bronchial disease and cancer, but that most diatomaceous earth is of the less toxic amorphous form of silicon dioxide. In any case, it is vitally important to follow the instructions on the bag about spreading this product carefully so that you don't breathe it in; it's best to wear a dust mask when applying it. And other research about using diatomaceous earth to control insects notes that it is far more effective when dry than wet, so you may have more luck with it indoors, or you may need to reapply it after rain. According to OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute), diatomaceous earth is an approved for some organic farm usages, with restrictions. But without further information about the ""other ingredients"" in this product, it is hard to tell if this particular product would be OMRI approved. In any case, if applied with care in places where small children aren't about to eat the dust, diatomaceous earth is probably one of the safest and most effective ways to control crawling insects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IGBD89QVHDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q0DM82#wasThisHelpful","R15IGBD89QVHDD","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heavy duty stapler for attaching 2-60 sheets of paper. The base and handle are black and grey plastic, while the mechanism and plate are steel. There are rubber grip pads on the bottom of the stapler to prevent slipping on a desk. The stapler ships with a long handled staple puller and 800 heavy duty steel staples.My husband unpacked this stapler and loaded it for its first use. He told me he had some trouble figuring out how to load it, but it seemed to work fine once loaded. We tested it on a batch of 58 sheets of paper. It stapled them easily with no jams. Then I tried loading the stapler myself. Since there were no written instructions for loading the stapler, I examined the pictoral instructions on a sticker on the stapler carefully. After about 3 minutes of studying the pictures and trying a lot of different moves, I got the stapler drawer to open and put some new staples in. I closed the stapler and tried to staple, but the loading drawer kept popping open. I couldn't get it to stay closed. Next thing I knew, the drawer popped way out while I was stapling and the rod bent severely. Dead stapler. I already have enough paper weights, so sadly, I had to throw the brand new stapler in the trash. If only there had been some written instructions to go with the pictures! At least I have the heavy duty stapler puller and 800 staples for consolation. Too bad--just a few words on a paper insert to explain the pictures on the sticker might have kept this stapler alive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N54U4C0BNZR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHYO514#wasThisHelpful","R2N54U4C0BNZR9","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is ready-to-use organic coconut flour in a plastic package with a zip-type recloseable seal. The list of ingredients contains one item: organic coconuts, whose origin is listed as the Philippines. Other information on the label notes that the coconut flour is non-GMO, vegan, and gluten free as well as organic. The label mentions a website with recipes, but the site does not appear to be working yet, at least not with the web address given. The manufacturer recommends storing the coconut flour in the refrigerator or freezer after opening.I was quite pleased with the flavor of this product straight out of the bag. It tastes fresh, and appropriately, like coconuts. Following a suggestion on the label, I substituted 1/3 of the total wheat flour in my usual pumpkin muffin recipe with coconut flour, and the result was quite tasty. The key for such substitutions is to add an equal amount of extra liquid. The first time I made pumpkin-coconut muffins using this flour, I added some extra liquid, but probably not enough since my muffins came out a little grainy. The second time, I added more liquid, and I was very pleased with the resultmoist, creamy muffins with a subtle coconut taste. The muffins were a little more filling than usual, a little more dense, and tasted somewhat sweeter, even though I used the same amount of sweetening as usual.According to the nutritional information label on the bag, the standard serving size is 2 tablespoons, which corresponds to 32 servings for the entire bag. Those 2 tablespoons supply 62 calories, including 2 gm of fat, 8 gm of carbohydrates, 5 gm fiber, and 2 gm of protein. Coconut flour is naturally low in sodium, and provides significant iron (2 tablespoons coconut flour corresponds to 10% of iron requirements on a 2000 calorie diet). It may also lower the glycemic index of foods that it is added to. Keep in mind that the fiber content is very high for a flour, so easy does it. Too much of a good thing can cause excitable bowels.If you're not sure what to do with coconut flour, just search the internet for recipes. There are plenty of recipes out there, including muffins, cookies, crackers, quick breads, brownies, and more. Many of the recipes are gluten free and also suitable for those following paleo diets. Or, like I did, you can adapt your own favorite recipes from home by substituting some coconut flour (plus extra liquid) for some other flour. In any case, note that even a small bag like this one of coconut flour will last a while since recipes using coconut flour generally use no more than  cup at a time, even to make a full batch of muffins. A little goes a long way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GA1B5NB751DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDCFXFE#wasThisHelpful","R2GA1B5NB751DO","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a roll of uncut kinesthesiology tape for supporting muscles and tendons to promote healing. This version of KT tape is 100% cotton, latex free. According to the manufacturer, when compared to KT Tape's other product, KT Tape Pro which is made of synthetic materials, you can expect to get 1-3 days of wear per application from this tape, rather than the 4-7 days from KT Pro. They also say that this tape provides Good level of support, while KT Tape Pro provides Best. Inside the box, you will find a 16 foot cellophane-wrapped roll of tape and a 1-page instructional brochure demonstrating various applications. The brochure includes links to videos, printable instructions, and social media. Instructions are available for injuries from runner's knee, plantar fasciiitis, should pain, lower back pain, AC joint pain, wrist sprain, calf strain, and many others.I began using kinesthesiology tape on the advice of both my chiropractor and my physical trainer. The tape has been invaluable for promoting heating of some nagging injuries, including both a recent shoulder injury and an ankle sprain from long ago. The tape works by providing external support at the site of the injury, as well as promoting the flow of lymph under the skin. Overall, I found this version of KT Tape very effective as well as handy and economical to use. I like the fact that it is uncut, so that I can use exactly the length that I need (although that does mean that I have to hand trim the edges to round them  to get maximum adhesion). This particular roll is good for wraps that will only be staying on a short whileI save the more expensive Pro version for wraps that need to last all week. In general, I've been pleased with this tape, how well it stretches and sticks, and how well it lasts. So far, I've relied on my physical trainer to explain and demonstrate specific wraps, but it's great to see that the manufacturer has also provided so many instructional videos if you're unsure about how to do a specific wrap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USFKJNBCG3RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME6ABPW#wasThisHelpful","R2USFKJNBCG3RI","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pair of protective earmuffs designed to suppress gunshot sounds while amplifying low-level sounds such as conversations. The muffs are black, well padded, and weigh 10 ounces with batteries installed (2 AAA batteries, not included). Fully folded, the muffs form a tight ball, about 5 in diameter and 4 wide. The muffs are fully adjustable, with a stiff padded headband and slider bars so they will fit many head sizes from quite small to very large. The ear pieces have thick  rubber padded sealing rings that conform to the shape of your face. The lid to the battery compartment has a plastic tether making it less likely that you will drop or lose the lid. The muffs work by first blocking as much sound as possible physically, then by capturing sound through two microphones, one located on the outside front of each ear piece, and filtering it electronically so that loud, percussive noises are suppressed while quiet noises are amplified. Thus, wires pass from each ear piece through the padding on the headband to carry sounds between the two ear pieces. A single volume knob is located on the back of the right earmuff for controlling amplification. On the front of the right ear muff is a 3.5 mm audio input jack that allows you to directly patch in sounds from a standard radio, two-way radio, music player, or other device. Also included in the package is a 3 foot long 3.5 mm audio patch cable and a small 14 page instruction brochure. The earmuffs have a 22 decibel noise reduction rating.I find these earmuffs much more comfortable and form fitting than my old set, which was a Peltor Tactical 6S. The 6S just wasn't very adjustablethey're hard to fit onto smaller heads. But the adjustability of this new Peltor Tactical 100 makes it a clear choice. They fit well on smaller women and children's heads, yet they also expand to fit larger heads that the 6S couldn't reach around. I also like that fact that the Peltor 100 only takes 2 batteries instead of 4. What it really comes down to though, is noise protection. At 22 decibels of noise reduction, these earmuffs do a good job at reducing noise and protecting ears. According to the noise reduction ratings, they aren't the most protective muffs on the market, but they're probably good enough for most situations. Amplification of ambient sounds is sharp, and the aux input is clear. The earmuffs are great for shooting on a range, especially for matches when it is crucial to hear conversations and instructions. They also work well for hunting, watching motorsports, and other loud activities where hearing protection is required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQUVZXBLP8YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAG4WX2#wasThisHelpful","RZQUVZXBLP8YR","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a set of 2 WeMo controlled lightbulbs and a WeMo link transmitter to control these bulbs or other WeMo bulbs that you may purchase separately. Other products that you can purchase separately to add functionality to the bulbs are a motion sensor (so that the bulbs turn on automatically when you walk into your room) or an insight switch (so that the bulbs turn off automatically when you plug in your phone to charge at night). The bulbs themselves are excellent quality. They provide 800 lumens of  warm light with a bulb shape and glow that is comparable to a 60W incandescent bulb, but they draw only 9.5W of energy. The translucent section of the plastic bulb cover extends far below the meridian, so there is a wide angle of light coverage (in some LED bulbs, the translucent cover ends at the meridian, so all the light goes up, which isn't very useful for table lamps since you depend on light below the shade for reading, not above it). The bulbs weigh only 3.5 ounces, much less than the old first generation LED bulbs. They will work with or without the WeMo transmitter. The WeMo transmitter is a small brick, 2  inches square by 1  inches deep. It will fill half of a standard light socket without interfering with the other half. It needs to be plugged in somewhere where it can reach your WiFi network and your bulbs. It draws only about  W of electricity, so you can plug it in somewhere and forget about it, once you set up your system. When plugged in, it produces a faint green glow, less that you might get from a small LED nightlight.I found the setup for this set rather straightforward. Following the instructions on the paper quickstart sheet, I screwed in the bulbs, turned them on, plugged in the transmitter, and downloaded the free WeMo app onto my Android tablet. Using the WeMo app, I finished setting up the transmitter for my network. Then I could easily turn the bulbs on and off from the app controls on my tablet. Other controls on the app were a lot harder to figure out. Apparently, you might be able to set the bulbs to turn on automatically at scheduled sunset time for your area, and turn off at dawn. Or easier than that, turn on and off at specific times automatically. I couldn't figure out these controls at all, though. I pushed and punched a lot of buttons throughout the app, but couldn't make headway at programming the bulbs to do what I wanted. Overall, the app is rather non-intuitive and quite frustrating, with little to no documentation (at least that I could find). Hopefully, though, the app will be improved with time, because these lightbulbs are designed to last. With their 25 year expected lifetime, they will clearly outlive any devices you might use to control them. So the controls will no, doubt, evolve and improve.As I decided where and how to put these bulbs into service, I began to really think through the concept of controlling lightbulbs through apps. While it sounds like a cool idea initially, in practice, it doesn't make as much sense as you might think. Does it really make sense to have to reach for your phone in order to turn a bulb off or on when you're sitting right beside your lamp? And what about other people in your house? How convenient is it for them to have to ask you to get out your phone in order to turn the lamp off if they're sitting right beside it? And if you decide to add motion sensors to turn on bulbs automatically when you enter a room, do you really want the bulbs to turn on every time you enter the room, even when it's daylight? Maybe it might be more convenient after all to control the bulbs manually. Most bulbs, that is. There are some locations, however, when bulbs like these make a lot of sense and are the perfect solution. For instance, if you have a sentinel lamp, one that you use to show that someone is home in your house. With bulbs like these, you can program them to turn on and off at certain hours, or control them remotely, even from the other side of the world through the internet. And if you add a motion sensor, you can add further suggestions that someone is home, through turning on these or other bulbs around your house. So for security purposes, these bulbs are great.I really like these bulbs a lot. They provide great quality light, and through the app, you can dim them, even if they're in lamps that don't provide dimming controls. Like other LED bulbs, these bulbs are mercury-free, so they're safer than CFLs. They use only a tiny bit of electricity compared to regular incandescents, so they're cheaper to run. They will last for decades. So, let's hope the next generation of the control app lives up to the promise of the bulb's capabilities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E2O4GBO518GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLTUG0#wasThisHelpful","R3E2O4GBO518GS","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a battery operated cordless electric shaver for facial hair. The shaver weighs 4.3 ounces. It is 6  inches long, 2  wide, and 3 inches deep at its widest points. It runs on a rechargeable lithium battery. Also included in the box are a snap-on side burn trimmer, a transformer/cord that works with either 110 or 220 V input, a zippered hard shell carrying case, a plastic cleaning/recharging station, a plastic cleaning cartridge with cleaning fluid designed to last 3 months, and a 40 page product guide in English. Controls on the handle turn power, speed settings (3 choices), and a travel lock. LED indicators on the handle light up to show the need for cleaning (after every use), travel lock on, battery charge level, replace shaving heads, and blocked shaving heads. A full charge can take as long as an hour, and provides up to 50 minutes of shaving time, or the shaver can be plugged in for just 5 minutes to provide a one-shave quick-charge. The shaver cannot be operated when plugged in. The shaver itself is water resistant so it can be used in the shower, but the cleaner unit must not get wet. The cleaner unit stands 10 inches tall and is 6 inches in diameter, so it takes up a hefty footprint on the counter. To use the cleaning unit, you snap the razor in place and press the on button. Active cleaning takes 10 minutes, followed by a drying cycle of 4 hours. Meanwhile, the razor is also charged while it is being cleaned. Alternatively, you can plug the razor directly into the charger instead of charging it with the cleaning unit, if, for instance, you are travelling and don't want to carry the cleaning unit with you. The razor and trimmer can also be cleaned by hand under a tap with running water if the cleaning unit is not available.My husband is quite impressed with this shaver. It gives a closer, more comfortable shave than his old razor, a Norelco Sensotouch3D, which was also a really good shaver, but this one is even better. The travel case is quite handy, as is the travel lock control. He found that the scent in the cleaning cartridge was somewhat overwhelming, so he won't be using the cleaning system until Norelco comes out with an unscented cleaning cartridge. He also finds the LED indicator lights on the handle a bit dim, hard to read unless he is in a dark room. Another possible problem is that the shaving heads and trimmer are separate snap-on pieces on this shaver, so they could get lost more easily than with shavers where these pieces are more permanently attached. Overall, though, the closeness and comfort of the shave with this shaver far outweigh any of these issues. My husband is extremely satisfied with this razor and it has replaced his former favorite, the Sensotouch 3D.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2255CK5EKTF25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1E5G9S#wasThisHelpful","R2255CK5EKTF25","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an electric toaster oven for baking small casseroles and cakes. The oven weighs a little over 13 pounds. Outer dimensions are 9 inches deep, 21 inches wide, and 12 inches tall. The oven area itself measures 12 inches deep, 9 inches tall, and 16.5 inches long. The slots for the baking rack are halfway up, so the distance from the rack to the top of the inside is 5. There is a clip on one side wall that holds the rack firmly so that it doesn't tip or fall out. According to the manufacturer, the oven will accommodate a 9x13 baking pan or a 12 pizza. There are heating elements top and bottom. All visible parts of the oven are made of steel, the sides, the top, the rack, the control knobs, except for the door, which is thick tempered glass, and the side attachments for the handle and feet (the oven stands an inch above the countertop). The electric cord is 24 long, grounded and 3 pronged. The 3 knobs on the front control temperature, time, and toast doneness. A red LED indicator light comes on whenever the toaster is in use. The toaster draws approximately 1340 watts when the heating elements are on. In the box, you get the oven itself, a crumb tray, a bake pan, a metal wire rack, and a fold-out paper instruction brochure in English, Spanish, and French. The oven comes with a 2 limited warranty (the warranty does not cover commercial use, misuse, abuse, neglect, product modifications, service outside the purchase country, glass parts, shipping or handling). The appliance is made in China.I was extremely impressed with how well this appliance works as an oven. When I set it for 350 degrees F, it went from room temperature to the target 350 in under 2 minutes. Wow! That's the power of convection! The temperature stayed right at 350 or very close, rising to as much as 365, but never more. While the  oven was baking at 350, the temperature on the outside top surface never went higher than 120 degrees F. This is far better than my old Black & Decker toaster oven, a small non-convection oven, which topped out at 330 after taking 10 minutes to get there, while the top surface reached 200. In general, I'm really impressed with how well this new Black & Decker oven cooks. With the fast heating time and even convection heat, small casseroles and cakes really cook extremely well in this oven. They cook faster in this toaster oven than in my gas oven, with no burnt edges. The convection oven also does a great job of roasting nuts without burning them. The timer knob for the oven is also quite useful. You can use it to set the oven to bake for an exact number of minutes (1-60), or use the ""Stay On"" setting.This oven is really too big to be an effective toaster, though. It's big enough to hold 8 slices of toast at once. But the toast cycle takes a full 7 minutes. In my old Black & Decker oven, toast took only 2 minutes. Since the electric draw is about the same for both toasters, that means that the new oven takes 3 times as much electricity for each round of toast (although the old toaster only holds 3-4 slices).  So, while you can use this new Black & Decker oven for making toast, it wouldn't be my go-to toasterit's too slow and expensive for everyday toasting.For the right purposes, however, this is a very impressive and useful appliance. It would be an ideal small oven for someone without a full kitchen, enabling fast and safe baking, even of casseroles and frozen pizzas. It could be useful in RVs with limited kitchens, for example, or student apartments or dorm rooms. Given how well the convection function works, it would also be useful as a supplemental oven in a fully equipped kitchen, great for baking small to medium dishes without heating the whole house up. It would make a wonderful housewarming or wedding present. Overall, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKL1UW2QOORJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I428#wasThisHelpful","RKL1UW2QOORJG","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This cube is for optimizing camera and software lighting settings for digital photography. The cube measures 1.5 inches square and weighs 1 ounce. It has 3 black sides, one fully grey side with the Spyder cube logo printed in white, and 2 sides that are diagonally half grey and half white. The cube is designed to be screwed onto a tripod mount by the bottom corner, which is surrounded by the 3 black sides. One of the black sides should face the camera when in use; this side has a  inch hole designed to act as a black trap. In this orientation the 2 half and half sides will be facing up and meeting at the corner pointing to the camera, with the white sides lower and the grey sides above, meeting at the top corner of the cube. On the very top of the cube is a plastic ball painted shiny silver (or maybe it's some sort of metal rather than plastic) with a black elastic loop sticking out the very top. Also included in the package are a nylon carrying pouch, a black neck strap with a quick release clip, and a paper insert in Italian, German, French, Spanish, English, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and 2 versions of Chinese. The instructions say Place the Cube in lighting conditions under which you will be photographing. Orient the cube so that the lower black face, containing the black trap, is at the bottom front, and the two split white/gray faces are both visible. Take a photograph that includes the Cube. This photo will capture important information about the shooting conditions, to be use in making basic RAW adjustments. After you take all your photos in the location where you set the cube, you go to your digital processing software, such as LightRoom, and use the photo of the cube as a reference to adjust white balance, exposure, brightness and blacks. One way to do this is by using the eyedropper tool in your software and clicking on the photo of the better lit (lit by primary light source) grey face of the cube, since it is 18% grey, or the black trap of the cube to set black levels. Thus, the cube works much like an 18% grey card, but with the greater sophistication of the silver ball to hunt for catch lights and the black trap for finding absolute blacks.I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this cube. I had expected some bit of software or plugin, given the price of the product, but coming up with how to use the information captured in a photo of the cube is really up to you. I thought the cube would work like a grey card, but would have the added convenience of greater portability.  Since the cube really needs a tripod to stand on its own, that may mean using a second tripod, which rather negates the portability advantage. Overall, I found the printed instructions extremely obtuse and hard to follow. On one side of the instruction page are some drawings without words. If you study the drawings for a while, you may figure out what they are trying to say. The drawings do convey some important information not covered in the textual instructions, however, such as the need for a tripod to mount the cube on. Neither the drawings nor the textual instructions mention the included neck strap with the quick release clip. I have no idea how the strap is intended to be used with the product, or what the quick release clip might clip to. At the end of the sparse verbal instructions is a link that says For more information: www dot datacolor dot com slash sypdercube. That link leads to a webpage that points to an article on using the cube posted on another website; the linked article is now defunct. So, you're on your own. If you know enough about photography to appreciate the design of this little plastic cube and how to use it, you may find it very useful. For instance, if you already rely heavily on grey cards, this could take your exposure adjustments to a new level. But if you don't know how to use a grey card or you already get good results without one, you may find this little plastic cube bewildering.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1181B0CXBM83D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002D4AHT0#wasThisHelpful","R1181B0CXBM83D","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a serrated knife suitable for cutting bread or vegetables with soft smooth skins like tomatoes. The blade is 8"" long, and it has a 5"" rubber grip handle, so the knife is 13"" long in total. The blade is solid stainless hardened steel from its tip through the heel of the handle. The rubber grip wraps around the handle in one solid piece; thus this knife is not going to fall apart or split if it gets wet. The knife weighs 6 ounces and feels very well balanced in the hand. The scallops of the serrations are on the right side of the blade only and start 1/2"" back from the tip (this 1/2"" of flat blade at the tip is sharpened as well). The blade shows a slight taper from cutting edge to the top. Instructions on the packaging say to hand wash this knife and promptly dry.This knife cuts very well, but what I really like about it is how it feels in my hand. It's simply very comfortable to cut with. When I'm cutting with this knife, I feel a lot less likely to bruise my knuckles as I often did with my old bread knife, which had a narrower wooden handle. The solid rubber grip on this handle is never going to work its way loose, even with repeated washings. This knife is excellent for bread and anything else with a soft texture that needs a sawing action to cut. For tomatoes, I would actually prefer a knife with a sharp point at the tip to remove the cores, and that's something this knife doesn't have. But if core removal isn't an issue, this knife certainly slices tomatoes well. Overall, this knife is an excellent, durable kitchen tool and my first choice for slicing bread.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32X72TH3D6WX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13OF2#wasThisHelpful","R32X72TH3D6WX5","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is WiFi range extender for that enables you to greatly extend the coverage of your current wireless router. In the box, you get the WiFi extender device and 3 installation guides (English, Spanish, French). The device measures approximately 2x2 inches on the face, and sticks out 1.5 from the wall when plugged in. It has swiveling antennae on both the left and right sides that are 2.5 long. There is an Ethernet port on the bottom of the device for wired connections. To install the device, you simply plug it into the wall and wait about 30 seconds for the power LED indicator light on the front to turn solid green. Then you need to connect the device to your home network. You can do this either through WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) or by first connecting to the device with a wireless computer or phone, then finishing the setup through a browser. LED indicator lights on the front of the device signal whether the device has a good connection to your home network, a good connection to a WiFi client device, and power and WPS status. To make this device work, you must already have a wireless (WiFi) router in place and working in your home; you also need to have Internet service.It took me about 15 minutes to unpack this box and get the device working extending my home network. The biggest challenge for me was making sense of the directions, which are a bit sparse. In any case, setup isn't that hard at all. Here's one way to do it:1. Plug in the network extender to an electric socket as close as possible to your home network router (in the same room is plenty close).2. Wait for the power LED on the front to turn green (10 to 30 seconds).3. On a computer or mobile device, find and join the new network. That is, join the network just as you would join any other new network in a library, cafe, or business. Depending on what you are using for a computer, you may need to go to SettingsNetwork Settings, or Control PanelNetwork Settings, or Network Connections, or... (This is where the printed instructions are a bit vague, since they are trying to use language that will work regardless of the operating system, rather than providing specific instructions for each type of operating system or computer.)4. Once you have join the extender's network, open a web browser and type in the address bar: www dot mywifiext dot net.5. This will bring up a list of nearby networks. Choose your home network from the list.  Press the continue button.6. Choose a name and security settings for the new extended network (or choose to make them the same as the home network's settings).7. Unplug the extender device and move it to where you need it, close enough to the router that you get a decent signal from the router, but also close to the area that needs coverage.8. Once the power LED turns green in the new location, you can join the extended network (the same way you did in step 3, but using SettingsNetwork Settings, Control PanelNetwork Settings, etc.). You are now good to go!Alternatively, you can set up the extender by pairing it with the router by pressing the WPS buttons on both the router and the extender and waiting for them to find each other. Then you connect with the new extended network in your usual manner (Step 3 above).Once I installed the network extender, I was quite pleased with how it works. I can now stream movies in my garage, where before I could barely get a wireless signal at all. The WiFi signal from the new extender reaches through walls and windows, and the coverage area seems larger than that of my original router. With the router and the extender working together as a team, I now have WiFi signal through every room of my house, my garage, and most of my yard as well. The Ethernet port on the bottom of the extender is also quite handy for connecting devices that require wired connections. Overall, I found this device relatively easy to set up and it performs quite well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36062E62BP583/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0YLRUW#wasThisHelpful","R36062E62BP583","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heavy duty, bright bulb suitable for PAR30 fixtures. It is designed to run on varying voltages, from 90V to 277V, so it can be used on 220V circuit as well as on a US standard 110 circuit. It provides 1100 lumens, which is approximately equivalent to a 75 to 85W incandescent bulb. It has a plastic head and plastic side fins to shed heat. Not that there is much heat to shedthis bulb runs very cool, even compared to similar CFL PAR30 bulbs. But unlike CFL bulbs, this bulb is mercury-free. Thus, it's safer all aroundunlikely to ever shatter or explode and it won't cause a hazardous spill or toxic waste diposal problem. It is rated for 25000 hours, more than twice as long as a comparable CFL PAR30, and more than ten times as long as a comparable incandescent PAR 30. Thus, replacement costs are much lower with this bulb, especially if you factor in labor costs or the dangers involved in replacing bulbs in tricky, hard-to-reach fixtures.This bulb will save you a bundle of money in the long run:Total costs (purchase/replacement + electricity over life of the bulb, assuming $.12/kwh)--this LED bulb (1 needed for 25000 hours): $77.69--23W CFL PAR 30 (2.5 needed for 25000 hours): $98.75--100W incandescent PAR 30 (12.5 needed for 25000 hours): $409.64As soon as I opened the package, I knew I was holding quality. The bulb simply feels well constructed. Also, I really like the light color from this bulb. With a temperature of 4100K, it is whiter than a clear metal halide bulb, and nearly as white as a daylight CFL. Thus, colors under this bulb don't have that yellowish distortion that you often find under an incandescent bulb. The ability to use this bulb in 220 volt circuits is another plus. Overall, if you are in need of a heavy duty, bright PAR30 bulb, this is an excellent choice that works well and saves money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZ2P33M0NOR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCY92YU#wasThisHelpful","R1BZ2P33M0NOR3","A4H4KYSM2KQ85","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4H4KYSM2KQ85?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this computer! I just bought a Dell Inspiron 15 #7547 several months ago and was never completely happy with it. This Dell i7559 Full HD is hands down, wonderful!!! This computer is fast, works wonderfully (despite the worries over Windows 10), and I am 100 percent blown away by the performance and graphics. I've played games for hours on this PC and have had no heating issues at all. Others have reported over heating, but I've not experienced it with this unit.I had the wifi drop off problem that many have complained about and while it was annoying before I knew what was causing it, once I read the previous reviews and realized it was a Windows problem, I went to Dell.com and downloaded the current drivers for this computer. I have had no wifi connection problems since I upgraded the system and it took only a few minutes to fix the problem.I installed my Sims 3 games and I can't believe how great the graphics are for such a hoggy game. On my last laptop much of the content was not shown due to the memory and graphics. On this computer, I can see the people drive in their cars through the town. Before, they got in the car and just arrived at their destination, now I can see everything on the game that I couldn't see before and it is very cool.My last Dell had some kind of weird keyboard issues but this computer works flawlessly and I really recommend it. This computer is a little heavy and it's plastic where the casing on my other Dell is metal. I don't really like the plastic, but in this case, I cannot complain because the computer is awesome. I am so happy with this Dell compared with my past Dell purchases.Other people have commented that this has room for easy expansion-which is a huge plus as well. I did uninstall MacAfee which I don't like and installed my Norton for which I have a subscription-I had no trouble with this. The only trouble I've had is with Windows 10-seems it wasn't quite ready for Primetime, but in time the wifi glitches and browser problems will be addressed.For laptop gaming, I find this computer perfect!! It's crisp, fast and has great graphics for a laptop-for the price, this laptop is really, really great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R250IPOTVUI2U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PYYDMQ#wasThisHelpful","R250IPOTVUI2U9","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been taking CoQ10 for quite a while for the heart healthy antioxidants it provides. I found this to be a good version of the supplement and I trust Viva Labs and only use their brand of coconut oil. I also like Jarrow, but the CoQ10 that I have already been taking is Viva Labs. I did some research and for this supplement, you want a small, dark pill which is what this CoQ10 is. Jarrow states that this is a high absorption source-many you buy are not but people take them any way. This CoQ10 is made in a way that is absorbed and not wasted. This is an important nutrient that is harder to make in your body on its on as you age-as you get older this is a good supplement to keep your heart and vascular system in good shape.I find Viva Labs to be a trusted brand and I've had no trouble taking this form of CoQ10.

"This hand cream works very well to protect hands and keep them moisturized while creating a barrier against dryness. I was expecting this to be a thick, heavy cream, but instead, it is light and moisturizes winter hands very well while keeping them nice and soft with regular use. The main ingredient in this cream is mineral oil. I was definitely expecting this to be a heavier and perhaps more greasy than it is. This is a much lighter cream than I thought it would be. This is more of an everyday moisturizer rather than a dry skin treatment. This does make skin nice and soft and provides some protection against the elements with regular use. This isn't a miracle cure but it does help for winter dryness or it works for hands that are over worked in the elements such as outside cold air or with drying chemical cleaners, etc. I have found this to be a nice, everyday hand moisturizer to help keep my hands nice and soft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J80ATBTMIFVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVWL7S#wasThisHelpful","R3J80ATBTMIFVL","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading The Longest Night. For a first time novelist, Andria Williams does a great job contrasting the family life of a military family with a failing reactor the husband, Paul is assigned to work on in Idaho Falls. This book takes place in 1959 and it sums up the life of a military wife very well.Nat Collier has a lot to adjust to. She was raised in Southern California. When she marries Paul she is under the thumb of the military with him. When Paul is assigned to a nuclear reactor in Idaho, they move with their two young daughters to an isolated military town where women and children live while their husbands work on the reactors. The reactor Paul is assigned to - Cr-1 by all appearances, is failing. Due to the master sergeant not wanting to stir anything up with the upper brass, the reactor's troubles are chalked up to Cr-1 being old and the crew is forced to keep her going with band-aids.After an confrontation with the unscrupulous master sergeant, Paul is punished and sent to the Arctic for a year to work on another reactor leaving Nat alone. Befriending a local, she gets by with the help of Esrom-the scandal! When Paul comes home, he has to deal with his growing family, his wife, as well as the reactor which has grown worse in its troubles in his absence.I think Andria Williams did a great job describing the stifling surroundings Idaho Falls held for Nat and an even better job describing the work Paul did on the reactor. Even I, who knows relatively nothing about the workings of a nuclear facility, could imagine the reactor and its problems and the growing concerns regarding it. While this is a work of fiction about an actual occurrence, Andria gives further reading suggestions for those who find the topic of her story of interest.This is a well done first novel and I will happily pick up further writings from this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI0R54H8542E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812997743#wasThisHelpful","RRI0R54H8542E","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book could use a few more recipes but I do like the invitation ideas and it has some cute templates and over all ideas. I think what this party book is lacking is more. Each section: Invitations, decorations, Cakes & Drinks, Games, Party Favors could all use a few more ideas. Each section has four or five ideas and this could have been a good book with a little more meat added to it. This book is basically floating on the Frozen franchise.

"This is another great study guide from Melissa Spoelstra. The last book workbook I have by her covers the book of Jeremiah and this workbook covers the story of Joseph. I highly recommend both. Spoelstra's books are relatively dense, full of stories, questions and food for thought. In this book, Joseph, we work on forgiveness and letting go of bitterness. The books that Spoelstra writes are not only food for thought, but food for the soul. The recommended reading in the back of the book is another plus and provides further reading suggestions for your studies. Forgiveness and letting go are big issues and some people hang on to resentment and bitterness forever. Joseph, Bible Study, helps to inform you on how to let go of anger, resentment and bitterness through stories, lessons and scripture. I don't just recommend it for women, or for study groups, anyone can work in these books and grow. When I finish a lesson in her books, I always feel like I've learned something important. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, we get caught up in the trivialities of life. Melissa's books really put life into perspective and teach lessons from the Bible. Whether you are fully familiar with the Bible or reading it for the first time-her study guides help you understand the messages more fully to gain great insight and become a better person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207Q9V3L68UPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426789106#wasThisHelpful","R207Q9V3L68UPR","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very cool cat tree. My cats in particular like the hanging ropes and the hidey holes. This is a tall unit, up to the ceiling and it's covered with soft fake furry stuff-not carpet but a little lighter than carpet. The boxes and platforms are heavy and made from particle board making it a sturdy cat tree. The ladders and scratching posts are great for playing and scratching. My cats also just like to perch on top and look down upon the dogs.I did take away one star for the directions. Granted, my husband didn't have too much trouble, but I hate to think what this would have looked like if I didn't have help putting it together. My husband builds stuff so he was really good with the instructions but for me, I found them vague. The pieces, with the exception of the scratching posts, are not marked according to the directions. We did have a couple of false starts where we had to take our beginnings apart and start over until my husband got the hang of the directions of building from the top down. Other than the instructions, I really like this cat tree and so do the cats. It took us about an hour or an hour and a half to build.This unit is large but can easily be taken from one area to another so once you build it, you can change its place and try different locations-it is not too heavy that you can't relocate it.The material covering the boards is a tad thin. I would have preferred a little heavier covering but this does look nice and it's a light beige color and kind of blends in with any color..All in all, for the price, this is a very nice cat tree with lots to do for the kitties.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V3V7BVW8F389/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250EM#wasThisHelpful","R2V3V7BVW8F389","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first mixed this with my old dog's food, it looked like he was eating around it. I held my breath for a second and then he started eating this up like crazy until the bowl was completely empty. I've not tried Eukanuba pet foods before and I use a good quality dry dog food for all my dogs. I have one mid aged that likes this just fine too. I gave a couple of handfuls to the bully and he totally loves it-though he's not old enough yet. My ancient dog likes this very much. I always have reservations regarding pet foods that list meal as the first ingredient-as in this food. Then I started thinking that in the wild, animals are not always picky about what they eat. Meals, such as chicken meal use by products-things you and I won't eat and grind them up into a meal for pet foods. It surprises me the cost of foods that use by products are still really expensive-foods such as this, but they do compensate with other ingredients and nutrients such as brewers yeast and they add good vitamins.I am still not sold on by products completely. I feel they are still a cheap filler. That said, my old dog is loving this so much I may have to get some for him when this bag is finished. He is very old for a big dog and if he likes this that much and the food helps him with old age issues, this is a huge plus and is why I am giving Senior Maintenance five stars. Normally, I don't rate foods that use by products this high, but my dog loves this and I think with the added nutrients, this is a good choice for a senior dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15B1R8DNNHVA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000633U58#wasThisHelpful","R15B1R8DNNHVA6","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My cats normally eat Purina Pro for Sensitive Systems since we took in a stray that seemed to do very well with this food. She's gone but our other cats like that food a lot so we just kept getting it. I was eager to try this type of Pro Plan and our cats like this very well too. They like it better than the last really 'healthy' food we tried. I have a bit of a problem with meals and this contains a meal, though the first ingredient listed is salmon. I was thinking however, meal is all kinds of stuff that isn't human grade, but in the wild, if a creature is hungry it may eat parts of an animal that humans wouldn't-with the exception of certain things that are ground up in the 'meal' for food-so my opinion is that meal is a cheap filler that may not be that healthy. That said, all three of our cats are eating this up and enjoying it. They don't seem to like the really healthy, expensive cat foods that are on the market so this one is a go for them and they are the ones eating it. I do think this is a pretty fair brand as far as healthy and likeable for cats.

I thought at first that this product was a dark circle treatment but the more I used it the more I realized this is a treatment for under make-up or when you want circles lightened up such as from a bad night's sleep. This is a light colored cream and a little bit goes a long way. The directions say to use it with the applicator above and below the eye area, and rub with the tip until it's absorbed. This is a long lasting tube that does provide results. This isn't a treatment however, but more of a cosmetic type product. You could probably get the same results using a concealer that you do with this product, although, I find this cream unique with its light color and metal applicator. This is an interesting product that does lighten under eye circles pretty well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGUR56EKFT16B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HR1JRTU#wasThisHelpful","RGUR56EKFT16B","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Tresemme hairspray because I ran out of spray but didn't have time to go to Sally's for what I normally buy, I am very surprised at how well it works. This Voluminous Hold hairspray provides a great hold but it doesn't make hair stiff. When this is on my hair, my hair still has a lot of bounce and a more natural look than with most hairsprays. It provides the perfect amount of hold without looking lacquered up and stiff. This also provides some nice shine. I thought I would try it because it's new and it wasn't expensive and I could use it for a backup for when I run out of my normal spray. This works so well, I might switch-I am not in a hurry to buy my normal brand since this is working so well.I have very straight hair that I style with a flat iron. This holds great and is easy to wash out. When I use this, it holds my style very well, adds shine and my hair looks natural and not weighed down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1093XW3FCUNB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJDWC#wasThisHelpful","R1093XW3FCUNB4","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last book I read was rather depressing, so The Shrunken Head was a delight for me to read. At first glance, I was thinking, here we go again, but alas, I was enchanted by the story and found the characters and plot fresh and fun. I enjoyed how this series with orphans, takes place in the 1930s. If I am not mistaken, the 30s gave rise to yellow journalism and tabloids. The four children involved in this tale: Sam, Thomas, Pip and Max find themselves the target of such a journalist when the famed and cursed Shrunken Head that takes center stage in their show at Dumfrey's Dime Museum of Freaks goes missing. The four find themselves stars in the local paper, and not in a good way.Each child has an uncanny ability which makes them stars of the somewhat defunct museum and sideshow. The Shrunken Head seems to breathe new life into the exhibit until it is stolen and the curse causes people connected to the head to mysteriously die. Danger comes hideously close to the children and they have to solve the mystery of the missing head before any more people, especially those closest to them, die.This was a fun, fun, fun book that I really enjoyed. I hope the targeted age group loves this book. I am a bit older, and really enjoyed it. Once the story got rolling, I had a hard time putting Curiosity House down. There are good characters, plot twists and turns, plenty of suspenseful moments, humor and great artwork in the story and I look forward to many more books in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVYV9Y2N6QM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062270818#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVYV9Y2N6QM8","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loves this Artist Studio. At first, I thought the light wasn't quite bright enough, but we've actually had a lot of fun with this kit. My daughter is in advanced art classes, and really likes this! She's pretty creative and has a lot of fun putting the faces together with the transparencies included in this Light Up Trace Case Kit and drawing them on the backgrounds provided.For blank paper we used regular copy paper and can make up our own scenes with the many transparencies that come with this. The surface of the light box is sturdy and you can tuck in the background and then put the transparencies underneath. At first, I wasn't that impressed with the set up, but an artist's eyes can create from anything. Kids can really spend hours drawing and then coloring their creations.This isn't a true light box type of tracing box, but it is a lot of fun for kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RF4X08OYZZNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHGG3HO#wasThisHelpful","R2RF4X08OYZZNS","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great moisturizing cream. It's rich and thick and better yet, it lasts for hours. I can put this on under make-up as well as on my neck and hours later I can still feel the softness on my skin. This is also a great nighttime moisturizer. This is a very versatile cream for day or night use. It works flawlessly under make-up and it works very well in conjunction with the Vichy Neovadiol Magistral Elixir. These two products together are wonderful and are useful in the anti-aging arena.I've had not breakouts with this product as I have experienced with other moisturizers and this really works to soften dry skin. I had a cold where around my nose, my skin got chapped and dry but this cream cleared up the dryness in no time. This is a really wonderful moisturizing cream that I can't say has had any drawbacks for me, only benefits so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37UJ98J9U9PWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010MGNK8#wasThisHelpful","R37UJ98J9U9PWB","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Free Men is great historical fiction. Katy Simpson Smith has recreated a dramatic account of three very different men, and the man who hunts them through the Alabama woods. I really enjoyed reading this book. The hardships faced by all made me happy I live now and not in 1788. Each man involved in this story has his own story and history and the readings of these is almost harrowing. Bob, a slave, dreams of escape and makes a run for it. White man, Cat, has lived a difficult life from birth and Istillicha, the Indian, is recovering from trauma and betrayal which led him to take a leave from his tribe. The three join up on the road and when faced with an opportunity that could change their lives, they take it and commit a horrible crime.Investigator Le Clerc works for the Creek chief, Seloatka and he is sent to track Cat, Bob and Istillicha and punish them for their crimes. Through the dense wilderness the three men try to get to Florida with Le Clerc on their tails. In between their day to day survival, the author deftly takes the reader back through the lives of each character, including Le Clerc.This story is based on a real happening which makes this a wonderfully intriguing read if you enjoy reading historical history. Life in 1788 was pretty crazy and this book is so well done that it's like time travel. I can tell if I am really enjoying a book by the amount of time I spend telling others about it and I spent a lot of time telling my family about this book as I was reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300AJ2VCSJEIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062407597#wasThisHelpful","R300AJ2VCSJEIS","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really love the Vichy moisturizers I've tried and was looking forward to using this corrective concealer. I think this works better on blemishes than under the eye. In order for this to correct some darkness under my eyes, I have to use several layers and even then, I can still see my darker circles. This works great as a corrector for spots or blemishes but not that great for underneath the eyes. It gets a little thick when I have to use so many layers plus foundation so I am not completely thrilled with the results of this corrective concealer stick. I do love the other products that I've tried from Vichy-including their dry oil and moisture cream. This color maybe a little light to correct my under eye circles but it's fairly close to my skin tone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R666DMAZ5VYH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW6ZV6K#wasThisHelpful","R666DMAZ5VYH6","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dogs seem to enjoy this Solid Gold Wolf King food. It does have a cool name. My bully likes it the most. The pieces of dog food in this variety are larger than in the food I normally buy for them but my dogs are all large so this doesn't seem to be an issue. I like to look into the ingredients in the food. The first ingredient in this is bison and the second is fish meal. I am not a huge fan of meals because it generally means all left over parts of the said animal. Like for example chicken meal can include all parts of the chicken they don't normally use, all ground up. That sounds gross, I know but fish meal is the same, all parts they wouldn't normally use are ground up and put into dog food. That said, there are also other good ingredients in this food such as carrots and sweet potatoes. There are a lot of Omegas in this food as well which is good for skin and coat. They include probiotics and other vitamins and oils such as salmon oil, sesame oil and almond oil. These types of fats are good for your dog. The fillers in this food seem to be rice bran, potato, and oatmeal. There are some really good ingredients in this food and it's made in such a way that my dogs will eat it. They usually are not thrilled with potato but like this food just fine. In comparison with our normal, grain free dog food, this does contain a bit more vegetables and fruit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8XOR2NKKB7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PAV22F0#wasThisHelpful","R3S8XOR2NKKB7K","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading The Curse Of Crow Hollow. While it did take me a bit longer to read than I had anticipated, I did enjoy the story: good vs. evil in a small town. Crow Hollow could be anywhere. It's nestled in a valley and up on a hill near an old abandoned mine, there lives a witch. She's lived up there for years in a tiny shack, banished from society where folks in town just as soon forget there ever was an Alveretta Graves. Things stay fairly separated and memories and secrets stay buried until a group of teens enter the forbidden zone and stir up some stuff with the witch. The girls who snuck up to the mines all suffer from strange afflictions-the result of which could only mean that Alvaretta has hexed them. When other girls begin to show strange illnesses, it's believed that Alveretta has cursed the whole town, and something must be done. Rumor has it that the witch is hiding a demon up there on the mountain.This is kind of a half Twilight Zone and half character study of folks who live in a tiny town with their children. It's about buried secrets, paranoia and the consequences of evil and guilt are heavily studied here. I hadn't read Billy Coffey in the past but I will definitely read his books in the future. I liked the atmosphere and the message of his book and I like the way the book was narrated like a story being told. I haven't read a book by Billy Coffey before, but I will definitely read his books in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JQGHM8DYT0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718026772#wasThisHelpful","R2JQGHM8DYT0V","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Iron Shop Butterfly Kinetic Wind Spinner is an interesting piece of yard art that you set up and the wind spins the two circles of butterflies in separate directions. This is easy to set up but getting the butterflies just right takes a little time. At first I had one side spinning wonderfully while the other sat there but eventually, I got all the butterflies bent to the right angles and both sides are spinning in the wind. I was afraid with all the bending I did on the butterflies that one would come loose because they are not attached that well for a lot of tinkering, but all butterflies stayed intact. The butterflies are pretty and they sparkle in the sun as they go around and around in the wind.That said, this piece is a bit expensive. It is sturdy and will withstand rain and wind. Make sure when you set it up that you tighten the bolts that hold the spinners - they were loose so just a quick tightening is all they need. I really like the spinner. It brightens up the yard and looks very pretty in the sunshine but it seems a little costly overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE00GPMCUF2T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CUOKNS#wasThisHelpful","RE00GPMCUF2T9","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Jarrow supplements and find they are always on the cutting edge for creating new products that can enhance your life. I already take Jarrow's Mag Mind and really love the product. My elderly Mom takes it too and she finds that it really makes a difference with her memory. I like the Mag Mind too as it has a magnesium that crosses the brain barrier and helps you sleep better and improves cognitive function. This supplement contains a Nootropic which is a neuro and cognitive enhancer. This supplement also helps with stress and maintains the level of cortisol your brain releases over time especially in times of stress. This is very cool stuff. I have found I am a bit more relaxed with this supplement and I sleep very well. We get a month's supply to try and sometimes it is or isn't long enough for a supplement. The time I have taken this supplement, I've noticed no adverse reactions. I am a  bit calmer and I like the idea of this working with stress and cognitive functions.

"I like this cleanser. It has a soft fragrance and uses good ingredients to slough off dead skin and cleans my face very well. I have been putting a little powder on a small, wet sponge each night and I find that this cleanser rinses off easily and leaves my skin nice and smooth without drying it.The packaging can use a lot of improvement though. When I opened the bubble pack it came in, a puff of cleanser came up from inside. The lid had opened causing the contents to spill. This won't go over well with customers. The lid needs to be secure prior to shipping so it doesn't spill during the trip and lose the contents of the bottle. That's the only problem I have so far with this cleansing powder. I like the product and it works great, but the packaging needs some plastic on the top or something to secure it to keep the lid from opening. A little of this goes a long way and it works well to clean skin and has a nice scent. I've not heard of cleansing powder before and I find that I like the concept a lot. This leaves my skin clean, nice and soft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGDXREFOOIYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6C8WM#wasThisHelpful","R3VGDXREFOOIYR","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have done a little research on Maca Powder since trying this product. The first and foremost thing I've read is that it shouldn't be eaten raw. This can cause some stomach troubles. The best way to use this powder is to cook it first. The Maca craze reminds me of the Matcha craze where everyone began selling Matcha whether it was the real thing or not. Starbucks even calls its ground wheatgrass, Matcha, for example.This is a good product taken in small doses and cooked. I just boil mine and add it to a smoothie every now and then. It's a potent food. If you read any blog regarding this food from a Peruvian, they all say to cook it and that raw Maca isn't good for you.This product is also great to add to cookies or breads for good health benefits. I've not tried this raw but you can add a bit to foods without changing the taste too much as long as you don't use too much powder.

"I've learned so much from reading Ocean Country. The bleaching of the coral reefs was a real eye opener as was the thought process that we do not just live alone in our homes, in our towns and in our states, we live on the earth and when you think of the outside world as well as the inside world, as We, it really changes the way you think-(I am not sure I explained that coherently, but read the book and it will make total sense). After reading this, I went to Reyes Beach and picked up trash on Coastal Clean Up Day which is an annual event that takes place each September and has for the past 30 years. This year with the threat of El Nino flooding California, people are worried all the trash will be washed ultimately into the sea. The problems of pollution and habitat loss (and over fishing) for animals is a worry. If you personally take care of what you can do and do things that will help - it makes a difference from a grassroots perspective. If it all overwhelms you, you can be paralyzed. There is still time but we have to pay attention. This book gives a lot to think about in that regard.Liz Cunningham has written a very good and thoughtful book about ""Our"" oceans and the ocean creatures we should be respecting and caring for-if we want our children's children to be able to eat fish and enjoy the ocean as we once knew it. If we don't do it, who will? This is a very thought provoking, good book to read if you are interesting in the oceans at all. This is also about her journey and not just the environment. Cunningham's journey is inspiring and her writing of this book is important. Read it and do what you can to help save the oceans for future generations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDUV4M7CJB33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583949607#wasThisHelpful","RSDUV4M7CJB33","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Honest Kitchen has created minimalist food for dogs and while, it doesn't look like much-it reminds me a little of horse food, but my dogs really like this dehydrated food, a lot. This recipe has 6 ingredients: turkey, navy beans, parsnip, pumpkin, and coconut. There are no preservatives and no fillers in this dog food. You mix it with warm water and wait three minutes until the food is hydrated and then serve it up. A four pound package will make 16 lbs of wet dog food.All three of my large dogs love this food and one of them is a very picky eater. I just mix this with their kibble for breakfast and they eat it all, no crumbs. I really like this food. It's something different for sure and it is healthy with no junk-which certainly can't hurt my senior dog. The only thing I can think of to improve this product is to put the food in ziplock bags. There are two bags in this box of food and they are non sealable plastic bags. I think using sealable bags would help to keep the food fresh in between feedings. I put this food in the gallon sized Ziplock bags to keep it fresh. My dogs really like this food. I will have to see how long this box last in comparison to the canned food that I feed them in addition to their dry food. This seems a bit expensive, but in the long run, it might be well worth the cost. I am going to look into other products by this company. I really don't find that waiting the three minutes for the food to hydrate is an imposition as I can usually busy myself while the food is moistening.

"This leash works really well and keeps your dog safe with lots of room to roam. The handle is comfortable to hold on to and the leash allows for your dog to really roam, and if something pops up, you can safely reel them back in closer to you with no problem. I have a large dog but he's good on a leash so this is sturdy enough to take him for a walk with. I have another dog who is large and not so easy to walk but I have no problems with this leash being strong enough for her either. This is perfect for a medium sized dog though. The clip that secures to the collar is solid and over all this is a very good leash.I received this leash free of charge to test and review.

"The Xen-Tan Fresh Tanning  Mousse can create a nice, even tan. The mousse is easy to work with and the results take a little while to show up. Applying the product a little heavier than usual will result in a darker tone because a light coat doesn't create enough color for a tanned look. This is really easy to apply and the mitt really helps to evenly apply the tan without creating areas that are darker than others. I really like the smoothness of this product and how easy it goes on and the following results. The first time use though, created a very light tanned effect.Tanners can dry your skin and this one is no exception and it caused more dryness than the tanner I have used in the past, but a good moisturizer can fix that. The scent is nice and not too strong.All in all this is a long lasting bottle because a little goes a long way, but you'll want to apply it a bit heavier if you want a darker tan. The mitt makes using the product so much easier, but the product is a bit drying to skin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGFKM939PI37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOL1D66#wasThisHelpful","R3VGFKM939PI37","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like Jesse Ball and have previously read, Silence Once Begun. I think Jesse can write experimental fiction and has the talent to back it up which is why I chose to read, A Cure For Suicide. In my humble opinion, Silence was much better. Cure is very flatly written. Much like the contents which is like a report of sorts, the book reads like a report and is very flat with little tone. This book does share one attribute with Silence in that once read, the end doesn't really justify the cause. There is not a big payoff in either book. But, they are both interesting to a certain degree.I will continue to read books by Jesse Ball because I like his experimental style his work contains enough mystery to interest me and I think he will get better as time goes on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ZA3V0MEBE6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101870125#wasThisHelpful","R28ZA3V0MEBE6E","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Winter Horses is a middle grade book about a young Jewish girl who escapes death at the hands of the Nazis in her small village and ends up in an old Ukrainian zoo that is looked after by an elderly man named Max. The zoo has been overtaken by the SS and many of the animals, much to Max's horror are slaughtered to feed the soldiers. When Max discovers that two very special and nearly extinct Przewalski (pronounced Shuh-VAHL-skeez) horses have been spared and are being tended to by a thin, freezing girl he steps in to help them and puts his own life on the line.Blending magical realism and history, Kerr has spun a unique story of survival during a bleak time in history. The name Kalinka is taken from a Ukrainian folk song and she is a great heroine in this book as she makes her escape from the zoo bound southward to find the Red Army as the SS close in on her and the horses which are to be put to death as they're too deemed an inferior breed and should be cleansed from the Earth.I enjoyed this tale. Though it deals with the random killing of zoo animals by the brutal SS, it isn't too graphic in nature. I enjoyed the tale of Kalinka and her love of animals made the story worthwhile. Old man Max is a gentle soul who adds character and depth to the story. The descriptions of war and brutality are given a go over in this book but not overly so, and I think this is an age appropriate tale for kids who like history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQ43M7868MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385755465#wasThisHelpful","R1IQ43M7868MX","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to reading The Household Spirit. I like the idea of this book and expected maybe something like The Accidental Tourist with quirky characters and some backbone. While there are some facets of interest in this book such as the character, Emily Phane's sleep experiences that cause her to get very little sleep and be sort of disconnected. The thing about this story is that both of the main characters are so awkward that every little thing becomes a big thing-simple gestures and conversations are gone over in detail because they are a big deal in their lives, however, there isn't enough liveliness or substance to make these things interesting. While reading some of these details, I would lose track of what was going on. I think the idea and the premise of this book is good but the execution of it went a bit astray, at least for me. The characters needed some sort of strength to carry this story but they were so inhibited that it made them somewhat boring to read about-though some of the writing is really great. There are some strong points to this story about loss, loneliness and friendship but in between them, it's just so so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22KPSTUQIA3G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307377059#wasThisHelpful","R22KPSTUQIA3G9","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a large bar of soap that's shaped like a huge bean. It is definitely great for the bath because in the shower with my smallish hands I am a bit afraid of dropping it on a toe. This particular bar (Pierrevert) has a powdery soap scent-I don't find it too overwhelming-a little headachy if you smell it too long. It's nice and relaxing for the tub though. The de Provence Soap makes a nice dense lather that works great for shaving your legs and it isn't drying. A little soap goes a long way so this bar will last quit a while.This is great gift-giving soap. It's a huge luxurious bar that comes nestled in a very pretty box. I think I have bought this brand of soap at World Market as a little gift. I like the Shea Butter because it's nice and moisturizing. All in all, I am enjoying this soap-it's a little big, but it should last a long time and it's got extra moisturizing ingredients and a nice scent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PFFFJ6EUIK32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9NR476#wasThisHelpful","R2PFFFJ6EUIK32","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want to read at least one great book this summer, I strongly suggest you pick this one. I feel as though I was transported to Paris, to Avenue Foch from the beginning of the German Occupation and stayed until the liberation-though in reality, it was only a two day stay. From the second I began to peruse the first page as I usually do when I get a new book, I could hardly put this down. Avenue Of Spies by Alex Kershaw has it all: guts and glory, horror, bravery, cowardice, greed, atrocity and heartbreak all with a backdrop of love, kindness and most of all, bravery.Alex Kershaw's writing style is spectacularly simple but gives the reader an acute understanding of what is happening which is rare when I read history, and is a sure sign of a good writer-I have read quite a few books about WWII this year, and this book by far is my favorite-but it's not even the history that is riveting in the pages of this book-it's the story of heroes. In this tale, Kershaw recreates the German Occupation in the City Of Lights. His subject is an American, Dr. Sumner Jackson, who lived on the posh Avenue Foch with his wife, Toquette, and their boy, Phillip. Dr. Sumner was the head doctor at the American Hospital in Paris and if that wasn't enough, he chose to help in the resistance against the Nazis as did Toquette and Phillip. Even when they could have gotten out, they stayed. Even when things got perilously close in danger they didn't leave-when the noose began to tighten on Foch Avenue and they were surrounded by the enemy, they stood firm.This book is inspirational. It could change a life. It could inspire you, dear reader, to be bigger than yourself. With the example of the human beings in the pages of this book, you could be bigger and better than ever and aspire to do good things. This is no mere history book, though the history is appallingly real, this book is more about humans at their best and their worst. This story is about real people who faced an empire and did not back down though most did. The hunger, the horror, the power the Nazis held over France was impressively strong and Paris fell with a whimper due in part by what had happened in Poland, but in the background there were people such as Sumner, his wife, Louise Marie Dissard, Violette Szabo, British Intelligence and other forces who where chipping away at the regime with the very real cost of being caught and murdered. The Gestapo and the SS had sinister ways in which to capture those in the resistance, such as the Funkspiel, where the Germans would impersonate a British spy after taking control of a their radio. In this way, and others, they were able to crack into the line of resistance fighters and gain valuable information. It was a cat and mouse game on Foch Street and the Sumners never knew when someone would turn them in or confess information after being tortured. Parisians left and right were either working for the Germans or had befriended them.So, if you want to read a really great book-pick this one. This is an incredibly great story. I can't recommend it more. I was literally stuck to this book for two days and while I wasn't reading it, I was talking about it.I would also suggest the Notes in the back of the book for further information and reading. I also see that Alex Kershaw has written several other books and I intend to get them. This is my great book alert for you. There is no way you would be disappointed reading about great heroes in the midst of terrifying danger in the most beautiful city in the world during one of the ugliest wars in history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39XF9FKKPGRZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140030#wasThisHelpful","R39XF9FKKPGRZT","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three cats and three dogs. We live in a rural area where things get dusty. There are tree orchards and vineyards everywhere and the pollen count is very high. This Holmes HEPA Allergen remover helps to keep the air fresh wherever you place it. This unit is nice looking and backs up to a wall or lays flat-it's not too huge or bulky.I've noticed a great difference in air quality and this freshens the air and keeps it clean. I found that my perfect setting is 2. It's quiet but still powerful enough to place in the bedroom. If I want to up the setting I can do so for a few hours but I feel at setting 2 it keeps the air fresh and has a nice hum to it that doesn't bother me. During the hot days that we have, this seems to also keep the room a bit cooler.The filters are easy to replace and are not too expensive when you compare the filters to other brands. This unit notifies you when the carbon filter needs to be replaced. You can also program this air cleaner to run when you want it to. Overall, this is a versatile unit with 4 settings. It's easy to set up and use and looks really nice. It isn't too loud and looks decent.

"The End Of Tsarist Russia is a dense read that very thoroughly details the lead up to WWI and the end of the Tsarist rule over Russia. This is an interesting book in that it discusses the ways that Eastern Europe and Russia were ran prior to the war. There is a lot of information regarding the races between the countries for dominance and how Russia rose to be a power when most of its people were farmers who lived far outside of the city. This book gives a great view of nationalistic views of citizens and the Tsar and how opinions and governing changed over time. This book also details the minor and major conflicts running up to WWI and who was with who in the world of international politics.This book won't be for everyone and it helps to have a basic understanding of the history of Eastern Europe while reading it. There are many, many players discussed and their politics and beliefs are laid out. For a relatively dry history book, I learned quite a bit from this book and enjoyed it to a certain extent. Some facts and information seemed a tad repetitive to me which slowed up the pace quite a bit. That said, Dominic Lieven has created a history book that is fairly easy to understand and there are page of footnotes and sources in the back of the book for further investigation if the topic interests you. Pertinent to this book is how the same areas are important to us today with the current conflicts with Russia-this book explains why these areas are hot buttons even in today's world.What I thought was interesting was the biographical tidbits of Nicholas, his family and his cabinet. Nicholas was severely nationalistic and held on to an old belief system that didn't allow him to change. His armies as well were ill prepared. As a whole this is an interesting albeit very detailed account of prewar history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G5LHR81OTFBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025585#wasThisHelpful","R3G5LHR81OTFBF","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These Sterling Silver Cushion Cut Emerald Earrings remind me of the style of the 1930s. The cushion cut creates a very dynamic look and these are very pretty. and elegant.

Verigold packages these earrings in a black jewel box inside of another black box and the packaging is well done and professional.

"I really thought this book sounded great and wanted to relax and enjoy it. This is an excellent premise but it wasn't executed in the way I expected. I found the situations of Ava and the dialog and the premise while reading it, a bit silly-all the way through. This could have been more seriously done because I feel that agoraphobia is an interesting subject, but I wish this was written more realistically. An American agoraphobic inherits a house in London and breaks free of her fears is a great idea, but there is just a lot of unintentional slapsticky moments that don't ring true, at least for this reader. I am not sure if the comedy is intended but moments that are serious, are not handled in a serious way. Some characters are charming and good but the story as a whole was fluffy and nonsensical at times.This could be a good beach read, but you'll have to stomach a few things that may be unsavory to many readers who wanted a good book about breaking free and starting over and not a weak, relying on whimsy, unsettling humor and other methods to entertain its readers. Good premise but iffy execution. The talents of the author, Mary Carter, are okay but the story and the antics involved throughout the book were not believable or realistic for me. I wanted to like it but I didn't care much for this book or about the people in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M3S0DJL5KQQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617737062#wasThisHelpful","R1M3S0DJL5KQQU","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this Jergens Wet Moisturizer. My legs have been pretty dry lately and I put this on after showering, while still damp, and the softness this oil provides lasts a long time. I have no need to reapply lotion during the day, even when it's very hot and dry outside. This goes on a bit sticky but soaks in nicely leaving no oily feeling, just nice soft skin. This bottle will last as it doesn't take much to do the job and is a nice sized bottle. The consistency of this moisturizer isn't oily and goes on more like a lotion versus an oil. This works better than the rose hip oil I have been putting on to combat dry skin.I like the concept of this moisturizer as well. It says it works on wet skin to lock in the moisture. I have no complaints so far and my skin has been really soft and nice since using this and I have had dry skin since wintertime. I like this product.

"This is a nicely laid out herb book that provides lovely pictures and lots of helpful remedies for the beginning herbalist. There are twenty chapters covering herbs such as garlic, sage dandelion, thyme, stinging nettles and much more.

It's not a huge, cover all the herbs book, but it is a great intro with some wonderful pictures. Tina Sams also teaches how to make some soothing baths and syrups and also some cooking recipes.The herbs presented in this book are fairly common which makes this a fun book to try out, but some of the recipes call for other herbs or ingredients such as crystalized ginger and mushrooms. There are some great vinegars in this book. This is a great way to start using herbs. A few of the herbs, such as mint, I have in my yard and I love the mint toothpaste recipe included in this book. There are lots of little gems to try in Healing Herbs.

"I chose Boo because many readers seemed to really like it. I thought this book sounded really interesting, but reading it, I felt I lacked the connection many had to Boo and his adventures in the afterlife of Town. I felt this book meandered and I was just reading words but not making any real connections. I did like Boo, a thirteen year old boy with a photographic memory, who was killed by a gun toting middle school boy in a school shooting. He was okay but I had trouble with the setting and the other characters who just seemed to pop up and do this or that and I didn't get the whole deal. I read the words but didn't feel much regarding the story as a whole.While I was interested in reading this book, it feel flat for this reader, unfortunately. In consideration of if my kids would enjoy this book being closer to the target age, I don't think they would get into it either. This is a unique and imaginative story that must have appeal. I just felt disconnected from it. I have read the Dog In The Nighttime book and greatly enjoyed it, but I don't think Boo really compares to it except for the fact that the main character is autistic. The publishers really pushed that angle and I have to disagree, but I am getting wary of comparisons in general.Give this a try if you want, you may like it. I just didn't connect in a way that others seemed to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5UWGNF44VEKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=080417136X#wasThisHelpful","R5UWGNF44VEKH","A6QG9LM5WL0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6QG9LM5WL0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My significant other has a number of watches, including watches meant to be worn as jewelry to a party.  Unfortunately, most of her watches are very small and given our increasing age, difficult to see.  This watch has a face that has a great size and a face that is simply elegant, perfect for any environment.Though my significant other owns numerous watches, they all have metal bands.  This watch is the first with a leather band, and she, to her surprise, loves the way it fits and feels on her wrist.  She loves the stitching on the band, and the way the relatively large face rests on her arm.  I should not that she is a relatively small person at around 100 pounds, so she has small arms.  I thought the face might appear to large on her arm, but it looks good to me, and more importantly, to her.The glass covering the face is synthetic sapphire, which is antireflection coated on the interior to reduce reflections.  Yes, the exterior surface still reflects light, but the interior face does so only minimally.The watch is allegedly water resistant to 165 feet.  I would not recommend diving in a watch with a leather band, but if you do, as long as you stay about 165 feet, you should be good.This watch comes in a box that is absolutely gorgeous, with an exterior cover with the Gucci name, and an interior hinged box, also with the Gucci name.  The watch is nestled on a thick pillow.  An instruction book in numerous languages is included in the box that contains instructions in, for example, Japanese, Korea, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, and more.  It appears that the instructions are in 25 different languages, many of which I am unable to read.  The instruction book includes its own slip cover, with Gucci embossed on the cover.  Indeed, the Gucci name is on the box and contents multiple times.From the simple face, to the gorgeously designed body and the stitched leather strap, this watch will be an elegant touch at a party or in a business environment.  Though the watch is relatively expensive, its simple elegance and beauty avoids being ostentatious.  This watch would be a perfect gift for most women.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8O2XAZLW8GFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014M9X5PG#wasThisHelpful","R8O2XAZLW8GFF","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This large china snowflake ornament is simply beautiful.  The ivory snowflake is decorated with gold and green paint with red ""stones,"" which surprisingly feel like glass.  Though a touch on the gaudy side, this ornament is a perfect addition to any Christmas tree.The snowflake has six points, with openings extending through the snowflake to permit lights and other features to show through the snowflake.  The gold trim paint dresses up the snowflake nicely, keeping the snowflake from being too plain white.  The red ""stones"" are a particularly wonderful addition that turn a lovely star into a phenomenal star.  In keeping with traditional Christmas colors, small green dots finish off the trim in various places on the star.  Lastly, a gold tassel is configured to secure the star to a tree.This Lenox jewels snowflake ornament may be a bit on the pricey side, but it is gorgeous and heirloom quality.  We think this ornament will be a treasure that will be passed on to our children, and perhaps their children as well.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25BY1BFAX7PJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFNJSJI#wasThisHelpful","R25BY1BFAX7PJZ","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We initially selected this toy because it looked interesting, and seemed to have enough action to entertain a child age three and up for a long while.  Well, the toy is kind of interesting, but it gets old fast; really fast.Getting this toy out of the box was remarkably easy.  There are four fasteners in the bottom and two in the back that are covered by tape.  Either cut around the outline of the fastener (my approach) or remove tape from over the top of the fasteners (my significant other's approach), rotate each fastener about 90 degrees, and remove.  Once the six fasteners are removed, Chase comes out of the box readily.  It took us about a minute to remove Chase from his box and another few seconds to remove the stretchy bands that secured packaging to Chase.Before playing with Chase, a switch on the bottom must be moved from a demonstration position to a play position.  Once in the play position, press Chase's badge and missions begin.  Each mission involves pressing various buttons to open Chase's backpack and to light the search light, to open Chase's backpack and to launch the net, or to activate the megaphone.  As a part of these missions, Chase can sit down, stand up, sniff, move his head up and down, and move his head side to side.  Chase allegedly comes with more than 130 phrases, though we have not counted them.  It does not seem as though there are that many phrases, but I presume the manufacturer would present only accurate information.  Maybe some phrases like to repeat too often.Our biggest disappointment is that Chase does not walk.  It just seemed that Chase should be able to move a few steps, but he pretty much stays in one place for everything he does.  So, when Chase is on the case, he pretty much does not move anywhere to be on the case, which is disappointing.  Another disappointment is that the megaphone is not very mega.  Indeed, putting your mouth next to the microphone and yelling, other than being annoying, can be louder than the megaphone output.  While the megaphone may be muted to keep parents from being annoyed, it does seem as though it could have been a little louder.A more serious disappointment is restoring the net to its launcher.  The net is hard to replace, particularly for the target audience of age 3 and up, and it can be installed backwards.  Incidentally, if you install the net backwards, at least one person has reported that the net will not come out.The bottom line is that Paw Patrol - Mission Chase, is hard to recommend.  Chase hardly does much of anything, and he does not walk.  After a few missions, the few things he does get kind of boring.  This toy seems like one that will quickly end up in the heap of toys that do not get played with often.Good luck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FD9DHGCRZDBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY41EEO#wasThisHelpful","R1FD9DHGCRZDBD","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit is awesome, and includes almost everything a new breastfeeding mother might need if that mother needs to pump.  Evenflo apparently makes three different types of breast pumps, and this particular pump is the most capable pump of the three.This kit includes Evenflo's double electric breast pump, a box of 40 five ounce milk storage bags, four five ounce milk collection bottles, a pair of membranes and valves for the breast pump, and 60 disposable nursing pads.  As a basic kit, this one is awesome, but a nursing mother will need a few other items, as noted below.The double electric breast pump is the center piece of this kit.  This pump includes 32 different settings to optimize pumping for virtually any level of flow.  The design is configured to allow one person to completely set up and operate the two suctions and the controls, though it might take a bit of practice to become proficient.  The pump also includes a carrying bag, though it is a bit on the small side, three different size flanges to find the best fit for mom, two five ounce bottles (thus the kit has a total of six five ounce bottles), and two extra valves and membranes (thus the kit has a total of four valves and membranes).Though this kit includes a lot, and makes a phenomenal gift for a new mom, a few more items would be valuable.First, a larger carrying bag.  The drawstring bag is fine for the pump, but that leaves everything else.  Find a zippered bag to hold all these items, plus the others that I list.Second, nipple cream for mom's breasts.  Nipples are very sensitive, and though mom swaps out nursing pads often, it is really tough to keep breasts from being irritated and sore.  A good option is Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter, which is lanolin-free.Third, get some large storage bags to hold bottles, storage bags etc.  The storage bags will keep everything clean and sanitary.Fourth, get a couple of small towels.  Even better, get a half dozen.  They can go in storage bags (preferable), or into the bottom of the zippered bag.Fifth, get lots more disposable nursing pads.  LOTS more.  Seriously.  As long as mom is nursing, she will go through these things quickly.Sixth, get more milk storage bags.  It is amazing how much milk babies need, and how much mom can generate, at least initially.  May as well save up for later when baby starts to eat more than mom can produce.You might also want to consider getting an adapter to pump directly to milk storage bags, rather than pumping to a bottle and then pouring into a storage bag.  Less handling is more sanitary.Many moms need to pump because they work, or need to be away from baby for short periods.  This kit is a great starting point.  Get the other items I listed above and turn a great starting point into a comprehensive kit for mom.  She will love you for your thoughtfulness!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DG5730KP1YI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0VQOLM#wasThisHelpful","R2DG5730KP1YI2","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the plus side, the three china kings are beautiful.  The style is classy and elegant.  The one issue I have is with the internal lights, which I think actually detracts from the beauty of these three pieces.As decorations, these three pieces are understated.  Though the gold trim could be gaudy, the artist used it to a level of effectiveness rather than taking it to a level of cheesiness.  The finish is smooth and bright with the white primary layer and the gold trim.  Indeed, these pieces would be at home in a church or in a house.Then there are the lights.  Each of the kings has a light for some, inexplicable reason.  I suppose some people might like the lights, and it seems like most Christmas decorations include lights.  However, the lights turn these beautiful sculptures into something more akin to the cheesy decorations you buy from those magazines filled with cheap, kind of good looking decorations made of plastic, all of which have a light.Even though I am less than impressed with the lights, which I leave turned off, these ivory, china Christmas decorations are beautiful, ready to decorate a bookshelf or a mantle.  Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, but at more than 7 inches tall, they are sculpted miniature statues celebrating a Christmas-related event.  These decorations will eventually be passed on to our children, and hopefully their children.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33C9OTXFJV66X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP1Z6GI#wasThisHelpful","R33C9OTXFJV66X","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the very plus side, the pictures are vibrant and edge to edge.  On the less than plus side, I am not a fan of all-in-one cartridges because invariably one color runs out of ink before the other colors, and you have to replace the entire cartridge, which has always seemed wasteful to me.Setup and connection was a breeze, though a touch slower than I would have thought.  I am not 100% sure how long it took, because I was not timing the connection, but I was presuming a couple of minutes maximum, and it seemed closer to 15 minutes, though it might have been longer.  It seemed like forever, but time seems to go slowly when you are waiting for something to happen.Once the printer connected to our network, there is the usual business of finding the right software or downloading the right drivers to drive the printer, which takes a few more minutes (okay, maybe a bit longer for some devices, because I always forget how to find the drivers because I do not do it very often).  Once you have the Wi-Fi connection and the drivers, FINALLY you are ready to print.The pictures are gorgeous, and the ink is non-smearing (Epson ink - some non-Epson ink is not so non-smearing or permanent, as we have discovered to our chagrin).  The clarity of the pictures on glossy paper is fantastic, and the colors are vibrant.  A 4"" by 6"" picture takes about 35 seconds, give or take, to print, which is actually fairly fast, certainly faster than our older Epson printer with Durabrite ink, and the pictures look better.Perhaps the biggest downside to this printer is the current price, which is quite high compared to many printers that will print photos.  If you really want the quality, speed, and borderless prints, and the portability is important, than this printer could be made for you, in spite of the cost.Overall, we love the speed and quality of the pictures, and that the pictures go from edge to edge.  The ability to print without a cable is cool, and the printer is small enough to be portable.  The cost per picture, excluding the price of the printer, is about 41 cents per print, based on current price of cartridge from Epson and 4"" by 6"" photo paper, which might be slightly higher than for some prints.  The only real down side is the single cartridge, which means that the first ink out requires a new cartridge.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZY1EV8SJVZT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZY1EV8SJVZT4","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have seen many different baby bottles, many of which contain gimmicks.  Initially, we thought these bottles might be yet another bottle with a gimmick, until we saw them in action.  The two coolest things about these bottles are that they minimize a baby's air intake and they are the closest thing to a breast we have ever seen.The vent on this bottle is configured to minimize a baby's air intake, and also seems to reduce colic.  The sophisticated valve appears to do a good job of controlling airflow into the bottle as baby feeds, and keeps air well away from the nipple area.  Regardless of whether a baby ends up with colic, minimizing air intake during feeding is a significant plus.In addition to the valve, the flexibility of the nipple does a fairly good job of mimicking a breast.  A human breast is quite amazing when it comes to feeding a human child, and bottles typically do an awful job of being even remotely similar to a breast.  The nipples on these bottles, on the other hand, have great flexibility and behave much like a real breast.  An accordion-type fold helps orient the nipple so that baby can remain latched even as baby's head moves or the bottle moves.  Indeed, baby may come to prefer this bottle to an actual breast, so unless you are trying to move baby from breast to bottle, best to keep baby on the breast as much as possible.While this bottle advertises that it is dishwasher safe (top rack, of course), and likely it is, we are somewhat concerned that over time the nipples will lose their flexibility due to exposure to the heat of the dishwasher.  On the other hand, different nipples provide different flow rates to adapt to baby's milk intake, and since the nipples need replaced regularly as baby grows, it could be that nipples are not washed enough times to lose their flexibility.In addition to all the bottle goodies that come with this gift set, a bottle brush is also included.  Yes, you really want a bottle brush to provide a proper cleaning to a bottle when hand washing.  A bottle brush may even be required when dishwashing bottles if you accidentally permit milk to dry in the bottle, which should always be avoided if possible.After what seems to be an extended commercial for these bottles, you would think that we overwhelmingly recommend them.  Unfortunately, these bottles do seem to have a flaw that we consider occasionally annoying.  Sometimes the bottles leak in the valve area.  Part of the challenge seems to be properly assembling the bottle.  However, it may be that the valve is not closing properly, which seems curable by reaching into the bottle and pressing on the valve tip.  We are not sure if the valve issue is a design flaw or a compromise that had to be made to minimize baby's air intake.  Regardless of the reason, the leaks seem to happen at the worse possible times, like when baby is REALLY hungry and you are trying to quickly prepare a bottle.  Hopefully subtracting only one star for the periodic leak issue is not being overly generous to the manufacturer.  However, the bottles otherwise seem about as perfect as a bottle could be, and given how well these bottles mimic a breast, we are willing to forgive a periodic leak issue, even while wishing there was never a leak.I am unsure of how many different types of baby bottles we have purchased over the years, from the old glass bottles with the yellow nipples to modern, super sophisticate baby bottles.  While some have worked better than others, none appeared to even try to mimic a breast.  it is almost as though mimicking a breast was not a consideration.  However, it seems to us that baby prefers a bottle that is close to the real thing.  Further, baby does not care that the bottle sometimes has a leak.  Baby just knows what baby likes, and baby likes this bottle.  What more do you need to know?Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H16IML003RUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKP8JYK#wasThisHelpful","R2H16IML003RUO","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Children are naturally artistic.  They love to play with crayons, colored pencils, water colors, and tempura paints.  This table is a great place for one or more children to let their imagination soar with all child-suitable artistic media.To make it easy to take advantage of a wealth of creativity, this table includes multiple storage cups and a canvas storage bag to hold the various tools of the artistic trade, such as crayons, paints, paint brushes, scissors, etc.  The table also contains a location for a 100 foot roll of 18 inch wide paper, which is ready to receive a young child's imagination.  The paper feeds up through a slot to permit the paper to lay flat on the table in preparation of whatever inspiration strikes a young artist.  The table also includes a child-safe paper cutter.The table is colorful and attractive to young children, though children even past the recommended age of 9 could find this table useful, depending on the size of the child.  This table could even be used as a place to build Legos or a model.  The two benches provide room for up to four children, depending on the size of the children, so multiple children could work on a single project or on individual projects.Though we love this table, we have only had it for a short time, and it is nearly impossible to assess durability of such a product in such a short time.  We notice that a few reviewers have experienced issues with the legs and apparently smearing paint.  While the table currently seems sturdy and stable, we will be monitoring it for any issues.Traditionally, our children have used the kitchen table as a place for their artistic endeavors.  Now our grandchildren have a place to let their creativity soar that leaves the kitchen table available for other activities, like eating.  In addition, the table provides a great location to store the tools of the artistic trade, rather than those tools ending up under the bed or in the dog's mouth.  Of course, the children must be encouraged to put all their goodies into the storage cups, and to pick up the crayon that rolls onto the floor, but that is always a challenge, and given how much they like this table, just the mere suggestion that the table might be removed typically encourages a bit of cleanup.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLACJMA5L0450/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006GUY0Y#wasThisHelpful","RLACJMA5L0450","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While the ABC picture boards are advertised as a toy, they are a great learning tool that parents and educators can use to help children learn their letters, and how the letters sound.  This set includes 13 double-sided boards for a total of 26 sides of learning, and 52 colorful letters, both small and large.To really use this educational toy, a parent or other adult will need to work with the child to explain how the letters sound, and to help sound out the words on the picture boards.  Of course, this learning opportunity is great for bonding with a child, also helping the child see that the adult values the ability to recognize and use letters properly.I remember having a similar toy when I was little.  My much younger brother also had a similar toy, as did my son and daughter when they were little.  In each case, we helped the child understand how to the letters sound and look, helping prepare the child for pre-school or kindergarten.While this educational toy is quite valuable as a learning tool, it is made of wood and as such, it is a potentially valuable building tool.  Thus, if your little one becomes a bit bored with learning, the wooden boards can be used with other building toys to create cities of the imagination.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REVMT1EIYFBM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012508NQ0#wasThisHelpful","REVMT1EIYFBM4","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small children have great imaginations, and these story blocks can help them to focus their imagination to become story tellers.  While basic play requires one of each block, multiple blocks can be used to tell a story.  For example, the princess might journey from her palace to a distant planet, where she finds a frog.  Upon kissing the frog, a pirate appears.  Where will the story go from here?  It is up to the imagination of the story teller.Some children may discover that telling and controlling their own narrative is far more fun than television, and often funnier than television.  Because block combinations can vary a lot with the mix and match possibilities of eight blocks, the variety of stories could be nearly infinite.Beyond telling stories, the block appear to be about the same size as standard letter blocks, so if a child becomes bored telling stories, they can use the blocks with other blocks to build with creativity and imagination.  The blocks come in a wooden tray that can also be used as a building element, along with being a storage tray for the blocks.Anything that spurs a child's imagination is a good thing.  When a child is challenged to develop verbal skills, it can only be helpful to them in school, or in life in general.  These blocks are great to develop creativity story telling capabilities.  And when a child's story telling imagination wanes, they can build a tower of blocks.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTU9IU24VLBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY8I9L0#wasThisHelpful","RCTU9IU24VLBX","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These sippy cups are a bit on the expensive side, but they are also feature-laden.  When you consider that these cups will likely be used by your children, and perhaps other children thanks to their durability, and in consideration of the useful features in these cups, the price may be less of an issue than it otherwise would be.First off, these cups are highly leak resistant.  As with all sippy cups, a few drops can leak out if shaken vigorously or banged, but a properly adjusted cup should not spill.Second, this cups are attractive.  Each cup is colorful with either numbers (1, 2, 3) or letters (A, B, C) and an array of colorful animals that are sure to attract the attention of most toddlers.Third, the flow rate is adjustable by way of a patented valve (innovation at work!).  Adjust the flow downwardly for a new cup drinker, and upwardly for the experienced old timer getting ready to graduate from sippy cups to a real grown up cup or glass.Fourth, these sippy cups have a small diameter and are tall enough for two hand to grasp.  Toddlers are still learning good hand-eye coordination, and these cups are great for little hands to find lots of orientations to hang on.Fifth, double wall construction for insulation.  Does your toddler like to haul milk around for what seems like forever?  With double wall  insulation the milk will stay cold longer and be less likely to deteriorate.Sixth, the plastic of these cups is break resistant.  Of course, virtually all things are breakable if abused enough, but these sippy cups should stand up to a fair amount of abuse without breaking.Seventh, the plastic is BPA free.  Yippee for that!Eighth, dishwasher safe.Why four stars instead of five?  With all the features, a couple of compromises had to be made.  The cups tend to be a bit unstable, particularly on slick surfaces like a high chair, and they have  tendency to fall over when being picked up.  How many times do you have to say ""USE BOTH HANDS?""  As much as these cups like to advertise being leak and spill proof, they are not shaken by a child proof.  Drops of fluid can still come out, and little hands love to push the drops this way and that.  Not enough liquid, shake the sippy cup some more.  I doubt that a cup can be designed that prevents a toddler from shaking drops out, but maybe one day...As you can see, these sippy cups are loaded with features, including a patented adjustable valve.  They are a great choice for parents seeking a safe, spill-proof (though not drop proof) sippy cup for their precious progeny.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEH7CG4XCNQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WLWEIPI#wasThisHelpful","R1OEH7CG4XCNQP","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This phenomenally sturdy waste receptacle is perfect for outdoor use in any environment.  Business owners looking for a heavy, wind resistant waste receptacle configured to take a beating look no further, you found it.  Though a bit expensive for home use, this waste receptacle could be an option for a sturdy recycling bin, or for a garage waste receptacle.The frame and side panels are steel frame with perforated steel sides.  The top is also fabricated from steel.  The top is removable to expose a 15 gallon plastic liner, which can be used directly for waste, or can be lined with a 15 gallon plastic bag.I am not sure what kind of paint was used for the steel, but the paint is uniform and seems thick, which should minimize corrosion and provide for excellent durability.This waste receptacle is probably not a good option for a kitchen because the interior remains open to air.  Thus, odors can escape, and flying insects can easily enter the open spaces.  However, this waste receptacle is perfect for a patio, deck, or other outdoor location.  This product could be an excellent option if you host upscale backyard parties and need attractive waste receptacle options.While there are less expensive options for outdoor waste, most, and perhaps all of those less expensive options are relatively light and are not wind resistant.  This receptacle weighs in at more than 50 pounds, which not only makes it wind resistant, by stable.  It is attractive and painted in neutral color suitable for many environments, including indoor commercial or business environments and a home garage.  This waste receptacle should be emptied frequently if used for organic waste products, such as food or garden debris.

"This apron was awaited with great anticipation because it looked cute.  Sadly, the reality was much less than the anticipation.  The material is thin, so if you are hoping for much protection from anything other than dust, prepare for disappointment.  Not only is the material thin, but it is stiff.  Even worse, the apron appears to be suitable for a woman who is a certain size that is neither too small or too large, given the complaints from people who find this apron too large or too small.Perhaps the worse thing of all is no pockets.  We have several aprons, all of which have pockets.  Without pockets, this apron is little more than a decorative bib, and not a very good one at that.Does this apron have any redeeming features?

"On the plus side, these sheets are pre-cut and ready to go.  On the less than plus side, these sheets are relatively expensive, and because the sheets are folded into quarters, creases need to be accommodated.We have used baking sheets in the past, but mostly the roll type.  The roll type baking sheets have their own issues.  The rolls can be a challenge to store.  The roll type sheets curl until you get some weight on them.  You also have to cut the roll type sheets, either with a built-in cutter, or with a pair of scissors, or both if you are trying to line round pans or extra large cooking sheets.These baking sheets are easier to store because they are in boxes that fit in a lot of spaces.  In addition, the curling problem of roll sheets is mostly gone.  These sheets are small enough that for many applications there is little or no need to cut or trim the sheets.While these baking sheets solve some problems, they introduce a brand new problem, two creases that extend entirely across the baking sheet.  We were able to decrease the effect of the crease by folding the baking sheets in the opposite direction, which helped the sheet lay most flat, but the crease remains.  The crease does not seem to be an issue with respect to drop cookies or roll cookies, but it could be an issue for certain kinds of sheet baking.Perhaps the biggest issue with these is the cost.  There are lots of baking sheets available in roll form that are far less cost per unit area.  However, there are times when speed is important, and there is just not enough time to cut baking sheets into smaller sizes.  That is where these sheets come into play.  Think about baking six dozen cookies in a hurry with twenty other things to do for a big party or for a family gathering, and you realize that these baking sheets could save you a lot of time in cutting and fitting baking sheets to baking dishes.We do not see these baking sheets as a one-size-fits-all solution for non-stick baking needs.  They can be a time saver in certain specific situations.  They may even be a perfect size for some baking tasks.  However, we see roll sheets as continuing to be our first choice for baking needs for the primary reason that they are more cost effective.  Furthermore, these baking sheets do not fit all our bake ware well, and the rolls are typically large enough for just about any bake ware, even requiring some trimming in many situations.  Certainly these baking sheets will be one of the options that we keep available just because they can be extremely useful in some situations.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFIW0CUT5DGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161UTDM8#wasThisHelpful","R1EFIW0CUT5DGN","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Potato Head has been a staple of many toy boxes for decades.  Mr. Potato Head Darth Tater provides a contemporary update to this toy box fixture, just in time for Star Wars #7.As with all Mr. Potato Heads, Darth Tater is easy to assemble and disassemble.  While I have enjoyed making different variations of Mr. Potato Head, putting body parts in weird places, etc., I like Darth Tater for being Darth Tater, and not a crazy mixed up Potato Head.  Okay, putting the funny glasses on Darth is kind of amusing.  The mustache is funny too (hey, Darth, nice 'stache dude!).  It is also easy to think of ""Space Balls"" and Rick Moranis's portrayal of Dark Helmet.I am surprised, and very pleased, to note that Darth Tater seems to have quality similar to the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Heads of Yore.  The parts go in snugly and stay in well.  The plastic seems to be fairly high quality as well, and the parts are nicely formed.As for containing all the Darth Tater parts, there are two options.  Nearly everything goes into the belly of Darth Tater, except the long parts.  Of course, it always seems like a part gets lost in the first month or two.  I am crossing my fingers on that one.  The other option is the phenomenal container in which Darth Tater is transported.  The container is similar quality to many kitchen containers, and ranks as a very good feature for holding pieces of tater.Darth Tater is a great reimagining of the Mr. Potato Head franchise.  What else could be next but the other Star Wars characters?  I would love to see Chewbacca, Luke, Leia, and Han as Mr. Potato Heads.  They could have a Mr. Potato Head Star Wars convention!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD3OLE0GG1NZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENLT8#wasThisHelpful","RD3OLE0GG1NZ3","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This watch is massive at 48 mm in diameter, and heavy.  It is a beast of a watch, water resistant to 330 feet.  This watch is also beautiful in a masculine way.  With the rose gold tone timing dial, gray gunmetal band, and its 18 mm thickness, this watch could be an timepiece option for a steam punk outfit.Other than providing an analog indicator of time with its Swiss quartz movement, and the rotating timer wheel, this watch also includes the date at the four o'clock position, which actually makes the date approximately level when you look at your watch.If you are looking for a sleek, dressy watch to go on a date, this watch is not what you want.  If you want a massive watch that is water resistant and makes a statement that you like your jewelry to be heavy and functional, this watch could be just what you want.

"I have some mixed feelings about this shot tracking set.  On the one hand, it is an interesting way to keep track of where each shot went, each time you make a shot.  If you are an experienced golfer, this tracking set might help you figure out where you need a shot adjustment.  On the other hand, if you are an inexperienced golfer and are shooting balls all over the place, this set may just tell you how bad you are golfing without giving you any suggestions as to what to do better.To begin, you download the Game Golf application from the Play Store.  Note that the application is available for Android phones only, so all others will have to find a different tracker.  The set includes little near field communication tags that screw into the handle of golf clubs.  Before you begin playing, you choose the course you are golfing.  Each time you prepare to take a shot, you press a button on the tag to tell the system where you are positioned, and then you take your shot.  The application records the data and starts keeping statistics.  The application can automatically keep score, and can tell you where each shot went as compared to the configuration of a particular hole.  If you play the same course multiple times, you can get a feel for where you might need to make adjustments to your swing, or to your power.  Note that the tags do not tell you anything about your actual swing.What kind of information can you get from the application?  Essentially anything that can be gathered from a GPS.  Just remember to push the button each time.  Trends can be seen, along with various statistics.  This information can be plotted on a lovely display that shows how shot location compares to the configuration of the course.  If nothing else, the displays are pretty.Keep in mind that this set will not help you with your swing.  For help on your swing, you need different kind of help, like a golf professional.  This set only tracks where your ball begins and ends with respect to any particular golf course.The real question is whether a player has the diligence to use the shot tracker on each shot.  If you forget to push the button for a shot, then statistics can be thrown off.  On the flip side, the displays are a lot like a video game, so if you like the melding of the real world to displays that might remind you of a video game, then you might become so enamored of this system that it drives you to golf continuously.  On the other hand, if you just like data or information and you like to see it organized neatly, and you like playing golf, you could find yourself wanting to play more and more golf just to watch the statistics gather.  Sounds like fun to me!Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB4AH8QMZL6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012OMWSRY#wasThisHelpful","R1XB4AH8QMZL6B","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This disposable nitrile glove is an industrial version of Ammex's disposable exam glove of a similar color with the same specifications otherwise.  As with other disposable nitrile gloves, these gloves can split easily.  These gloves generally should not be used with sharp objects or objects that generate splinters, because the gloves are easily cut and split.  In addition, nitrile gloves cannot be used for protection from certain types of chemicals.  However, nearly all gloves have an Achilles heel when it comes to chemical resistance.  However, if you need light protection for your hands in a variety of applications, disposable nitrile gloves are affordable protection.Our traditional go-to glove has been the Ammex disposable exam glove.  These gloves are essentially the same as the disposable exam gloves, though without the medical-related features of the exam gloves.  As with the exam gloves, these gloves are useful in non-puncture environments.  Also similar to exam gloves, the chemical resistance of these gloves is fine for exposure to many typical household chemicals, excluding toluene, which is used in some fingernail polish removers, and some acids.  As with any glove, before using these gloves in any location where they will be exposed to chemicals, the user should determine ability of the glove to withstand exposure to the chemical.One feature of Ammex gloves that I really like is that each glove includes a textured area around each finger tip that should provide additional grip of slick objects.  Nitrile gloves tend to be slick when wet, so caution should always be taken when picking up fragile or heavy items when using these gloves, particularly when the gloves are wet.We began using disposable nitrile gloves when working around dirt and mud.  One of the biggest drawbacks to these kinds of gloves is that once they get wet and are removed, it can be difficult to get the gloves back on again.  Often we wait until the gloves dry out to try to put them on again, or we just, as the box says, dispose of them.  Of course, once the gloves dry out, they typically go on again about as easily as they originally did.While the exam gloves are rated for medical purposes, these gloves are not.  However, these disposable gloves can be used as hobby gloves, for working in the yard, or as protection while using chemicals to clean house, though some common chemicals can eat through these gloves, so check before you use.  The nice thing about these gloves is that they are so inexpensive that there is minimal guilt in throwing them away once they have served their purpose.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6GV0C4K8CIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006C3ED66#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6GV0C4K8CIN","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those friendly folks at Kiddopotamus bring you Laffy Giraffy, which seems to deliver what the marketing blurbs promise, meaning a bit of chuckling and amusement.While Laffy Giraffy seems like a relatively simple toy, it includes a marvelous spinner that makes balls spin around, bounce, and pop, making more than a little noise.  The balls can be viewed through a front and back window on Giraffy, which should create a bit of amusement for baby.  Giraffy also has arms that extend and retract, and bend as well.  Giraffy's bottom right foot can be pressed to make Giraffy squeak.  Giraffy's bottom left foot makes crinkling noises when pressed and scratched.

"We tend to have a lot of birds around our house.  Fortunately, many of them are songbirds, versus invasive nuisance species.  This bird feeder is specifically configured to hold black oil sunflower seeds, which are somewhat small and which easily slide through the wire mesh of the bird feeder to feed various enterprising birds.  The color of the feeder is a beautiful red that makes the feeder easy to see when hung in a tree.  I have no idea whether birds are attracted to the red, but it does make the feeder pretty.This feeder is entirely metal, which is powder paint coated.  The powder paint coating should provide corrosion resistance, but ultimately I expect the feeder will rust and require replacing.  Hopefully the feeder will last for years before rusting starts.Filling this feeder is relatively easy.  The top cover angles up to detach from one of the wire handles, which permits rotating the cover out of the way to access the fill port on the feeder.  Fill the feeder with sunflower seeds, and then rotate the cover to close the port.  I strongly suggest filling the feeder outdoors, because it is nearly impossible to prevent some sunflower seeds from falling on the ground.The handle is also the place to attach a hook to hang the feeder.  This feeder can be hung almost anywhere through the handle, but try to avoid being close to a tree trunk or an enterprising squirrel can jump from a tree trunk to the feeder.  Of course, a squirrel can also reach the feeder from above in some situations.This product also includes a metal wind spinner.  We have several of these that we have hung on our deck for years.  Unfortunately, all our older spinners are rusting and do not spin as easily as they once did.  However, until the rusting starts, the spinner is an attractive decoration that can be hung just about any place.This bird feeder seems to be a high-quality metal product that should provide years of use.  The color is a bright attractive red, and the feeder holds enough seed to keep birds fed for days.  The attractive spinner is a decorative plus that makes this product even more desirable for bird lovers.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB13SZJFF79HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOXP36#wasThisHelpful","RB13SZJFF79HQ","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hummingbird feeder is an attractive addition to any backyard.  Fill the with mix specifically made for hummingbirds, and watch them flitter to and from each of the four metal feeder ports.We have had other hummingbird feeders, but all of them were plastic.  This feeder is mostly glass and metal, with a plastic base.  My only concern is whether the metals are all corrosion resistant.  The brushed nickel portion should be water resistant, at least for a while.  I guess only time will tell.In addition to being beautiful, this feeder is easy to fill and clean.  The base unscrews from the glass reservoir to permit easy filling of the reservoir.  The base also separates into two piece to permit easy cleaning of the base parts.  The ability to clean the feeder is important because the food mixture has to be replaced every few days because it goes bad relatively quickly.The color of the glass is allegedly cranberry.  The color may be cranberry, but I would call it pink.  Whatever it is called, the glass is very pretty.  Indeed, the entire hummingbird feeder is pretty.  Fill the feeder with a mixture of sugar and water, after it has been boiled and cooled, or a suitable hummingbird nectar, then hang the feeder in your backyard and wait for the hummingbirds to find it.Hummingbirds are present in much of the United States during the summer, though they are resident year-round in a few places.  Hummingbirds are one of nature's most amazing creatures, flying like a helicopter.  It takes a lot of energy to do that.

"These disposable gloves are supposedly intended for industrial applications, but there are some drawbacks to the gloves.  For example, latex allergies are common, and wearing these gloves could cause a reaction.  As another example, these gloves are not suitable for prolonged exposure to harsh chemicals.  Thus, when the manufacturer says ""industrial applications,"" it appears that the applications are non-chemical applications for people who do not have latex allergies.On the other hand, these gloves are more elastic than gloves made of nitrile, vinyl, or chloroprene, and I thought they went on my hands more easily than gloves of nitrile or vinyl.  While these gloves allegedly have better puncture resistance than vinyl, they still break relatively easily.  My significant other broke through several pairs of gloves with fingernails, though her fingernails are relatively sharp.  I guess that means that a woman with sharp nails needs to use extra care in pulling these gloves on their hands or puncture is likely to result.While these disposable gloves are suggested for food service use, I wonder whether that use should be applications where the gloves do not contact food directly.  It would seem that contact of latex gloves with food might cause allergies in people eating the food.  At least, it seems reasonable to me that such transfer might occur.  Better safe than sorry and avoid contacting food with latex.As with many other disposable gloves offered by Ammex, these gloves have textured areas around each finger tip to help grip items, which is particularly helpful when handling wet items.Frankly, latex gloves, which contain natural rubber, are not my favorite gloves because of the risk of allergies, which is a relatively common allergy.  However, they are slightly more resistant to puncture than some other materials, and they are more elastic than common nitrile or vinyl disposable gloves, which makes it easy to put these disposable gloves on hands.  Of course, these gloves should not be exposed to harsh chemicals.  So, depending on whether you are allergic to latex, and whether anyone you know if allergic, and depending on what you plan on doing with these gloves, the may be an option you want to consider.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GEL791IZLQYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017HV7RK#wasThisHelpful","R3GEL791IZLQYM","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our favorite type of disposable gloves are nitrile, so we were anxious to try these gloves to see how they compared to nitrile.  These gloves are very light weight and are not suitable for use in any relatively tough environment, including exposure to chemicals.  Further, the gloves do not stretch as much as nitrile or latex, which means that a person who might be able to fit into a nitrile small might not be able to fit into a vinyl small.These gloves are non-sterile, but are anti-microbial.  These gloves are generally suitable for food service and certain other applications.  While the gloves are recommended for plumbing and janitorial, such recommendation may not consider exposure to certain chemicals used by janitors and plumbers.  Neither does such recommendation consider that plumbers can solder and braze, and these gloves should not be exposed to high temperatures or they are likely to melt.  Indeed, the box suggests the gloves should not exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), which a human can achieve with a fever.Likely the best place to use these powder-free gloves is in the kitchen while preparing food when working with food without bones, because bones would likely compromise a glove.  Another potential issue with these gloves is that when wet, they can be very slick, making handling of dishware potentially problematic.The relatively low cost of the gloves encourages frequent glove changes, which is great when switching from raw meats to working with vegetables where prevention of cross-contamination is potentially important.  Just remember to toss the used glove into the trash.All disposable gloves have their limitations, and vinyl gloves may have more limitations than other gloves, such as nitrile and latex.  However, they are relatively low cost and anti-microbial, so they could be a good option for light-duty applications not involving heat, chemicals, and sharp instruments.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWIAS3IKW1QEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF499WY#wasThisHelpful","RWIAS3IKW1QEO","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most guys, and more than a few females, love a set of virtually any kind of high-quality tools.  This set of SAE (also called English or inch by some people) standard tools is beautifully finished and is probably the minimum wrenches you would want for household or vehicle use.The finish on each heat-treated wrench is beautiful.  Indeed, it is tempting to avoid getting the wrenches dirty or scratched precisely because they are beautifully finished in gorgeous, shiny chrome.  As noted elsewhere, this set includes 10 wrenches in inch sizes of 1/4, 5/16, 11/32, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, and 3/4.  Several of these sizes have gotten a lot of use over the years, and I look forward to years of service from this set.In addition to the wrenches, this set includes a labeled holder for securing each wrench.  The holder is not nearly as pretty as the wrenches, but it is functional and fits well in my large tool box.As noted on the package, these wrenches are guaranteed forever, which has historically been the claim to fame for several other brands, such as Craftsman.  Admittedly, I have not had these wrenches for very long, but based on the ""forever"" guarantee, the fit, the finish, and the chrome vanadium material of the wrenches, it seems like these wrenches are ones that will be passed along to another family member.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AYMZNOB83NO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EXX8MNC#wasThisHelpful","R2AYMZNOB83NO7","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review is based on only a few hours of use, and I have to review what I see.  What I see is a camera that is a little slow, but easy to configure with unexpected features.I have noticed that if the camera is connected to my phone continuously, it does have a tendency to disconnect from my N-router or my cell phone periodically.  I have had to restart the software to get the camera going again.  I will note that I am sitting about six feet from the router in clear view of the router, so the issue is not signal strength.  On the other hand, I have had the camera sitting next to me connected to the camera continuously for nearly two hours without an issue, so I am not sure why the camera sometimes loses connection, or why my phone loses connection to the camera.Connecting to the camera is really simple.  Download the application from the internet, connect to the camera, set the user name and password, connect back to the household network, update the firmware, fire up the application, connect to the camera, and go.Several different display options are available.  I keep to the lower resolution because display updates seem really slow.  In addition to the standard display, this camera has an infrared light that enables night vision, which works really well.  I was not expecting night vision in a camera at this price point.In addition to the video, this camera can play music over the built-in speaker.  I think the music may be stored in my phone, but I am not sure.  The ability to play music over the camera was another unexpected feature.As for sound, it is available in one direction at a time only.  Communication can be set to the camera speaker, or sound can be received from the camera microphone, but duplex communication is apparently not available.This camera does have limitations that make it somewhat single purpose.  I doubt the range of this camera and the limited capability of the night vision would make the camera suitable for a security camera.  I suppose you could use the camera to monitor a room, or use it as a nanny-cam.  The camera does permit recording of still images, but I cannot record video on my phone.  I am not sure whether video can be recorded on a computer, since I have not tried this camera with a computer.As a baby monitor, this camera seems to work fine as long as you have good Wi-Fi connectivity.  While I lost connection with the camera a couple of times, getting connection back seemed relatively easy.  I like the night vision, and the ability to listen in on the baby.  Perhaps when the baby is older, being able to talk to the baby might be beneficial.  For now, listening to the baby is the most desirable option.  The ability to play music over the camera speaker is really not necessary, given all the other music making devices baby has (including one that connects to the crib), but that feature could be useful if baby's other music making devices are on the fritz, or out of batteries!I was tempted to give this camera a five-star rating, but the periodic connection issues pushed it down by one star.  I should note that I have run the camera for several hours without an issue, and plan to run it much longer, to see whether the connection issues reappear.  I will update my review after my additional testing.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGJI2RNXINS4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3GKO36#wasThisHelpful","R2JGJI2RNXINS4","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy setup; timed, low-energy LED's; and fresh herbs and vegetables; what more could you ask of an indoor garden?This indoor garden is based on hydroponics, gardening without soil.  Setup is remarkably simple.  Remove everything from the box, attach the bank of LED's to a vertical post, which is adjustable in height, pour in water, add the plant pods, and then add the fertilizer.  Plug it in, choose the length of time the lights should be operated, and wait.  Periodically you do have to add more fertilizer, and you do have to adjust the post height as the plants grow, but growing is nearly as simple as that.Of course, it is rarely as simple as the instructions claim, but other than choosing plants that like to be grown hydroponically, it really is simple in this case.  By growing plants this way, there are no weeds, and rarely are there any bugs.  If you do find annoying insects, just remove them.  Can you grow seeds other than those provided by Miracle-Gro?  Yes, by providing the seed with a porous base, many seeds can be grown this way.Fresh veggies in the winter time sounds awesome, and though the veggies are small compared to their outdoor cousins, you choose harvest time.

"On the one hand, I really wanted to not like this toy because, as others have noted, the focus here seems to be on outfits, wigs, and accessories rather than being a marine biologist.  I suppose we should not disillusion children with the actual rigors of a profession such as marine biology, but perhaps this toy sugar coats it too much.  The problem is that if I overlook Sandy's alleged aspiration to become a marine biologist with incredible fashion sense, I like the toy as a child's toy.Essentially, this toy is a doll house that also looks like a boat, specifically, an ""ocean cruiser.""  Sandy activates various magic points throughout the cruiser, and Sandy is compatible with all other Flipsies toys, and vice versa.  Excluding the marine biologist distortion, this set includes quite a few doll house accessories, such as binoculars, dolphin, table, chairs, etc.Perhaps where the rubber meets the road is how much children like this toy.  They love it, and they like playing with it.  At the same time, you can explain that while being a marine biologist is fun, in real life marine biologists do not work on a ship that looks like a cruise ship, and marine biologists are not typically fashion models.

"We use a lot of disposable nitrile gloves, typically for yard work involving soil and manure, though we have used them for household cleaning as well.  The gloves we typically use are exam gloves, which have a higher strength than these gloves.  While these gloves are weaker than our light blue exam gloves by test, they apparently have more resistance to certain chemicals, as listed on the side of the box.Generally, disposable nitrile gloves are great when working around stuff that will stain your hands, get your hands excessively dirty, or when you might be exposed to chemicals that can damage your skin or be absorbed by your skin.  Incidentally, nitrile gloves can be great for certain messy cooking tasks.It is true that nitrile gloves can split easily. There have been days when I have gone through multiple gloves when working around sharp objects.

Of course, nitrile gloves tend to be slick when wet, so caution should always be taken when picking up fragile or heavy slick items when using these gloves.While these gloves have been great for us when working around dirt and mud, once the gloves get wet and are removed, it can be a challenge to get the gloves back on again.  We sometimes have to wait until the gloves dry out to try to put them on again, or we just, as the box says, dispose of them. Of course, once the gloves dry out, they go on again as easily as they originally did.As with other disposable gloves we have used, these disposable gloves can be used as hobby gloves (given their chemical resistance, working on cars sound good) or as protection while using chemicals to clean house.  However, these gloves are not resistance to all chemicals, so avoiding direct contact with chemicals is still preferable.  Definitely check the resistance of these gloves to the chemicals you are using before you use them.  The best thing about these gloves is that they are inexpensive, so there is minimal guilt in throwing them away once they have served their purpose.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AB9NCSQIHGED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGSGREM#wasThisHelpful","R2AB9NCSQIHGED","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the positive side, this colorful hand puppet is soft and cute, and says some clever phrases.  On the negative side, the puppet is rather small inside, and it is challenging to get a larger hand inside the mouth.There are six, built-in phrases.  Fortunately, I found it fairly easy to avoid the button that activates the voice, so I could easily provide the voice of the puppet, so adding more dimension to the six, limited phrases built in to the electronics.  However, it is a challenge to get my hand into the puppet and to keep it there.  After five minute of playing DJ the Dinosaur, I am ready to change hands or do something else.  Try getting a child who is interested in a hand puppet to do something else after five minutes of being entertained.Typically I would describe a toy like this as being limited.  However, by being your own puppeteer and providing the voice, in a way, this toy is somewhat unlimited, except for how long you can keep your hand in a tight space.  This toy would be great for a child ages 8-16 who is interested in entertaining a younger sibling or relative.  As long as you avoid the button that activates the voice, this hand puppet can be far more than the six stock phrases.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OT4XYQG5ZCPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPW03QC#wasThisHelpful","R3OT4XYQG5ZCPY","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I suspect babies may be more amused by toys like this one than I am.  I do love a good toy, and I have seen some really fun baby toys, but this one falls a bit flat for me.Fundamentally, this toy does not do a lot.  If you collapse the toy (there is a trick to that, which I will provide in a moment), it does stay upright, but un-collapsed the toy falls over and stays over.  The ears flip up and flip down.  There are five beads in a tube that roll around and around, making noise.  Big deal.  I am thinking that this toy is going to be one of those that has a short play life because it is just not that interesting.Collapsing this toy is a bit of a trick.  First rotate the toy about 70 degrees in the counterclockwise direction, when looking from the top.  The press down and while pressing down, rotate the toy clockwise, and release when the toy has been rotated back to about 0 degrees.  If you continue rotating in the clockwise direction, the toy disengages and pops up again.I must point out that behind the cloth in the middle of the toy is a metal spring.  Even if the cloth comes off the metal spring, it does not seem as though the toy could be a hazard, but I am not sure.  I tried pinching my finger in the spring, and could not.  Given how heavy this toy is, having it thrown at something, like a window or a television, is probably the biggest hazard.  Regardless, I am not seeing enough excitement out of this toy to make a recommendation.  If someone gives you one, use it as much as you can and then pass it on to someone else, or Goodwill.  Otherwise, consider other, more interesting toys instead of this one.Good luck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US7XX9P065OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPB0RZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1US7XX9P065OZ","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the one hand, I like this cutter.  On the other hand, it is limited in use to boxes, packing tape, and thin wood.  I tried cutting the packaging for the cutter, and the cutter would score the package, but not really cut it.The cutter looks relatively cheap.  It is lightweight and just does not have a quality feel to it.  The front end of the cutter is angled to help position the cutter.  The cutter has ""three"" positions, but one of the positions is closed, so that doesn't really count.  The other two positions are cutter tip exposed, and blade extended a half inch.  Thus, the blade on this cutter is not configured to cut anything thick.I did go to town on cardboard boxes with this cutter.  Actually, it was fun cutting cardboard boxes, even more fun than cutting with a steel box cutter because the cutter really seems to slide through a cardboard box straight, versus a box cutter, which likes to skew in different directions.  Eventually the significant other yelled at me and told me to stop cutting up cardboard boxes.  It was fun while it lasted.A couple more advantages to the cutter.  It will not rust, and the ceramic blade should stay sharp for a long time.  The ceramic blade seems as though it would not slice a finger as readily as a steel blade.I like this cutter, but it is limited in what it can cut.  Cardboard boxes are fodder for this cutter.  Everything else is hit or miss.  The thick cardboard of the packaging for the cutter was barely sliced, and it would not cut all the way through.  I tried pressed wood, and the cutter would scratch, but not really cut.  Replacement blades are really expensive, while replacement steel blades are almost literally dirt cheap.  On the balance, while I like the cutter, it is hard to recommend it because it is limited in capability.  Then again, this cutter does so well on cardboard boxes, and I like the general concept of a ceramic blade, so it gets four stars from me, even with its flaws.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HY6P0VDTPU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9SSJE4#wasThisHelpful","R36HY6P0VDTPU6","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tripod is fantastic for still cameras, either digital or film.  The range of motion of the head and the ability to position the legs is phenomenal.  The head even includes a motion I have not previously seen in a tripod.For the most part, the movements of this camera tripod are intuitive.  The legs have four positions, according to the box.  I tried two of the four positions, and movement is relatively smooth.  The only thing that was annoying was that I thought the legs were a bit harder to move outwardly than I would have liked.  Do not try moving the legs with a camera attached to the head of the tripod until after you have practiced moving the legs in and out without the camera attached.The head has all sorts of movement.  The camera platform rotates, tilts, and raises and lowers.  Even more interestingly, by loosening the handle that grips the post that raises and lowers the camera platform, the entire post can be raised up and pulled from the central support, rotated 90 degrees, and secured sideways.  Why would you want to move a camera in that manner?  Right this moment I do not have a specific answer, but as someone who has used all the motions available in a tripod, I can vouch for the benefit of having as many ways of moving a tripod as possible.The box alleges that the right angle ability is patented, which is pretty cool.  Likely Manfrotto was trying to figure out how do something different from everyone else, and knowing how easy such innovations were to reverse engineer, they patented their invention.  Smart idea giving them a unique feature as long as the patent is in force.In addition to the ability to move a camera in a bunch of different ways, this tripod also includes a little hook to hang a bag and another hook to attach a strap.As enthusiastic as I am about this tripod, there are a couple of things that I think could have been done a little better, which is why the four-star rating instead of five stars.I have a less expensive tripod that has a rack and pinion system for raising and lowering the head of the tripod.  The motion is really smooth, and the camera stays in position when not rotating the handle, though the rack can be secured in position.  In addition, that tripod has a handle to help smoothly rotate the camera platform around the center of its axis.  Why are these features useful?  Because the ability to move the head vertically and around its axis smoothly makes that tripod much more compatible with a video camera.As a still camera platform, this tripod is excellent.  The ranges of motion are outstanding.  Indeed, the features on this tripod are phenomenal.  The only downside is that this tripod is less than ideal for a video camera because the motions of the tripod are not all that smooth.  So, for everyone interested in mounting a still camera, this tripod's for you!Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TARL8EA0QWI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JS86CI#wasThisHelpful","R1TARL8EA0QWI6","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Board games involving mythical creatures have been around for a while.  This game is an attempt to put a spin on such games, with the spin being the negotiation for the dragon's hoard at the end of a round.The real problem is that if you have a person who refuses to be flexible, the negotiations end without divvying up the dragon's hoard.  Theoretically, a more introverted person learns to be more extroverted to push for their fair share.  However, if that person does not, then one or two people always seem to get most of the hoard, or no one gets anything.  It can get quite frustrating for all involved rather quickly, the game may get back into the box, and then it may end up along with other, non-played board games, until the reasonable people get their hands on the game.On the other hand, when this game is played by the maximum number of players, which is six players, it seems like one or two players push for the less extroverted players, and the treasure hoard is divided, and divided more fairly.This game is set up for three to six players, ages 12 and up, and is estimated to take about 45 minutes to play.  The game play seems relatively quick, but only because game play is relatively simple.  Indeed, one real problem of the game, other than the ""negotiation"" over the dragon hoard, is that the game is not really all that interesting for an experienced board game player.  It might be fine for a game or two, but after that, most experienced players will want to move onto something more challenging.I like a good board game, and this one is fine from the perspective of simple play, but the negotiation aspect seems to take the original cooperation needed to kill a dragon and turn it into a slugfest for share of the loot.  Other games with a well-defined end that provide an element of randomness to permit anyone to win seem more fair to me.  Maybe I am playing this game with the wrong group of people.  After all, these people are highly-competitive individuals driven to win in games where it is typically each player for themselves.  The cooperation aspect is not something they are accustomed to integrating into their playing style.Good luck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39WLXPJTCFOXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R39WLXPJTCFOXK","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Toys seem to become more and more complex, making all sorts of noises, with lots of flashing lights, and numerous controls.  This toy is a seeming rarity in that it requires no batteries, relying instead on child, parent, or grandparent power.  Press down on the toy, the front and back legs are pushed back, and release.  On hard floors My Little Pony Pinkie Pie takes off across the floor.  We tried Pinkie Pie on carpet with no pile, and Pinkie Pie rolled only a short distance, so forget about Pinkie Pie on anything other than smooth floors.Pinkie Pie's head also moves back and forth, but rolling and moving her head back and forth are the entirety of Pinkie Pie's skills.Perhaps not-so-surprisingly, the under three-year-old set seem to like Pinkie Pie.  Perhaps the enjoyment is that Pinkie Pie is colorful and scoots along at a pretty good clip before crashing into a wall, carpet, or something else.  For older children, the enjoyment may be that they can affect the function of an object in their grasp.  Whatever the reason, it warms a parent or grandparent's heart to see a baby or grandbaby enjoy the simplicity of their young lives with a s small or laugh as Pinkie Pie does her thing.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39GSBGXZP7ZRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENR24#wasThisHelpful","R39GSBGXZP7ZRG","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have used lighter nitrile disposable gloves in the past, and been quite happy with them.  Yes, nitrile gloves can split easily.  Yes, you may go through more than one pair is using these gloves to handle objects that have sharp edges or splinters.  Nitrile gloves cannot be used for protection from certain types of chemicals, though that is true for most gloves.  However, if you need light protection for your hands in a variety of applications, disposable nitrile gloves are affordable protections.We have used another Ammex disposable nitrile glove, in light blue.  I was surprised that these gloves seemed thicker and heavier than the light blue gloves, and they are easier to put onto my hands.  In addition, the box is thicker and longer than the box for the light blue gloves.  As with the light blue gloves, these gloves are useful in non-puncture environments.  Similar to the light blue gloves, the chemical resistance of these gloves is fine for exposure to many typical household chemicals, excluding toluene, which is used in some fingernail polish removers, and some acids.  As with any glove, before using these gloves in any location where they will be exposed to chemicals, the user should determine ability of the glove to withstand exposure to the chemical.As with the light blue disposable nitrile gloves, each glove includes a textured area around each finger tip that should provide additional grip.  Of course, nitrile gloves tend to be slick when wet, so caution should always be taken when picking up fragile or heavy slick items when using these gloves.We love using disposable nitrile gloves when working around dirt and mud.

"This product is a bath gel and bubble bath in one, with pleasant scents that do not linger after use.  Thus, even if it is difficult to find time to take a bubble bath, the bottles need not sit around gaining dust because you can use them in a shower instead.This trio includes three 8 ounce bottles of bubble bath and shower gel.  The three bottles are scented with hydrating hibiscus, nourishing milk and honey, and calming lavender.  The odors are mild, even when surrounded by bubbles in a bath tub, so no need to worry about being overwhelmed by bubble bath odor.  In addition, the odor remains mild after taking a bath, so no need to be concerned about an odor that lingers for hours after a bath or shower, which is a plus when being around people who are sensitive to odors.As has been my experience with other bubble bath products, it seems like it takes a lot of bubble bath to make a lot of bubbles, which is why I usually avoid more expensive bubble bath products.  Based on my experience and usage, one bottle is likely to last for only two or three baths, which makes for a relatively expensive bubble bath.  Even when used as a bath gel, it seems like one bottle is only likely to last for 6-10 showers, which does not seem like very many to me.What about the magical dead sea ""essentials""?  Based on the ingredient list, it appears that those ""essentials"" are sea salt.  The only thing that tells me that the salt is from the Dead Sea is the bottle, because the ingredients just say sea salt.  Some people seem to think that sea salt, particularly from one or the other particular sea, has some benefits to skin.  I will take their word for the magical benefits of salt from the Dead Sea.Other features of this product are that it is alleged to be cruelty free, meaning this product was made without harm to any animals, which I presume includes humans, and it is free of paraben, phthalate, and SLS, which I presume is a good thing for people concerned about those particular chemicals.On the other hand, as a gift, this trio could be a great upscale gift for a friend or relative for a birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion.  Put the individual bottles into a basket surrounded by a towel or other decorative item(s) to make a house-warming gift.The only real downsides I see to this product are the cost and the screw tops.  Flip tops are much more convenient for use in a shower or a bath.  Indeed, it is really easy to put too much bubble bath into the tub with the screw top open.I like the pleasant odor from these bubble baths, and that the odors are mild, both in the bath or shower and afterward.  I like that these can be used either in the bath tub or the shower.  I also like that they eliminate unnecessary chemicals.  The addition of the magical Dead Sea ""essentials"" is of uncertain benefit, but as long as additions are not harmful, maybe they do have some benefit.  The only negatives are the somewhat high cost by my standards, and the lack of a flip top.  I would definitely use this trio as a gift for someone special, because it is an upscale product.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72WTEOPJZJHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVD9JOE#wasThisHelpful","R72WTEOPJZJHW","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some toys you just love instantly, and this is one such.  It is a little messy, but it combines a art with a toy to create a toy that is fun and gives a child, or even an adult, a sense of accomplishment.Essentially, this toy creates plaster casts of various dinosaurs.  The kit comes with enough plaster for six dinosaurs, along with paint to personalize your dinosaurs.  Put the mixer together, attach a mold, mix the plaster, pour it into the mold, close the mold, and rotate the handle.  After mixing for a minute, which spreads the plaster to the surfaces of the mold and likely helps remove bubbles, wait 15 minutes and then open the mold, welcoming a plaster dinosaur into the world.Once you have your dinosaur, this kit includes a tool for smoothing the edge of the casting where the two portions of the die meet.  After smoothing the seam line, it is time to haul out the paints and be ready to decorate your dinosaur.  Create a collection of dinosaurs for a shelf, or just because you can.The great thing about this toy is that it is a great opportunity to teach a child about age 6 or above how to create slightly more complicated art projects.  It is really cool to see a child create something with their own two hands that they can see, touch, and feel, though the plaster is a bit on the fragile side and it will not tolerate being dropped.  Consider the dinosaurs either a decoration or a very fragile toy.As much fun as this product is, the one downside is refills.  As of this review, the only refill I see is a kit that includes enough plaster for six more dinosaurs, along with three more molds.  That refill kit costs as much as this product.  It would seem as though for the same price as the original kit that dinosaur making materials for twice as many dinosaurs, or more, could be provided.  There may be other plaster and paint that can be used in place of the plaster provided by RoseArt, though I am personally unfamiliar with such plaster.  Paints that work on plaster are readily available from a variety of sources.Making the six dinosaurs in this kit, including the painting, is a lot of fun.  Each dinosaur helps a child understand how castings work, and gives each child to express a bit of personal creativity.  For these reasons, this product gets 5 stars from me.  The only downside is acquiring additional plaster and paint, which I consider to be somewhat expensive.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VODA0AIUUUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAQ3UOC#wasThisHelpful","R10VODA0AIUUUQ","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Swaddling blankets need to be thin in order to wrap smoothly around an infant.  These color neutral swaddling blankets are a perfect thickness to created a perfect swaddle around your little one.  In addition to be appropriately thin, these blankets are soft and ready to secure your little angel so that he or she feels safe and warm.In addition to being soft and thin, these blankets are relatively large at 40 inches by 40 inches.  Thus, these blankets should be able to hold even the largest infants securely.  The material of these blankets is 70% viscose bamboo and 30% cotton, meaning that they are all natural and at least somewhat environmentally friendly since they are produced from a renewable resource.About the only thing that I do not know is how well these blankets will hold up under multiple washes.  The wash instructions include gentle cycle and no bleach, so I suspect the material is likely somewhat fragile.In addition to swaddling, these blankets are large enough to provide a light covering during breast feeding.  Further, once baby is grown, assuming these blankets have survived numerous washings, these blankets can be used for all sorts of other things, though durability may come into play.Light multiuse blankets for swaddling can be a challenge to find sometimes, particularly when the primary purpose of swaddling is to make baby feel safe rather than for warmth.  These blankets are perfect for swaddling, including summer time when excessive warmth can be a concern.  Because of their large size, they can be used for other purposes.  The only issue is whether they will survive multiple washings, even on gentle cycle.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29GTQV0QF8PM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O7R1K#wasThisHelpful","R29GTQV0QF8PM2","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, I received this seed as a review product from Amazon Vine.  I say unfortunate because a requirement of the program is to review received products in 30 days, and these seeds should be planted next spring, which is long after 30 days, because we are at the end of the growing season and grass will soon be dormant.  So, I have a product I need to review without actually trying the product.Given that I am in this situation, I can tell you that I have purchased Scott's Turf Builder Grass Seed in the past.  The seed has germinated readily, but the challenge is getting the grass to establish in the spring before the weather gets dry.  As a practical matter, it is really challenging to establish new grass.  If spring is dry, it is unlikely that the grass will germinate, and if it does, it will not establish a good root system and by July all the new grass will be gone.  Even with a wet spring, watering between rains can be important, along with proper fertilization.Well, until next spring, the verdict is out on this particular bag of grass seed.Good luck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17X7XFCY6ECUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARYS25E#wasThisHelpful","R17X7XFCY6ECUV","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It seems rare to me when the advertising for a product almost exactly matches the product.  However, that is the case with this doll; everything on Amazon's product page is (currently) on point.  Except for gaining a customer perspective, reviews are nearly superfluous.This doll is soft and cuddly, and while being a baby, is perfect for babies ages 12 and up.  Baby Stella includes a dress, bloomers, diaper, and a pacifier that stays in place on Baby Stella's mouth with a magnet internal to Baby Stella.  I love the magnetic pacifier, but I am a bit of a geek about stuff like that.The doll itself includes lots of fun little touches, including an appropriately rounded tummy, stylized facial features and belly button, and cute little toes, though not individual toes.  Little cloth tufts and a pink ribbon top off this cute little doll that avoids the stereotypical look of many competing dolls.One of the most important features is the softness of the all-cloth doll.  Babies and toddlers can be challenged with eye-hand coordination, and hard-faced or hard-headed dolls can end up colliding with a head, or something else, causing injury, albeit minor, or damage.  The softness of the doll makes it a perfect first doll for any child.I notice that one of the current lines on the Amazon page is that this doll is a great gift for a grandparent to give.  Speaking from experience, I must say that is true.  Of course, it could also be a great doll for a parent to give.

"The relatively plain surface of a car seat has to be one of the most boring places on earth for a rear-facing baby.  Looking at the seat for hours has to be monotonous.  This image gallery addresses that issue by providing four panels for four different images, tailored for the visual acuity of babies as they develop.Recalling that babies initially have poor eyesight, four images are large, basic patterns in black and white that provide baby without something other than the back seat to see for about the first two months.  While an adult would quickly become bored with the images, babies seem to enjoy familiarity, and seeing these patterns again and again can help baby feel comfortable with a stable environment, even while travelling.  While a parent might be tempted to change images frequently, they should do so with great caution, because babies like seeing the same patterns again and again.As baby's eyesight develops, six additional patterns are available for babies above the age of two months.  While four of the patterns are just that, patterns, two of the patterns show a stylized baby and a house, which can provide some early teaching moments.Six more patterns are provided for babies three months and older.  These patterns include a stylized car, a sailboat, a fish, and a butterfly, and two patterns.  Lots of bright colors are added to the images, taking advantages of baby's improving eyesight and ability to discern colors.Likely the most difficult thing for most parents and grandparents to remember will be to change patterns, as well as not changing them too often.Eventually baby will outgrow the images, and it will be time to provide home-grown images, such as pictures of family members, pets, etc., to gift the travel activity car seat to someone else, or perhaps to repurpose the travel activity gallery as a wall hanging.There are so many aids to help parents and grandparents appropriately stimulate babies that it is difficult to determine which aids are the best.  Some parents have defaulted to electronic aids, including tablets.  However, babies live in a world that is far simpler than ours, and they like simple things.  Most babies will love the simple patterns included in this travel activity, at least for the first few months after birth.  Changing the patterns at appropriate times should fascinate baby and provide a baby, initially rear-facing, and later forward-facing, with something to see while riding in a vehicle other than a field of cloth.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5QNMT36BU5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z6KCE12#wasThisHelpful","R1S5QNMT36BU5T","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This toy is cool with lots of fun features.The front portion of the Gup-S detaches from the main vehicle portion.  The back cover flips up to reveal a large storage area to contain all the extras that come with the Gup-S.  A holding tank inside the back lights up by pressing a button on the side of the Gup-S.  Note that Gup-S only has two phrases until you pull the tab on the bottom of the Gup-S, which can be done only after un-packaging the Gup-S.  The toy includes a single character (and you need more!), a rotating drill on the front of the vehicle, a couple of mini-sleds with an ice breaking tool and a claw, and a piece that mounts on top of the vehicle - a light, I think.  The treads on the underside do ""retract"" so that the back portion can be a stationary laboratory or base.I enjoy all the features in this toy, but the two that I prefer the most are the light up tank, which is a cool blue, and the lift up cover that allows access to position all the accessories in the interior.Does this toy have any negative issues?  Just one that I can see.  Forget about putting this toy in a bathtub.  Yes, it is tempting, but water, batteries, and electronic devices generally do not mix.  Indeed, avoid submersing this toy.Beyond the one minor negative, this toy seems to be a winner, and perfect for nearly any child ages 3-6, or older, like a grandparent.  Yeah, grandparents really like this one.  A lot.  Trust me, I know!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KB7SX8E0QQLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQKMIUO#wasThisHelpful","R3KB7SX8E0QQLS","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frankly, I think parents and grandparents get as much fun from some toys as babies or children do.  I must admit to playing with this soft book for a while to match up the sounds and to learn the scope of fun.This activity book includes four two-sided ""pages.""  Some of the pages contain images of musical instruments that match sounds provided by a hanging portion decorated with a musical note.  The musical instruments include a saxophone, a cloth vinyl record, a flute, drums (of course), and maracas.  Beyond the five page sides that contain images of sound-making devices, one page includes an unbreakable mirror, and two outer page for covers for the cloth book, one of which includes the question, ""What do you hear?""  The saxophone and flute pages include covers for the instruments, and the covers contain some kind of paper or plastic that makes a crinkle noise.One nice feature of this cloth book is that the electronic noise maker is connected to the main part of the book by a ribbon.  Once the battery dies, the noise maker can be separated from the book for disposal.  Alternatively, you could attempt to cut the seams to remove the electronic noise maker to see if the battery is replaceable.This cloth activity book from Baby Genius is a great versatile toy to expose a baby approximately 6 months to a year old to many concepts.  Included amongst the concepts are that fixed images remain constant, seeing oneself in a mirror, matching sounds to images, and the ability to manipulate an environment.  Because the activity book is cloth, it would be difficult for a baby to hurt himself or herself while manipulating the book.  This toy is a perfect toy for most babies in the target age range, and could be a great purchase by a parent or as a gift for a baby.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R111OYOR791IM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPVZYJO#wasThisHelpful","R111OYOR791IM2","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book weeks ago, and have been meaning to review it for some time, but I was not sure precisely what I wanted to say.  The conflict I have is what I expected of Koontz, and what I actually got.  I expected a thriller or horror story.  Instead, I got a character study with underpinnings of the supernatural.  Was the book worth reading?  I will say yes, with a caveat.Our protagonist is Jonah Kirk, which is assuredly an auspicious name.  Jonah lives in a big city in the tumultuous 1960's.  Jonah meets a woman who tells Jonah that she is the city.  Initially, I wondered whether this woman was a nut, or whether she was something more.  Also, I was hoping for more interaction throughout the book with this woman, but we see her very little.  This woman also tells Jonah that everything will turn out all right.  That assurance is not precisely true, as the reader will learn.Quite often a novel will tell the story of characters central to ""big events,"" such as crimes, solving crimes, etc.  In this particular case, Jonah and people Jonah knows are peripheral to the ""big events.""  However, it is the intersection of Jonah and the ""big events"" that provide moments of intensity in the story.  Much of the rest of the novel is about Jonah, his family, and friends.  Indeed, this novel is character driven rather than plot driven.  There is a climax, in the traditional Dean Koontz style, but the climax is not the end of the story, because Koontz deals with the aftermath rather than glossing over how people deal with tragedy.  Of course, he does not wallow in tragedy, but neither does he overlook it.Koontz fans are reacting to this story in many different ways, which is my caveat about this book.  If you expect lots of tension, chase scenes, and things that go bump in the night, you will be mostly disappointed.  This book is about the characters, and most characters, both in real life and in this book, try to avoid tension, chase scenes, and things that go bump in the night.  On the other hand, if you want to read a story about life, albeit a life that intersects with some very interesting events, and even supernatural events, then this could be the story for you.  I am certainly glad I read this story, which is the first time I have said that about a Koontz book in a while (except the Odd Thomas books, all of which I like).But, remember that I struggled with expectation versus reality for a while before I reviewed this book.  I pondered everything from three stars to five stars, before ignoring my expectations and accepting that the book I read was a well-written character study from an author who does not normally write such books.  How you react to this book will likely be how you manage your expectations.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PRIFXIHGF9G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545958#wasThisHelpful","R1PRIFXIHGF9G8","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These cross-training shoes are lightweight and comfortable while providing great support.  The mesh design provides lots of airflow to keep feet cool and dryer than leather shoes.  The colors will likely appeal to many people, particularly younger people.One theme that seems to be a constant with many reviews of these shoes is the difficulty of getting a foot into them.  Unfortunately, my significant other's feet went into the size 6.5 easily, so we are unable to comment on this issue encountered by others.  Another theme is the expected size of these shoes.  With respect to this observation, our observation is that this shoe runs about a half size smaller than other shoes we have purchased in the past.  My significant other typically wears a size 6, and the size 6.5 fit nearly perfectly.My significant other informed me that she would definitely buy these shoes, because she likes the weight and comfort of the shoes.  The only concern she had, which is a minor concern, is that the top of the shoe is very light weight, and she is slightly concerned that these shoes offer very little protection from injury.These lightweight, comfortable shoes are great for walking.  They can be readily washed in a washing machine.  While the sizing tends to run on the small side, by compensating for the size difference, it should be easy to buy a pair of shoes that fit perfectly.  Even better, these shoes are on our list to purchase again.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBNRGLOPBVUR2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVQKT8A#wasThisHelpful","RBNRGLOPBVUR2","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"People have swaddled their babies for about as long as there have been babies.  Babies seem to love the security of being swaddled, and it seems to help them sleep.These particular swaddles are small swaddles for babies 0-3 months, or 7-14 pounds in weight, or up to 26 inches in length.  The 100% cotton is washable.  The material is not as soft as the material in some baby clothes we have, but these are swaddles, which can readily go over other clothing, so softness is a bit less important.  The swaddles are secured with hook and loop fasteners, which are easy to adjust to fit perfectly to any baby within the recommended size ranges.  The colors are neutral, so the swaddles can be used for girls or boys.One surprise, to me, is that babies seem to need to be held less often or for shorter times with swaddles.Swaddles are a great thing to help babies feel secure for sleeping.  The swaddles reduce the chance for baby to startle itself awake, leading to longer, more secure, sleep.  Swaddles can also reduce the need to hold baby, leaving mom and dad valuable time to perform chores.  These swaddles are color neutral, and washable 100% cotton, perfect for many newborns.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAB30AE887HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100O5WUS#wasThisHelpful","RMAB30AE887HW","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tote is insulated to keep bottles cool or warm, as needed.  The tote includes pockets for all sorts of stuff, including powder, wipes, snacks, etc.  Of course, this tote will easily handle a few diapers, a small blanket, and even a change of clothes.  The plastic can be wiped for cleaning.  This tote also includes a separate pouch for a tablet, and another pocket for a cell phone, with plastic covers to protect both.This tote includes two hook and loop straps for suspending the tote from the handles or frame of a stroller, either for transport or so the a cell phone or table can be viewed by an infant or toddler for entertainment.  On a negative note, this tote is configured to attach to a stroller, and does not include a handle or strap, which would increase its usefulness.This tote is most useful as an add-on to a stroller.  As such, it has lots of competition from totes of various types that are larger, and often come with a strap.  This tote is smaller than many totes, which does provide an advantage for placing it where it can be suspended for viewing of a cell phone or tablet, but a disadvantage in situations where storage volume is important.  Before you purchase any tote, it is important to understand where the tote will be used and how much you hope to carry in the tote.  The primary value of this tote is short trips in a stroller.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IAEL2JJFK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSA2OK#wasThisHelpful","R5IAEL2JJFK9","A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This activity gym is the second or third one we have owned, and it is the best.  As with our others, it can be folded to take on the road, and the cloth portions can be wiped clean or removed to be washed.  The ""three stages"" are okay, but it is more the colors, toys, portability, and washability that make this activity gym useful and fun.Among the toys, all of which can be attached to the arches, is a mirror, which babies seem to love, an acorn with rattles, a soft cloth owl, a butterfly, some leaves, and a musical fox that provides up to ten minutes of music, sure to provide some entertainment for baby.  The musical fox can be removed to be used separately from the activity gym.  Babies love to reach for the toys to make them move and make noise.Some baby items need not be complicated or expensive to be useful.  Such is the case with this activity gym.

"I will have to use this for longer to give a more comprehensive evaluation, but after my initial use, wow, I love this stuff!  I absolutely hate the feel of foundation on my face, but this ""cushion"" is the closest I've ever come to feeling like I'm not wearing makeup at all.  The only feel is that my skin feels softer where I put it on, not at all sticky or greasy or filmy.  I can't believe how much I like this.  I rarely wear foundation, but this is something I could see swiping on a bit of across my too-red cheeks each morning.I love the little sponge that is included (which has its own recess within the container).  Now I can put on makeup without getting my fingers makeupy.  I know I could have used a sponge with other products, but having the sponge right in the compact is so cool.  And it actually feels good against my sensitive skin.The color I got, W2, Light Ivory, blended well on my face, but it went on a bit darker than I would have expected, given the name.  I can wear it, but if they had a lighter shade, I would get it.As I'm reviewing this, the product is not yet available for sale, so I'm not sure what the price will be, but looking at similar products, I'm guessing around $25-$30, which is higher than I would like to pay for foundation, but depending on how long this lasts (I'll update), it might be worth it, even for a cheapskate like me.  I'm just really excited about being able to even out my blotchy skin so easily and without making my face feel filmy.Again, I'll have to try this longer to see if my initial enthrallment lasts, but right now, I'm hooked.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AAUA014HE7DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01643J3G8#wasThisHelpful","R2AAUA014HE7DG","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me make it clear that I am reviewing this wig based on it being a COSTUME wig (the description does say cosplay), not as a real wig that you would wear day-to-day.  The matting at the top, as other reviewers have noted, makes it obviously a wig (it resembles a cheap stuffed toy at the top; it's all kinked up and coarse).  I think they do this to provide better coverage at the top, so your head doesn't show through, because this is not a dense-coverage wig with a lot of hair.Okay, so as a wig to wear with a costume or for your daughter to play with, it's GREAT.  The hair (except at the top) is very silky and beautiful with multiple tones and lengths, giving it (except at the top) a realistic look.  Holding the wig in my hand, I kept thinking, ""I wish my hair looked like that (except at the top)!""  But once I put it on, I just looked silly.  It made my head look gigantic.  The color is absolutely gorgeous, but it totally doesn't work with my pale, rosy skin.  My daughter tried it on, and with her medium olive-tone, it still didn't look right.  I'm not sure who this color would work for (it looks great on the mannequin, though, doesn't it?).  If nothing else, these wigs could give you a preview of what you might look like if you dyed your hair (or bought a more expensive wig) in that color.I know wigs need to be snug so that they don't slip off, and, to be fair, I have a big head, but yeah, this wig felt a little too snug on me.  And I wish that the included hair cap was a blonde one (rather than dark brown/black).  But I like how the wig comes packaged, and I like that I could repackage it easily for safe storage.Wearing a hat or scarf to conceal the top, you could wear this wig as a real wig.  At this price point (currently $24), it's not fair to expect more.  But as a costume wig (maybe I'll donate mine to the high-school drama club), it's pretty nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXKC02JYI493/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9TF1DO#wasThisHelpful","R3IXKC02JYI493","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish fish oil products were more stringently regulated.  It's so hard to tell if what the manufacturer claims is true or not.  But sometimes it's obvious when something isn't quite right.  In this case, Zenwise claims that these capsules have 2400mg of Omega-3 fatty acids (but keep in mind that this is *per serving*, which consists of two capsules).  But then here is their breakdown of that:EPA: 880mgDHA: 660mgOther Omega-3 fatty acids: 200mgOkay, I come up with 1740mg total.  How are they coming up with 2400mg?  Did they count the DHA twice?  I have to wonder if they really even understand what Omega-3 fatty acids are.  On the product page, they brag that these capsules have ""2400mg of pure Omega-3 fatty acids, as well as 880mg EPA and 660mg DHA.""  Um, what do they think EPA and DHA are?  They're Omega-3 fatty acids!  So they should have said ""including"" not ""as well as.""  They lose some credibility there.I looked up Zenwise, and it appears that they are a new company, started in the last couple of years.  On their website, the founder is identified only as ""Kyle M.,"" which seems a little odd.  Why wouldn't the founder of a company want his last name known?Despite these inconsistencies and oddities, I think it's probably a pretty decent product, and it probably does have around the stated amount of EPA and DHA (but not really 2400mg Omega-3), so factor that in when comparing prices.The claim of ""no fish burps"" is tossed around by a lot of fish-oil packagers today, but I've yet to find one that lives up to it, including this one.  The bottle does smell okay upon opening, though (always a good sign), and the capsules themselves have a very light lemon taste on the outside, which many people will find helpful in getting them down.  I find it useful to take my fish oil at bedtime.Overall, this isn't a bad fish oil.

"I love silicone spatulas, and this particular set has just become the favorite in my drawer.  I love the blue color and the translucent handles.  The handles are round, growing thicker towards the base (see the picture I uploaded), so they are very comfortable in your hand and easy to keep a good grip on.  This is an important consideration if you make something that requires a lot of stirring or folding.  I have a bit of trouble with my hands, so I especially appreciate how nice these feel to hold.  These would make an EXCELLENT gift for anyone with mild or moderate arthritis or similar issues.The silicone scraper part is removable from the handle if you need to get into the crevice to clean, but they are firmly seated, so they are unlikely to come off accidentally.  The whole things are dishwasher safe.The manufacturer doesn't state what temperature they are safe to, but they do say you can use them for scrambling eggs, so I would think that you could use these, as with most silicone spatulas, in a hot pan.  Be aware, however, that the handle is plastic and probably not nearly as heat resistant, so if you leave the spatula resting in a pan, you might get little dents in the handle from the pan softening it.Overall, this is just a lovely set that I can recommend without hesitation.Note:  The manufacturer sent this set to me at no cost for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J1HG7YBGR9ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014VQZO4A#wasThisHelpful","R3J1HG7YBGR9ZT","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an average-quality set of soft, silky, and very pretty washcloths that are perfect for use on babies and anyone else with delicate/sensitive skin.  I like the set a lot, though there seem to be some consistency issues in color and sizing.I tried a bamboo towel for the first time only a few months ago, and I absolutely loved how it felt.  Then I got the chance to try a set of all-white baby washcloths, and I loved those, too.  So I was really excited to try this six-pack of colorful washcloths.  The colors I got are different from the photos shown on the product page, as other reviewers have noted, but the colors of mine don't exactly match the colors I see uploaded, either, so there appears to be some variance and uncertainty of what you'll actually get.  I know that some of this is just due to different cameras and different lighting, but the description (currently) says you'll get two each of yellow, green, and pink, but my set doesn't have two of any color, and it doesn't have yellow at all.  My set consists of three cloths in very pale blue, pink, and green; white; medium-shade lavender, and a medium pink with a slightly coral tone (see the picture I uploaded, but it doesn't quite capture that coral tone).  I love the colors, but the differences from the description, the manufacturers current pictures, and the pictures of other reviewers is a bit puzzling.There are also differences in size from one washcloth to another (see the photo I uploaded; some are significantly longer than others).  I don't think this is a big deal, but you wouldn't think it would be that hard for the manufacturer to get them all consistent.  Also, one of the washcloths had a loop that had been snagged and pulled out a few inches, resulting in a visible flaw in the washcloth (see photo).  There were a few other minor pulls in other washcloths, but I think that's to be expected here and there.The fabric is on the thin side, but I think that's a good quality in washcloths.  It makes it easier to get into nooks and crannies (a baby's ear, for example, or your lower lashline), and they're easier to rinse and ring out.The cloth content is 70% bamboo and 30% cotton.  The stitching isn't perfect, but it's not bad.  The current price, $15 for six, is comparable to other bamboo washcloths.Overall, I like this set a lot, especially the silky feel and the pretty colors, but if there is a specific color combination you have your heart set on, be aware that what you get may differ from that pictured.Note:  The manufacturer sent me a set of these washcloths at no cost for review purposes.Update 11-16-2015:  The manufacturer contacted me to say that they are no longer selling the six-color set I got; they now are only selling the three-color (two of each) set as currently pictured at the top of the product page.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKYKP3LRRE5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ4YYUI#wasThisHelpful","R1MKYKP3LRRE5L","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you want a LOT of true color, these bulbs are the way to go, and you won't be disappointed.

It's not bright (so the porch stayed dark), but it made all of the white surfaces on our decorations really pop, and trick-or-treaters absolutely loved it (especially teenagers) as they looked at each other and realized they were glowing (""Dude!  Look at your shirt!"").  It really gave our porch that creepy, yet cool, something I was going for.But do be aware, as I already mentioned, that this will not put out a lot of visible light, and the glowing-white effect is most pronounced within several feet.  If you want to make things glow beyond that, you'll need additional fixtures.For our purposes, these worked great, and I'm extremely happy with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5EUM150FN6SL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9IPGDY#wasThisHelpful","R5EUM150FN6SL","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good jump rope.  The handles feel really comfortable and cushy, with recesses for your fingers to give you a better grip and to make it even more comfortable to hold.  The ""rope"" itself is heavy enough to make it easy to swing, but not so heavy as to make it heavy overall.When I was a kid in gym, the teacher said that the right length of rope is one that comes up just to your underarms when you stand on it and pull it taut.  The lengthy is pretty easy to adjust.  Pop off the caps on the ends of the handles (easy), feed the rope through till you can reach it and pull it out (difficult...it gets caught on something inside), use a pair a pliers to unpinch the metal clip (easy), adjust to your preferred length, repinch the clip (easy), poke the whole thing back into the handle (little difficult...I had a lot of slack), then finally replace the caps.  I shortened the rope to accommodate my daughter, who is about 5'5"" (as noted on both the product page and the box, this rope is recommended for people up to about 5'9"").  I was able to get all the extra rope into the handle, but if you won't need to lengthen the rope again, you might be better off cutting off most of the slack.  I noticed that after shortening, the rope no longer pivots in the handle because it is stuffed in there so tight.  But I didn't check it BEFORE I stuffed the rope in there, so I can't say for certain how easily it pivoted prior to shortening.  I went to pull it out again, but it's REALLY wedged in there, and I couldn't get it out (I'll probably have to take needle-nose pliers to reach it), but the pivoting aspect isn't a big deal (we all just jumped with plain old ropes when we were kids, right?).The box says to use the jump rope on grass or a ""soft floor.""  That's probably not realistic.  I don't want my lawn torn up, and I don't want anyone jumping rope in the house.  My daughter took it out and jumped in the driveway.  She'd forgotten how fun jumping rope can be because she hadn't done it in years, but it's like riding a bicycle.  The rope showed no wear from being used on a hard, scratchy surface, though it probably would eventually.  Fortunately, this rope is cheap enough (currently $8, regularly $11) that even if/when it wears out, it's practical to replace it regularly if you're a heavy user (but I think it would take a LOT of use to wear it out).Other than the rope being difficult to poke out the handle, I don't have any complaints.  This is a solid piece of equipment.Note:  The manufacturer sent this jump rope to me at no cost for review purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AK7WSS79QV39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147WO3M2#wasThisHelpful","R2AK7WSS79QV39","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this hat because I burn like butter, so I need protection all around, and I wanted a red hat.  It's not bad, but I guess I got spoiled by my Sunday Afternoons hat.

"Things I liked:  The scent is very, very light (so I'm puzzled how some other reviewers thought it had a strong smell).  I can barely smell it, but the tiny bit of scent that is there is quite pleasant; it doesn't smell at all like makeup or sunscreen.  It didn't irritate my skin.  My face is very, very sensitive, and a lot of products make it sting.  But I tried this out on different days under different conditions, including when my skin was painfully sunburned and during a bad rosacea flair, and this actually felt soothing.  I am very, very pale (if ""vampire"" were a makeup shade, I'd have been the inspiration), but I thought this formula blended really well with my skin.  I was amazed by that, actually.  The coverage was surprisingly good.  As I mentioned, I have rosacea, and this really went a long ways towards toning down the red and making my skin look normal.  Anything more opaque would look artificial.  I thought this gave me a nice, lightly ""air-brushed"" look, not perfect, but like a real-life version of the ""beauty shot"" setting on my camera phone.  It just seems to soften and blur.  A lot of foundations make my skin look older, but this stuff makes me look younger (well, I think so, anyway).Things I didn't like:  As I was applying the cream, holding it upright, it just kept oozing and oozing out until there was a giant blob running down the side.  This might have something to do with my living at high altitude (almost 7,000 feet).  You might want to store it cap-side-up, especially before the initial opening, to encourage the air bubble to rise to the top.  As with most makeup, this stuff made my skin feel filmy.  Most people probably wouldn't be bothered by it, but I rarely wear foundation (and I'm VERY particular about face cream) because I just can't stand the feel of something on my face.  (So it says a lot about how much I otherwise like it that I've put it on several days in a row now.)  My biggest complaint:  It ran into and stung my eyes like a cheap sunscreen!  I couldn't believe it did this. I didn't even apply it all that close to my eyes, but somehow it migrated in.  Since then, I no longer put it on my eyelids at all.  That solved the problem, but I typically don't have this issue with foundations.  The price, currently $30, seems high to me.Overall, I like this BB cream, and I'm very impressed with how it looks on me, but due to the eye-stinging and sticky feel (and, yeah, the price), this probably isn't something I would get again.  However, if I were going to start wearing makeup every day for some reason (which I'm not), I would keep it under consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y53CBETOE8J8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CE15US#wasThisHelpful","R1Y53CBETOE8J8","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this step-stool for over ten years, and it's still going strong.  It's very lightweight and easy to carry and store, and I feel REALLY secure and stable climbing up on it.  Over the years, I've used it for countless things.  Every time someone needs to reach something, they say, ""Where's the little white step-stool?"" because it is THE preferred device around here, and it's constantly being moved around.  I used to keep it in my kitchen for reaching top shelves, then it was used long-term by my daughter to climb into a low loft bed, then my husband cabbaged onto it and started using it every time he needed a little extra height.  I've always been nervous about that because he way exceeds the duty rating (which is 300 pounds, and he's about 400), but it's never shown any sign of stress or wear from it (don't take that as a recommendation to do that; you might not be so fortunate).Folding it can be tricky.  I find that it helps to hold it by the top step on the back side, and then whump the feet of the front side on the ground.  This always makes the top step slide up like it's supposed to (you probably won't have an issue with it; the way it gets ""stuck"" for me sometimes is probably caused by the excessive weight that was put on it).  The biggest problem is that the steps are a bit hard to clean, but that's because the tread is very textured, which is a good thing (you'll never slip on this ladder, even if it's wet).  I wouldn't change that even if I could.There aren't many things I've had for so long that are still working so well and haven't given me any trouble.  Every household should have (at least) one of these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WH4QAYL959R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9472C2#wasThisHelpful","R3WH4QAYL959R","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It sounds like a good idea in concept...a glasses frame with interchangeable lenses...but in practice, it's kind of a hassle.  I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I found it kind of difficult to snap the lenses in, and once I did, I'd gotten fingerprints all over the lenses.  The frames themselves are okay, and are reasonably comfortable, but they come with a clear frame attached beneath the lenses, which reflects light and is kind of annoying.  I snapped that off, and that helped things, but is it a safety hazard without it?  There are no directions.The frames sit too high on my face, the top edge well above my eyebrows, which gives them kind of a medical look, like I just had cataract surgery or something (and the bottom edge is really too high).While I was wrestling with putting in a lens, one of the rubber nose pads came off.  It went back on, but it slides off so easily, I can imagine losing it.The glasses come with a little cloth pouch, but the case for carrying the whole set is enormous (about 7""x4""x2.5"").  I would never carry this around in my purse, so, so much for being able to change my lenses on the fly.The clarity of the lenses is good, and I do like the variety that comes with the set.

"This is a neat little battery pack.  I have a lot of battery packs (I'm kind of known for always carrying at least one or two), and one of my favorites was an old, old (in tech years) model that had its own little cable built in.  I've gotten bigger and better batteries since then, but this is the first one I've come across that also has a built-in cable.  This is especially exciting for me because my daughter is always borrowing my battery packs and misplacing the cables.The plug is a little different than it appears in the picture (there's just one plug, with the Apple and Android connectors sticking out at a right angle from each other).  Once plugged into your phone, you need to push the power button to initiate charging.  The battery arrived 3/4 full, but the instruction pamphlet says charging from drained will take about 4 hours.The unit only weighs about 2 ounces, which I think is GREAT (the brick I currently carry most often has a lot more capacity, but it sure is heavy).  This is a reasonable compromise between capacity and size.  And with the built-in cable, you're always golden (and good for sharing if your friend has a different OS than you).  The only thing that would make this better is if the USB cable for charging the battery pack itself were built in (but it is included).  And maybe if it had a built-in flashlight.  But at this price point (currently $10), I think it's a fantastic deal, and I absolutely love the size and weight.Note:  The manufacturer sent this battery pack to me at no cost for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3230N5ZMAPRAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01450HA9O#wasThisHelpful","R3230N5ZMAPRAG","AXAJXJZUL2J5P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXAJXJZUL2J5P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cool little bowl set.  My husband is always eating cherries and other things with pits, so I thought this would be perfect for that.  Unfortunately, the serving bowl is smaller than the debris bowl, only holding maybe a cup or so, much smaller than my husband would take for fruit (he gets a big bowlful to eat over the course of a football game, for example), but on the other hand...portion control.This set could also be used separated, with the bigger bowl being used for something like chips, and the smaller bowl for dip.Aside from being on the small side, I really like it.  It feels solidly made, and it's really cute.  It's not microwavable.  It's made in China (says the box), but this is not stamped on the bottom of the bowls, nor is even the manufacturer's name (Kody), so I worry a little bit about accountability and the possibilities of lead-containing paint and all that.  I probably wouldn't feed a young child out of it for that reason, but I'm not worried enough to keep my husband or me from using it.

"I have a free-standing cabinet I love except that the sides are open, so the contents make it look cluttered when viewed from the side, plus (worst of all) everything in it gets dusty.

"This is a well-constructed, practical product, beautifully packaged for gift-giving or treating yourself.With boiling water inside, the outside only reaches a pleasant level of warmth (nothing feels quite as good as a warm cup in your hands on a cold morning).  The lid is flat on top and is stable enough to securely hold the tea basket after steeping if you choose, but I prefer to continue using it as a lid to help keep my tea hot while I drink it.  I wish the lid were double-walled as well, because it gets quite hot, and I hate seeing all that heat dissipating when it could be keeping my tea hot for a prolonged sipping.  But at least it does have a lid, which is especially indispensable while steeping, but, to me, also while sitting.As is typical with glass tea baskets, the little slits allow a bit of the finer particulates to get into your tea, more than you would experience with a metal  basket (see the picture I uploaded of the dregs in my cup after steeping with this basket).  My favorite metal sieve basket fits quite handily, and though it won't look as elegant as the glass basket included with this cup, it won't let nearly as much particulate get through (even the best leaves have some); and, with its handle, it will be much easier to remove.  I found it kind of difficult to remove this glass basket without getting an uncomfortable amount of steam rising up on my fingers, plus the glass was just kind of hot.  So even though watching ""the agony of the leaves"" (a real term!) is an appreciated part of a modern tea ceremony, this glass basket, like all I've tried, just isn't that practical.The cup itself is beautiful.  A cup of tea almost looks like artwork sitting in it.  And, as I mentioned, it does a good job of insulating (pre-warm the cup by rinsing it with a bit of boiling water from the kettle if making black tea).  The thickness of the cup tapers near the rim, which is good, but it's still much thicker than I'd like, because tea is best drunk from a delicately rimmed cup.  I used to drink tea from a tea mug (I liked how the mug held the heat) until an Indian friend (who was raised in Kenya and the UK, so tea was prominent in his upbringing) snobbishly told me that we are not animals, and tea can only be properly drunk from a good china teacup.  Despite his airs (he did have his tongue in cheek, but only a bit), I discovered that there is some validity to what he said.  In a large, thick-walled cup, your lips are open much more as you drink, preventing you from properly aerating the tea (thus maximizing the flavor) against your tongue.  Drinking tea from a thick-walled cup is like drinking wine from a mug.  I don't even drink, but I get that.Nevertheless, unconventional vessels may be appropriate on occasion.  This will not be my everyday teacup, but I will definitely use it from time to time, such as sitting outside with my husband on a cool evening, or any other time when I won't have easy access to my teapot hot plate.  I've been sipping a cup of tea while writing this review, and I'm pleased with how warm (and for how long) this insulated cup kept my tea.  I write slowly (like I drink my tea), and it would have been stone-dead cold by now if it had been sitting on the desk in a regular teacup.Note:  The manufacturer sent me this teacup at no cost for review purposes.Update 11-19-15:  I've found that I use this cup more than I expected.  I've been drinking more single cups (as opposed to steeping a whole pot) lately, and when I do that, the long-sipping properties of this one just call out to me.  I have a lot of very pretty teacups to choose from, but I keep using this one because HOT tea is so important to me.  I also really appreciated the clear basket recently when I acquired a bag of very fine jasmine tea pearls, which would create a crime against humanity to not steep in a clear basket.  I've also recently gotten comments from others along the lines of, ""Oh, I NEED a cup like that!""

"I like our porch light fixture and did not want to replace it to gain a dusk-to-dawn function, but I had a tough time remembering to turn it off and on each day.  I had looked at light-sensing devices you can screw in, but they tend to be bulky and unattractive.  So I was delighted when I found this bulb (I didn't even know a bulb with a built-in sensor was a thing!).  The current price ($7.50; I think I paid a little over $8) seems pretty decent for the added functionality.At times, we have thought it was malfunctioning.  It might not come on until later (darker) than you'd expect, and in the morning it might stay on a little later (brighter) than you'd expect.  And it seems to vary how much light it takes to activate/deactivate it.  But by the time it's fully dark, it is reliably on, and by the time it's fully light, it has reliably gone off.  I have never found it on during the day (even though our porch is on the north side and shaded), and I have never found it off during the night.The nearby streetlight does not seem to interfere with it, but opening the front door when the foyer light is on seems to confuse the sensor, and the bulb starts slowly blinking off and on.  But once we close the door, it snaps out of it and comes on immediately.  It's not perfect, but it does work, and I feel so much better knowing that my porch light is going to come on every night without my having to think about it, especially when I'm not home.  Now that's it's fall, it's always dark when my husband gets home from work, and sometimes even when my daughter gets home from after-school activities.

"I really like using self tanner in mousse form. To me, it much easier to apply it. If you are a little scared of using a lotion or cream, you may like using a mousse. Ive used creams, lotions, mousses, and sprays and prefer a mousse probably the best.With this product and this brand in general, there is no stinky tanner smell. Ive used tanners so long that I remember the days of having to shower to get the horrible smell off.

"I love this brand of self tanner. It has a cooler tone to it than other brands that Ive tried so it is much less orange. The easiest way to apply it is with a tanning mitt. I like to apply it with a tanning mitt and then go back over my whole body once more with the mitt to make sure its all even. Tanning mitts can be purchased separately, I use the one sold by the same brand.Besides the tone and coloring being so nice, it fades so evenly. I think that is such a stand out feature about this tanner. I dont get those unsightly, patchy spots. It just fades away evenly. It stays on for a good week and then I notice that Im just lighter again.

"I love packing cubes. After the first time that we traveled with packing cubes, Ive been hooked. They are very convenient. You can separate and organize your items in your luggage either by items or by person. My favorite way to pack now is for each person to have a different color of packing cube so everyone can grab their items at a glance.This set includes 3 different sized packing cubes. The cubes are in a small, medium, and large. The are a very good size. One side is the colored nylon side, the other side is clear plastic. Each one has a handle.Many packing cubes are mesh at least on one side so wet or sweaty items can breathe. These have no mesh and arent ventilated.

The rescue rig and Rescue Bot High Tide are plastic but the Cody and Servo pieces are cardboard cutouts. For a brand like Playskool, a toy over $20, the Rescue Bots, the age range, for all that, cardboard cutouts just sound bizarre. Why?The Rescue Rig has to be assembled of course. The Rescue Rig and High Tide are made out of plastic. Even the plastic used seems cheap and thin. Playskool was really cutting corners on the cost of this toy.

"I had read the reviews previous to using these so I knew that they come stiff. These are almost sponge-like but larger and flat like a wash rag. They swell up slightly when wet and dry back out when not in use.I found these to be practical and useful for wiping up countertops and tabletops more than for washing dishes.

"The CAILLER L'Ecorce Dark Chocolate Cocoa Bar is a dark chocolate bar. It's definitely not the best dark chocolate that I've tried. It isn't as creamy or rich tasting as Ghirardelli.

I know that it is a dark chocolate and it's not supposed to be creamy like a milk chocolate bar but you want it creamy in texture as it melts in your mouth.

"I personally thought the whole line of Create a WWE Superstar was gimmicky and set up to just make parents buy more wrestlers. The premise of the sets are that the arms, legs, heads, and all the accessories can be taken off and mixed and matched with other wrestlers which are of course, sold separately but my boys have absolutely loved them.They love action figures anyway and I think there is something cool about the wrestlers to them. They have actually loved taking off all the parts and switching them around. I constantly hear the pop, pop of a head or arms getting jerked off and switched.The set also comes with tattoos that can be applied to the wrestler.

I had the old plastic ones in the past and they would end up getting cut up and I would be afraid that little pieces of the board may get into the food so I havent used one of those for years.

The iNeibo says that it wont cut or scratch. Its also dishwasher safe.I was very pleased when the cutting board arrived. Its much bigger and heavier than I imagined it would be. It feels substantial and gives you plenty of cutting room. The silicone doesn't slip around on counters either.It has a neat feature in that it has measurements marks around the sides but they arent in inches.When it came, it did have a silicone chemical scent but went away completely after I ran it through the dishwasher.Since its silicone, its also microwavable or even safe in the oven to 425 degrees.I received a sample product free for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34JP47IQNLKKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VI145KQ#wasThisHelpful","R34JP47IQNLKKD","ALNFHVS3SC4FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALNFHVS3SC4FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its zippable and can be removed to be cleaned.I do not detect any kind of odor or chemical smell to the pillow at all.

"My boys have wanted their own tablet for years now which seems funny to say since they are only 8 and 10. Ive had a Kindle Fire HDX and its usually with me. The boys also get to use an iPad at school occasionally so they are well aware of tablets and what you can do on them. I had hesitated though because I didnt want to let my kids loose on a device that gave them access to the world wide web. I mean seriously, World Wide. Moms just have visions of what all that can lead to. I also didnt want to hand my Kindle Fire over to realize that they had bought in-app purchases and what not without realizing that they were spending real money. I know there are restrictions that can be placed for that but you never know. Its hard to tell sometimes in a game if you are spending coins that you earned playing the game or spending coins that someone has to actually pay for.It is more expensive than a regular Kindle. Amazon now has one for $50. Amazons kids Kindle is selling for $99 while the Epic is running $129 at time of this review. The Kindle has 8GB memory while the Epic has 16 but you can install a microSD card in the Kindle for more memory. The cameras in both are 2 MP.The Epic comes with 20 apps already installed. Other LeapFrog apps and games can be purchased in addition. This is not like the LeapFrog LeapPad or Explorers, this does not take game cartridges but is a true android tablet.I definitely prefer both the LeapFrog Epic or the Kids Kindle Fire over other non-kid tablets just because of they are kid friendly, kid-safe, and durable. With the LeapFrog, you still lock yourself into the all the LeapFrog only apps, etc. but you do get a real tablet with internet access. With the Kids Kindle Fire, you also get a free year of the Amazon Freetime Unlimited which includes free access to 10,000 kid-friendly books, movies, TV shows, educational apps, and games. I still think its hard to beat a Kindle and the value of all that Amazon offers.What I like about the LeapFrog Epic is that my boys have grew up on the LeapFrog Explorers and LeapPads and they are familiar with them and the way it looks, operates and is set up. That made it an easy transition to this Epic tablet for them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41YQ67T6R96U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R41YQ67T6R96U","ALNFHVS3SC4FV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALNFHVS3SC4FV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a 3rd generation 7 Kindle Fire HDX and one of the new 7 Kindle Fires that was just released. This case fits both of the Kindle Fires with their cases on with ample room left over. It is not a tight squeeze at all. It leaves plenty of room for plugs and accessories. It would still fit the 8"" with no problems. This is specifically for Fires so I wanted to address the size for Kindles right off.I actually wanted this for my sons new LeapFrog Epic 7 tablet. The Epic also comes in a big, thick kid-sized case. It does still fit in this case but barely. I want to mention that in case someone is considering this case for the Epic. Leapfrog does sell their own cases and one of those would probably be a better fit. With the Epic, there is not room for the cord.Back to the case. The case is very dark navy neoprene with bright blue fabric on the inside. On the outside: one side contains a slot for a name badge. The name badge is a piece of paper behind clear plastic like the way  a luggage tag is made. The other side contains a zippered compartment.

"My boys have started wearing these type of athletic pants all the time to school. My boys who are 8 and 10 are actually the same size and both wear the same size. Neither of my boys are very tall but they are muscular built so jeans dont fit them all that well. The athletic pants with an elastic waist fits them pretty well. We have been buying the Starter brand that we buy at Wally World. That brand fits them really well. This brand seems to run a little smaller in the waist and a little long in length which is not what we need.I have the same size in both brands I was surprised to see how much smaller the STX brand was. Ive included a picture with the two pairs together. This brand, STX is the black one on top. They are a good 2 inches smaller than the Starter brand.

"My sons loved this set so much that they fought over who got it. My one son loves anything green and the other loves anything athletic so it was exactly what they both wanted.The set contains 1 pair of shorts, 1 tee, and 1 tank top.

The set is 100% polyester although the t-shirt has that cotton tee look.The style, colors, and fit were all great. It was generously sized with no shrinkage. I like that it is a size 10 which can be hard to find. Many clothes companies do the combo size of 8/10 or 10/12. It does fit closer to a 10/12 than an 8/10.The only negative is that it came in a plastic bag and had a strong chemical smell.

"This is such a lovely serving piece by Lenox. It has the delicate, classy of Lenox but for a fraction of the cost of their bone china because it is crafted from porcelain.This a 2-piece cold dip bowl set, it has a shallow bowl and a deep bowl. The shallow bowl is for the dip and has a 16-oz capacity. You place the shallow bowl with dip in it on top of the deep bowl that you fill with ice. The ice from the deep bowl keeps your dips cold which is great for cream cheese and sour cream type dips.The shallow bowl has a gold rim and the holly print inside the bowl. The deep ice bowl has the holly print all around on the outside.Both bowls say dishwasher safe but Im always a little leary about washing gold rimmed dishes in the dishwasher. I will wash mine by hand to be safe.Im really pleased with the quality. There doesnt appear to have any imperfections of any sort.

As I read, I felt like I was listening to the narration of a good documentary, which was explained when I saw that the author was a BBC documentarian.I really like the world-wide scope of this book, and the fact that it includes many non-traditional kinds of architecture.  I have quibbles with some of the selections: there are better examples of Mayan architecture, and interesting buildings have been left out (a second volume perhaps)?  Although it calls itself a ""history"", chapters are  conceptual, rather than chronological.The images, though not tiny, are too small to fully appreciate the buildings, so it is not going on my art book shelf.

But there are a number of nice features.  It is organized into seasons, but includes a section of year-around projects as well as seasonal projects.  One thing nice is that it includes almost 40 useful recipes for home care (e.g. ""DIY Oven Cleaner that Really Works) and personal care (e.g. lip balm).For each season, there are sections for recipes, preserving, home care, and personal care.  (The last three topics are great ideas for diy gifts).  But even before that, there are 100 pages of basics and techniques -- not only is this informative, it has a nice tang of pragmaticness.  Personally, I think the food recipes are fine but not novel to me, but I've got a lot of experience in this area, though they may be quite useful to less experienced cooks.Besides the organization, what I really like about this book is that there is a lot of depth to her thinking and analysis.  She has really thought out various aspects of her approach, for example, how not to be wasteful (e.g. interesting ways to use scraps of food, like making vinegar out of scraps of fruit trimmings), or the tradeoff between diy and ""outsourcing"" (e.g. it is worth buying soy sauce rather than making your own, saving your diy time for other things).  She has a great way of organizing information, such as a table of cleaning products in order of pH, or top tips for food preservations (e.g. ""Brine fermenting is faster and simpler than vinegar pickling, especially for small batches of vegetables"").Overall, this would be a great gift for a diy type, and I am really looking forward to making projects out of this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWHTUZHA4JVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570619913#wasThisHelpful","R2IWHTUZHA4JVC","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This fits perfectly inside the inner pot of 6 quart electric pressure cookers.  It makes it so easy to make, for example, stock, I just put my flavor ingredients (typically vegetable trimmings and chicken bones) in this mesh basket, cook for a while in the pressure cooker, and then lift out this basket to have just the pure stock left behind.The one thing is you have to break off the handles in order to fit inside a standard 6 quart electric pressure cooker.  They are surprisingly easy, too easy, to break off, which is probably a problem for those who wish to keep the handles.

"The content of this book is better than I had hoped.  For Knitters who are interested in stitch anatomy and alternate ways of doing increases and decreases, and the resulting appearance, this is a gold mine.  It is nicely organized into increases and decreases of different types, and then has a separate section of increases and decreases for special circumstances such as lace, textures, cables, ruching, bobbles, color, tams.Everything is illustrated with clear color photos.  And here is the problem:  the page size is so small that most techniques take several pages to illustrate, so that you can't see it all at once.  It would be so much better if this book had larger pages, so that each technique's photos and illustrations could be seen on a single page or two-page spread.But in spite of this, the content here is incredibly useful to knitters who have progressed beyond the beginner stage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5LT1KRWPGWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612123317#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5LT1KRWPGWC","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"CONs - can't insert plugs completely, weak protection, not arranged for power adaptorsPROs - sliding outlet covers, screw holes in back, UL ListedThe biggest problem with this strip is that I cannot insert plugs all the way, and power flows when a plug is not completely inserted -- what is in the innards of this thing?.  When I was a kid I thought it was fun to get a buzz by letting my finger touch both live prongs of a partially inserted plug at the same time, but I don't think that this is such a good idea any more. I'm surprised it is ""US Listed"".  Though it worked fine once things were (partially) plugged into it.If you are still considering purchasing this strip, here are some more details:If you need good surge protection, you want to look for one with a higher joule rating.  Practically every other surge protector is rated at significantly more than 250 joules.  Think of this more as a power strip than as a real surge protector.  It is fine for mechanical appliances, but due to the outlet arrangement and the weak protection, it isn't for delicate electronics.Because of the short cord, it is useful only if you want a few additional outlets close to an existing outlet. In my kitchen this would work for attaching underneath a cabinet (using the screw holes in the back) by my little appliance village.However, if you need to plug in power adaptors, the way these are aligned will make it so you can't use the neighboring outlet, thus reducing capacity.  (I suspect it is cheaper to manufacture if the outlets are lined up this way.)And, If you simply need more outlets, you might also want to consider instead a wall-mounted ""6-outlet tap"" (searching for that phrase on Amazon will show you lots of alternatives).This power strip is missing many bells and whistles that some might prefer to have, like a blinking light to indicate prior power surges or surge alarm, right-angle plug, usb charger ports, and so forth.  It does have sliding covers for each outlet.  It is made in China.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYN4WQIP6UWP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMJGY#wasThisHelpful","RYN4WQIP6UWP1","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lot clunkier than I imagined, and I've ended up not using it.  First of all, the description says it is 12"" long, but including the handle, mine is 13"" long when folded. And the bundles of tubes are rather wide.  I was hoping for something that had the convenience of a collapsible folding umbrella which could them be opened up when I needed a stick.  I guess I've been spoiled by the convenience of my telescoping tripod.As a walking stick, it seems decent, though a little wobbly.  If you're flying somewhere and need to carry a walking stick folded in your carry-on, this is a good one.  But if you want a compact stick to carry around with you all the time and which you can then open up when you, say, walk on unstable rocks, or encounter unfriendly dogs, this stick, folded up, makes a larger bundle that is inconvenient to carry along routinely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6W4E6HMJW87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q2B2SC#wasThisHelpful","R2M6W4E6HMJW87","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Get these for the caramel, not for the chocolate.  I was really hoping for a chocolaty treat combined with caramel.  Instead it is super sweet caramel with a breath of chocolate.  If you want good chocolate, look elsewhere.The caramel itself is good, nice smooth texture and not too firm, nice flavor.  But I can barely taste the chocolate, on both types.  To me they taste too sweet, but then I prefer a lower ratio of sweetness in general, others may like them.  But I was really hoping for more chocolaty flavor.  However, for the right person, this would make a good gift.One thing good is that each piece is individually wrapped, so they will stay fresh (hopefully) even after the tin is opened.  And the tin is nice (as tins go), one which many people will want to keep because of the Hershey's logo.  The tin is about 7-1/4 inch in diameter and about 5-3/8 inches high.A few other details:- the first ingredient is corn syrup, and then after the chocolates, there is sweetened condensed milk followed by high fructose corn syrup (no wonder I can't taste the chocolate and they are too sweet),- each piece weighs about half an ounce (in the wrapper), and the total contents weighed 2.5 lbs,- the ""Best By"" date of my batch is 6/2016, and- they are made in Mexico.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKVXJLMRQ9B6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZANRMSK#wasThisHelpful","ROKVXJLMRQ9B6","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the built-in thermometer probe is not something I use all the time, it is really handy and makes this appliance much more useful than other toaster ovens, because you can program it to cook just until the done temperature is reached, and then either turn off or switch to keep warm.  This is useful not only for meats, but also for baked goods (bread is done from 200-210), casseroles and reheating frozen food (165 degrees +). I found a comprehensive list of internal temperatures for all different kinds of foods, and at WhatsCookingAmerica that got me going, and then when I cook my own recipes, I notice at what temperature they are ""done"", and then the next time I make them I can program it to stop cooking at the precise moment, even if I am not around.The one problem is that the lowest temperature you can specify as a stopping point is 140 degrees, so if you want to cook a meat to rare or medium rare, you have to watch it yourself and manually stop it at a lower temperature.  However, ""Warm"" is just the right temperature to slowly raise a piece of meat to rare, so I've made some great steaks by first searing the meat, and then letting it slowly come up to my desired doneness on ""Warm"" while I then work on other parts of the meal.As a toaster oven, it isn't perfect, but the advantages of probe controlled cooking makes the flaws easy to ignore.  In particular, it is warmer on the left, so I simply utilize that feature by putting larger pieces to the left, or by rotating half way through cooking.  Also, there are two rack positions but it comes with only one rack.  I ordered a second rack on their site, and frequently use both racks during a meal.  They say it is 11"" wide on the inside, but it is just a smidgen under, so my 11 inch pizza pans have to go in slightly tilted until I get to the middle of the toaster and can find a spot that will let them lie flat.  As a toaster, it is a little on the slow side, and often I will ""preheat"" it by turning on toast while I am preparing whatever it is that I am going to put inside.I had an older one of these, and after many years of use, the number display became hard to read -- I could figure it out but others could not.  But I liked the features of this model so much that I bought a new one, but have kept the old one as an extra to bring out and use when I have lots of cooking going on.Note, Hamilton Beach has a number of temperature controlled kitchen appliances.  They have a slow cooker with a temperature probe, and a water kettle that will heat the water to the precise temperature you want.  I'm definitely watching this line of appliances to see what else they will come up with that has innovative features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A31P0782514D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039BJ3JG#wasThisHelpful","R1A31P0782514D","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"needed a phone that would work with only ""line power"", so that it would work when the power is out.  I narrowed it down to two models, and picked this one because of the large display and buttons, which are easier to see when the power is out.  This phone is great, because the basic functions work when the power is out, but if you're interested in the bells and whistles, those work only when there is additional power.  And at the time I bought it, it cost very little.Note, although this phone has a large base, it is very light, as though there is really not much in the base, which is there only to provide a space to present the large buttons.Note, many of our neighbors have accepted fiber optics from the phone company, which means that they don't have line power to make their phones work when the power goes out (the fiber optic installation has a battery, but from what I've heard it doesn't last that long).  I simply cannot be out of touch that long (old sick family members) so we have refused the fiber optic ""upgrade"", and are very happy when the power goes out that this phone keeps working.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H25IOA4673UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007B5VH0E#wasThisHelpful","R2H25IOA4673UW","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm glad to have this, since I usually make a mess when cooking, and I prefer to avoid getting spots on my clothes.  It is useful to have the neck strap be adjustable, that way I can make this apron align where I want it to.  The twill fabric is a bit heavier than simple woven fabric would be, which is good since it will make it harder for grease stains to pass through.It shrunk significantly with the first laundering.  It lost 2 inches of length and 1 inch of width, so that after washing it is 30 inches in height (not counting neck strap) and 27 inches wide at the bottom. After laundering, the waist ties are each about 34"" long (originally 36"") and the apron at the waist is a bit over 26 inches wide. (I washed in room-temp water and dried on ""medium"".  In case there is a difference from one batch of fabric to the next, mine is black.)Note, the description of this product mentions two pockets. The one I got has only one pocket, around the belly-button area, which is a bit larger (after laundering) than 9 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

I see why the comparison was made, but to me the tone is different -- it doesn't have the same kinds of capers with comedic aspects, and the protagonist quest doesn't involve seeking boyfriends.  Instead, it involves unexpected pairings of people, with money-raising schemes, and one of the main issues driving the plot involves dealing with people who are suffering the effects of dementia and other mental/medical issues.It is nicely fleshed out and realized, but I would like to have had more depictions of the inner life of the boy protagonist.

"This book provides an excellent reference manual of FileMaker Pro itself, but it is uncertain who the target audience is.  It is not for DB beginners, because it doesn't talk about what databases are, why you'd want to use them, getting started building DBs, etc.Experienced FileMaker users would benefit most from the depth of coverage in this ""reference manual"" level documentation of the FileMaker Pro system.  Yet things which experienced users need, such as concise summary lists of functions (one per line), are not here.  And the in-depth explanations of how to do things remain at a beginner level throughout the book, including ""click on this"" types of instructions for those who haven't ever done those steps before.  It would have been better to not spell out all those step-by-step instructions every single time, and instead spend some time/space on synthesizing and summarizing the features and resources of FileMaker Pro instead.Also for those used to other DB systems and who know well how to build databases, just not in FileMaker, would benefit with a ""just the gist"" kind of coverage, rather than the exhaustive detail which is in this 2-inch thick heavy book.With the depth of explanation, it may be good for advanced CS people who are studying and mastering FileMaker Pro.  However, even they would benefit from some of the overview and summary information that is missing from this entry into the Missing Manual series.

"This cable worked with all the devices I used to test it.  Specifically, it works fine as a data sync cable for Apple devices using the Lightning connector, and it works fine as a charging cable using either the micro-USB or the Lightning connector.It is compact (7"" from end to end, not including the Lightning adaptor), so it is easy to carry around -- I am going to replace two different cables with this one.  However, due to its short length, it is hard to actually use your device while charging it, so you may prefer a longer version of this cable.  Even just a few inches longer would make this cable be a bit more usable in action.Also, it could use some protective caps for the ends when not in use.  They put so much material and design work into the box that I'm just going to toss into recycle, that it would have been nice if they had put a tiny portion of that packaging effort into including protective caps.Finally, though there are no hints of problems with this cable, I've had Lightning cables go bad (both Apple and Belkin), so if you may want to make sure you keep another Lightning cable as backup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36YIY4V6NJFZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQCUC2I#wasThisHelpful","R36YIY4V6NJFZL","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROs- handles & zippers on both ends, see-through top, breatheableCONs- no moisture barrier on bottom, flimsyA few well thought out touches make these good for under-bed storage of large items (or many small items).  These are long, so there are handles on each end, as well as zipper openings.  So it is easy to access items from either end of this long rectangular storage bag.  Also the top is covered by clear plastic, so you can see what is where inside the bag without opening it.  The sides and bottoms are breathable to keep items from getting ""stale"".They are cheaply made of attractive but lightweight materials, but under bed storage is really a light use application.  But don't expect the quality of construction you'd find with a heavy duffle bag suitable for checking as luggage.Two issues which might be important to you.  First, at times we have trouble with musty floors during rains, and it would be better if there were a waterproof bottom -- but I can do it by DIY by putting a large garbage bag on the bottom.Secondly, for some people with allergy problems, it might be good to have it constructed from fabric which is impervious to dust mites.

"PROs- can charge devices & battery simultaneously, two USB outputs, high capacityCONs- no built-in prongs, larger than alternatives, included cord hides needed micro-USB plugLike the FluxMob Bolt , this is one of the few power banks which can simultaneously power your devices as well as store charge in its internal battery.  Having dual functions at the same time can be very handy if you have a short period of time in which to charge your devices as well as battery backup (e.g. while changing planes).This one claims to store either 4200, 6000, or 9000 mAH of power (depending on which one you choose), unlike the Bolt which claims to store only 3000mAH.  And it is really nice that there are two USB output ports, so that you can power two devices at once.However, it is missing the built-in outlet prongs of the Bolt, so you have to carry around a wall-to-USB base.  Also it is about twice as large as the Bolt, so if you are budgeting space, that can be an issue.  Speaking of budgeting space, it seems like some of the deep textured design on the rubbery surface is taking up room, and it could be a bit more compact if it skipped that part, however, the rounded edges and corners make it feel good in the hand.The included cord is rather clever, at first appearing to be the wrong type.  It appears to be a standard-A to mini-B USB plug, which is not what the box needs to charge.  However, if you pull on the useless mini-B plug, a micro-B plug is revealed.  I didn't realize this at first and raided my cable drawer to be able to charge the thing (I needed to provide wall outlet prongs also).  This dual cord-type could be useful if those match the devices you carry around.  (If you want to see an image of these different plugs, look at the ""Connector Types"" section of the Wikipedia article about USB.)For the space and the modest price increase, I think it is worth getting the largest capacity possible.  And for the right person, it could make a useful gift.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33K2GCDOPZSDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDF70N6#wasThisHelpful","R33K2GCDOPZSDV","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is an incredibly detailed account of the rise of the MP3, interwoven with the story of the music industry versus music piracy, written by a journalist/math major with prior experience with the world of Wall Street.  While I was generally aware of the general flow of events, this book details specific meetings, detailed business dealings, law enforcement and court activities, and so forth. It gives a good window on the growth and changes of the internet over the same period of time, from the music industry point of view.  The pivotal results are at the very end of the book.The end of the book explains how he tracked down and pulled together all of the threads in this book, the interviews he conducted, and the published sources he relied upon.  Yet sometimes, events in the remote time and past have such vivid detail that I wonder how much is reconstructed after the fact; for example, when describing a meeting in 1995, he describes someone speaking in ""sentences, punctuated with short, sharp intakes of breath"".  Still, there is an incredible amount of meticulous research and detail in this book.  If there is any flaw, it would be this book is filled out with overly detailed results of dedicated research, and that some people may prefer to read a more analytical and condensed version of this tale.Along the way, this book, in the first chapter, reveals  how and why MP3s suck, compared to CD music quality.  In the first chapter, the science of psychoacoustics suggested where and how bits of music information could be thrown away, when digitizing music.  Years ago side-by-side comparisons showed me how much presence and depth of music was missing in MP3, so I have avoided them, so it was illuminating to know the specifics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DQPBVZ2NAYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426612#wasThisHelpful","R5DQPBVZ2NAYO","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first powdered dip mix I have tried that I have liked.  When you first mix it up, the flavor is just about right.  As you let it rest, the flavor grows and the onion flavor gets a bit sharp -- too much flavor is a nice problem to have, but I tone it down by adding a bit more sour cream, so for me it makes even more dip than the back of the envelope states.  Also, my daughter feels it is a bit too sweet and needs a dash of soy sauce to balance it (I like it either way).I have fond memories of green onion dip that my mother would make from a dry mix in the 60s, but when I tried the same brand now, Laura Scudder's Dip Mix, Green Onion , I guess my tastebuds have changed, because it has a fake taste to it now, probably from the MSG.  Another one I tried, Gourmet Village Dip Mix Onion Chive , was out of balance too sweet.  And Lipton Soup & Dip Mix, Onion is not awful, but not great, and missing the freshness of the green onion flavor.  Usually make our own at home out of dried minced onion, fresh chopped scallion greens, and a dash of soy sauce, and leftover caramelized onion if we have some.I'm a big fan of Spice Hunter blends, especially because they aren't filled out with salt, so i was optimistic about trying this dip mix when I saw it in my local store.  I'll be keeping some of it on the shelf.Note, to those who are sensitive, it has no MSG or glutamates or yeast extract.  [Yes I know that when my daughter adds a dash of soy sauce she is adding glutamates, but at least it is not in the form of MSG, and that is the way she likes it.]","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAIJGHKVLJICO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJOGOTY#wasThisHelpful","RAIJGHKVLJICO","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone in the house agreed that this dip was good, but that it covered over the basic flavor of the avocado. The instructions said to mix the contents with one large avocado, I used a single large Haas, but we found the resulting flavor to be too strong.  Adding an additional half an avocado made it better (I do appreciate that they are generous with the flavor ingredients).I tried this because I am a big fan of Spice Hunter in general, especially because they don't pad out their spice blends with salt. i find their Steak & Chop Grill & Broil blend to be very useful in all sorts of dishes, including roasted vegetables, grilled burgers, dips, etc.  And their Green Onion Dip Mix is really good, without the MSG of other brands of green onion dip.  But I won't be getting their guacamole mix again.To me, the point of guacamole is to taste the avocado. I prefer Guatemalan style with just a bit of white onion, a pinch of oregano, mexican/key lime juice and salt to taste.  So while this was not bad, to me it misses the point of guacamole, it would have been better if it enhanced the avocado rather than overwhelmed it.Perhaps it would be useful if you don't have access to good avocados, to make weak avocados work, like during that time of year when most of the avocados aren't so good.p.s. I was really happy to find this mix at my local market.  I really didn't want to have to buy many packages (as listed on Amazon), just to be able to try it.  I won't be buying this one again, but I will be buying their Green Onion Dip Mix, and will continue to try out others from Spice Hunter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7T3XO8W3251/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJOGXAE#wasThisHelpful","RM7T3XO8W3251","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a couple of different things.  On the surface, it is a chronological account of Jackley's path from early encounters with poverty, anecdotes of people and situations throughout her schooling and her work in other countries, on to the founding of Kiva and later ProFounder, interspersed with brief profiles of micro-entrepreneurs she encountered along the way.  But what takes this book to another level is that she extracts lessons and advice from these experiences, that would be useful to anyone struggling to build an organization which can accomplish things.Early on, she talks about her frustrations in trying to find a lawyer to help set up Kiva so that it conformed with SEC regulations.  While seeking other supporters to work with, she learned that she had to customize the language she used for each person, and that she ""had to tell stories to move a person from a place of ignorance to a place of understanding"".  After a while, I realized that this is exactly what this book is doing, telling her stories to the reader, to convey the perspectives and tactics she has realized over time.Sometimes the lessons surprise you by jumping out from behind a simple anecdote. For example, in one chapter she talks about building her initial team, then she started reminiscing about dealing with chickens that people would give her when she visited in Uganda, and then suddenly her flock of hens and a rooster brought her to the importance of picking strong team leaders (roosters) and getting out of the way to get them to lead.  Then she proceeds to expand upon experiences with her team leaders.Much wisdom about making good things happen in an entrepreneurial way, and choices in life, are in this book.  I was interested in reading it because I am reaching a stage where I want to focus on charitable choices I'd like to make, but I thought the book was going to focus on specific kinds of activities worldwide, rather than building effective organizations which make a difference.  Still, there are lots of good lessons in this book which I find illuminating and helpful in refining my own goals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QWVQWB3PKDQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679643761#wasThisHelpful","R1QWVQWB3PKDQ2","AO9UNKQG83BUP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9UNKQG83BUP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ah that feeling -- when you just finish a great story and only want more -- more of the characters and another great suspense thriller to capture your interest and enthrall you for a couple of hours. That's how I feel after finishing this 4th book in one of my new favorite series.DI Helen Grace is a very complex and interesting woman. In this case, she is investigating a series of arsons that have left several dead women in the ashes of burnt out houses. An excellent police procedural, the reader follows Helen and her team as they try to put the disparate pieces of this puzzle together to stop a killer without conscience. Red herrings abound, and I was stunned by the denouement and revelation of the killer and the motives.I cannot wait for the next one (LITTLE BOY BLUE). If you like strong female lead protagonists and lots of action with supporting characters who add to the depth of the story within, you will like this series. I am one of those people who has to read a series in order, and I think that the reader sees the development of the characters by doing this, which ends up further cementing the attachment to the setting and characters.Series order  Eeny Meeny  Pop Goes the Weasel  The Doll's House  Liar Liar  Little Boy Blue","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3772PDSLAMDU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1405919213#wasThisHelpful","R3772PDSLAMDU9","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sunglasses are the right size and shape to protect the eyes of my 5-year-old grandson. The lenses are polarized and orange in color with a black rubber flexible frame. These are basic sunglasses that I hope will last for a long while, but don't have much hope as this is the type of item that tends to get broken by repeated overstretching, sitting on, running over with bicycles or some other method. The price is right to replace them, however, should that happen.I feel it's important that kids wear sunglasses to protect from UVA and UVB light and I was happy to receive this complimentary pair for my objective evaluation and review. RIVBOS makes these kids sunglasses in a variety of styles and colors that would work great for both girls and boys. Depending on the size of your child's face, nose, ears, the fit will vary, but I would guess should fit ok for most above age 3.The first set of these I got had a lens scratched at delivery so I contacted RIVBOS and they sent a replacement pair right away -- that kind of customer service is definitely an important factor when placing online orders. I'd recommend them as you can order with confidence. The sunglasses come with a black drawstring pouch for storage and protection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLCPZZO8L3LS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012W5ZPZA#wasThisHelpful","R2WLCPZZO8L3LS","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this block print dress. I have the pink, white and navy version. My dress arrived without a care/content tag so I was unsure about proper washing and care.  It had a few wrinkles from packaging which were easily ironed out with a warm setting. It did not scorch/singe. The sizing chart is a little different than the USA sizes. I usually wear a 6-8 and the XL size fits me and hits just a bit above mid thigh.

"This is a very soft and lightweight electric heated blanket that will surround you in warmth and comfort. I have used an electric blanket on my bed for most of my life and have had mixed results with the various different brands. The big issues for me have always been, how fast does it get warm, is the blanket ""zoned"" to provide more warmth at the feet, and how can I remember to turn it off.This blanket solves my major problem of remembering to turn it off as it has an automatic shutoff after 10 hours. I can't tell you how much peace of mind that gives me. One of the things I always worried about was leaving it on and creating a fire hazard -- and wasting electricity. Problem solved.The blanket is not zoned and provides a uniform heat -- directions say to make sure that the label is at the foot of the bed facing up as the heat is produced in a downward fashion. The top of the blanket is still warm anyway, just not as warm as underneath. I placed the blanket on top of a thin down comforter and I set the heat level at 8 and leave it there all night long. The unit does have dual controls for both sides of the bed, ideal for those of us who sleep in the same bed with someone who doesn't want to get too hot. It is also programmable so you can decide how long you want it to heat between intervals of 15 minutes to 12 hours. The blanket is thin and you can see and feel the coils, but that is not an issue for me.My complaint is with the controller. It has several buttons to preheat, set the temp level and any timer settings, but the main thing is that it is not backlit and you can't really tell if it is on unless you turn on a light or press the power button so it lights up before it goes off. I wish it was backlit while on. The two cords attached to the controller provide a counterweight to the controller so those tend to pull the unit off the bedside table. I ended up putting it on the floor beside the bed (where I can't reach it, unfortunately as I have a very high set bed), because it kept falling off the table. I don't want to stick it onto the wood of my night table, so it will remain on the floor.I like the blanket and it will keep me warm on those cold winter nights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZH0T671R6NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHFT10#wasThisHelpful","R3LZH0T671R6NS","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always liked pearls, and this is a nice sized set that adds a touch of sophistication to your look as this gem really never goes out of style and is always appropriate either dressed up or down.The set of earrings comes in round pink box with a cute little bow on the outside. The pearls are larger than usual and a button shape so they are not perfectly round. The stud metal is listed as sterling silver on the post so that is helpful information for those of us with sensitive ears or a nickel allergy. I did not experience any redness or other irritation from wearing these for 10-16 hours in a day. They have a nice lustre and are comfortable.The only issue I have with these is that the butterfly used to keep these studs in place is very small and I have replaced those with other, larger fasteners that I already had in my jewelry collection.

"Part police procedural and part mystery, this novel  focuses on the hunt for the person who has abducted and killed 3 women -- and now has possibly taken a fourth.  The women share common traits, most specifically they have dark hair and blue eyes. In addition, each of the bodies discovered on the isolated beach has another commonality -- a bluebird tattoo. Helen knows that the man they are desperately seeking must be linked in some way to all four of the women and she and her team are out pounding the pavement and knocking on doors trying to find the latest victim, Ruby, before she too becomes another.The reader has the benefit of the points of view of Helen, Ruby, and glimpses into the psyche of the man behind these crimes. In addition, Helen is still dealing with her personal problems and work issues with her subordinates and superiors. It is important that you read the first two in the series before opening this one as Helen's character develops and we get more insight into what makes her tick with each book. I like the fast pace and the characters --  the story line is good, and the investigation methodical. If you haven't tried Arlidge before, I'd recommend this series if you like an entertaining thriller that's not too gory.Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group NAL for the e-book ARC to review.

"These are quite the wild looking pair of sunglasses for a fisherman, but very nice for a bicycler. The frames are a basic black/grey with  5 interchangeable lenses of various colors. Each color offers a varying degree of light blockage. They provide a very comfortable fit, no pressure on the temple, nose, or behind the ears. The thing I was especially impressed by was the ventilation all around the frame. The only thing that touches the face is the nose piece -- thus there is no place for the build up of sweat. Most importantly,  the lenses provided for very clear vision and reduce glare.The lenses are very easy to exchange. The case for the glasses and lenses is roomy but compact. A lens cloth, glasses strap, and head band are also included.Although I received a complimentary pair of these polarized sports sunglasses for my objective evaluation and review, I would recommend purchasing these for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KW8J0HP64893/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JB3N23Y#wasThisHelpful","R3KW8J0HP64893","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although some might want to order these for their children, I wanted them for myself! I use a washcloth on my face each morning, and have found them to be the softest I have ever used. Measuring about 10x10 inches square, the cloths are smaller than the typical ones I used to purchase, so are quite perfect for children. They also don't hold as much water, so are lighter and thinner to use. I can't say enough how soft they are, and they just get softer with each laundering. The washcloths are hemmed on all 4 sides.I can't honestly say I know that much about how bamboo is turned into cloth fibers, but these woven cloths are certainly nice and I was quite happy to receive a complimentary set of 6 for my evaluation and review. They come in a nice box, suitable for gift giving, and are free from chemicals, toxins, and dyes -- making them an excellent choice for anyone who has sensitive or delicate skin. The cloths in the box are rolled up and secured with a paper band -- be careful when removing the bands as one of my cloths caught up in the adhesive and some of the woven strands broke and came undone.I wash these in warm water and do not add any bleach.

"I received a complimentary sample of these sweat pants, harem style, in black in size XL. Though I normally would wear a medium, I looked at the chart on the product page -- found that my measurements matched that for the large, and ordered the extra large size because I have had recent experience with Asian sizes and automatically order the size up from what it says I should wear. Result = perfect fit!I love how these pants fit just below the knee, are comfortable and not tight with the baggy legs. The material (I ordered black) has a nice weight and is very soft. The 3-inch waistband is red and gray, with two different types of drawstings -- one is flat with unfinished ends and the other is round with a plastic tip. The top one is a big longer than the lower one and the first thing I do is to knot the strings immediately to prevent them accidentally being drawn into the band. While wearing, I don't tie the bottom string, but I do sort of tie the top one. The pants fit nicely at my waist. There are pockets on each side, about medium size, and though I don't put anything in them while exercising, they would hold a phone or a wallet if need arises. The pants at the bottom are stretchy but fit tight against the shin right below the knee. I like the styling.I wash these in cold water and hang to dry and they have not faded. There were some minor stitching flaws in the waistband area in the back of the garment and some loose threads, but so far has held together and these cosmetic flaws did not impact the fit or the comfort.

"Update 10-18  -- after the second wash, the crotch and seat area seams completely came apart and there are holes in the seams. Tried to contact company but no response. Would not recommend purchasing.Although the measurements on the product page indicated that I should ask for a medium, I went ahead and ordered large because of recent experiences with Asian sizing reminding me that I should always get a size bigger in order for it to fit my body. I am 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weigh between 125 and 130 pounds, and the large fits me perfectly allowing for a little extra room for movement and activity so that it's not binding. I received a complimentary pair of these jogging harem pants for my review and evaluation, and I really like the fit and style.The material is soft and comfortable, and this pair is a dark gray with a 2 inch black waistband with drawstrings that you will want to knot immediately to avoid them being drawn into the waistband. The drawstrings don't have a lot of extra length, and I knot the ends rather than trying to tie them. The pants have nice slim cut legs and the length is about right as they hit me right below my ankle. I like the styling of the large, deep pockets on each side at the hip, but I doubt I'll be putting anything in there while exercising. Definitely holds a phone or a small wallet though if you are wearing them while you are just out and about on a casual day of activity. The hem is double stitched but the threading is not that tight so I hope it won't come undone easily when laundering. I don't put these in the dryer, but I do wash in warm water and hang them up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFA3NLRCQSALR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYCTHG8#wasThisHelpful","RFA3NLRCQSALR","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do quite a bit of traveling and usually end up ""living"" out of my suitcase when I arrive at my destination -- so it's essential that I keep the case organized so that I can get to the items that I need quickly, and also protect them from snagging or other damage while smashed inside luggage. I received this complimentary set of 3 nylon packing cubes in the purple color, and I'm really happy with them.The material is nylon and is easy to clean and also is moisture resistant. The mesh allows whatever is packed inside to be seen easily as well as to keep anything from being without any air to dry or simply circulate to whatever is packed inside. The 3 cubes open almost completely with a zipper -- and there is a ""pull"" on both sides so you don't always need to open the cube completely to get to the item you want out.

"I took this bag to the lake with me for the weekend and can say that it is roomy enough to hold all of my essentials! From swimsuit to clothes to personal hygiene and makeup -- there's plenty of space in this gray tote for everything I needed.The tote is lined inside with a pink shell and has a zipper compartment as well as 2 pockets -- perfect for sliding in my electronics and chargers. The material is polyester and nylon so it won't stain too bad if it gets moisture inside. With the bottom zipper on the outside undone, it expands to hold even more items -- and when stuffed to its limitations, stands about 15 inches high.There's another lined outside zipper pocket as well. The zippers open and close smoothly along the track; I didn't notice any catching.The hand straps and shoulder straps are sturdy and attached with rectangular and semi-circular metal rings. The bag is well-made with the Oiwas label attached to the outside in the same color as the bag. There is one thing that perplexed me, however, and that is this long thing ""cord"" with a metal hinge that is attached to the inside -- perhaps for keys?

"I have what I'd call ""overly processed hair."" It's dry from my hair color and from daily blow drying after a shampoo and rinse. Although I use a lot of moisturizing products, I can't seem to get rid of the dry ends and the frizz so I have been looking at and trying lots of different products meant to restore some shine and moisture. This thin, white lotion isn't the miracle I was hoping for, but it does help some.I squirt about 4-5 pumpfuls of the product onto my hands and then massage it into my towel dried hair, and then comb through with a wide toothed comb. After a bit, I style using the blow dryer and my round brush as usual. Since I have a few gray strands that escape taking on the color, and because of the tendency of my hair to want to curl, I need to work with my hair for a bit to get it styled. I can't say that this shine lotion really does much more than smooth my hair a bit and help with the initial comb out. I don't really see any youthful transformation, but maybe I should have started using this years ago at the first sign of gray.All in all, this product is OK and I love the small, it's easy to use, and it doesn't weigh down my hair. I'll keep using it until the dispenser is empty and by that time, it should have definitely made me a convert or will allow me to pass on future purchases.

"I absolutely love shopping for clothes and nothing beats having them delivered right to your door.  With the crop top trend still in fill swing, I decided it was time I start filling in the gap in my wardrobe! The white blouse is well-designed with just enough length to show off a little stomach without being overly revealing.  I also love that they left the scalloped ends which really adds an extra detail to the shirt.The lace is of good quality and I am not worried about it falling apart on me after a couple wears like some shirts I have previously purchased from other stores (not naming here). The only negative comment that I really have about the top is that the neck is a bit tight for those of us with larger heads, and it is hard to avoid getting makeup on the blouse when pulling it on or off.I received this complimentary blouse for my evaluation and review, but I can honestly say it is a very nice top for a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBWGZ1ME3V8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3I7ITM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBWGZ1ME3V8T","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, creamy, thick night moisturizer. It's unscented and goes on smoothly and completed absorbs within 10 minutes. It leaves my skin soft and eliminates the tight, dry feeling. I've tended toward dry skin for years and am always searching for a really good moisturizer. The product contains vitamin C and other ingredients that have been show to reduce the signs of aging -- such as fine lines and uneven skin tone. I'm not sure how one proves that further wrinkling has been prevented, but it does seem to help smooth my skin.I do not have sensitive skin and I'm not prone to any type of breakout, and this product doesn't produce any untoward reaction on my face. It is FDA approved and made in the USA.The cream comes in a convenient plastic pump and one depression of the plunger provides the right amount of cream to cover my face and neck. The moisturizing effect is noticed immediately and lasts through the night.I received this sample product free for my objective evaluation and review, but I can recommend it for anyone wanting a moderately heavy night cream with some anti-aging benefits.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9XRVX1HAQDII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHXPMCM#wasThisHelpful","R9XRVX1HAQDII","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you can see from the attached picture, these are very pretty and are the perfect size for a stud-style pierced earring. The setting is sterling silver and is oval-shaped with tiny cubic zirconia that create a lovely sparkle without looking gaudy. The 4 prongs hold the created blue saphhire stone and the space below it allows the light to enter in order to really make the stone glow.The set of earrings comes in a small, velvet-lined box that would make it very nice for gift-giving. Any woman would be thrilled to have this set and they are perfect to wear for most occasions. I've been wearing mine to work and have received many compliments on them.

"I have an older model Black and Decker weed eater that came with a charger and 2 batteries. After several years of hard use, one of the batteries had completely died so I was thrilled to be offered the chance to receive this complimentary sample from Masione to test and review. This 18V 2000mAh battery slid perfectly into the charger and was completely charged and ready to go within a couple of hours.I guess there's nothing like a new battery, and the charge on this one allowed me to do the entire yard (I have a half acre with lots of trees, fences, landscaping) whereas before, using the batteries that came with the weed eater, I was barely able to keep enough power to do the front using BOTH of the batteries and then had to wait about 8 hours each for full recharging.It was great to be able to find a replacement battery at a reasonable price, so I will definitely be reordering from Masione when I need a new one and will look to this vendor for other needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6YQ10AEHOWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YGVPCG6#wasThisHelpful","R2D6YQ10AEHOWJ","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always loved playing badminton and was very eager to try these glow in the dark shuttlecocks. They come as a set of two boxes with four birdies in each box. Each box contains a solid red, a solid blue, and 2 multi-colored blinking LED lighted shuttlecocks. The lights can be turned off/on by a switch inside the shuttlecock.We first played with them during the daytime and had the LED lights turned on. The light was especially noticed when it travels away from the hitter.  These are the nicest shuttlecocks I have ever used: real feathers, knotted string, properly weighted. Due to the sturdiness, they popped off the badminton racket with ease and could be used in slightly windy conditions.The real fun started with night time usage.  The LED lights were very bright. The solid red and blue shuttlecocks were easy to track and return. The multi-colored blinking ones gave us more of a challenge as it was difficult to track the exact location as the lights flashed.These are a great product to have available to extend the fun from day into night. They are great for any age-any level badminton player. I would definitely recommend purchasing these. I received a complimentary set for review and can honestly say that I definitely would get them again as soon as these wear out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVIV9ZUTVQIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KTP3B2#wasThisHelpful","R1IVIV9ZUTVQIJ","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I'm amazed. I'm always a little leery when I receive offers for free food items -- especially those that are touted as being organic and ""good for me."" So imagine my surprise when I hesitantly put a single mulberry in my mouth and chewed it. Wow - these taste absolutely great. Slightly sweet, chewy and a healthy alternative to candy bars or other snacks.Called a ""super food"" by some, these berries are high in protein and fiber as well as rich in anti-oxidants. All that doesn't matter, however, if it doesn't taste good. But I can assure you that the natural sweetness of these berries makes them my new addiction. The product comes from Turkey and should be stored in a cool, dry place.Thank you to Immortalitea for sending me this delicious sample package for review and evaluation.

"I really don't like to drink plain water, and I know how important it is for my health to stay hydrated, so I am always looking for alternative fluids. I prefer drinks without calories and caffeine, and thought I would try this brand of zero calorie soda. Although I was intrigued by the fact that it is non-GMO and also ticks the boxes for being vegan, kosher, and gluten-free -- the most important thing to me is TASTE.Well, this was OK, but I can see that I'm going to have to keep looking to find a substitute for Coke Zero and other carbonated flavored waters (ICE). Perhaps it's just that this is black cherry flavored and maybe the other choices in this brand would be more appealing. It seems like a bitter aftertaste that almost makes me shake my head and wrinkle up my nose. This has no sugar and no artificial flavors, and it does not taste sweet at all though made with fruit extract.Next time I get a chance, I'll try a couple of other flavors of the Zevia and see if I like any of them better.

"My husband isn't really into getting the latest items, even if he knows they are good for him. So when I presented him with this absolutely stunning leather wallet, he didn't know what to think! And then when I mentioned that it has RFID protection, his senses went on high alert and he was completely interested. He opened the nice box and picked up the high quality leather wallet and fell in love! He's very particular about his wallet style, and this one has a fold over flap with a see-through for a driver's licence and plenty of slots for all of his credit and debit cards.I feel better knowing that his data and security are protected, and he loves the look and feel (and nice leather smell) of this wallet. It has plenty of slots and the larger compartment for cash. He also keeps receipts in his wallet and there is plenty of room for those as well.In the past few months, I've received and evaluated several different RFID wallets and protective covers, but this one is the best of all. I wish they'd make a women's wallet that is similar to this. I like the silver box cases and the zippered pouches, but this one looks and feels like the kind of billfold that a man would want to carry. Knowing that it also protects against identity theft from unscrupulous criminals makes it even more appealing. I received this item free for my evaluation and review.I'd recommend this as a gift for the man in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDVAGXRTU6Q0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZZ17P84#wasThisHelpful","R3KDVAGXRTU6Q0","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK -- there is so much I want to say about this fantastic CGP that I don't know where to start. I'll begin by saying that I have played a keyboard of some kind since I was 5 years old -- started out on the accordion and moved into piano and other electronic keyboards since. I've performed on stage, for music contests, and yes -- for money in years since. Let me just say, that if I even SEE a piano, I am compelled to sidle to it and eventually will sit down and play a piece or two -- no matter the venue. I'm sure I've embarassed my family a time or two with my addiction, but I simply HAVE to know how the instrument sounds.I have been playing this piano about 3 hours a day since I was lucky enough to win the VINE lottery and have the offer. I could barely wait to get it out of the box and set up. The first thing that surprised me was that the weight of the item on the product page said 30 pounds -- well that was obviously a mistake as it is 33 kg (nearly 75 pounds). This is not a miniature -- it's a full-size concert grand keyboard with absolutely beautiful keys that respond to the touch of that on a real grand piano. The weighted keys give the true feel of the instrument and they are actual size for my fingers. With help (OK, truth -- my husband sent me out to weedeat the lawn while he put it together because I was actually jumping up and down with excitement), the entire piano was set up and ready to play within 30 minutes. I moved it to a location in my house where I knew I could get to it easily and turned it on. WOW.This piano is more than I ever imagined for an electronic keyboard. The touchpad with its many choices for tones, rhythm, balance, and recording require that I have the instruction book at my side as my reference at all times. Even though I have had this for weeks, I am still finding out more about the capabilities and options available.I play a lot of different types of music, but what I absolutely love is BIG SOUND. I love the instrumental music of soundtracks and ballads, the mournful dirge, and almost every popular piece known to man. I also love the classics and even the big band sound of the 50s. My background with the accordion also leads me to polka and you can't even imagine how well this instrument responds to the changing tempos and tone selection. I can go from full symphonic with strings to sax or bass with the touch of a button. The panel allows me to select two tones for upper octaves and two tones for lower, and I can adjust them up or down. You can also add accompaniment of drums or an auto accompaniment that allows harmony with just playing one note. Every type and style of music can be played from hip-hop to orchestral.I could go on forever about how much I love this CGP -- I could compare it to an actual grand piano for instance, and tell you that honestly, I prefer this. For one thing -- it doesn't have to be tuned every 6 months. AND, the volume -- oh, the volume! I love loud. Included is a sustain pedal, and actually that's my only complaint -- it's like a sewing machine pedal instead of the three typical pedals -- but that is such a minor detraction that it barely begs mentioning.As a last comment, I'll say this -- my neighbors are hearing my nightly concerts. I got a set of headphones to jack into the keyboard so that I don't have to torture them as I work through difficult pieces learning new music. Also, I'd like for them to be able to sleep and I love to have my doors open to the beautiful weather -- so I put those on if it gets too late as I tend to ramp up the volume. This also connects to my larger speaker system if I want to really ramp it up. I only wish they enjoyed my music as much as I do!I've tried other electronic pianos through the years -- Yamaha is another popular brand, but I really am thrilled with this one. I actually have a beautiful piano in my family room that now sits unplayed -- it's a Baldwin Acrosonic -- because I prefer being able to add additional tones when playing and I wonder if I'll ever touch it again.If you're a novice or a professional, there's a lot to love here and the price point is perfect for someone wanting to finally discover the joy of music and the thrill of making it. I love that i can record songs on a USB flash drive as well. With the key action and touch of this instrument, you can give your children music lessons and not feel that they aren't getting the true experience as, of course, you can always choose the ""grand"" piano sound all by itself. You may want to select the option for this item that includes a bench, but I am using a kitchen chair and it works great.Buy it!  You won't be sorry!  But now, I have to get back to the chair because I can't resist...","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2WJRTOIJ8NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0124Y99PQ#wasThisHelpful","R1P2WJRTOIJ8NU","A1WKQ94M45D8MG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1WKQ94M45D8MG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On 15 September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull MP was sworn in as Australias 29th Prime Minister.But who is Malcolm Turnbull, and what does he stand for?Malcolm Bligh Turnbull (born 24 October 1954), has been a member of parliament since 2004, representing the NSW seat of Wentworth.  He has had careers as a journalist, a lawyer and as a businessman before being elected to the Australian Parliament.  In this book, an unauthorised biography, Paddy Manninga Sydney journalistdocuments Malcolm Turnbulls life and career.  Mr Mannings investigations have drawn on interviews with others and have involved detailed research.  The biography was not authorised by Malcolm Turnbull, which is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  An advantage in that Mr Manning could report his impressions and conclusions independently, a disadvantage in that while the records tell what has happened, motivation can sometimes only be assumed.From looking back over Malcolm Turnbulls career to date, its clear that he is energetic, intelligent and focussed.  It is also clear that he defies any neat categorisation.  His achievements include beating the Thatcher Government in the Spycatcher trial in the late 1980s, clearing the way for the publication of Spycatcher by Peter Wright.  He also defended Kerry Packercodenamed Goanna during the Costigan Royal Commission (officially titled the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union) during the 1980s.  He later had to defend his own role in the collapse of HIH in 2001Australias largest corporate collapse.  Malcolm Turnbull was also heavily involved in what became a failed attempt by referendum in 1999 to change Australias constitution to enable the establishment of a republic.  Malcolm Turnbulls successes in business included co-founding, with Sean Howard and Trevor Kennedy, OzEmail in the early 1990s.  Malcolm Turnbull has a long list of achievements.In 2004, Malcolm Turnbull was elected to the Australian Parliament.  In 2008, he was elected leader of the Liberal Party and of the opposition coalition.  In 2009, his judgement was questioned after the Utegate fiasco, and in December that year was replaced by Tony Abbott as leader.  Who would have thought, then, that less than six years later Malcolm Turnbull would be Prime Minister?I found this book interesting.  It provides a lot of detail about Malcolm Turnbull, and a comprehensive chronology of his life so far.  While I remember many of the public events (especially the Spycatcher trial, the republic referendum and Utegate) I knew less about Mr Turnbulls business involvements.  Together Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy make a formidable team.  Will all that energy and intelligence make Malcolm Turnbull an effective prime minister?  I hope so.  I guess that well have to wait to see.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Melbourne University for an opportunity to read a copy of this biography.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELHLPP9NND5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0175VTYQ2#wasThisHelpful","RELHLPP9NND5Y","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a world without bees, food production is a challenge.  Eighty percent of plant life and food has been wiped out, together with the bees. The elite live in the Bubble, theres a think tank  and troops  at the Barracks, and the Farm, where people struggle to produce food, and survive.  This world is controlled by the totalitarian corporation Hexagon.  Theres also a virtual reality world, called Nirvana, where some can escape for a while  if they can afford it.Larissa Kenders, or Kenders as she prefers to be called, and her partner Andrew are part of this world.  He is a scientist working on virtual reality, she is a musician.  Their lives are constrained: Hexagon keeps almost everyone under surveillance.  People who rock the boat in anyway tend to disappear.  And then Andrew is reported dead and the only relief Kenders can find is through her escapes into Nirvana.  Although she can choose to explore any world, she prefers Earth.  Its where Andrew is.  When she meets Andrew in this virtual world, she is convinced that he is not dead.Kenders is in danger.  What is real, and what isnt?  Who can she trust?  And what really happened to Andrew?  Others have disappeared as well, and its clear that Hexagon is monitoring Kenders and others very closely.  Technology is a double-edged sword.This is the first novel in what will be a three part series.  J R Stewarts dystopian world is particularly uncomfortable.  The natural catastrophe is feasible and much of the technology is recognisable.  I read an earlier version of this novel and appreciate the changes that have been made in this version.  J R Stewart has further developed both the world and the people in it, and I am looking forward to the next instalment.

"In November 2002, Police Constable Billy Tyler is assigned twelve hours of night duty at a hospital mortuary in Suffolk.  His job?  To guard the body of a notorious murderer.  While the murder is not named in the novel, it is clearly the notorious child-killer Myra Hindley.  Billys job is to guard the body, to ensure that nothing happens.  Billys wife Sue does not want him to accept the assignment.  She is frightened of what might happen in the presence of such evil.Billy sees the job as just another assignment.  He is to guard the mortuary, to make a note of all who enter it during the course of the night.  The body itself is locked away, and Billy does not have a key.  During the twelve hours, he will have two breaks in his duty.As the night passes, Billy becomes more aware of the dead womans presence.  He is also increasingly aware of his own anxieties - about his marriage, and about his disabled daughter Emma. Billy also remembers some of his own past actions as silence surrounds and weighs down on him.  During the night he is visited by the ghost of the dead woman.  He sees her, he smells her cigarette smoke, and he is questioned by her.  And those questions lead him into places in his own past which cause discomfort.Once started, I found this novel very difficult to put down.  It is not about the murderer and her crimes, its about the man who finds himself guarding her corpse.  Its about the (almost inevitable, surely) self-examination that becomes part of such duty during the night.  Staying vigilant in such surrounding in such circumstances enables (or does it require?) a greater degree of self-awareness.  Or does it?  Will Billys life change as a consequence, or will the issues he considers recede (back) into the background once his duty is over?Perhaps Ill read this novel again, when Ive had an opportunity to think more about Billys life and less about the murderer.  This is one of thosenovels which is complex and uncomfortable, beautifully written and confronting.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1951IBCT0QMR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BJ3O0K#wasThisHelpful","R1951IBCT0QMR8","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh novel in Ms Gentills historical crime series which features Rowland Sinclair and is set during the 1930s.  Rowland Sinclair is a wealthy gentleman artist who lives in a Woollahra mansion with his greyhound Lenin and an assortment of bohemian friends including Edna Higgins, a sculptor for whom he has feelings, and Clyde Watson Jones, a landscape painter, who can also be handy with his fists.In this novel, Rowland Sinclair is planning to race his yellow 1927 Mercedes S-Class at the Maroubra speedway for a charity race in aid of the Red Cross.  When a journalist who interviews him is killed, Rowland Sinclair is caught up in the mystery surrounding his murder.  Sinclair was one of the last people to see the journalist alive.  Who killed the journalist, and why?The story, which incorporates some real characters  such as  the young Rosaleen Norton (known in later years as the Witch of Kings Cross), the poet Kenneth Slessor, the actor Errol Flynn, the painter Norman Lindsay and Arthur Stace ( Sydneys Eternity man), moves at a rapid pace.  The journalists murder is only the first, and it seems that someone is after Rowland Sinclair as well.I really enjoyed this novel.  There are plenty of twists and turns as Sinclair and his friends try to find out who killed the journalist.  Ms Gentill has a great mix of characters, and the use of actual newspaper articles from the period as chapter openings serves to reinforce the setting.  I loved the depiction of Errol Flynn (he fits right in, naturally) and wanted to know more about Arthur Stace.  While some aspects of the story clearly draw on facts established in earlier novels, it is possible to read (and enjoy) this novel on a standalone basis.  Across this series, Ms Gentill has drawn on the political unrest that followed the Great Depression.  Her exploration of the tensions between the communist and fascist sympathisers, her blending of history and fiction provide an intriguing setting.But back to the mystery: its a great read, and Im looking to read the rest of the series.Note: My thanks to Pantera Press for providing me with a copy of the novel for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YZNSS3NPT5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GASKNK#wasThisHelpful","R21YZNSS3NPT5N","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1986, Tom Houghton is a twelve year old boy, growing up in the western suburbs of Sydney with his mother and grandfather.  Tom is sufficiently different from most of the other boys to be an irresistible target to bullies.  Toms escape from reality involves immersing himself in the golden age of Hollywood cinema.  Tom reads biographies about the stars, and has made his own catalogue of different actors and their roles.His grandfather encourages him to realise that theres more to life than Hollywood, but its easier for Tom to escape reality than to confront it. Sadly, his mother provides a near perfect role model for escapism.  When Tom discovers that Katharine Hepburn, his favourite actress, modelled herself on her brother Thomas Houghton Hepburn, his imagination runs wild.  Thomas Houghton Hepburn hanged himself in 1921, but Tom Houghton thinks that if he can invent a new identity for himself hell find success.  Surely his detractors will change their opinion of him?  Can Tom find success in this way?I was about to become the real Thomas Houghton.In 2014, aged forty, Tom Houghton is offered an acting role in Scotland.  Can Tom make the most of this opportunity?  Can he escape his past, and the consequences of some of his choices?  What has Tom Houghton made of his life?  Where does Tom Houghton fit into the world? The Tom Houghton you thought you were never existed.I had very mixed feelings reading this novel.  I did not like Tom Houghton, but I felt sorry for him.  I kept hoping that he would gain some insight, come to terms with himself and realize his potential.  Mr Alexander has done a wonderful job of creating Tom Houghton as a complicated character.  Hes not (at least, not to me) heroic and he doesnt often take responsibility for his actions or their consequences but he is human and very vulnerable.  How much of life is predetermined by fate?  How much is governed by experience and opportunity?I didnt like Tom Houghton, but I wondered which personification of Tom Houghton I was reacting to.  Was it the child, retreating from the bullies, building barriers to his success while protecting himself?  Was it the insecure adult trying to protect himself from failure?  Was it the boy and then the man trying to come to terms with his sexuality?So, who is Tom Houghton?Note:  My thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster Australia for the opportunity to read this book.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28NSX1Y6PNV6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCHX28#wasThisHelpful","R28NSX1Y6PNV6K","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Portugal had a population of about one million people at the beginning of the fifteenth century.  A tiny country, with an economy which largely depended on fishing and subsistence farming.  A country where the kings were too poor to mint their own gold coins.  But, as Mr Crowley writes, a country with big aspirations.In August 1415, a Portuguese fleet sailed across the Strait of Gibraltar and stormed the Muslim port of Ceuta, in Morocco, one of the most heavily fortified and strategic strongholds in the whole Mediterranean.In Ceuta, the Portuguese saw a glimpse of the wealth of Africa and the Orient, and dared to dream of expansion, of conquering infidels, and of trade like that enjoyed by Genoa and Venice. After Ceuta, Prince Henrique (Prince Henry the Navigator) began to sponsor expeditions down the coast of Africa in search of gold, slaves and spices.  The Portuguese also explored inland Africa for the mythical Christian king Prester John.  Portugal was also driven by a desire to eradicate Islamic culture, and to establish a Christian empire in the Indian Ocean.Mr Crowley has drawn on letters and eyewitness accounts to write of Portugals rapid rise to power.  Some of the major characters portrayed in this account of the Portuguese empire were King Manuel (the Fortunate), Joo II (the Perfect Prince), the governor Afonso de Albuquerque, and the explorer Vasco da Gama.How did Portugal achieve such dominance in such a short period?  By discovering a route to India around the horn of Africa  achieved by sailing out west from the African coast in order to use the Atlantic winds to sail east around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean.Though its supremacy lasted little more than a century, Portugals achievement was to create the prototype for new and flexible forms of empire, based on mobile sea power, and the paradigm for European expansion.  Where it led, the Dutch and the English followed.I found Mr Crowleys account fascinating.  While I knew some of the history of Prince Henry the Navigator, of Vasco da Gama and (later) of Ferdinand Magellan, I had not focussed on the detail and the impact of the Portuguese empire.  The history of Portuguese exploration is well worth reading: it is an epic tale of courage, endurance and brutality, of skilled navigation, of diplomacy and of religious zealotry.  And, supporting the public figures we can name and read about, are many unknown sailors who suffered illness, disease and frequently death.  Afonso de Albuquerque became the first European since Alexander the Great to found an Asian empire.The Iberian powers who had carved up the world at Tordesillas in 1494 were conditioned to believe in monopoly trading and the obligation to crusade.Portuguese supremacy may have only lasted just over a century, but during that period the Portuguese reached India in 1498, Brazil in 1500, China in 1514 and Japan in 1543.Note: My thanks to Netgalley and the Random House Publishing Group for an opportunity to read an advance copy of this book.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REL05EPA1QSUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01228DX1A#wasThisHelpful","REL05EPA1QSUC","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In twenty-two thought-provoking vignettes, Ms Kennedy introduces us to the world of an Aboriginal woman (our narrator, whose name we never discover), her partner Antman and their dog Fleabag.  These vignettes are full of quirky characters, of black humour and of reminders that Aboriginal Australia still often remains quite separate from the Australia that many of us occupy.Our narrator, Antman, and Fleabag travel across Australia.  They meet eccentric relatives, including Cousin Moodle, whose love of funerals once has her falling into a grave.  They meet Old Mother Howard, a drunk woman with flaky, grey skin shes always pickin at. Old Mother Howard and her husband Old Mick Howard are whitefullas.  While theyre not related to our mob  ..  all the blackfullas look out for the kids because they feel sorry for them.  The Howards have six red-haired children, each with an extra finger and toe on each hand and foot. There are darker stories as well, especially the story of how Bess and Vic met in The Golden Wedding Anniversary and in Grandfathers Medals.  These stories are reminders that equality is still sometimes only a word.While the language in these vignettes is often colloquial, its appropriate for the stories being told.  The narrator is having a conversation with the reader, recounting events from her own viewpoint and in her own style.  While the style is warm and frequently humorous, humour is part of the observation and telling of the story, not usually an end in itself.  Its a book to read, and to think about.Ms Kennedy won the 2006 David Unaipon Award for Indigenous Writing for Me, Antman & Fleabag.  This is a book which deserves a much wider readership.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W8RTY4G9SQVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0702236179#wasThisHelpful","R2W8RTY4G9SQVK","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this novel, Geraldine Brooks breathes life into the ancient legend of King David from the Old Testament.  Ms Brookss portrayal of David covers his journey from obscurity, his transformation from shepherd to soldier, and then to become king, his triumphs and his failures.  My recollection of Davids story in the Old Testament is of a hero: a boy with a slingshot who slew the giant Goliath.  Of a shepherd boy who rose from obscurity to be King of Israel, and who was the father of Solomon.  Beyond that, I remember (or misremember) very little.Narrated by Natan, Davids personal prophet, The Secret Chord describes a very human David, a man who is both noble and flawed, a man with considerable strengths and awful weaknesses.  We get impressions of David through the reactions of his wives Mikal, Avigail, and Batsheva, and see him through the eyes of Natan.  And David as a father? He fails to be an effective father to all of his children, except in allowing Natan to mentor his lastborn son Shlomo (Solomon).  Its hard to understand how a man so gifted could fail to inculcate any sense of responsibility into his older sons.  A curious blindspot in one who could so often read others so well.This is a novel which incorporates the best and worst of humankind: adventure, beauty, betrayal, drama, fratricide, incest, intrigue, music, romance, sex and violence. At times I felt great sympathy for David, at other times I found his behaviour outrageous.  In many ways Natan is the perfect narrator.  His gift of prophecy enables him to anticipate some events as well as to add context to others.  King David reigned over Israel for almost forty years.  In this novel Ms Brooks provides a possible life for him.Whether you regard the Old Testament as historical fact or allegorical fiction, this novel brings both people and times to life.  I enjoyed it very much.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher Hachette Australia for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this novel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5XNYIRKMEKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV59234#wasThisHelpful","R3U5XNYIRKMEKQ","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Life is looking pretty good for family law attorney Jamie Quinn in Hollywood, Florida.  Her father may get his visa soon, her boyfriend Kip is wonderful and business is growing.

And Jamie managesto upset Grace as well.At the same time, Jamie is looking into a plane crash which killed her neighbour Sandys twin sister.  As a consequence of the accident, Sandy and her husband Mike are now looking after their niece Katie.  Youd think it would be straightforward enough to find out who owned the plane.  But its complicated, even with Duke Broussards investigative skills.So, why is Marvin Glasser resisting divorce?  Who really owns the plane that Sandys twin sister and her husband died in?  And what does Katie know?  While shes trying to find out the answers to these questions (and more)  Jamie is trying to restore her friendship with Grace, stay in touch with Kip and figure out who is trying to destroy her reputation and why.  But its not just her reputation at stake.There are a few twists and turns in the story and some laugh out loud moments.  And the conclusion?  Well, it works for me.This is the fourth of Ms Venkataramans novels to feature Jamie Quinn, and Ive enjoyed all of them.

"Five international travellers, Marco and Gino from Italy, Yukio and Mitsuko from Japan, and Victor from America meet regularly, inspired by a shared interest in the work of Vladimir Nabokov.  Marco invites Cass, from Australia, to join their meetings.  It is winter in Berlin, and Cass finds the city somewhat inaccessible.  Cass has come to Berlin to write.  She hasnt started writing yet, and perhaps this meeting with its possibility of literary fellowship may provide her with momentum.  Marco tells her where and when to meet, and that at the next meeting they would begin a speak-memory game in which each would introduce themselves with a densely remembered story or detail.Cass joins the group, at 5pm the next day, and Victor is the first to speak. He tells the story of his life and of Nabokovs influence on him.  There are more meetings, and at each one a speak-memory is shared.  Friendships are formed between different members of the group, and winter in Berlin becomes more bearable.  But memories are not always safe, and sometimes the past can intrude on the present in unexpected ways.The group is destroyed by a sudden, tragic event.  Lives are changed unexpectedly.  Friendships are challenged and stretched.  Can the individuals in the group move on?Cass is the narrator of this story, and we share her perspective of events, of life in Berlin.  From the discomfort of her leaking boots in the snow, her pleasure in developing friendships and the impact of tragedy, Cass is central to this story.  As is the shade of Vladimir Nabokov.I like this idea  that an object sucks in the memory of its use. I enjoyed this novel, and will reread it at some stage.  Not so much for the story (or stories) of the travellers but for the hints of Nabokov.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Random House Australia for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this novel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UA0J5LP1AFC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJ2UDBU#wasThisHelpful","R2UA0J5LP1AFC7","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"October 1863.  The American Civil War is in full swing, and while the Union is gaining the upper hand, the Confederates still have a powerful weapon in the form of the CSS Manassas. The CSS Manassas, a sloop of war, hunts down Union merchant vessels, sending them and their cargo to the bottom of the ocean. The CSS Manassas is powered by both sail and steam, and is armed with two pivoting seven-inch Brooke rifles and six thirty-two pounder smoothbore broadside guns.  Her commander is Captain Nathaniel Pelle.  So far the CSS Manassas has sunk or burned sixty-two ships and insurance rates are skyrocketing as a consequence.  She is well equipped for the missions she has been carrying out, and President Lincoln wants her stopped.That damned Rebel pirate ship has caused us nothing but trouble for the past year and a half!The Union navy is stretched to breaking point because of its blockade of the Souths ports and cannot spare a squadron to hunt the CSS Manassas.  One ship is detailed to pursue her: the USS Oswego, under the command of Captain Samuel Stacy.  Can the USS Oswego succeed?  Captain Stacy was once a colleague of Captain Pelle, but there is a longstanding feud between the two men.  Captain Stacy will be more than happy to sink the grey raider.At the same time as the USS Oswego hunts for the CSS Manassas, a beautiful Confederate spy, Kitty Averill, is trying to avoid Pinkertons agents.  Kitty Averill learns some information which could be vital to Captain Pelle, if she can deliver it to him and if he believes her.This novel is loosely based on the true story of the CSS Alabama, a commerce raider that attacked Union ships until it was sunk by the USS Kearsarge outside the French port of Cherbourg in 1864.I really enjoyed this novel: the detailed description of the ships and their weapons and how both were operated; the feud between Captains Pelle and Stacy which coloured their actions and responses; the actions of Kitty Averill; and the various people at Cherbourg and elsewhere who were part of the story.  If you enjoy nautical adventure, especially 19th century nautical adventure, you may enjoy this novel.  The two captains are the main characters, and my favourite  as written  is definitely Captain Nathaniel Pelle.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Random House Australia for an opportunity to read an advance copy of this novel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SSFEQE3MOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGJ7P2M#wasThisHelpful","R23SSFEQE3MOX","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Why are these murders being committed?

"...  is optimistically named Via Roma, and it is here that my fathers story has its beginning.This book tells the story of the authors father, Francesco Borgia, who migrated to Australia in 1925 from San Procopio, a small rural town in  Reggio Calabria in southern Italy in search of a better life.  He was only 18 years old.In 1937, Francesco returned to visit his family.  They wanted him to stay in Italy, but by then Francesco believed that his future was in Australia.  He had a dream: to establish his own business making pasta in Australia.  He borrowed 50 ($100), ordered pasta making machinery in Massena, which he arranged to have shipped to Australia.On 24 May 1938, Francescos factory  Borgia Brothers  began production in an old dairy at 74 Ward Street, North Adelaide, South Australia.  In July 1939, he went into partnership with Luigi Crotti and the Sovrana Macaroni Company was born.Disaster struck with the advent of World War II.  Italians were considered a threat to national security and were classed as enemy aliens.  On 11 June 1940, Francesco was arrested, placed in an internment camp. He spent the next three and a half years in camps at Tatura, Hay and Loveday.  His plans to marry were put on hold and his business was closed.Released from internment (7 January 1944) and married on 4 March 1944, Francesco Borgia worked hard to restart his business.  Despite all of the setbacks and at times almost overwhelming obstacles, Francesco Borgia restarted his business.The story of Francesco Borgia (6 August 1907  20 August 1964) is a story to which many immigrants to Australia will be able to relate.  Non-English speaking migrants have the added challenge of learning a new language in addition to settling in a new country and experiencing a different culture.  Its also inspirational, and shows just what can be achieved by those courageous enough to keep trying.I enjoyed reading Francesco Borgias story and learning something about the history of pasta making in Australia.  Ms Borgia Griguols book is a fine tribute to her father, his drive and heritage.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTCLYE4VJY5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1740084934#wasThisHelpful","R1YTCLYE4VJY5X","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Ian McCabe goes missing in outback Australia, his friend Gabriel (Gabe) Branch leaves coastal Queensland to search for him.  Ian is a roo shooter, a peripatetic lifestyle which makes it difficult to pin down when he went missing.  This will be a difficult journey for Gabe.  Identifiably Aboriginal, removed from his parents as a child, the world of his ancestors is alien to him.The only thing that seems to hold any promise is an artifact Ian mailed the week he disappeared.In Alice Springs, Gabe discovers that the artifact is a message stick.  Hes told that it is something to do with death, but he needs to find someone from the right tribe to read it.  Gabes journey through the outback draws the attention of Dana Pukatja, a Pitjantjatjara medicine man who does not want Gabe to find the truth.This is an interesting and at times convoluted tale.  Gabe needs to become more aware of his own Aboriginal past and culture.  He needs this awareness in order to understand both the world in which he finds himself, and what happened to Ian.  The journey is difficult, both physically and emotionally.  The supernatural also has a large role.  Gabe encounters people who help him, and those who discriminate against him.  Where does Gabe belong? And what about Dana Pukatja: can Gabe find the truth despite his best efforts?White men, with their metal and machines and their mania for conquest, never understood Aborigines or their land.The vastness of the Australian outback is vividly depicted in this novel: a remote place which can be very unforgiving of those who enter it.  The outback is both backdrop to the story and a character within it. In addition to the search for Ian, and Gabes search for himself, Ms Cunningham also raises a number of the social issues that continue to bedevil Australia as a consequence of the treatment of the Indigenous Peoples.Did I enjoy this novel?  Not entirely.  But that is mostly my discomfort with the story presented rather than the way it is written. This is a novel which invites you to consider the background as well as the events.Note: I was offered, and accepted, an electronic copy of this novel for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34D42NUX819L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009D4BGXE#wasThisHelpful","R34D42NUX819L6","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Rosemary Anner invited me to look at Eumundi and Friends: Hot Air Ballooning I couldnt resist.  Eumundi Mouse is a very adventurous young Australian mouse, and her stories are told by father and daughter team Stuart and Kristen Anner and beautifully illustrated by Cristina Birtea.This is a picture book, intended for children aged between 7 and 9.  I think that some younger children would enjoy the story as well, but Id be careful not to encourage aspiring young hot air balloonists. I mean, if a mouse can take off in a hot air balloon, just imagine what a child could do?Eumundi and her new friends Hammy and Julia set off  somewhat inadvertently  in a hot air balloon.  Its an adventure with, after plenty of excitement, a happy ending.I read this on my Kindle Paperwhite which means that, unfortunately, I didnt get to fully appreciate the coloured illustrations.

"Priya Conlin-Kumar, a South-Asian American FBI agent, has just been reassigned to Wheeling, West Virginia. Her assignment will be to investigate potential money laundering: important, but probably not very exciting.  But, just as Priya is about to take up her posting, two bodies are found, and the FBI is asked to investigate whether Wheeling has a serial killer.  Priya is despatched to investigate.It was never a matter of if they would kill again.  The only question was when.A number of bodies are recovered.  There are sufficient differences between some of the cases for Priya to question whether two murderers are operating.  Not all of the local police are happy with Priyas involvement, which creates some tension between the various people involved and has the potential to slow down the investigation.Priya is a very interesting character, her tragic backstory is important, as is her Hindu heritage.  The title He Drinks Poison is from The Ramayana which itself is part of the backdrop for the novel.  Priya is a worshipper of Kali, and the visons she experiences from The Ramayana become more important when it becomes clear that one of the serial killers is fixated on her.There is plenty of action in this novel, and some very explicit, graphic descriptions of violence.  Who are the serial killers, and what why do they kill?  Will Priya work though the clues the killer is sending her before others are killed?  Can she find happiness?I found it difficult to put this novel down.  Early on we find who the serial killers are, and the motivation for one is comparatively straightforward.  But the second, more organised serial killer challenges Priya on a number of different levels.If you like deep, dark stories with a number of twists and turns, and you can stomach explicit and graphic descriptions of violence, you may well enjoy this novel.  The fight between good and evil  depicted in part using Hindu mythology  adds an extra, interesting dimension to this story.Note: I was offered, and accepted, an electronic copy of this novel for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S3YJ860EYUFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A9XJBO4#wasThisHelpful","R1S3YJ860EYUFG","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buffalo, New York.  During the 1980s, recession has transformed the fruit belt  what was once  the citys proudest African American neighbourhood  into a ghetto.  In this neighbourhood, Loretta Ford masquerades as the owner of a house whose previous occupant is dead.  Loretta, a single mother and religious fanatic, lives a reclusive life with her son Shadrack.  On a rainy night in April, the mayors son, Audwin Brooks, crashes into Lorettas home in the middle of the night.  This accidental meeting sets off a series of events that will reverberate through two families and change lives.  Why, and how?Reading the novel will provide some of the answers.  Uncomfortable answers in the main.  What events and circumstances have changed their lives?  What are the issues they are trying to make sense of?  On the face of it, Loretta Ford and her son Shadrack are very different from the Brooks family, but superficial looks can be deceptive.Ive never lived in Buffalo, New York and Im not African American.  But the major themes of this novel  abuse, control, dispossession, neglect and violence  exist in most (if not all) societies.  These themes are colour-blind.  Parents shape their children, for better or worse, through their own experiences and sense of what is best.  Some parents have better experiences than others.  Loretta Fords experiences are awful and so, as a consequence, are Shadracks.  And the Brooks family?  Neglect takes a different form there.This is a dark novel, and there is no happy ending.  But, while I hoped for different outcomes, this was never going to happen for these characters.  Is it a lack of self-awareness that restricts opportunity, or an absence of hope for change?  Or is it, simply, an impossibility to effect positive change in such blighted circumstances?  How can this cycle be changed?This is Eddie Marks debut novel: a thoughtful, considered book which raises many difficult issues.  There are no simple theories of causation here, no magic answers.  But not everyone is a victim, and there are some villains (at least to me).  I can never understand (or forgive) those in positions of power (such as teachers and doctors) who see signs of abuse and neglect and choose to do nothing.Forgive me for it, my son.  I didnt know.Note: I was offered, and accepted, a copy of this book for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8UBCG9GIOKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBXHLQ0#wasThisHelpful","R2V8UBCG9GIOKX","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Florence (Flo) Corrigans memoir is inspirational.  It is also testament to aspects of life in Australia which many of us would prefer not to think about.  Born in the early 1930s, Flo spent her childhood in temporary camps in the rough and remote Pilbara region of Western Australia.  Flo looked after her siblings in those temporary camps while her parents eked out a living prospecting, fencing, and killing wild dogs.  Eking out a living did not include fresh fruit and vegetables, education, or shoes.As a teenager, with very little money in her pocket, Flo left her family.  Her abusive father told her never to return.  Flo made a life for herself, and then for her own family, through her determination and hard work.  She worked as a fencer and as a horsewoman, as a dogger, a roo skinner, a goat hunter and as a cook.  Flo learned that she was of Aboriginal descent during her thirties when she became a mother.  It was then that she discovered that her birth had not been registered.In those days, I could get killed and nobodyd know who I was because thered be no registered name.  I was an alien in my own country.Flo set about finding the truth of her own family  a difficult task given that her parents had given her so little information.  Through tragedy  her husband died of asbestosis  Flo continued to find out about herself and her family.  She taught herself literacy and, well after she retired, bought her first house.Its difficult reading Flos story, reading of the hardships she endured, and the reminders of practices such as forced adoption.  But her story is well worth reading, both because it reminds us that these aspects of the past are not yet only confined to history, and because Flo herself has made her own life count despite the adversities she has experienced.  Flo needed to discover her past, and we need to remember it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGA8NQ22WZXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1921248157#wasThisHelpful","R3JGA8NQ22WZXJ","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Nicola left the flat briefly to buy a packet of cigarettes, but when she returns her live-in boyfriend Jonathan tells her their relationship must end.  Jonathan says that he no longer wants to be with her, and it would be best if she moved out.  Disbelief is Nicolas first reaction.  Then, as realization sets in and her world falls apart, she is devastated.  Nicola turns to her friends, particularly Susannah, for advice.  While most think that Nicola would be better off without Jonathan, she isnt convinced.While this novel is the story of a relationship breakup, it has some very humorous aspects.  The breakup of a relationship does not just affect the couple involved, it has an impact on friends and family as well.  The friends (mostly couples) and parents of Jonathan and Nicola are each ready to offer their opinions.'Let's say he's a prat. But he's the prat I love.' She paused. 'Actually, I've never been absolutely sure what prat means, exactly.Much of the story unfolds via conversation, with each chapter offering a different point of view.  This enables us to appreciate the differing perspectives and, importantly, to see how Nicola and Jonathan react.  It may have been Jonathans choice to end the relationship, but it soon becomes clear that Nicola is more able than Jonathan to move on.  Has Jonathan made the right decision?  Does he really want Nicola to move out of his life?Too bad about the marmalade.  The balance between bitter and sweet was the essence of the thing.In this short novel, Ms St John managed to dissect a particular relationship in order to demonstrate its numerous and various components.  Control may start with Jonathan, but it certainly doesnt stay with him.  Friends and family members have views, but Nicola and Jonathan need to negotiate their own paths through it.  I enjoyed this novel, with its flashes of humour and neat depictions of relationships and their perils.The Essence of the Thing was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1997.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15M2CHJ8R2Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CHXD7M6#wasThisHelpful","R15M2CHJ8R2Q1","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 1543 in London, and Henry VIII is distracted by many things.  He is courting Katherine Parr, is planning an invasion of France and his health is failing.  For the ordinary people around Southwark, surrounded by poverty and greed, living in crowded slums with illness and disease constant threats, life is about survival.  Bianca Goddard, the daughter of a notorious alchemist, uses her knowledge of herbs and medicinal plants to make her living by making medicines.  She sells her medicines to the poor in the Southwark slums.Plague is a near constant threat in Tudor London, and can spread rapidly.  When a merchant ship is quarantined, there are rumours.  And when outbreaks of pestilence spread, theres an urgent demand for rat poison.  Biancas friend Jolyn seeks her assistance for painful abdominal cramps, and dies suddenly after drinking tea at Biancas.  Not surprisingly, Bianca is accused of murder.  While Bianca believes that someone was poisoning Jolyn, Constable Patch believes Bianca responsible.  Can Bianca find out how Jolyn was killed, and by whom?Bianca, with the aid of her boyfriend John and the colourful Meddybemps, tries to find the truth.  Is Jolyns death connected to her work for Mrs Beldam at Barke House?  And why are so many people after Jolyns lucky ring?  Bianca needs to investigate carefully and quickly: Constable Patch is determined to bring her to justice.  She suggests jealousy as a motive, to which Constable Patch replies:Another lover, Patch groaned. How pedestrian.I had trouble imagining Patch actually saying How pedestrian, but thats okay.  There are a number of different threads, a few red herrings and a lot of rats in this story.  Ms Lawrence depicts the squalor and the hardship well.  I can hear the rats(!) and smell the waste.  The setting is well described, the story moves at a quick pace and while some aspects are less believable than others, Bianca Goddard is an interesting character.

"Jovan and Suzana have escaped the horrors of Sarajevo by seeking refuge in Australia. For them, life in Melbourne is nothing like their old lives in pre-war Sarajevo: once academics, they are now both cleaners.  Jovan cleans at a bayside hospital in Melbourne and Suzana cleans houses.  The death of their two children in Sarajevo causes them both, in different ways, great pain.During a hot Melbourne summer, Jovan finds his cleaning work disrupted by acts of graffiti in various places around the hospital.  The cryptic and disturbing graffiti has an impact on Jovan, it reminds him of aspects of the past that he is trying to come to terms with.  He cleans up, time after time, knowing that the graffitist (nicknamed Dr Graffito) is probably aware that Jovan is the cleaner.  In the meantime, life moves along.  Jovan keeps thinking he must replace the brake pads in his panel van before the brakes fail, and he feels considerable pain from toothache.  Suzana cleans for people who seem to appreciate her services, but she knows there should be more to life.  Jovan and Suzana are largely invisible to those around them, and many of their interactions (both with each other and with others) touch only on aspects of them as people.  Their lives are not satisfying, and they long to recover what was important to them in the past.The two worlds appear far apart.  Sarajevo is across the seas, and as time goes by, the separating waters seem ever broader to Jovan and Suzana, yet the box, which they cannot open, and cannot close contains their Sarajevo lives.How can you make a new life in another country when your old life carries such pain?  Is it possible to reclaim what is good and find peace from what is painful?  Gradually we learn more about Jovan and Susana, about their lives and aspirations in Sarajevo, about their dreams for starting again in Australia.  We see the scars of the past, and how they are (inadvertently or otherwise) rubbed raw by the unthinking actions of those around them.  As if, somehow, the fact of being given refuge should nullify or neutralize the past.A world of diminished men labouring without end, for no good reason, and a womans job thrown in there after them, somehow, however she might fit the shoes provided, broken crystal slipper or otherwise.I found this novel profoundly moving, as well as a reminder that human experiences are complex and layered.  It reminded me as well as some uncomfortable aspects of Australia: assumptions about refugees and not taking the time to learn how to pronounce names.  All part of a subconscious, or sometimes unconscious, process of differentiation.  Jovan and Suzana are two people profoundly affected by war, but not (yet) destroyed by their experiences.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZVXHFL0PRXYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWDJRYU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZVXHFL0PRXYQ","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Golden Age is set in a convalescent home for children who were victims of poliomyelitis in Perth, Western Australia in the early 1950s.  (The Golden Age Convalescent Home for Polio Children which operated in Leederville from 1949 to 1959, really existed.  It was once a hotel, and has since been demolished.)  This novel tells the story of a twelve year boy, Frank Gold.  Frank and his parents Ida and Meyer were Hungarian refugees who had wanted to go to America but had reluctantly come to Australia.  Meyer has adapted, Ida has not.  And when Frank contracts polio after they settle in Perth, she has even less reason to be happy.  Ida was once a concert pianist, but once Frank became ill she no longer played.Once you have tasted meaninglessness, you lose any idea of reward, or punishment, or conventional virtue.Frank has been moved from the adult polio hospital (where he was the youngest patient) to The Golden Age (where he is the oldest).  At first he is not happy about this move, coming soon after the death of Sullivan (aged 18) whom hed met in the iron lung ward.  Sullivan had composed poetry, which Frank transcribed for him, and the two of them had become close.At The Golden Age, Frank explores the corridors in his wheelchair, trying to catch a glimpse of Elsa, the only other child of his age.  The two become friends.  The reader learns more about each of them, about Elsas strength and sense of self, about Franks intense desire to belong and to write poetry.  Theres an encounter which changes both their lives, and quite soon after the story moves (abruptly) to the present day and we learn a little about the intervening years of their lives.The story is told in the third-person, and moves through a number of different points of view.  I enjoyed this, as it gave an opportunity to see events through the lives of some of the other characters including Franks father, Elsas mother and Sister Olive Penny who is in charge at The Golden Age.  Through Frank and Elsa, Ms London describes the onset, impact and isolation caused by polio.  Through their parents (particularly Elsas mother and Franks parents) she describes the post-war world in Australia, the impacts of difference, disease and war.  Its a rich world, shaped but not destroyed by events.  I read this novel accompanied by memories of my father, who contracted polio as a young man (in Tasmania) during this epidemic.This is the kind of story that stays with you, long after youve finished reading it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNF501HMMXYXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY5QJQ2#wasThisHelpful","RNF501HMMXYXL","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jeremy Corbin, his wife Jacqueline Walls and their baby daughter Annie were living a quiet life in suburban New Jersey.  Then, one day, a series of events shattered the calm and their friend Eytan Morgenstern saved them.  Why is the group, known as the Consortium, after Jeremy and Jacqueline?  And who is Eytan Morgenstern?As the story unfolds, we learn more about Eytan Morgenstern and his past.  It becomes clear that many people are interested in Eytan Morgenstern: his superhuman strength is one of the legacies of Nazi experimentation.  The novel moves between past and present, between London, Tel Aviv, Poland and Manhattan.  Eytan Morgenstern may have spent much of his life bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, but the threats to him personally have never been greater. Is it possible for Eytan Morgenstern to break free of the past - can Jeremy and Jacqueline help him?Its difficult to review this novel without introducing spoilers, although Im trying to resist that.  Its also the third novel in a series, and Ive yet to read the first two books.  Suffice to say that there is plenty of action, and sometimes the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys is not easy to make.  This is a fast moving thriller which draws on some of the atrocities of World War II as providing some potential for current military aspirations.  Individuals are not important in this world, except, perhaps as vehicles for (or recipients of) the science behind strength.While I intend to read the other books in the series (The Bleiberg Project and The Shiro Project) at some stage, The Morgenstern Project is sufficiently self-contained to be read as a standalone novel.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Le French Book for an opportunity to read this novel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVC8H3ZVIGGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9KL7QM#wasThisHelpful","RUVC8H3ZVIGGF","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"haunted my childhood.This is a novel about the times and impacts of the Great Depression in Australia (from 1929 until well into the 1930s).  The novel is set in Port Adelaide, and the central character is Judith Larsen who was living with her parents on a coal hulk on the Port River.  Judith is a child when she sees men so hungry that they swim out into the river to try to retrieve bread scraps thrown to seagulls.  She sees, too, how men use newspaper to pad their clothes against the cold.  Judith had little opportunity for formal education and, when her fathers income as a winchman on the wharves is reduced as a consequence of changes to hiring practices, she leaves school to work in the Chew It caf.  Australias political landscape is changing, as unemployment and hunger provide a fertile breeding ground for those seeking to change society and to manage it differently.He could play anything on the piano and he could dance and box but now had to earn his living in a hot dirty foundry.Judith falls in love with Harry Grenville, a talented piano player who is attracted to the ideals of the Communist Party.  Judith herself, thanks to a benefactor in the form of Joe Pulham at the Working Mens Club, is able to attend Art School and makes her own social commentary in the form of satirical cartoons.I flushed.  This was charity.  We all struggled against it.Judith and Harry marry, and Harrys commitment to the Communist Party leads him on a fact-finding mission to Spain - just before the Spanish Civil War erupts into a massacre of leftist sympathisers.  Harry disappears, and Judith sets off for Europe to try to find him.It was a peculiar shifting from one world into another, as is traipsing out of bright sunshine into darkness.I found this novel totally engrossing.  I remember my grandparents speaking of the Great Depression, which struck when they were newly married in Tasmania.  My grandfather said that hed eaten so much rhubarb during that period that he could never eat it again.  Members of my grandmothers family joined the Communist Party in the hope that communism could redress the inequities they saw.  There was a belief, too, in the importance of unions to support workers in their struggles.  Ive read quite a bit about the Great Depression, but generally in relation to Sydney, or Tasmania.  In this novel, which manages to cover many different aspects of the Great Depression, to weave fiction around the facts (such as the Beef Riot in Adelaide in 1931), the social and political unrest of the times, the impacts on individuals become clear.  Reminders of the susso (the so called sustenance payments) that originated during the Great Depression.  By 1932, more than 60,000 people depended on sustenance payments, which were intended for those who were truly destitute, whod been unemployed for a long period of time and who had no assets or savings.But that afternoon my thoughts strayed to an idea of a generation of young people lost in time.  I had a vision of them all sitting around in a railway waiting room, hoping for a train to take them somewhere, anywhere.While Hunger Town is in part a love story, its the portrayal of the tenacity and courage of so many individuals that caught and held my attention.  Its a reminder too, of the hardships experienced by those generations whose experience of life was shaped by the economic depression between the two world wars.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUC1FBGSLNKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRBPDY4#wasThisHelpful","R3MUC1FBGSLNKM","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two families are the focus of this novel, which is set in an outer suburb of Melbourne.  The Kileys, with their six children, are long-term residents.  The Jensons, with their two children, have just moved in.  The older of the Jenson brothers is Colt, aged twelve.  Colt used to be an athlete, but he doesnt run anymore. Colt has shelves of statues - of golden boys - as a mute testimony to his past prowess.  Rex Jenson, Colts father, invites the Kiley boys, Declan and Syd, together with other neighbourhood boys in to play with his sons and their mountain of toys.  And, compared to the other children in the neighbourhood, Colt and Bastian Jenson have everything: including a swimming pool, a BMX bike, and skateboards.For Freya, aged 13, and eldest of the Kiley children, Rex is much more sophisticated than her dad, Joe.  Joe Kiley isnt happy, and he doesnt have a lot of money.  If Joe drinks too much, then voices are raised, plates are smashed and the younger children are distressed.  The older Kiley children, Freya and Declan, do their best to look out for their younger siblings.  They try to make things right for others as well:  at one stage Declan takes a blow from the neighbourhood bully Garrick to protect a much smaller boy, Avery.So, for many of the neighbourhood children, Rex is something of a hero.  For Freya, he becomes someone she can talk to.  But is Rex someone who can be trusted?While this is marketed as a novel for adults, I think teenagers would also appreciate it.  Its about growing up and the resilience of children, about relationships between children, about the acceptance of domestic violence, and about the insidious way in which money and power can enable predators.  The novel raises questions about boundaries, about acceptable behaviour, and about taking responsibility.  What can you do to change your world?  Will anyone believe you?While some of the issues covered in this novel are unpleasant, Ms Hartnett certainly provides a realistic depiction of a world that is all too familiar to many.  I finished the book, and wondered about all of those Kiley and Jenson families who exist outside fiction.Tomorrow, if the weather is fine, he will run, swim, ride.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLE7RWN2QOOOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M6MQKXQ#wasThisHelpful","RLE7RWN2QOOOA","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When Jesse Marley applies for her first adult passport in 1981 as part of planning a surprise trip home to the UK from Australia with her parents, she finds there is a discrepancy about her birth registration.  She asks her parents why, and finds that she was adopted.  Jesse is devastated, and travels to the UK to see if she can find who her birth mother was, and why she was given up for adoption. Once in London, she has an accident.  And in hospital, temporarily unable to speak, forced to use her left hand instead of her right, Jesse starts drawing places and people shes never seen.  Her Doctor, Rory Brandon, is intrigued.  Especially once he recognises the castle.Thus begins Jesses journey: to a place called Hundredfield built a thousand years earlier by the Normans near the border with Scotland.  What is Jesses connection to Hundredfield?  Can Rory help her find the answers she is seeking?The story moves between the present in which Jesse is trying to seek information about her past, and a period some hundreds of years earlier when the marriage of a mysterious woman to a lord of Hundredfield seems to initiate a series of inexplicable events.  How are these two stories connected?Of course.  Theres always an explanation.I enjoyed this story, and kept turning the pages trying to work out how (and through whom) Jesse was connected to Hundredfield.

The two are in competition for information lost when the Third Reich fell, and will do whatever it takes to achieve their objectives.There was no longer any room for doubt.  It had all started in Germany and had continued over the course of centuries.Detective Antoine Marcas is reluctantly teamed with Jade Zewinski and tasked with tracking down Neo-Nazi assassins in Europe.  To do this, they need to make sense of an arcane Freemason mystery, assisted by some information newly available from KGB files.  Trying to stop the extremists, trying to get one step ahead of them while working out what they are after provides Antoine Marcas and Jade Zewinski with a number of challenges.This is a fast paced and intriguing mystery, suitably peopled with likeable heroes and despicable villains. There are plenty of novels focussed on secret societies, usually with a focus on religious arcana.  This novel held my attention: extremism (of whatever motivation) is sufficiently current, raw and real to feed contemporary concerns.  Its difficult to say more without introducing spoilers (and Im very keen not to do that).  If you are after a fast-moving novel that provides an historical context for its events and actions, if you are intrigued by secret societies, their rituals and arcana, then you may well enjoy Shadow Ritual.  Recently translated from French, this is the first novel in a series.  Ill certainly be looking to read the others if they become available in English.The flesh falls from the bones.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Le French Book for an opportunity to read this novel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHYJ16KD2BYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SC7E04A#wasThisHelpful","R1IHYJ16KD2BYU","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bobby Hale had been in the Union Army a few times: enlisting, taking the bonus, deserting and then re-enlisting.  He cant forget the action he saw at Fredericksburg and at Chickamauga.  Bobby Hale is an orphan, and with no ties in the east, hes looking to find a new life in the west.  In 1869 Bobby Hale, armed with a Colt Dragoon revolver and an Evans repeater rifle, and with his mare Cricket, hooks up with a pioneer wagon train heading to Oregon.  The wagon train is led by a man named Theo, and a Crow scout named Big Tree.There aint nothing luxurious or enlightening about this part of our country, and I dont know why people get so rapturous about it.In this novel, we journey with Bobby Hale between 1869 and 1876.  We see the country through his eyes, see how he tries to do what he considers is right, and see how Bobby relates to the world around him.  Bobby leaves the wagon train in Montana to go trapping in the Rockies with Big Tree.  After a few years, he heads to Fort Ellis where he winters in a Conestoga wagon with widowed sisters Eveline and Christine.  Then, after making plans to return to the sisters, he takes a job as a scout.  After killing an Indian who is part of a peace party, Hale deserts.  And then life gets complicated.  Bobbys subsequent journey with a new companion named Ink takes him into some dangerous territory, including the site of the Battle of Little Big Horn.I wasnt feeling like a hero no more.I really enjoyed reading this novel.  Bobby Hale is no conventional hero, yet he tries very hard to do the right thing by those he cares about or feels some responsibility towards.  He realises, too, that the white mans treatment of the Indians is unjust and tries to learn more about the country in which he finds himself. I found myself thinking about Bobby and Ink after I finished reading the novel.  Would they have stayed together?  Could they have been happy? How would their lives have continued?  Mr Bausch managed to create a story in which I could smell the coffee, hear the shots fired and appreciate the great divide between the Indian and European cultures of the American west.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZRRCDSV1CP5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9PJELI#wasThisHelpful","RZRRCDSV1CP5X","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ginny OByrne and her fianc Julian Rockliffe travel to Freycinet National Park where theyll be staying at Devil Lodge in the shadow of the Hazards.  As they drive into Freycinet, Ginny finds the Hazards disquieting: both brilliant and disturbing. The colours of the landscape seem to overwhelm her, making her disoriented and dizzy.  And we know, through Ginnys musings on the drive, that she is wanting Julian to change back to the way he was up until six months earlier.  Ginny and Julian have been together for over five years, and now - suddenly and insistently - Julian wants them to get married.Let me tell you what happened to us here at Freycinet.But Julian and Ginnys stay at Freycinet will not be restful or relaxing.  Two women go missing, resulting in a massive search in which Ginny and Julian become involved.  What has happened to these women, and why? And why is Ginny so disturbed by the Hazards?  Is she right to suspect some of the men involved in the search?  As the tension builds, as the policeman in charge seeks to make sense of the scene, Ginny struggles to make sense of what she is experiencing. No-one in fairy tales has a mother, have you ever noticed?There are a number of twists and turns in this novel and while some aspects of it didnt work well for me, I loved Ms Calverts descriptions of Tasmania.  Its difficult to say more about the story without introducing spoilers, and this is a story in which not knowing what might happen (or why) significantly increases the tension.  And when you get do to the end, certain aspects will make sense, while others may make you wonder.If you like mystery, murder with a twist, in a beautiful setting, you may well enjoy this.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37GIC8NBGS6HV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R320TM#wasThisHelpful","R37GIC8NBGS6HV","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura and Clare Vaizey are at boarding school when their father dies, and the lives they had anticipated for themselves (especially Laura) are changed forever.  Their mother removes Laura from school and sends her to business school to learn shorthand and typing.  Laura, no longer able to dream of pursuing a career in medicine, becomes responsible for her sister Clare.  Mrs Vaizey decides to return to England and, on the last ship bound for England as World War II breaks out, abandons her daughters.Laura finds work in a factory, where the owner Felix Shaw pays attention to her.  Although Laura is unsure about Felix, she agrees to marry him, partly (at least) to prevent Clare having to leave school. I think youd better just marry me, and both of you come to live in the new house.  Ill fix everything.Felixs way of fixing everything is through controlling Laura.  He belittles her, he manipulates her, and he crushes her.  In the claustrophobic environment that Felix controls, neither of the sisters can relax. And over time, Laura begins to reflect Felixs values. She had achieved this state with much painless suffering, committing murder by proxy.Although Clare sees Felix for what he is, she cannot persuade Laura to leave him.  Laura has almost entirely lost any sense of herself as an independent person.  Can Laura be saved?  Or will Clare have to abandon her in order to save herself?For me, two tragic themes are central to this novel.  The first is the warping of Lauras spirit as, oppressed by Felix, she becomes more like him.  Gone is the clever independent girl who dreamed of being a doctor, replaced by a fearful woman reflecting Felixs views in order to find an uneasy peace in her world.  The second is the awfulness and power of manipulation, where people seek (whether physically or psychologically) to impose their wills on others.  Laura has been doubly unfortunate: a narcissistic self-serving mother, and an insecure controlling husband.This is a thought-provoking novel.  It is uncomfortable and confronting, raising questions about choices, and imbued with an undercurrent of malicious destruction.  I am uneasy with aspects of the story, they reflect a reality I have observed.This novel was first published in 1966, and was reissued in 2012.  The setting may seem dated, the issues raised are not.It is a wonder of the world to notice how fundamentally people change from one second to the next when they are given their own way.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRVXM2CRO3VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CAJZLG#wasThisHelpful","R1XRVXM2CRO3VH","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are three parts to Being There.  The first part includes various pieces that David Malouf had written since 1965, the second part includes two previously unpublished libretti for Voss and Mer de Glace and the third is a translation of Hippolytus.I enjoyed the articles, introductory essays, talks that constitute part one:  David Maloufs erudite musings about the shape and meaning of art.  About what it is, and about how we (as individuals) respond.  These are pieces to read, think about, and reread.  And to wonder whether (and how) definitions of and responses to art may have evolved over the almost fifty years covered by these articles.  I have read some of these pieces when they were originally published, but to read them as a collection invites more detailed consideration of a personal relationship with art, especially with opera and music.Any activity that demands our complete attention - absorption in a task, looking hard at a painting or a piece of sculpture, losing ourselves in the reading of a story or in a play or film; doing anything, as we say, that takes us out of ourselves - is restorative, and in a particular way.I enjoyed, too, the two libretti, especially Voss.  David Maloufs introduction to this section sets out the context for his writing of the libretti, and reminded me of the challenges of adapting novels for stage (and film).  I love the novel Voss, and, as for other novels to which I am emotionally attached, am not interested in any movie version of it.  I know (somehow) that the movie will not match my interpretation.  In the Voss libretto, though, I could recognise my Voss.  Mer de Glace is different in that it is not a representation of Mary Shelleys novel Frankenstein but a depiction of the first telling of the story.And Hippolytus?  Left me wanting to reacquaint myself with Euripides.I enjoyed this book, with its collection of different pieces, providing both a view into David Maloufs relationship with art in various forms, and a looking glass through which to consider my own responses to interpretation and performance. About what I like, and why.Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Random House Australia for an opportunity to read an advance copy of this book.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38EVY3EUJUUTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9M3836#wasThisHelpful","R38EVY3EUJUUTK","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to this book by Thomas Fleming, there were many conflicts between the Founding Fathers about the role of government in the United States of America, and the most important of these was between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, respectively the first and third presidents of the United States of America, had very different views of the role of government and specifically of the presidency. In the introduction to this book, Mr Fleming writes that: Washington was first, last and always a realist, while Jefferson tended to see men and events through the lense of a pervasive idealism.How did these differences in character and leadership style impact on the government of the fledgling nation, and do those differences still have an impact on the present?  What is the role of government and how should presidential power be exercised?Mr Fleming provides a detailed examination of the differences in leadership style between Washington and Jefferson, as well as the different experiences which they each bought to the presidency.  Before I read this book, I knew that Washington was the general who led the colonies to freedom during the American War of Independence and was unanimously elected as the first President.  I knew that Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, had served as the United States Minister to France and as the first United States Secretary of State under President Washington before becoming the third president.  I knew very little about either the fact or causes of the political differences between them.In this book, Mr Fleming explains the development of the Constitution, which followed the Articles of Confederation approved by the Second Continental Congress.  While achieving independence from Britain left the United States at peace, the structure of government was unsettled, its power weak.  This appears to have been key to the development of Washingtons political ideology, favouring a strong federal government. Jefferson favoured the rights of the individual states.  Although these differences clearly shaped their individual presidencies, they have also continued to have an impact on US politics since.And is one model of presidency better than the other?  Or have both models (in their different ways) strengthened the Union?  Certainly, at the time the United States came into being, a more centralized model of government would seem (to me at least) more effective in addressing the challenges facing the new nation.  But the needs of nations and the ways those needs are met can change over time.I enjoyed reading this book and learning more about the differences between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  Washington seemed more practical, and focussed on effective management as well as leadership, Jefferson more of a passionate idealist believing that inspiration would serve instead of management by government.  Two very different men, two very different (but complementary) visions.  Each wanting what he saw as best for the USA.While my positive impression of George Washington (gleaned some decades ago) remains largely intact, Mr Flemings book makes me question aspects of Thomas Jeffersons influence.  I suspect that Ill be doing some more reading about Thomas Jefferson in the future.Note: My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read an advance copy of this book.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10GTJPHX6WTN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWX7QRA#wasThisHelpful","R10GTJPHX6WTN6","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On 29 June 1951, at the Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) Bridgwater in the UK, an explosion killed six men.  The cause of the explosion was never identified.  This event provided the inspiration for Neil Grimmetts novel.The novel opens with the explosion, and with one mans knowledge that the explosion was not an accident, but murder.  That man, Gunner Wade, was sent to find the shift chemist and foreman when a problem developed in the nitration house.  He was the only member of the crew to survive.Fast forward to spring 1979.  Byron Brownings father Gerard was one of the men who died on 29 June 1951.  Bryons seen the letters Gunner Wade had written to his mother over the years, stating that Gerard was murdered.  Martha Browning has tried to keep the letters hidden from Bryon, but hes seen them.  And, keen to find out the truth about his fathers death, Bryon gets a job at the ROF.And The Hoard still waits, its evil has grown with the passing of years.  And the Triumvirate is alive and prepares to moveWhat follows is an intriguing blend of betrayal, murder and mystery.  Will Bryon discover the truth, or will he become another casualty of the evil that seems to permeate this place?  Several different characters tell the story, and while the production of high explosives can be both dangerous and dirty, human greed increases the danger immensely.The story is complicated: numerous characters and technical detail about the processes serve to simultaneously slow the development of the story and to increase the suspense.  Gunner Wade seems to have been driven to madness: can he be relied upon?  It isnt always easy to differentiate good from evil, or to sift truth from madness.Because of the number of different characters and points of view, it took me a while to get caught up in this story.  But I was hooked early, and found it almost impossible to put down.  The description of the factory - surely one of the circles of hell in Dantes Inferno, the manipulation of men to distort (or destroy) the truth, the destruction caused by the production of materiel even before that materiel makes its way into a theatre of war are some of the thoughts and images that accompanied me as I read this novel.  Many of the characters are flawed, some are more likeable than others: a near perfect cast to tell this story.I found this novel challenging and thought-provoking.  And scary.And all hell broke loose.My thanks to Mr Grimmett for offering me a copy of this novel after Id read and reviewed his novel The Threshing Circle.  Two very different novels, both will stay with me for a long time.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28RGL4Y430019/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLPNF8#wasThisHelpful","R28RGL4Y430019","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pit of Vipers is the second book of Ms Thoms Son of Kings trilogy and continues the story of Alfred of Wessex and Eadwulf of Mercia, which started in Shadow of the Raven.  Id strongly recommend reading Shadow of the Raven before embarking on Pit of Vipers.The year is 864, and Alfred is now fifteen.  At the court of first one older brother and then the other, he is learning the art and craft of being a king. Eadwulf, the (fictional) Mercian who has spent time as a Danish slave, has been back in his homeland for four years.  Eadwulf has married, and he and his wife Leoflaed form part of the household of Wigstan of Elston, a Mercian ealdorman.  While Eadwulf, known as Ulf to the Danes, is happy with Leoflaed, he has not forgotten Freydis.  He is still determined to extract vengeance on his uncle, Burgred.While Alfred and Eadwulf are the primary characters, Ms Thom has skilfully used secondary characters to portray everyday life in the ninth century and to add depth to the story.  A dozen vipers also play an important part.  Ms Thom portrays Alfred as a much more likeable character than some of the other depictions I have read in other novels.  Yes, he is pious and he has some medical problems but he is keenly observant.  Eadwulf has been shaped by his experiences in Denmark, and his loyalties are divided.  Where will Eadwulf stand as the Danish attacks increase?  Will he ever get his revenge on Burgred?There are many characters in this novel, and the character list at the beginning of the novel is great for those of us who need it.  There are also two helpful maps: Anglo Saxon kingdoms, 860s-70s and a more detailed map of Wessex for the same period.  I found the maps particularly useful when trying to follow the action, especially the invasion by those dubbed The Great Heathen Army in 865.I enjoy historical fiction set in this period and Ive thoroughly enjoyed both of the books so far published in this trilogy.  The intrigues, lifestyles and lives of the characters are well drawn, and the world they inhabit is alive and vibrant.NOTE: I was offered, and accepted, a copy of this book for review purposes.  I am keenly awaiting the publication of the final book in this trilogy.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIBEKQU1LT78B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RDB7H0A#wasThisHelpful","RIBEKQU1LT78B","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Shakespeares Macbeth, after prophesying that Macbeth shalt be King hereafter, the three witches end their prophecy with these words for Banquo:Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.In the play, Banquo is murdered shortly afterwards, and Fleance flees from Scotland and out of the play.  But have you ever wondered what happened to Fleance afterwards?  In Ms Rochelles novel, we follow Fleance as he escapes into Wales and joins the court of the King, Gruffydd ap Llewelyn.  Fleance meets Gruffydds daughter Nesta.  They have a child together, a son named Walter.  It is through Walter that the witches prophecy will eventually be fulfilled, and it is Walter who is the main character in this novel.It takes more than an unfortunate birth to dishonour a man.Ms Rochelle has woven fact and fiction with elements of fantasy in her portrayal of some of the key events of the 11th century.  From Scotland to Wales we accompany Fleance, from Wales to England, Scotland and France we accompany Walter as he grows from a youth into a responsible adult.  Walter becomes friends with Malcolm, son of Duncan, who will become King of Scotland in 1058.  Harold Godwinson and William of Normandy will fight for the crown of England in 1066.  And every so often, Walter will be visited by the witches, mostly through his dreams: The Norns seem to have an interest in my future.  I believe in them.I enjoyed this novel.  Im familiar with Shakespeares Macbeth, as well as portrayals of Macbeth in a number of novels of historical fiction.  While Shakespeares Macbeth provides a starting point for Ms Rochelles novel, and the prophecy by the witches (the weird sisters or the Norns) provides a connection to the play, the novel itself is not bound by the play. Banquo, Fleance and Walter may be fictional characters, but many of the other characters are historical, as are many of the events portrayed.  I particularly enjoyed how Ms Rochelle portrayed the challenges faced by Malcolm as he became King of Scotland. If you enjoy well-written historical fiction grounded in fact, and if you ever wondered what happened to Fleance after Banquo was murdered, you may well enjoy this novel.Note: I was offered, and accepted, a copy of this novel for review purposes.Jennifer Cameron-Smith","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HQ8HV74G6NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYXFJ1I#wasThisHelpful","R25HQ8HV74G6NU","A1DYMH30TSRONY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DYMH30TSRONY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The combination of this Garcinia Cambogia and their weight loss program really works. I got my first bottle of Garcinia Cambogia for free because I participated in a Facebook contest.Since I also got their weight loss program and I desperately wanted to lose weight I decided to follow their diet plan and exercise program each day.After a few days, each morning I woke up filled with energy and I used to do a workout. I gained a lot of weight in the past because of my sugar cravings, but ever since I got this Garcinia and followed the diet plan, they simply stopped and I was not hungry anymore in the evening.Last month I lost 17 pounds. I just got my second bottle of Garcinia cause I need to lose another 25 pounds to get to where I want, so I'll update my review next month.So far, I am really happy","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BI7R0KYIKX8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5YWNLU#wasThisHelpful","R2BI7R0KYIKX8A","A27D1L36PIJ8UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27D1L36PIJ8UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I've already gone through 2 other cases I bought from a store, but they didn't last, they didn't fully protect my ipad and they were awkward when trying to use my ipad. This one makes it easy to use your ipad still, easily charge it, works great. I specifically chose this one because I like its cooling and ventilation ability, so it doesnt over heat. I watch movies a lot or read on my ipad so I like how it folds upright if I need it to.

" 3:00 MinsThese are awesome Grill & BBQ Gloves by BlizeTecMy husband and I cook a lot, and I was burning myself all time on the top of my hands and arms. The gloves have prevented that now. They fit perfectly onto my hands. The best part is you can move your fingers around easily so it does allow you more flexibility while cooking. My husband uses it to BBQ..so I might need to get an extra pair so he doesn't take mine anymore ;p Overall, the heat resistant level is solid..up to 420 F degree. Durable, safe to use, easy to clean.Despite the manufacturer suggesting handwash only, I did try it once in the dishwasher without reading the instruction on the packaging, and surprisingly they were not damaged and they work just fine.

"Peta Jos second novel, The Crushing Season, is an engaging story about friendship, family, love and loss.Leah, May, Tate, Alex and Benny are the best of friends. They met in high school and more than fifteen years later, despite the separation wrought by their busy lives, remain close. When May is hit by a double crisis, her friends rally to support her, but none of them realise how badly she has been affected, until she does the unthinkable.I became quite attached to all of the Crushing Seasons protagonists, who are wonderfully developed characters. Tate is a feisty news editor, struggling to balance her commitment to her work and new motherhood. Leah runs her own successful restaurant, but is plagued with a history of bad relationships. Benny is a frustrated writer on the verge of giving up on his dreams. Laid back Alex is suddenly anxious about his future. May is the linchpin of the group, whose gentle and caring nature never hints at the dark secrets she holds close.The dynamic between the friends is skilfully rendered. I enjoyed their rowdy reunion, their affectionate ribbing and bickering, and of course the way they supported each other in times of crisis. Even when their bond is complicated and strained, the connection is clear. In many ways, they remind me of my own close circle of friends whom I dont see as often as I would like.Peta Jos exploration of the books somber issues such as abuse, depression, suicide and guilt, are thoughtful and compassionate. Most importantly, the characters emotions are sincere, and their behaviour genuine. Though there is real sadness in The Crushing Season, there is also plenty of heart and humour, which often made me smile.Well paced, with excellent characterisation and a strong plot, The Crushing Season is an affecting tale, both achingly poignant and truly heartwarming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BA0K6ZVPM46E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0987279920#wasThisHelpful","R3BA0K6ZVPM46E","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a parent, facing the horror of your precious child being murdered is one thing, confronting the truth that your child is a murderer is another. In The Guilty One, Sophie Littlefield's 15th novel, Maris Vacanti and Ron Isherwood wrestle with the loss of their only children under very different circumstances.A year ago, Maris's teenage daughter, Calla, was murdered, and shortly after Maris's husband left her, declaring their marriage a sham. Too emotionally depleted to even feign normalcy, Maris has let her suburban life lapse but is at a loss as to how to move on when a random encounter offers her the chance to escape and start anew.Ron was horrified when his son Karl, Calla's ex boyfriend, was charged and later convicted for Calla's murder. Though his son, and wife, maintain a plea of innocence, Ron is racked with guilt because he believes his son is responsible and worries that it is his legacy of explosive violence, and the mistakes he made as a father, that contributed to Karl's actions.An emotionally wrenching novel, The Guilty One is a character driven story that explores the themes of grief, guilt, forgiveness and redemption as Maris and Ron struggle to reconcile themselves to all they have lost, and find a way to move forward.While the perspective of a bereaved parent of a murdered child has been examined often in fiction, the aftermath for the parents of the murderer have rarely been examined. To the best of my recollection, in most cases the killer's parents are absent or highly dysfunctional. Ron and Deb are ordinary middle class people and I appreciated the author's decision to humanise them, and acknowledge their grief and loss.The pacing is measured, the writing and dialogue of a good standard. Though there is little in the way of overt action, Littlefield maintains a low hum of suspense, as Karl's culpability is in question.I found The Guilty One to be a touching and thought-provoking novel, with a bittersweet but satisfying conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P1I0TISFNRCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476757836#wasThisHelpful","R1P1I0TISFNRCC","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always intended to read Chloe Neill's popular Chicagoland Vampires series but never found the time, so I leapt at the chance to read The Veil, the first book her new Devil's Isle series.It has been seven years since the Veil between New Orleans and the supernatural world was torn open permitting the egress of paranormals determined to enslave or wipe out humanity. War raged for a year, leaving thousands dead and the land scarred before the Veil was closed. Magic was banned and the Para's who survived incarcerated in a neighborhood adjoining The French Quarter, nicknamed Devil's Isle.Claire Connolly owns and runs an antique and supply store, inherited from her late father, at was what 'ground zero'. She refuses to abandon the family store and leave New Orleans even though she risks everything to stay, for after the Veil was reinstated, Claire discovered she was a 'sensitive', a human with the ability to wield magic, and discovery would mean 'containment'.But when Claire witnesses a woman being attacked by two wraiths (sensitives that have been overwhelmed by their magic) she intervenes and to save herself must use her magic. Certain she will be arrested and imprisoned, assistance comes from an unexpected source, bounty hunter Liam Quinn, who not only helps destroy the evidence of her actions, but also finds her a mentor to teach her to harness her magic.Walking a fine line between remaining hidden and discovery, everything changes when Claire and Liam discover a dangerous plot to reopen the Veil.Though New Orleans isn't an unique setting, Neil's worldbuilding is solid. The society has dystopian elements what with almost martial law and street level magic monitoring, and there also an apocalyptic feel given the scorched earth, ruined buildings and communication issues.There is quite a lot of information to digest in The Veil, including the history of the war, the current status of New Orleans society, the make up of Para's, and the motives of the Beyond. I felt Neil integrated the details well for most part, maintaining a good pace and advancing the plot.The characters are likeable, Claire is stubborn, resourceful and she has a close knit group of friends that are her substitute family. Liam is essentially a loner, especially since losing his sister. As a bounty hunter he can move quite freely between New Orleans and Devil's Isle where his grandmother is and he has, if not friends then sources, such as Moses, a computer hacker with horns. The attraction between Claire and Liam is immediate and inevitable, and a strong element of the plot.Though I'm not irreversibly hooked, I did enjoy The Veil. It's a quick and engaging read and I will most likely pick up the next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GHV5OFRAXX7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4GCK#wasThisHelpful","R3GHV5OFRAXX7I","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rory McGovern is a part time freelance stylist, who lives in New York with her actor husband and two young children, but with her husband's star fading and residuals dwindling, Rory is forced to find full time work. Just as she lands a position with a start up webzine run by Millennials, her husband announces he needs some space, and Rory is suddenly the only grown-up at work and home.Rory often made me shake my head, both in empathy and disbelief. I could relate to the chaos of parenting, less so to the doormat aspects of her personality. Sadly most of the other characters were little more than stereotypes, from Rory's man child husband, and loopy mother in law, to bitchy colleague, and the hunky man about town love interest. I did like Claire though, and Josh of course, as I was meant to.Rory's experiences in the workplace are highly exaggerated, or at least I hope so. I certainly wouldn't stand for Taylor's snotty attitude, life is too short and I'm far too old (just a year older that Rory) to put up with that sort of crap. The highstrung, self absorbed Millennial staff are ripe targets for mocking however and McLaughlin and Kraus delight in poking fun at them, as well as the inane 'jargon' favoured by youth that actually have nothing to say.How To Be a Grown-Up was entertaining, but only mildly so.

"From Cathy Lamb, comes another poignant, funny and winsome novel, titled My Very Best Friend.After a twenty year absence, reclusive bestselling romance writer, Charlotte Mackintosh is returning home to Scotland to arrange the sale of her family's cottage. She is also hoping to reconnect with her childhood best friend, Bridget, who has stopped replying to her letters. She is shocked to discover the cottage in a state of bad disrepair, and to learn that Bridget, who has been living a lie, is missing.My Very Best Friend is a story about friendship, about love, about childhood and coming home. It features a decidedly odd but endearing heroine, a handsome Scotsman, a broken woman and a community of quirky characters.It deals with serious issues including sexual abuse, domestic violence, drug addiction, grief, and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. There are some unbearably tragic moments in the novel that had tears welling in my eyes, others that had me gritting teeth at the injustice.But what Lamb does best is to remind us that life, for all its sorrows, can be utterly glorious. Charlotte and Toran's reconnection will have you sighing and swooning, the ladies of the St Ambrose Garden Club (aka The Gabbing and Gobbling Gardeners) will have you screaming with laughter as they lead rowdy drunken sing-along's in the town square and ride bikes in their lingerie at midnight, and a surprise reunion will have you smiling so hard your cheeks will hurt.It has a few flaws, including a somewhat slow moving, muddled start and a little repetition, but I'm willing to forgive all because Lamb redeems herself with such fantastic characters and heartfelt commitment to the story.Witty, wise and wonderful, My Very Best Friend is another winner for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PG836BLK2PPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758295081#wasThisHelpful","R3PG836BLK2PPK","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For all it made me feel, I declared Fredrik Backman's debut novel, A Man Called Ove my favourite book of 2014 and My Grandmother Asked me to Tell You She's Sorry is now my favourite of 2015.Elsa is an improbably precocious but utterly adorable seven year old girl who loves her grandmother, Harry Potter and Wikipedia, in that order. Bullied at school, Granny is Elsa's best and only friend, her guide to the Land-of-Almost-Awake, a dreamscape of fairy tales, magic and adventure that comforts them both when life is difficult, and her very own superhero.She shouldn't take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny. Because all the best people are different - look at superheroes.""Just before Granny dies she presses an envelope into Elsa's hand, and asks her granddaughter to deliver a letter.""Give the letter to him who's waiting. He won't want to accept it, but tell him it's from me. Tell him your granny sends her regards and says she's sorry""And so begins Elsa's adventure, part quest, part treasure hunt, part superhero mission, Granny's letter leads Elsa first to the door of a wurse, and then The Monster (also known as Wolfheart), another letter leads her to the Sea-Witch and yet another much later to the Princess of Miploris. With each letter, offering apologies and regrets, Elsa unravels the truth about the fairy tales that form the foundation of the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and the secrets of her grandmother's exceptional life.""Elsa doesnt know if this means that Granny took all her stories from the real world and placed them in Miamas, or if the stories from Miamas became so real that the creatures came across to the real world. But the Land-of-Almost-Awake and her house are obviously merging.""In My Grandmother Asked me to Tell You She's Sorry, Backman weaves a creative tapestry of the ordinary together with the extraordinary. Characters that are real, flawed yet magnificent, or as Granny puts it,""no one is entirely a sh*t and almost no one is entirely not a sh*t"".It tells a story that is both wise and insightful, absurd and wondrous as it explores the themes of grief, love, difference, connection, regrets and forgiveness.Funny, moving, heartfelt and inspiring, it made me laugh and cry.Not five stars but ten... at least!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMTSNOJPKLZ6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501115065#wasThisHelpful","RMTSNOJPKLZ6E","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And Then Came Paulette is a charming story about family, friendship and community, wherein a collection of lost and lonely souls in need find refuge with one another. There is humour, tenderness and joy, despite the individual sorrows that unites these characters as together they rediscover a sense of purpose, usefulness and comfort.The characters have their own stories and quirks, from newly widowed guy to ninety five year old Hortense. Ferdinand also has his family to worry about when it seems likely his son is heading for a divorce. The identity of Paulette comes as quite a surprise, one I'm not willing to spoil.Translated from the author's native French, And Then Came Paulette is a quick, uplifting read. I must admit the ending feels very abrupt and the story unfinished as a result, but I did enjoy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GOJZAI6LIZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEG6UFW#wasThisHelpful","R8GOJZAI6LIZ9","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would probably not have given this book a second glance except that just days before it was offered to me for review I had read Turtle Reef, an Australian contemporary romance novel, in which the heroine, working at a marine park, befriended an octopus. I was intrigued by the relationship and was delighted by the opportunity to learn more.The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness, is written by Sy Montgomery, an author, naturalist, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator. It offers a very readable and rather unique blend of personal experience, scientific knowledge and philosophical opinion about what is understood, and unknown, about the nature of octopuses.I knew little about octopusesnot even that the scientifically correct plural is not octopi, as I had always believed (it turns out you cant put a Latin endingion a word derived from Greek, such as octopus). But what I did know intrigued me. Here is an animal with venom like a snake, a beak like a parrot, and ink like an old-fashioned pen. It can weigh as much as a man and stretch as long as a car, yet it can pour its baggy, boneless body through an opening the size of an orange. It can change color and shape. It can taste with its skin. Most fascinating of all, I had read that octopuses are smart.""What Montogomery is able to show in The Soul of an Octopus is that octopuses are complex creatures who exhibit personality, intelligence and emotion, despite having neural systems completely alien to our own. During her time spent at the New England Aquarium she befriended several individual octopuses including Athena, who was the subject of a popular 2011 Orion magazine piece, ""Deep Intellect"" which went viral and was the inspiration for this book, Octavia, Kali and Karma. Through her study of, and interaction with, these extraordinary creatures she shares what she learns from both science and her experiences, while musing on the mystery of the 'inner lives' of the octopus, who grow from the size of a grain of rice and live for, on average, just four short years.The Soul of an Octopus is as smart, playful, curious and surprising as the creature it features. A fascinating read I'd highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R339Z6TUWX28OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451697716#wasThisHelpful","R339Z6TUWX28OW","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2012 Ann Morgan, a freelance writer, editor and blogger, set herself the goal of reading one book from every country in the world, sharing her reviews through her blog, AYearofReadingtheWorld.com.The World Between Two Covers is in small part the story of her reading adventures, but is more fully an academic examination of the challenges she faced in sourcing world literature.Her first task was to determine exactly what defines a country, apparently there is some dispute, though she eventually settled on a list of 196. Morgan was then faced a number of challenges in selecting representative texts from each country including availability (only around 4% of books published in English are translated from other languages), censorship, technology and cultural identity. The World Between Two Covers examines these issues both within a global context, and within the framework of Morgan's personal challenge.""The truth is, we as individuals will never be wise enough or cultured enough or fast enough or long-lived enough to read the world as deeply and thoroughly as it deserves  and we never have been. We can only fail. So we have a choice: we can stick with what we know, or we can embrace the impossibility of reading world literature properly and jump right in  feel the fear and do it anyway'.""I found The World Between Two Covers to be an interesting read, highlighting the issues at play in reading world literature, especially because I'm in my second year of participating in a similar, though far less ambitious challenge {Around the World in 12 Books}, requiring I read 12 books over the course of the year, each set in a different country, across six continents.

"I have missed the last three books in the Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus series, largely because they have been released since I started blogging and my reading time has rarely since been my own, so I jumped at the chance to rejoin the series with Murder 101.It's been six months since Peter retired from the LAPD and he and Rina are now living in upstate New York, closer to their adult children. Peter is working for the local police force which is rarely troubled by anything more than drunken college students, while Rina has made herself at home within the community. When the body of a young coed is discovered brutally stabbed to death, Decker is the only member of the Greenbury Police with the experience to investigate. He quickly connects the dead woman to a recent theft from a crypt and, teamed with an obnoxious rookie, Tyler McAdams, Decker suddenly finds himself in the midst of a case involving stolen art, Russian assassins and international politics.I so enjoyed reconnecting with the characters of this series, I love that Kellerman has aged them in 'real time'...it has been 27 years since The Ritual Bath was first published. The children Decker and Rina share, including foster son Gabe, are now grown up and on their own, Decker's old partner Marg has left the LAPD for quieter pastures and Decker and Rina are adjusting to the changes their move has wrought.In this book Decker is partnered with Tyler McAdams, a Harvard graduate with a silver spoon in his mouth and a chip on his shoulder, who initially drives Peter crazy but eventually, with Decker's gruff guidance, proves useful.I wouldn't expect anything less from Kellerman than a well crafted mystery which requires shoe leather, rather than luck, to solve. Decker's investigation is all about following leads, face to face interviews and a bit of hard earned cop instinct. The murdered girl is the first homicide to occur in Greenbury in twenty years so it makes sense that Decker is placed in charge, and in his usual bulldog manner, Decker is determined to solve the case even when his life, and Rina's and Tyler's, are threatened.Murder 101 is another well paced, solid installment in the Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus series, which is likely nearing its conclusion, but proves that Decker isn't quite ready to give up his badge just yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNF2PWOX3K7MI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062270184#wasThisHelpful","RNF2PWOX3K7MI","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Catch by Taylor Stevens is the fourth book to feature the unusual character of Vanessa Michael Munroe.Regrouping after the events of The Doll, Munroe has been biding her time in Djibouti, Africa, working as an interpreter for a small private security company as 'Michael'. When Munroe's boss accepts a job on a freighter bound for Kenya, Leo, jealous of Michael's closeness with his wife Amber and oblivious to Michael's real gender and talents, insists she accompanies the team. Part way through the voyage, the ship is attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia but Munroe escapes with the injured freighter captain in tow. It quickly becomes obvious that the pirate's target was not the cargo, which included a secret cache of weapons, but the captain, and to save the crew Munroe must negotiate the shadowy world of piracy, Hawala and corruption.Munroe is such an intriguing character, a borderline sociopath capable of lethal violence with finely honed instincts, she is also highly intelligent, resourceful and has a prodigious talent for languages, skills which she makes good use of in The Catch.The story of The Catch is perhaps more cerebral than in previous installments. Gathering information and planning strategy is more important than Munroe's physical prowess as she scrambles to understand the motives of the pirates while nursing debilitating injuries inflicted by a vicious group of hired thugs.The weakness for me in this story is in the motive Taylor ascribes to Munroe for saving the ship and its crew. I just wasn't convinced Munroe's attachment to Amber was strong enough to risk so much for her, even given Munroe's unique sense of justice and loyalty.Though The Catch could be read as a standalone, familiarity with the unique character of Munroe lends a richness that enhances the story. As someone familiar with the series I was satisfied with this installment and I am eager to discover what Munroe's next move will be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SSTIAIEC8SUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348932#wasThisHelpful","R3SSTIAIEC8SUA","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"New Orleans Requiem is the fourth book in Don J. Donaldon's mystery series featuring chief medical examiner Andy Broussard and Kit Franklyn, a consultant psychologist for both the ME's office and the NOPD.The story opens with Andy and Kit being called to a crime scene in the New Orleans French Quarter. The body of a man has been discovered in a locker in Jackson Square, stabbed through the heart, with an eyelid removed and a newspaper propped on his chest with four scrabble letters taped to it. When a second body is found two days later with identical wounds, a newspaper and three scrabble letters, Andy and Kit fear a serial killer is stalking the town. Broussard and Kit are taken aback when what little evidence they have points to the killer being a colleague with a grudge, but with hundreds of forensic specialists in town attending the Annual American Academy of Forensic Science conference, narrowing the field of suspects isn't going to be easy.An interesting blend of police procedural and medical thriller, New Orleans Requiem is an enjoyable novel. The case at the heart of this mystery is well plotted and believable and the identity of the murderer came as a surprise. The pacing is good, with the duration of the conference providing a natural time frame in which to solve the mystery.Broussard and Franklyn are well developed characters. An affable man with a large appetite, Broussard is an experienced and well regarded ME. Kit considers Andy both a colleague and a mentor. She has good instincts and is both resourceful and intelligent. Their professional skills complement each other and they make a good team.First published in the early 1990's the absence of 'Google' and cell phones are evident in some aspects of the novel but the story doesn't feel dated. I'd recommend New Orleans Requiem to readers who enjoy procedural mysteries, especially those with a forensic focus (think Quincy, ME or CSI).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QV0OJV77OQSQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8B7EZE#wasThisHelpful","R2QV0OJV77OQSQ","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""They lived in a honey-colored house that sat hard up against the pavement of a picture-postcard Cotswolds village and stretched out beyond into three-quarters of an acre of rambling half-kempt gardens. Their mother was a beautiful hippy called Lorelei with long tangled hair and sparkling green eyes who treated her children like precious gems. Their father was a sweet gangly man called Colin, who still looked like a teenager with floppy hair and owlish round-framed glasses. They all attended the village school, they ate home-cooked meals together every night, their extended family was warm and clever, there was money for parties and new paddling pools, but not quite enough for foreign travel, but it didn't matter, because they lived in paradise.""Lisa Jewell's newest release, The House We Grew Up In, is a poignant and absorbing story about the Bird family. As children, Megan, Bethan and twins, Rory and Rhys, delighted in their mother's sense of whimsy, the kitchen walls papered with their artwork, and the annual Easter egg hunt in the garden. But as adolescence strikes, the children have less patience for their mother's eccentricities, and the family bond begins to chafe. When tragedy strikes one Easter Sunday the family is devastated and as each member struggles to make sense of it, they turn away from each other and eventually go their separate ways. Years later, the remaining Bird family members gather at the house they grew up in and are confronted by old hurts, resentments and unresolved guilt.The House We Grew Up In spans a time frame of about thirty years and shifts back and forth to reveal the Bird's past and present, unfurling a complex tale of a family fractured by suicide, betrayal, adultery and mental illness. Their childhood home, once a comfortable, cosy haven becomes the physical manifestation of the dysfunction and turmoil which affects the family.Each individual has their own secrets to tell that are teased out over the course of the novel. Jewell's characters are realistically portrayed, though their flaws, from Lorelei's obsessive hoarding to Rory's irresponsibility, are more clearly in focus. The dynamics that play out between the family, as well as various lovers and friends, are believable and observed with keen insight into the complications of these relationships.Heartfelt, provocative and powerful The House We Grew Up In is an engaging novel, well crafted by an accomplished author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLURG5KPI876/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476702993#wasThisHelpful","R3LLURG5KPI876","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From Jenny Colgan comes another delicious tale of family, love and romance in her newest release, Sweetshop of Dreams.If pressed, Rosie Hopkins will admit that she is in a bit of a rut, her career has stalled, and so it seems, has her relationship of seven years, but she cant imagine how spending six weeks in rural Derbyshire will help matters any. However her elderly Great Aunt Lilian needs help and Rosie, an auxiliary nurse, is best placed to do so. Reluctantly Rosie travels to the small village of Lipton, determined to sort out her aunts affairs and return to London, and Gerard, as quickly as possible, but as she experiences the charms of country life, changeable weather and grumpy dentists notwithstanding, Rosie slowly discovers just how sweet life could be.On her first day in Lipton, Rosie gets lost in the country side during a rainstorm, on her second she discovers her aunts sweetshop, which needs to be sold as a going concern to fund Lilians move into a nursing home, has been abandoned, and on her third she careens out of control on Lilians old bicycle, destroying a farmers vegetable patch and humiliating herself in front of a hunky farmhand and the handsome local doctor. Country life, Rosie is convinced, is not for her but as she begins to restore the sweetshop to its former glory and make friends with the locals, she begins to consider the choices she has made and reevaluate what would make her happy.Entwined with Rosies adventures in Lipton are glimpses into Lillians past as a young woman and the regrets, disappointments and tragedies that shaped her life. This goes a long way to explaining Lilians sharp tongue, and gives the story a little more depth, emphasising the novels major theme of regret over the risks not taken.Most readers of a certain age will fondly remember the sweets of their youth, my preference was for cobbers (caramel squares covered in milk chocolate) and lurid pink musk sticks, so Rosies refurbishment of Lilians sweetshop holds a great deal of nostalgic appeal. Colgans recipe additions for treats such as Coconut Ice, Peanut Brittle and Tablet (aka Scottish Fudge- which Jenny Colgan kindly shared with Bookd Out readers) are a welcome inclusion, and perfect to enjoy along with the book.An engaging and charming story with few sour notes, Sweetshop of Dreams is an enjoyable novel and a sweet treat to savour.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S8PSFKMPEYNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402281838#wasThisHelpful","R1S8PSFKMPEYNE","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""""Oh, we're such a caring school,"" the principal told me. Blah, blah. blah. Let me tell you the first thing I thought when I walked into that playground on that kindergarten orientation day was cliquey. Cliquey, cliquey, cliquey. I'm not surprised someone ended up dead. Oh, all right. I guess that's overstating it. I was a little surprised.""Big Little Lies begins with a death at Pirriwee Public School during a Trivia Night fundraiser, but the details are concealed as the narrative shifts to a period six months previously to introduce Madeline, Celeste and Jane, along with their offspring, at the Kindy orientation day.It is at this inauspicious event that Jane's son, Ziggy, is accused of bullying a classmate, Amabella, triggering a sustained campaign of hysteria by her high powered mother, Renata, to punish Ziggy for denying being at fault. Madeline, a veteran of schoolyard politics and never one to shy away from controversy, chooses to side with Jane, supported by her best friend, the beautiful and wealthy mother of twin boys, Celeste and as such declares war.While the school drama escalates in the lead up to the Trivia Night, the three main protagonists have other important concerns to deal with. Madeleine's teenage daughter from her first marriage wants to go and live with her father and his new wife, Celeste is barely holding together her veneer of perfection, and Jane is hiding a shocking secret regarding the paternity of her son. These complex characters are so perfectly formed it seems likely I could meet them at the school gate. This is unfortunately true too of the 'blonde bob' brigade, whom I am all too familiar with having endured 11 years of primary school politics (with four more still to go).There is plenty of humour in this sharply observed novel of playground alliances, 'mummy wars' and domestic crises but as Moriarty slowly strips away the social veneer to explore truths about bullying, domestic violence, betrayal and infidelity its darker heart is exposed. As the tension builds, gossip swirls, secrets are revealed, alliances shift, and lies are found out. Ultimately of course the truth prevails, and the mysteries are resolved in the stunning climax.Part noir suburban mystery, part domestic drama, Big Little Lies is compulsive reading. Thought provoking, clever, witty and wonderful, this is another wickedly brilliant novel from best selling Australian author Liane Moriarty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9RQGHTGJD88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167064#wasThisHelpful","R1J9RQGHTGJD88","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed Molly Harper's sense of fun and humour in her Jane Jameson series and Naked Werewolf series so I leapt at the opportunity to read this new stand alone novel.Better Homes and Hauntings is a paranormal romance/mystery that is set in a dilapidated haunted mansion on a private island off the coast of Newport. Crane's Nest is the ancestral home of young software billionaire Deacon Whitney and despite a history of tragedy and hauntings he decides to renovate the mansion, hiring a team of professionals including his best friend and architect, Jake, Nina, a landscaper, and professional cleaner and organiser, Cindy. The project requires them all to remain on the island during the renovation and ignore the weird vibes and frightening dreams the house seems to provoke but that grows increasingly difficult as a malevolent spirit begins to make its presence known. Deacon's cousin, Dotty is convinced that solving the mystery surrounding the death of her great-great grandmother, Catherine Whitney, will put the spirit to rest but they need to do so quickly, before history repeats itself.Harper finds a good balance between creepy ghost story and lighthearted romance in Better Homes and Hauntings. There were moments when my skin prickled with goosebumps and times when I was smiling broadly at the snarky banter between her characters.The mystery is well thought out, with missing diaries, stolen jewels and a ghostly murderer to find. Harper also integrates a real world element in the form of Nina's vengeful ex-boyfriend, intent on sabotaging her success.I though the mix of personalities worked well, the enforced isolation creating a quick and tight bond between the main characters. Two romances develop over the course of the novel, Deacon falls for Nina, while Jake is infatuated with Cindy. Both pairings are well suited and it is sweet to see them work things out.A quick, light and engaging read, fans of Harper are sure to enjoy Better Homes and Hauntings and as a rare stand alone it's a great way to test her appeal without committing to a series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFIW63W9LPTAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147670600X#wasThisHelpful","RFIW63W9LPTAD","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wonderful debut novel by Swedish author Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove had me laughing out loud, and blinking back tears.""He was a man of black and white.... Ove wanted what was right to be right, and what was wrong to be wrong.""Ove is a man who believes in order, routine and rules, he has worked hard all of his life, paid his taxes, taken care of his beloved wife and his house but now, forced into retirement and alone at 59, he no longer has any wish to continue on. He has made his peace, planned carefully for his departure, but is wholly unprepared for what follows after his new neighbours accidentally flatten his mailbox.Undaunted by Ove's inflexible opinions, gruff manner and short temper, Parveneh and her family make demands of Ove that he cannot resist. And then comes a mangy cat, a homeless teen and a man in a white shirt, and slowly, despite his best intentions, Ove begins to live again.Simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting, this is a story about love, grief, life, death and Saab's. Told with heartfelt emotion, wry insight and a sense of humour, Backman has created an endearing character, few will be able to dismiss.""It isn't what a man says that matters, it is what he does.""For all that it made me feel, I'm declaring A Man Called Ove my favourite book of the year so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKAJL0EZFT69P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IORP664#wasThisHelpful","RKAJL0EZFT69P","A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1Z3V0SOB9D9VP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Review:Overall...4.25Performance...4.50Story...4.00I enjoy a male narrator for a lot of my romance novels just because the male parts are always my favorite, but I have to say that I think Eric G. Dove is one of the best. His voice is just so smooth and deep. I love to listen to him. To make it even better, he does not make his females sound dimwitted like so many of the male narrators do. (And it's nothing against male narrators, but for a man to take on a female style voice, they tend to get breathy which a lot of the time makes the female characters sound dim-witted...Eric G. Dove does NOT have that issue.) If I ever release any of my books on audio, he will be at the top of my preferred narrator list! He has a great voice with a lot of different inflections and I love the way he narrates the Wilde men.So, this story...This story is about Cam. He's one of the twins and I love the two of them. Vaughn and Cam are close, closer even than they are to the rest of their brothers...and mind you, they all work together so as a whole, they are a close group. But I love Cam and Vaughn. The issue is in this book...someone is trying to kill Cam...oh, and yeah, Vaughn has his face too. See where this might be an issue? As a result, Cam is trying to keep this entire investigation and himself away from all his brothers. He doesn't want anyone caught in the crossfire. But when his informant that told him about the hit ends up dead, everything gets complicated.And that pulls Eva into the case. Not only is she Cam's best friend, she's also his former police partner and a homicide detective. Throughout the course of this story, their friendship morphs into more. But both Cam and Eva have issues that make a commitment between them difficult. Cam NEVER sees himself as a commitment guy and Eva knows that. She on the other hand, has this unrealistic, idealistic view of a committed relationship. What they have together works...it's just that neither of them can see the potential in that.It was a good book. I listened to the entire thing with the audio version. I did mention how yummy Eric G. Dove's voice is, right? Now the issue is...book #3 is out, but not in audio yet. Do I wait? I really don't want to because I love the Wilde brothers and am ready for another one of their stories, but I love listening to this series on audio. I think I'm just going to have to keep an eye on Audible and hope it comes out soon. (Note...this review won't post until late November, but I wrote it in early October, so that status may no longer be accurate. I'm really hoping it won't.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8OY5LTXFNXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAGYUC0#wasThisHelpful","R2U8OY5LTXFNXT","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Bright Side was absolutely one of the most beautiful, most heartbreaking, most heart wrenching, uplifting books I've read this year. I read it two months ago and it's taken me that long to be brave enough to pick up Gus (although my reviews will probably post close together...I read Bright Side in July, Gus in Sept).And if you haven't read Bright Side, you need to stop reading this review right now because it will contain spoilers...oh, and you need to go buy it because these books are FABULOUS and contain such an incredible message about how to LIVE and love life. They are both PHENOMENAL. But they need to be read together and Bright Side has to come first.So...Gus. It took me so long to start this book simply because I wasn't ready to read about Gus without Bright Side. I had to have my mourning period, too. But this book picks up the day of Bright Side's funeral...and it's just as hard to read as I thought it would be.But just like Gus is slowly healing throughout the book, I, as a reader was slowly healing, too. Just like Bright Side, this is a book about happiness, and living life to the fullest, and DO EPIC. And the entire story is just that...Epic.Gus is broken...so broken...and I'll be honest, it hurts to read about his pain. In fact about the first 25% of this book is filled with that pain. But Kate was everything to Gus...of course it's going to hurt. But slowly, Gus and his mother, and even the glimpses of Keller and his daughter show them all getting up, still sad, but learning how to move on and embrace life...just like Kate taught them.There is so much to love about this book, but at the heart is that same theme...Live. Do Epic. It may be the hardest thing you ever do, but it's worth it. Life is worth it. And that's a theme that speaks to my heart and left me with a smile on my face as I turned the final page. The conclusion...seriously, so perfect. I wanted to read it out loud to my husband but I had too much emotion clogging my throat to do that.And I probably should mention Scout, because she's a phenomenal character...broken more than a little bit, too. She has her own incredible growth throughout the story, but this book belongs to Gus...purely his. And I don't want to focus on anything but him. BUT I should note...I love what happened with Gus's mother and their family at the end...again, perfection.I adored this book just like I adored Bright Side. I don't think any story could reach the level of perfection that Bright Side did, but wow...Gus is a close second.Read them. Read them both!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E90WNR3SEB4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991140273#wasThisHelpful","R2E90WNR3SEB4D","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"y Review:I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this book which is always a worry when it comes to a second book featuring the same couple. Sometimes it's hard to maintain that same quality of story line into the second and subsequent books. For this series that was especially true just because the conflict between the two MC's was their inherent differences that kept them apart. But the authors used those differences brilliantly in this book to maintain the same style of conflict without compromising the quality and depth of commitment between these two characters. That isn't an easy balance to maintain...at all.In this book, Dylan and Avery are making their relationship work...for the most part. Dylan still has issues with wanting to protect Avery from everything, while Avery still has issues wanting to handle everything for himself. What makes this work for them is Dylan's very real commitment to making them work...and I'll admit this relationship is a bit one-sided in that willingness to compromise. I loved Dylan for that. He compromises with Avery to keep Avery happy. Although Avery makes compromises, too, a lot of his compromises are less thought out than Dylan's. Dylan makes a concerted effort day in and day out to curb his protective, alpha tendencies with Avery. Once again, I loved Dylan and his ability to see what his mate needs. He is so much why this relationship works for me as a reader. I love seeing his level of commitment.And although Avery is just as in love with Dylan as Dylan is with him, he just isn't used to thinking about someone else. As a hedgehog shifter, Avery is used to tackling everything himself. That group (pack) mentality that Dylan automatically has doesn't come into play for Avery. As a result, a lot of the time he doesn't realize just how much his actions are hurting Dylan until after the fact and then he feels awful. Avery approaches their relationship differently and while it isn't wrong, it makes things feel like Dylan is getting the short end of the relationship a lot of the time.I like watching the constant push and pull between the two of them while they try to figure out how to make this all work. Let's face it, who would consider a mating between a wolf and a hedgehog? They are wildly different and that makes their approaches to life wildly different. I thoroughly enjoy the way the authors have done that with their characters. It makes for a really interesting dichotomy.There a lot of side stories happening in the background of this book. Some of them are resolved, but several of them are not. All of them were really interesting and I'm so hoping that means we have several more books coming from this series. There are so many really interesting characters in this pack and I need all of Dylan and Avery's friends to find their HEA's too. From Lucas and the mystery happening in his life to Jaden's really messed up mate. I'm ready for another book announcement for this series. I just hope it comes really quickly. (And I don't think I could ever get tired of Avery/Dylan stories, and with the set up of Avery's PI business, they could continue on for a lot of books.)I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZ2IDYZWLRYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623800706#wasThisHelpful","R2BZ2IDYZWLRYY","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Aww, I loved getting this new look at Tom and Reese. That's my one complaint about New Adult is that the mc's tend to be so young, I'm never sure if they'll make it long-term...so I loved that we got to see more of them a little bit later in life.And it's not that everything is sunshine and roses for Tom and Reese now, either. It's definitely not. In fact, they are having some real issues. Tom is still  having a lot of the same problems in that he withdraws into himself when he's stressed. After so many years, Reese gets that about his boyfriend, but that doesn't make it any easier when Tom shuts him out. To make things even more complicated, Reese has some really exciting stuff happening in his life that Tom is missing out on because Tom is so shut down.Once again, my heart hurt for these guys, but I love the way Reese handles Tom. He gets Tom's issues and for the most part, he doesn't let those scare him away. But Tom also killed me...he should trust Reese with his issues at this point, shouldn't he? There were moments when I just wanted to shake him...mainly because he knows better. But I also get that life can get to be overwhelming and then we revert back to our old destructive methods. It just made it hard to watch sometimes.But what helped ease that ^^^ stress were Steph and Cash. I love them so much and loved that they kept popping up in this book with their irreverent love and relationship. So much about their additions to the story worked for me and it did lighten the tone a lot...which the book needed.Overall, I am so happy that Amy Jo Cousins chose to write this one. It just made me happy...at least in the end. And this quote from the book just says it all...all of the distress in the story rolled up into one sentence.""Because it was hard to see yourself as the hero in someone elses storywhen you knew you werent worthy of it.""So many feels.

"My Review:Okay, Andrew is not Jenna's step-brother, but I think he's close enough that this could fall under that step-brother trope. I haven't read that trope yet, but I've been fascinated by it so this was a good introduction to it.Andrew came to live with Jenna's family when he was 16 and she was 14. He was told then that she was off-limits and he was so grateful to this family that's taken him in, he's tried to respect that this whole time...with one weekend where he slipped in college. Both he and Jenna agreed then that it was a mistake. She realized he didn't want to risk his new family for her.Since then, he's gone on to become a NHL superstar...and she's languishing in an accounting firm with a boring accounting boyfriend. This Christmas is the first real time they've spent together since that fateful weekend in college because Jenna has gotten very good at avoiding Andrew, knowing she can never have him.I thought this was a great story. I thoroughly enjoyed the way the author set up the beginning of the story with the family at Christmas with everyone home. That worked for me and I found the backstory between Andrew and Jenna as completely enjoyable and believable. My only real complaint is that I would have liked to have seen more of the hockey aspect...just because I love the Aces team. But there are glimpses of them. As it is the book is a great holiday read with a touch of our beloved hockey team added to the end.And I just LOVED the way that everything played out in the end. All the reactions were so perfect. I was just grinning ear to ear when the book finished because of the perfect way everything was finished out. I loved the chemistry between Jenna and Andrew and it made for an incredible story. And the overall story was a good one. And now I can definitively say...I like this trope.I highly recommend both this book and this series. It's a good one...especially if you love hockey...and in the case of this novella...a good holiday read.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377V4AKOHDS1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNE45JA#wasThisHelpful","R377V4AKOHDS1T","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:To me, this was a book that got better as it got closer to the end. This was a book about the lives of the rich and famous...kind of. Chelsea runs amazingly gorgeous resorts. Rafe buys those gorgeous resorts and that's how their paths cross just as Chelsea's life is falling apart. But despite the turmoil, they are combustible together and that creates a really sexy story.I enjoyed that set-up of the hotels. The memos between Chelsea and her assistant were hilarious and I could see so many of them actually happening. But I also really loved the way the book began. Illicit sex with a Santa...just the visuals had me giggling although it was a pretty sexy scene. Talk about creative. Who would ever look at a Santa suit and think, ""this could make a great sex scene""? LOL. I loved that completely unexpected twist.And I will admit, I was almost as enamored with the scenery as I was with the story. Samanthe Beck created some really gorgeous settings with these resort hotels...esp. the one in Maui. But the limo scenes were *almost* as good...hehe. And I did love the twist at the end that required Nick to get involved...I'm being really vague there because I don't want any spoilers, but that entire set-up just really worked for me emotionally.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It takes place during the holidays, but in exotic locales so it has a holiday vacation kind of vibe to it. I loved the chemistry between the two main characters and the set up/background for each of them within the hotels. They each had complicated backstories which added a lot of depth to the emotions of the story. I liked and enjoyed it.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R188WZBEWO0UKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151U7X3U#wasThisHelpful","R188WZBEWO0UKR","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Overall.... 4.25Performance... 4.25Story.... 4.25I'll admit, I haven't read a whole lot of Tonya Burrows, but every time I finish one of her books, I ask myself why?? I really, really enjoyed this story. I do love second chance tropes and this one is a good one.Jude was a Marine under Libby's father's command. Libby's father NEVER liked him...never thought he was good enough for Libby. So, 8 years ago, when Jude asked Libby to marry him, her father shut it down...something that Libby is clueless about. She still has no idea why Jude cheated and dumped her two days after asking her to marry him...and she's never quite recovered.Neither has Jude. Libby is the one who got away. The love of his life. Now, he just does as little as he can to get through the day. To his brothers, who don't know what happened then, he's the screw up of the family.But now Libby's father comes to him for help. Since they broke up 8 years ago, Jude and his brothers have started Wilde Security and are the best in the business in providing personal security. Libby's father may not like him, but he knows Jude would do everything he could to protect her, so when a stalker threatens her, Libby's father hires Jude to protect her.I loved this story. The story had just the right amount of suspense in it, but the over-riding story is this unfinished love story between Jude and Libby. I loved them together and their back-story broke my heart, especially since it's so obvious that their past broke both of them. The added dimensions of Jude's brothers gave so much more to this story. I can't wait to keep reading more of the series.I also really enjoyed this author. He has a really smooth and polished voice that was just nice to listen to. I definitely recommend the author, the narrator, and this first book in the series. A great start. Luckily, I already have book #2 loaded onto my iPod, so I'm ready to get started on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HYA587WMYBC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6T6CKE#wasThisHelpful","R2HYA587WMYBC2","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Once upon a time, I really devoured menage stories, but then I discovered the joys of reading m/m and my menage obsession kind of fell by the wayside. Not any more. This book reminded me just why I've always loved menage stories so much. OMG, there was so, so, so much to love about this book. And I really did love every single bit of it.This book is about an NFL football team in Alabama that's trying to get off the ground. As a result, it has a core group of misfits trying to build a cohesive team. Among those are Cass and Beau, two best friends who come to the team as a package deal, after a YouTube debacle showing them having sex with a woman at the same time. Also new to the team is Marian. She's an assistant coach thrilled to have her chance at coaching...finally. She's not going to blow this chance by getting involved with the two most notorious playboys in the NFL.But you know, this is erotic romance...that isn't going to fly for long. As with most menages, you have to go into reading a book like this willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief. (For me, that came from the whole female coach screwing her players and that's not a HUGE issue, especially since they are still at camp when the teams are still being settled.)What made this work for me truly was Beau's character. I loved how he's the one with the really shady history in the NFL, but he's really the voice of reason in this threesome now. He's the one who observes, who sees, who knows what the other two need...even before they know it. Personally, I think a lot of that comes from what he's been through and having to face up to his own demons. He's learned to be analytical about stuff, especially the hard stuff.And you know this book is going to be sexy. Wow, Samantha Kane brought her A-game for the sex scenes in this book. So hot! And that final scene had to be seriously tough to negotiate in her head...I mean really, that is a LOT of body parts to direct through a scene. But for me, it worked...although be warned...if you have issues with a group dynamic, you might have issues with the way the story goes. I personally liked that twist to the story line and am excited to see how all that plays out in consequential books to come in the series.Overall, I really liked it. I loved Beau and Cass and the new ways they find to connect in this book and how Marian's influence changes the dynamic between the two of them, too, especially since they've been together for a few years. I liked the whole story of how the team is floundering to find their foothold and how all these pieces will come together to make it work. And I like the sexy times in the book...those worked really, really well.Note: At the time of writing this review (Nov 12, 2015) the book was on sale for $.99...serious bargain. Buy it if you like menage/sports stories. You won't regret it.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B4EN3W4SGV3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OWZS#wasThisHelpful","R1B4EN3W4SGV3X","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This book...I sat on my couch reading it one Sunday morning with my husband sitting beside me. I drove him crazy raving about just how good and creative this book is that entire morning. I loved it so much.Prophesy is a fictional little town in Texas that has basically been built around the Prophesy Boot Company. Every generation there is a prophesy boot maker who has the gift to make the boots. For this generation that person is Laney, but she doesn't want to stay in Prophesy...she doesn't want to accept her gift. There's too much risk involved if she stays in one place. She will either get hurt or will hurt someone she loves...neither are outcomes that Laney is willing to risk. But despite everything, she does love Prophesy and the boot company and Whit, the man who's health is failing but is the current boot maker.On the flip side of Laney is Cal. He came home from the Army and doesn't plan to leave Prophesy again. Whit is his dad and they both suffered when Laney took off. Cal doesn't trust her to stay this time, but the town is counting on her. He has to convince her...for the good of the town and the legacy of the boot company.This book was so incredibly creative. The boot company is like any other custom boot company, but every year there is a lottery for twelve people to get the special prophesy boots. The legend goes that those boots are magic/blessed and the owner will find their one true love and live happily ever after. That's the gift Laney refuses to accept. When she was apprenticing under Whit, trying to channel that gift went very wrong. She won't hurt anyone else ever again. It terrifies her. And Cal terrifies her even more.Truly this is a book about the love of cowboy boots as much as it is about the love affair between these two people. I live in Texas and have some gorgeous cowboy boots that I love. Reading this book, I could see every aspect of the construction of the boots. The author's descriptions of the boots and the process used to create them was incredibly fascinating. I'm lucky that my small West Texas town has a custom boot-maker in town. I fully plan to visit his shop this week. I'm enamored with the process now and want to walk into the store, inhaling that distinctive smell of leather and peruse the rows filled with hand-tooled vamps and inlaid designs.I just loved the book. Part of that is because this book featured a huge symbol of Texas, my home, in the boots and the author made me love them even more. But mainly, I loved this book because I fell in love with Laney and Cal. I wanted to see them get their HEA after so many years apart. I hate that they both got their hearts broken when Laney ran before, but that's what makes second chance love stories so good. Those deep emotions are still there. The trust just has to be rebuilt and the way that Kelsey Browning crafted this story, she created a wonderful second chance at love that I could cheer for.I enjoyed it thoroughly, even though there were a few tears along the way. It was a beautiful story and I'm looking forward to more in the series.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149K0O0KO7FYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163PV8E2#wasThisHelpful","R149K0O0KO7FYI","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Any book that starts with 10-foot snow penises, you know it's going to be a fun one. This book had so much going for it and I really enjoyed reading it.While Paul is the character we've really known from the other books, it's really Kyle who steals the show in this book. He's an awesome character and I challenge anyone to read this book and not fall in love with him. Really, Paul never had a chance in resisting him.But Paul's character is interesting too...just in that on the surface he's so put together, but he's really a mess. I loved Corrinne and how she kept pushing the holiday movies onto Kyle so he could understand Paul's hang-ups and how Kyle just didn't get it...until the end and then just like Kyle, my heart broke for Paul. Seriously, his family situation is heartbreaking. Paul needs Kyle...age difference aside. He needs someone who's that giving and full of the ability to care with every part of himself.Because like I said before...Kyle was incredible. He has such an amazing heart...from his twin sister to Paul's neighbor, Kyle is a caretaker and I loved him so much for it. He didn't mind losing sleep or what he had to do. And then hearing how he came to doing his job...gah...I LOVED this character. And note...I adore the fact that he's a toppy Twink who's 13 years younger than Paul. Those differences worked for me just in that people underestimate who Kyle is so much.The book had a ton of emotion...love and acceptance and concern in Kyle's corner; heartbreak and desolation and hope in Paul's corner. But there is an amazing cast of supporting characters who make this story even richer. All of these books have had a seasonal fundraiser. The Winter Wonderland aspect of this one was incredible. I could envision all the aspects of it and want to come visit it, too.Heidi Cullinan needs to write a follow-up novella to this one though. I want to see Paul and Kyle redo Kyle's grandparents cottage. That would be such a fantastic little side story and it would allow us to revisit how the town is progressing with the Winter Wonderland year round.Every single book in this series has been great. They all work amazingly well as stand-alones, but they've each been incredibly sweet and heartwarming. Perfect reads for the holiday season and I definitely recommend them all.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCT4CCHQWBVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTT9SR8#wasThisHelpful","R2DCT4CCHQWBVW","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This is not a very long book, but it's a fabulous, complete story with so much depth and romance and emotion, I never felt like it was lacking anything.This book is about two men who work together. Bo is from El Paso and is an executive for a large construction company. Travis is from Austin and helps develop environmental friendly projects. They've worked together for a few months in El Paso. Although Travis is extremely attracted to Bo, he's never seen any sign that Bo is gay. That's because Bo is deeply in the closet. His Catholic family wouldn't understand and he's never met anyone who was worth risking his family over.The two guys meet on a blind date and things explode from there. Seriously, I cannot convey to you just how much I loved this story. Bo is this big alpha who is used to being in charge, but to a certain extent so is Travis. They are both bigger than life characters and their chemistry reflects that. I loved the two of them together. Bo is pure Texas...red beef and cowboy boots. Travis is pure Austin...vegan and bicycle rides across town.On paper they are so different, but they mesh so well. I'm from Texas and I could relate to both these guys so well because I know these guys. Irene Preston has crafted a gorgeous romantic story here that struck all my hot notes. The absolute best scene in the book is Bo firing up the grill for...corn, and thinking about how long it's been since he had meat. I loved him and how he's actually okay with that because it makes Travis happy. In fact they are both about compromises to make their relationship work. For two alphas that isn't the easiest thing to do, but it made me believe so much in the health of their relationship.This book was amazing. I highly recommend it and plan on re-reading it again. If you like your guys alpha with a side of sweet and sexy Texan, you're going to like this one, too.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCA3EG8LS4O1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155X4J8K#wasThisHelpful","RCA3EG8LS4O1Y","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I enjoyed this story. It's a sweet, romantic, holiday romance with a touch of emotion with everything that these characters are going through. And both these guys are going through a lot.For Cole, he was in the process of going on a romantic vacation with his boyfriend when he got dumped at the airport. The problem...he met his boyfriend when he was on the rebound. Their relationship was never given a real chance because his boyfriend wasn't over the ex.So when things start up with Owen, Cole knows he's on the rebound. None of this is real or lasting. Cole is the one who's most visible vulnerable in this story. But Owen is dealing with a lot too. He has taken over his father's bar when his father fell into ill health. The issue is his dad never wanted to give up running the bar.Owen is such a good guy. He literally sees Cole upset and wants to fix things for him. That's what he does...he steps up and takes care of the people around him. I loved that about him.But I also love the undeniable chemistry and passion between these two men. They both agree that Cole isn't in a place to do anything besides be friends, but they just can't help themselves.I truly just enjoyed reading this book. I loved the set-up with the bar setting and the issues with Owen's father. It all just really worked for me. Once I started, I didn't want to set it down. It's a happy book, even with the angsty-sad undertones. I enjoyed it... a LOT!

"My Review:I have never read this author before, but she has a new fan. I loved this book so much.Alex is a single mom who in a single week has had all her dreams threatened. She's been on the five-year savings plan to buy the bakery she works at, but suddenly the owner has to sell early. And her one joy in life is her adoptive daughter...who's supposed birth father has shown up to claim paternity.Hayden is a hard-working multi-millionaire. He's spent his life trying to make up for a mistake he made when he was too young. So when a woman comes to him to tell him that she gave their baby up for adoption 6 years ago, he plans to become a father to that little girl...without much thought of what it will do to the woman who's adopted and loved her for the last 6 years. But it's not that Hayden is unfeeling...far from it. It's just he has to be part of his child's life, but his life is elsewhere. He's very cognizant to the fact that both mother and child will need visitation to make this transition work. What he doesn't count on is falling as much for the mother as he does the child.Seriously, this was just the perfect holiday romance. The story set-up was perfect and heartwarming. Tons of heartstrings being tugged in the middle of incredible small town picturesque life and snowfall. No one in this book is the bad guy. It's so easy to see from all sides of it, which made my heart twist for the characters just that much more.I loved the backstory between the three ""sisters"" and their three daughters. I need to go back and read book #1 now and am anxiously awaiting #3. It's just a great feel-good book and set within the middle of the Christmas season, it's one that I can definitely recommend to make you feel happier and better as you go into the magic that is the holidays. The romance is phenomenal in the middle of this heart wrenching conflict.And let's just take a moment to note the perfection that is that cover. Honestly in my viewpoint, this is simply the PERFECT holiday cover. I love it so, so much. Everything about it...the snow, the couple where he's carrying her, the colors.

"My Review:Overall: 4.5Performance: 4.5Story: 4.5I'll admit, this is my first exposure to this series. I own several of the books, but I haven't read them yet, but I got a deal on the audio for this one so I jumped it in line for my ""reading"" of the series. I liked it.For me, Frankie's character made this book. She's so beautifully vulnerable and in need of love. I don't know how much of that was done so perfectly by the narrator, Renee' Raudman, and how much of it was because of phenomenal writing by Marina Adair, but I loved how Nick really saw Frankie. He saw her pain and needs and felt drawn to take care of her. I love a protective alpha type and he was incredibly perfect in this role. And poor Frankie...I challenge you to read this book and not feel for the poor girl. She's spent her life not being good enough and always being the one to sacrifice for her family. I wanted to jump into the book and tell off her entire family from her grandfather to her brothers because they are all so clueless. All of them, except Nick. He knows the truth of how much she's been hurt and just wants to keep that from ever happening again. That's why it's so devastating with what happens at the black moment in the book. Seriously, my heart aches for her character.And I do love Nick. He's trying and yes, he screws up. He's human, but it's not his fault that he truly doesn't get how awful Frankie's family is to her, especially at the beginning. (I'm assuming the events leading up to Frankie being fired from the family vineyard happened in book #2 because it was a significant thing that happened off the page in this book.) I thought the chemistry and want between the two was perfect. Nick has his own vulnerable moments just because Frankie is so naturally closed off and defensive. She's not one to let down her walls...she's learned the hard way how to protect herself. But Nick knows that about her so he's willing (for the most part) to put the work into her as they grow closer together. They both want one another, but there's so much standing in their way with their own pasts and the details of the conflict between their two families. Working, living, and loving together isn't going to come easy.I enjoyed the family/vineyard setting for this book. That all worked for me. In fact, I'm ready to dig into the rest of the series.I love Renee Raudman as a narrator. She has such an incredible range, and this series is no exception to how well she does voices. My problem in this book was that I listened to her narrate a whole other (urban fantasy) series and her voice took me back to that book, so it was hard to adjust to listen to her in this book and place myself mentally into this setting rather than the other. BUT that's a personal thing for me...the problem when you listen to so many audiobooks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXXA1JQDPHN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848134#wasThisHelpful","R2AXXA1JQDPHN3","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This story isn't really long, but I didn't find it lacking at all. In fact, it was a sweet, romantic holiday story that left me with a smile on my face. (I always like that when it happens.)The book features a curmudgeonly lumberjack and a nerdy librarian...and that was such an amazing combination.Simon has spent years trying to stay away from people. He's good living in his little cabin with little or no outside communication. Despite his best efforts, though, he's made an impression on this small town. They understand he doesn't want to be messed with, but he's got their love and loyalty regardless just because of all his random acts of kindness that he thinks no one has noticed. They have and they love him, which made him such a great hero for this book. He's truly a good guy. He's just had a rough history which has left its scars.Adam has noticed how much the town loves Simon, too, and he's just as smitten. Unfortunately, the grumpy lumberjack has never shown any inkling of that same interest. But Simon is just really good at hiding his emotions. He's lonely, but determined that he's meant to live his life alone, as a recluse. Seriously, how could you not root for a guy like this to find someone to spend his life happy with. Luckily, the author saw that need, too.The book is sweet and romantic, with a conveniently placed snowstorm that leaves Adam stuck at Simon's cabin. It worked and the story made me smile.

"My Review:This is the second book of the series that's centered around the Celestial Springs Beauty Salon. Mom's name is Celestial Springs (she's a bit of a hippie) and her girls are named Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Summer was the heroine in the first book. Autumn is the heroine in this book.Autumn takes after her dad (who she never remembers being around). She has a bit of wanderlust which is a problem for Louie...the guy she's been involved with on and off over the years. Louie is a cop firmly entrenched in this town. He never plans to leave. Autumn is counting the days until she can leave. There's no way they can EVER work, although they both have definite feelings about the other.Autumn is a hard character to love. Despite the history she hints at, she's just so immature. I had a hard time with her and her attitude a lot of the time. On the other hand, I loved Louie. There are hints about Louie's depths in that he checks on Autumn's family and mom, even when she's not in town (which is most the time). He's also very cognizant that getting involved with a cop isn't the easiest thing. He works at a very dangerous job.And I loved the details that Louie's job added to the story...from his K9 partner to his help with Autumn's brush with illegal activities, I liked those little moments where we got to see more of his cop side.So a bit up and down, but this book was incredibly readable. I was entertained and never once thought about setting the book down. I personally didn't connect with Autumn's character, but overall, I still enjoyed the book. But it will be interesting to see what happens in book #3. Winter is another difficult character...older than Autumn by 10 years and she's a bit icy. It will be interesting to see the man who manages to melt her heart.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZB5SDPJ69YP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I2B45U#wasThisHelpful","R34ZB5SDPJ69YP","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I've read one other book out of this series, but honestly I hadn't remembered that until I went back and checked. I will tell you though, I haven't read the majority of this series. That hurt me when it came to reading this book. There were a LOT of group scenes with all the previous characters. I hated those sections of the book just because there were too many characters for me to keep track of who was who...because I haven't read most the other books. BUT the rest of this book was brilliant and I loved it so much.Harper is not a person who deals with stress well...being dumped by her fiance three months before their wedding after years together was a bit stressful. So she took off to Nashville for the weekend of the original wedding date...and met Liam. They immediately connected and despite that neither of them make a habit of one night stands, hooked up the night they met.I really enjoyed this book a lot. Harper lives in a small, judgmental town. But surprisingly enough she has ties to Liam's life that neither realized before. But that doesn't mean that their lives mesh...he's a rising superstar in the music world, but that has so many obstacles. While I loved how all-in Liam is in this relationship, I couldn't help but have my heart twist a little bit for the issues Harper faces. Signing up to be involved in his crazy life is not for the faint of heart. He's a gorgeous superstar...women want him and throw themselves at him constantly. They'd be thrilled if Harper just disappeared off the face of the earth. That isn't an easy thing, no matter how good of a guy he is or how deep their emotions for each other are.I liked it. I was in the hair salon at the 90% point of reading it and I kept shushing my hairdresser, so I could find out how Liam and Harper were going to sort out this mess. I definitely recommend this one. It was just a pure joy to read and I couldn't read it fast enough, because I had to know how they got to their HEA...I needed that for both Liam and Harper. Their chemistry made their love at first sight completely believable. And I LOVED the musical aspects in the book especially the song lyrics and writing that just enhanced the already beautiful love story.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S14HTMN6MU37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455565105#wasThisHelpful","R2S14HTMN6MU37","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Okay, this is a story that astounded me in just how creative and good it really was. I LOVED this story. Wow...so creative. HUGE, GIGANTIC KUDOS to Jen Frederick for this incredible story.Okay...so this story features an agoraphobic heroine. Yeah, you heard that right...she's terrified of leaving her apartment. To the point that she will have a panic attack, throw up, and pass out if she tries. BUT she has a very good reason for that...someone is terrorizing her. After three years, her cousin is tired of it and hires Jake's company to find her stalker and protect her.But what Jake does is fall in love with her. See, Jake is a former Army Ranger who lost both his left arm and leg in Afghanistan. He knows a bit about the long-term effects of PTSD. As a result, he can see Natalie for who she really is...not just her sickness. In the same way, she sees him as perfection incarnate despite his lost limbs. They're perfect together...maybe someday they'll be able to be in the same room together.Do you see it now? Why this book is so brilliant? It's just so unlikely that this relationship could ever work, but Jen Frederick weaves it incredibly well. Not only is their romance believable, but it's also beautiful and hope-filled. I loved these two together. They really are perfect for one another. When no one else believes in Natalie, Jake does. He sees her strength and the fact of the matter is...even if she never gets better, he can live with that because he loves her unconditionally.I loved this book. I thought it was brilliant and completely creative. I applaud Jen Frederick for writing it and making the chemistry between the two leap off the page. From the moment I started reading it, it was obvious that this book was something special and I barely put it down until I hit the final page. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!Note: while I loved this book and story, that cover is just dismal. Ugh...why, why, why? There could have been so much done to create a cover just as attractive as the story.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCLW73IX0RLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947556#wasThisHelpful","R2SCLW73IX0RLI","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Quickie Review:This is a quick, easy friends to lovers romance that embraces the holiday season. In this story, Erica and Andy have been best friends for over 20 years...through each of their marriages and divorces. They do everything together except sleep together. But Andy is ready to change that and thinks the holiday season may be the perfect time to do so.The problem...Erica hates Christmas. In fact, Erica is the epitome of practical. Honestly, she really doesn't believe in magic anymore...certainly not something as fanciful as true love. Andy thinks he can use the holidays to keep Erica off-balance, but the outcome isn't what either of them expect. But in the end, it turns out even better.I'm a sucker for friends to lovers stories and this one was fun just because Erica is so darn practical...she doesn't see what's right in front of her. It was sweet and light. It had enough holiday background/setting that it would be perfect read for this really busy holiday season, just to get you in the mood. If you only have an hour or so to read a story, this is a good choice.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PJD1R17L622/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8FOLO4#wasThisHelpful","R24PJD1R17L622","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:From the moment the story begins, you know that Trevor has a death sentence hanging over him. He's in the last stages of kidney failure and after 7 years on the transplant list, his hopes are pretty much gone. Now it's just a matter of deciding when to stop dialysis.Even though he's lived with this for 7 years, on the outside, he looks like a normal, healthy guy. Yeah, he gets tired faster, but he's worked hard to stay in optimum health. So when he meets Marc in a hotel during a blizzard, Marc has no idea that anything is wrong with him.This is definitely an insta-lust story, but I really liked how L.C. Chase wrote it. It seemed really believable. For Trevor, this is his last chance at a human connection...ever. They're in a blizzard. It's a one-night thing. What can it harm? For Marc, he's simply lonely. He let his mother's acid in his life ruin his ability to connect...with anyone. But after a talk with his personal assistant Kate right before leaving the office, he's suddenly questioning how he goes about his life. His attraction to Trevor definitely helps that introspection.For both these guys, this is one night...a freak storm...a situation that will never happen again. Neither is willing to pass that up. But then they connect and it's so much more. They both realize that quickly and that's where the story really begins.There was so much to love about this book. Of course, my heart broke for Trevor. At only 39, he should still have so much life left to live, but he doesn't. But then there's Marc, who has all the time in the world, but he chooses not to live his life to the fullest...or in any way. They each really, really need the other and watching them discover that makes for a gorgeous story.I also really loved the artistic aspect of the story. Trevor is a full-time artist who has earned quite a bit of acclaim. Once upon a time, Marc dreamed of being an artist, but stopped painting when he had his fallout with his mother. From that moment on, all his decisions have been made to try to make her proud of him. He's a lawyer, who built an art studio onto his house, but can't even step foot into it because denying that part of himself hurts so much.Like I said...so much to love. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. It was emotional and riveting. From the time I started it, I didn't put it down again until I hit the final page. I highly recommend it.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3061EQ3O2BMEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626493405#wasThisHelpful","R3061EQ3O2BMEZ","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Every time I start a new Molly Harper I get a little thrill just because I'm laughing almost immediately. I forget how much I love her sarcastic sense of humor that comes through her books, but I think with this novella, I have a new favorite. I loved this story.I think most of that is just because I love Andrea and Dick Cheney so much. Dick...gah...I think I could read books featuring him all day long. He's this completely irreverent ""character"" of a person, but underneath those obnoxious T-shirts and irrepressible flirting is a guy who has a heart of gold. And that's why this book was so good...because his heart belongs to Andrea, so he doesn't take it well when she's been hurt on her job working as one of the Counsel's most highly requested human blood donors.Andrea doesn't really get how much Dick likes her and how much of a heart the guy really has until this book begins. First there's the emotional upheaval of Mr. Wainwright...one of the last of Dick's family line and then she gets hurt. For the first time ever, she gets to see the real man behind the sarcasm and that made this book so good.I just really, really loved it. It wasn't a very long book, but it was completely emotionally satisfying. This one definitely gets catalogued under my list of Molly Harper's favorites. (And a huge thank you to Molly Harper for listening to your fans and giving us Dick's story...I love him even more now.)If you couldn't tell, my advice...read this book. And if you've never read any of Molly Harper's books, this is a GREAT place to start because it gives you a good view of her humor and writing style. I think you'll find yourself as a new fan!!I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QPOE9T7WEQMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCI656#wasThisHelpful","R1QPOE9T7WEQMP","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Aw, this was a good story. Jane's life is kind of in shambles. In the last year, she's gotten divorced from her cheating ex. While he's moved on with his mistress, Jane is struggling not to live in pjs whenever at home with her 5 yo daughter. Her one joy is her dance classes, but registration is down which means her very meager income is down. But it's the holidays and she's trying to maintain a happy face while helping one of her sisters navigate planning her wedding. Her father also died this year, so there's some emotional turmoil on that front for the whole family.Henry doesn't understand close families or why he's back in this small town that was the site of every emotional black point in his life. But his twin sister is in ill health and he has to help her. He's just trying not to sink into the black hole that is this gossiping, nosy small town. They never managed to help him or his sister growing up with their irrational, drunk mother. He doesn't want them in his business now. He HATES that he has to be back here now. The one bright point to this visit is getting to see Jane, his teenage crush.I do like this series. Regardless of Henry's black feelings for this small town, I love this little town. I also loved that he ended up writing a travel article about the town which enabled him to see it with more objective eyes, too. There is a lot of emotional upheaval in this book. My heart hurt for what Jane is going through with her jerk of an ex...I HATE how much he continues to hurt her. But my heart also broke for Henry and Ivy and the things they went through growing up. Those reminiscent scenes were so painful and Henry's very real physical reaction to thinking of them even after so many years shows just how truly awful they were. The author did an incredible job with his mental anguish.I love all the businesses the author has established through this series. I can see them all so clearly in my mind and want to visit them...along with the festivals and the orchard. Really, Olivia Miles is an excellent author and this book was a great addition to the series. I love this little town of Briar Creek. I'd move there in a heartbeat if I could and the thought of even visiting throughout the holidays sounds like heaven. Luckily, I have the book which is *almost* as good as a real visit (you know, if it was a real town, not a fictional one.)I definitely recommend this book.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4CST9RD2B5TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3E76YW#wasThisHelpful","R4CST9RD2B5TO","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Confession...when I went to set up this review on my blog, I was shocked to see that this book is #8 in a series. But upon further investigation, I think that's kind of misleading. Besides the legal setting, I don't see any connection between this book and the other 7 books in the series. You most certainly will not miss anything if you haven't read the other books. I haven't read them and LOVED every single minute of reading this book.This book had the most epic and unexpected prologue ever. It's a scene from the day that Leary starts at a law firm right after graduating law school. The owner and reclusive, legendary owner of the law firm meets with Leary....something that simply isn't done and what she tells Leary changes everything about Leary's life. Then the book begins and the reader gets to see how Leary had taken this advice. Whoa. I loved this. Talk about empowering a woman to embrace who she is.This book is fabulous just in that Leary is such an amazingly strong character. She's awesome...but she definitely meets her match with Reeve. I loved the two of them together. She's such a strong character, but he didn't let that intimidate him at all which just fascinated her. Most guys don't know how to handle her and the fact that he does turns her on and leads to some great explosively sexy scenes.This book was so intelligent. I enjoyed reading it so much. It was one of those books where I read with a smile on my face almost the entire time...until that gut-wrenching black moment which Sawyer Bennett wrote brilliantly.But not only was it an enjoyable read, it was so hot and sexy, and it had a great sub-plot in the case that these two lawyers are working on opposite sides of. Then there was Ford in the background. Wow, I love him and really hope Sawyer Bennett plans a story for him someday soon.Going into this book, I would expect the ""trial"" scenes to be a bit more dry, but they were just as interesting and entertaining as the romance. It all just really worked and created a great cohesively, amazing book that I loved every minute of reading. And believe me, I read LATE into the night because I couldn't put it down. It was just one of those books. I HIGHLY recommend it!I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C84JJS4N9ZDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947904#wasThisHelpful","R1C84JJS4N9ZDH","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This book had a different feel than the other books in this series. Damian is deep undercover and has spent years doing that. At this point, he connects with his Damian (criminal) persona much more than his Parker (Marshal) persona. He's honestly been doing it too long and is *kind of* aware of that. But it's not until he meets Tabitha that it really becomes apparent. He needs to get out of this business.The problem is...Tabitha is up to her neck in criminal activities and could be on her way to jail soon. BUT she's stuck because her ex is blackmailing her with her brother's life. If she doesn't cooperate and provide Joey with a place to deal (the hotel where she's an assistant mgr) then her brother will be set up to go back to jail for his dealing history.Because of the criminal setting of this book, it had a much grittier feel than normal. Both Tabitha and Damian are up to their necks with drug-dealing thugs and illegal activities. It's a balancing act and neither realizes how the other one plays into it all, so neither can be completely upfront about anything besides their criminal activity...which they both know about.It was an interesting book, definitely written to Mandy Baxter's former high standard that she's set for this series. Personally, I rated it just slightly lower than the other books simply because I didn't care for the deep criminal aspect of it. Even though this is a Marshal's book, I like a little light with my dark and there wasn't much light in this book. Even though there were incredibly sexy times between Tabitha and Damian (and I mean really sexy...like steam the page up sexy), all those events took place in the middle of high stress where they more often than not got interrupted. But like I said, that was simply a personal preference for what I like to read.It was a well-written, smart book. I liked the setup with Tabitha as a hotel manager. It was interesting getting a glimpse into her world. I also thought that Mandy Baxter did an incredible job showing the stress of undercover officers are under on a daily basis and how hard that is to do long-term.Overall, it was another great installment to the Marshal's series.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB03V8SFGMGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1420134833#wasThisHelpful","RHB03V8SFGMGP","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I wasn't sure I would like this book when it first began. At the beginning of the story, Kyle was still convinced that he'd never get over his love for Olivia, who married his half-brother. And Lourdes was engaged, although in a bad place with her relationship. Hmm, they both were in love with other people...how is this going to work? But I love that they developed a friendship first...friends to lovers always works for me.Whiskey Creek in the winter. I liked it. I liked the set of circumstances that threw Lourdes and Kyle into living together. I also really liked how comfortable Lourdes is with inserting herself into Kyle's life. She's been really knocked down by the events in her life lately, but I love that being with Kyle you can see the glimmers of that old confident Lourdes that made it to the top of the charts.There's a lot going on in this story...as there is in most the Whiskey Creek stories. Kyle is dealing with the spiraling emotional breakdown of his ex, who he's still tied to by family and legal obligations. I almost hated how nice of a guy Kyle was with Noelle. He really went too far letting her walk all over him. I had a hard time with how little he stood up for himself, even when things began to implode...he still was protecting her to an extent when he shouldn't be anymore.But there's also the wedding between Riley and Phoenix...my favorite couple in the Whiskey Creek series. They didn't play a huge part in this book, but I loved that we got to see their special moment, because I love them so much.It was also interesting to see Lourdes life as she's working to rebuild her music career and how her manager and her involvement or lack of one with him affects her future success.And in between all that were the perfect little Christmas vignettes...from the chopping down the Christmas tree and trimming it to the Victorian charity event. It made for such a beautiful, fun setting for the story.Overall, this was just another fun installment to the Whiskey Creek series. I recommend any book in the series. They are all good. You can read any of the books alone, but the entire series is phenomenal.Now the only single person left in their little crew of friends is Baxter...and he has finally come back home. Please, Brenda Novak, I'm begging you...please tell Baxter's story. He's earned his HEA, too, and I want to read about the guy who finally catches his heart and sweeps him off his feet.

"My Review:Although I have a couple of Kim Amos books in my TBR pile, this is the first time I've read one of her stories. I'm not so sure this was the best place to start just because Casey is not an easy character to love.Casey is very rigid with her control of everything to the detriment of...well, everything. She's not happy and knows that she needs to loosen up. She's even set out with a plan to do that...create a new Casey. But the way she approaches new Casey is very much old Casey. She has a plan...a list...a guideline...and, again a long list of rules about how she can become less rigid. Yeah, you can see how that's going to work out for her. It's not. And that was probably my biggest issue with her. She's not dumb, but the way she approaches fixing her life is. It simply doesn't make sense, and that's why I really had a hard time with loving her. There's no flexibility there.On the other hand, I love Abe. He has his own set of rules. He's a monogamous womanizer. He can have the same woman in his bed for a set period of time, but once she hits 90 days, she's gone. After he has a brush with his mortality, he realizes that this isn't the way he wants to live the rest of his life. So he sets about changing his approach with Casey.There were lots of things going for this book...*I loved the firefighter aspects of it. Those scenes were dynamic and interesting from the camaraderie of the firefighters to them actually fighting fires. I loved all those scenes within the book.*Casey works at a tutoring place that caters to children that need help. I loved getting the glimpses inside this business and the young 10 yo (Carter, I think was his name) just broke my heart. That story was so well-done. I fell in love with that kid right along with Casey. I loved how she connected with him. Again some great scenes especially as they were ferreting out his problems...great imagery and writing.*The small town and the Knots and Bolts girls. There were some interesting scenes here too, but in these I felt like I was missing a lot because I haven't read the previous stories. These women were obviously the heroines of those stories.*Dave & Quinn...um, yeah, I'm ready for their story. I liked them a LOT!I did have one other issue with this book, and this is completely a personal preference. I like a lot of action on the page, but these characters spent a lot of time in their heads or having sex. I felt like there wasn't a whole lot of meat to the actual romance because of that. It did get better with the climax and final scenes, but overall I wanted more actual dialogue among the characters and less talk within their heads...especially Casey's who got to be a bit repetitive.So, somewhat of a mixed review. And while this wasn't my favorite book I've ever read, I think a lot of that was simply because I didn't connect with the heroine's character. Just like in real life...you simply don't connect with everyone.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1718ULVCDWMS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145555751X#wasThisHelpful","R1718ULVCDWMS8","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This book started off really strongly. I liked how seemingly opposite Bruce and Teag were even though they are after the same dream. Bruce is a big, tattooed bear whereas Teag is more of a curmudgeonly pretty-boy. But they are so much better suited than they seem. See, they both have this dream of starting a bar of their own. While Teag is a class-A jerk in the beginning, Bruce approaches him about joining efforts.Like I said, the book started off really strongly. I loved the two guys together and how they worked even when it felt like they were at crossed-paths. I liked the chemistry they had.But about 2/3 of the way through the story lost something. That was the point when the mystery somewhat ramped up. There's been a thread of supernatural/ghost/witch theme that has lightly run throughout this series and this book was no different. While I loved the added lore of the old Blue Parrot bar and the nostalgia it added to the story, the rest...the Boys, Leo, Mme...all seemed to detract from the story.But the story at that point seemed to lose it's close connection to the inner workings of Bruce's POV, too. And honestly, I think it was Bruce who kept this story going. When Teag was not the most lovable of characters, I could still like him because Bruce did. I would have loved to have seen more play with their power shifts, too...because there were some definite sexy possibilities there that were then just kind of washed over.So somewhat of a mixed review. It wasn't Lou Harper's best book, but I still enjoyed reading it overall.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E96JVXSPRJ0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116TEMRA#wasThisHelpful","R3E96JVXSPRJ0R","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Hands down, this is my favorite book that I've read from HelenKay Dimon. Every single little thing in this book worked for me.This book is a HUGE character driven story. Molly and Jason have a long history...of dancing around one another and not doing anything about their mutual attraction. When it began, she was only 17...too young for him at 23 and then life and circumstances kept them apart until there was simply too much between them...much of it really antagonistic. These are two characters who have dealt with their attraction by sniping and fighting one another...to the point where their friends wonder which will happen first...they have sex or kill one another.But underneath all that is what made this book so good...hurt and pain for both Molly and Jason. Wow, the emotion in this book was just so, so well done. Jason has tried to bury his attraction to Molly and his hurt from war in countless other women who mean nothing to him. But Molly has had front seat tickets to his parade of women and that isn't something she can just overlook. So when they decide to give into their attraction, it's Molly putting up the walls for her protection. This is sex and only sex...she won't even think about the hope for something else...something that's utterly devastating to Jason. They may be sleeping together, but the divide between them is getting bigger and bigger.The main romance is amazing, but it's made even better by the secondary romance of Marcus and Will. Marcus is Jason's older brother and the two brothers are basically in the same situation...they're good for sex, but not a real relationship. See, Will is still active duty and very much in the closet. Will is his little dirty secret. Marcus added so much depth to this story with his discussions with both Jason and Molly. I loved him even when my heart is breaking for him. There's no cliffhangers in this one and their story is *somewhat* resolved in this book, but I'd LOVE to see Marcus and Will get their own story. There's so much conflict for them to still overcome and I'd love to see more of their story.This is one of those moments that makes me sad that this is a Carina publication. I'd LOVE to have this book on my keeper print shelf. Maybe they will print it eventually (they do that every once in a while...probably just to give me hope).I definitely loved this book and it's going right into my re-read shelf. BTW, for those of you that read my review for the first book in this series...I was somewhat dissatisfied with the explanation of why this shooting range was needed and how it would differ from what they already had AND support 3 people. Those questions were answered in this book and I LOVE what the author is creating with these guys and their shooting range. It sounds incredible. I'd go to it in a heartbeat!I highly recommend this book. It's easily one of the best books I've read this year.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38PDPMK1EASWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOVZY6G#wasThisHelpful","R38PDPMK1EASWL","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Overall: 4.25Performance: 3.75Story:4.5This book has been on my wishlist forever simply because it's on so many people's favorite m/m book ever lists. When I saw that it was available in audiobook, I took the opportunity to grab it. I'm so glad that I did because the story definitely lived up to the hype. It was really amazingly good...and tragic. Geez, this story will shred your heart.Zach...5 years, from the age of 15 was kept as a slave, a dog, to a sadistic sob. He was freed when a military group came in to save some other hostages, and they found Zach, a broken shell of a person who had been mentally broken. The book takes place 2 years later. Zach is home and trying to create a normal life, well, as normal as possible, for himself and not lose what's left of his mental stability. But then there's David.David...when Zach was 15, he had the biggest crush on David...and it was reciprocated. They shared a single kiss before Zach's parents shipped him off to visit his aunt and he was kidnapped. It's been 7 years since that kiss and they haven't seen one another, although neither has ever forgotten. BUT so much has changed since then.This book...seriously. You can read all that above and KNOW how intense and heartbreaking this is going to be. But wow...Zach is a great character. He may have been broken, but he never lost his strength. To survive what he did was amazing. To be able to function again is amazing. What he creates with David is a miracle.But what's even more amazing about the story is just how real it all feels. There are moments when these guys are able to laugh about how screwed up Zach is, and of course there are so many more where they cry. But all of that made it feel so authentic. I felt like I was in the story with them throughout the highs and lows. Rowan Speedwell sucked me in completely and these guys hurts and pains became mine. It was a wonderfully told story about the complexity of human spirit and about just how strong a person can be, but they are so much better when they have a support system.And Zach's support system wasn't just made up of David. It includes his parents, Dick & Jane, and Annie. And yes, even to a certain extent...Brian. There were so many little scenes that were nuggets of emotion and how they each worked to build up and support Zach.It was a great book and I loved reading/listening to it, although I will admit that there were a few times when the narrator's voice didn't change enough so I could tell exactly who was speaking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J17A1LV20JND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BNXKMO#wasThisHelpful","R1J17A1LV20JND","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:There are certain authors you read and would like to see into their brain just to see how they come up with things. For me, Alice Clayton is one of those authors. This book was so funny. I'd catch myself laughing out loud in the empty house while I read it. Someone needs to go through and count up how many food puns she used when discussing sex. OMG, they kept me laughing throughout the entire book. Between cornstalks, cucumbers, and nuts, I will NEVER be able to look at fresh produce or a farmers market the same way again. LOL.This book is told entirely from Roxie's pov. She grew up in this small New England town with her wildly romantic, hippy mother who fell in and out of love at the drop of the hat. As a result, Roxie wants nothing to do with this life. She left for culinary school and then went to LA with plans never to return. But when her mom gets chosen to go on The Amazing Race just as Roxie's job as a private chef falls to pieces, she comes home to run the family diner...and there she finds Leo.Leo happens to be the local hottie farmer who just happens to be a pedigreed New Yorker, too. We're talking big money here, but he seems like a normal guy...and even more importantly, he's all in with Roxie's summer loving plan. Sex for the summer with no fear of commitment...what guy would honestly ever say no to that? But of course, as will happen...feelings develop and deepen.There was so much to love about this book...the food puns, the small town, the diner, the farmer's market, Leo's farm, the swimming hole...and OMG, the food porn. And the surprise was the BEST because I totally did not see that twist coming.I also loved that the most popular hot guy from her high school days with his HUSBAND...LOVED the two of them and how they meshed with Roxie. I loved the cooking classes Roxie taught with them. I loved how she made the diner her own.Every single little thing about this book simply made me happy. I really, really liked it. And we haven't even talked about the Little House on the Prairie references. OMG, it was just all good and funny and sweet and romantic. I read the whole book with a grin on my face.My only complaint... and this is a seriously MINOR one... is that the book started a little slow, but keep reading...it picks up quickly at about 20% into it.I DEFINITELY recommend it!I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J12UX6NAAN1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501118137#wasThisHelpful","R2J12UX6NAAN1J","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Review:This was my first time reading an Emma Hart book. And I need to just say up front...I think I'm in love with the guys in the band, Dirty B. I love them, but their mother is the absolute BEST. I ADORE how she puts these boys in their place. They may be the hottest boy band on the planet, but I love how they all immediately step in line when she lays down the law. LOVE that.Okay, so this book is Aidan and Jessie. Their lives have been intertwined since long before the guys made it big. In fact, Aidan asked Jessie to the prom and she turned him down flat. She's a bit contentious like that and I love her for it. This is a girl that you don't mess with because she will knock you down to size faster than anything. And honestly, Aidan thinks she's pretty hot, but she's not worth having to put up with. Yeah, their's isn't the friendliest of relationships to start out this book and that makes it a lot of fun. I'm not a HUGE enemies to lovers gal, but this one works. She just doesn't put up with anything and I have to love her for that. I especially love her when it comes to how she deals with the press. She's AWESOME!And I have to say, these two may not get along, but that makes the sex smoking hot. This book is Steamy with a capital S. I love how even though they are at one another's throats...when it comes to the bedroom, the clothes can't come off fast enough. Chemistry...you can see it sizzling off every single page in this book.My only real issue with this one was the conflict. It seemed just a tiny bit wishy-washy toward the end when both characters were well aware this wasn't a lie anymore...that they had real feelings for one another. That disconnect between them just didn't work for me, especially knowing Jessie's upfront and in-your-face character. It was a tiny niggle...certainly not enough to ruin the book for me, because I did enjoy this one. Now I need to go check out the rest of the Dirty B books.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR4OF6M5LCYV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQPE0#wasThisHelpful","RR4OF6M5LCYV2","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I don't know what I expected from this book, but this wasn't it. Regardless, it was a really good, riveting read. The book was darker, more depressing, more gritty than I expected.The heroine is in a bad place...on the run...living in a depressing little trailer park where everyone else has their own depressing story. The mom of three whose life is way too much of a reminder for Annie. The snarky stripper next door who sees way too much and is way too attractive. The elderly, tattooed guy who is the only one who's truly kind to Annie, but everyone says he's dangerous. Then the alluring, seductive voice on the phone...Dylan...who is way too much of a forbidden temptation.This book is one of those stories where around every turn there's another unanswered question. It takes a while for all those questions to be answered. Most I saw coming but there was one that completely and totally shocked me. I did NOT see that coming. The night I read this book, I planned to only read part of it and then move to something else for the rest of the evening. Well, that didn't happen. This story sucked me right in and I couldn't put it down. Not until it was over. And then I immediately got online to order a print copy of it and preorder the next book in the series.And here's your warning...this book does end in a cliffhanger, but the good news is that book #2 is out in another month...thank goodness. Because I'm dying to know what happens to these characters. And I'm not just talking about the hero and heroine. I want to know what happens to them all. M. O'Keefe has written an expertly woven story full of characters that I care about...even when I didn't think I was going to get that attached to them. It was a good book and I cannot wait for the next one!And that's all I'm going to say because anything else would end up spoilery and you need to enjoy pulling back the layers of this story yourself.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CP3O47CGT1I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101884487#wasThisHelpful","R1CP3O47CGT1I2","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Yep, I'll admit it...I'm a sports romance whore. There are not many of these that I don't enjoy, if not absolutely love. This one was one of the ones that I love, and that's kind of surprising because for a while I wasn't too sure about this heroine.Lovey is spoiled. She grew up in the shadow of her superstar, super-talented, NHL bound brother, Duncan. As a result, her family tried to make it up to her by letting her have her way when she wanted something bad enough. All of them cater to her, including her brother. But part of the issue is Lovey's personality. She's one of those genuine people that everyone likes...she's fun, she's vivacious, and she's tenacious...which serves her well. But for her brother, it makes it hard for him (and the rest of her family) to take her seriously. She's trying to change that perception and is starting a new career and life in Chicago, where her brother lives. Until she settles into her life there, she's living with him and the Ace's Captain, Marc.And then there's Marc. He's the Captain of the team for a reason. He's completely focused on the hockey team and trying to get them to winning again. He's also good friends with Duncan, who's told him that Lovey is off-limits. No matter how combustible their chemistry is, he has to respect that. But I did mention that Lovey always gets her way, right? Yeah, she wants Marc and doesn't plan to let her brother dictate her sex life. No way. No how.There were so many things to love about this book. First of all is Lovey. While she obviously has some flaws, I loved her just as much as everyone in the book does. She's just one of those people. Add to that, I really respect the business she's building. I loved the author's descriptions of what she was doing. It made me want to start back up my old blog that I used to have once upon a time and go out and take more photos, appreciate more pretty things. I like how she's creating this whole new business model and everyone doubts her. But she knows she can do it. She's determined and professional and I loved that about her.And of course this is all set within the world of hockey and the NHL. I loved that. I do love sports themed books and every time I read a hockey book, I swear I'm going to start watching more. If only I could convince my husband that this would be a really good idea. Maybe I'll have to start watching by myself.It was a good book and definitely one I recommend. It was a GREAT start to this series and I can't wait to read more about the Aces hockey team.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32R5RDT35ZECG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWEMG5M#wasThisHelpful","R32R5RDT35ZECG","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This was a cute set-up for a book. A bakery owner who gets up at 3:00 AM living across the street from a bar that's open until 2:00 AM....yeah, there's going to be some conflict there. But the thing is...the bar was there first and Maddie knew that.And that brings us to Maddie...who is not the most lovable heroine ever. In fact, she's spoiled and uptight and will make a great, bitter old maid in another thirty years....because yeah, she already has the attitude. I had a really hard time liking her...at first. But as Emmett falls for her, she began to soften a bit and she began to grow on me. Although i did find myself fascinated by the entire Chamberlain clan. This is the first book that I've read by this author, but I'm definitely ready to learn more about them. The family who is pretty much hated by everyone, but with the exception of Maddie, they all seemed like pretty awesome characters (at least this generation and Granny...who I loved). And Maddie did come around. She had a good character-growth arc.I also really enjoyed Emmett's side of the story. I like that he wasn't all that he appeared to be, but had very good reasons for not telling Maddie. I liked him and how he related with his employees and customers. He truly embraces the point of a bar...to relax and hang out. I especially loved when he was commiserating with Maddie's brothers.It was a sweet, fun book. I enjoyed reading it. There was only one little niggle about it that I talked about below that lowered my rating from a 5 star to a 4. But even with that, I plan to read from this author again. I want to read more about the Chamberlain family...maybe Logan next? And I definitely need to go back and read the first two from the series.Note...there was one thing about this book that really bugged me...the sex scenes. I write...I know these aren't easy to do, but there was so much flowery prose in the sex scenes, it took me out of the story... every single time. There's a bad guy in the book called the Penis Picasso, but an orgasm is called a 'pinnacle of pleasure'? No, just no. Ugh. If you can say penis, then you can use the word orgasm. It was just distracting and made the writing (in the sex scenes only) feel a bit 80's.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPSP9D8XXMU45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNHXW#wasThisHelpful","RPSP9D8XXMU45","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Overall.... 5.0Performance... 5.0Story.... 5.0Before reading/listening to this book, I was told it was amazing, but I was still completely blown away by just how incredible this book was.There is one character who makes this book...Bright Eyes herself, Kate. Wow. Talk about a character to fall in love with and admire. I'd love to have just a tiny smidgeon of the positivity and outlook on life that Kate does. This is one of those books that challenges you to be a better person, to be a more positive influence on those around you, to live more. The story is gorgeous just because her character is so beautiful.Kate has a passion for life...and that shows through everything she does. From making friends wherever she goes, to encouraging those around her, to interacting with kids...she has an incredible zest to her that comes through every single interaction she has. It's admirable and such a joy to read.Kate is in her first year going to college at Grant. It's obvious from the beginning that her life has not been all smooth sailing...in fact, it's been far from it. And that's what makes her outlook on life so much more impressive. Along the way through her story, you get to see her circle of friends and see how knowing her has enhanced their lives. It's a beautiful thing, an incredible book, and was an even better audio book. The narrators were incredible. I adored Lidia Dornet's voice for Kate. She did her inflections so perfectly...it just enhanced the dialogue in the story so beautifully.It's an incredibly moving story that will leave you sobbing at the end. But even through the tears, I felt happier for having met Kate for a few hours through the reading of this book. She and Gus have a phrase...Do Epic...that paraphrases the theme of the book beautifully! I loved it and highly recommend it...IF you can handle a super-emotional ending. (Seriously, this is your warning....I had tears rolling down my face for hours at the end of the book.) But I'm so glad I read this one and now I'm dying to read Gus because I need something happy for him...Bright Side was his other half...and that won't be easy for him to recover from.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R8VLYGGQ7YJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMLYUO8#wasThisHelpful","R1R8VLYGGQ7YJQ","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This was a great book just in that I could never figure out how the author was going to fix this situation that the characters find themselves in. It's such an impossible set of circumstances...someone is going to lose out and Grey and Avery's relationship will be the thing that suffers. But I loved that because it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the entire time I read this story....which I really did love. It's a great, conflict-filled set up.These characters all live in a small mountainous town that relies on the ski industry to survive. Grey is right in the middle of that with his high-adventure ski company that he's sunk his entire life into. He runs this company with his friend Trip, but his company relies on him to be hands on. That's why it's so completely devastating when a drunk driver hits and injures him while he's riding his bicycle.That drunk driver is Avery's twin brother. The issue is Andy's only real asset is the old victorian house that he owns with Avery...and the chances are good that Andy's going to jail AND they will lose their house. But there's another conflict in all this in that Avery is the only physical therapist available to Grey when he first starts his recovery. As a result, they become friends and then more...even though they know it's going to get complicated.This book was so smart and so intelligent. There's no doubt Andy made a huge mistake, but with that single mistake everyone loses. It's a good lesson even while it makes for a fascinating, entertaining read. I really enjoyed the book. I loved both Avery and Grey. Neither one of these are bad people. Even Avery knows that Andy was absolutely in the wrong. It's one huge, bad situation and they are all going to end up losing out. If there was anything I didn't like about the book, it was Avery's father and really both parents, but I'm pretty positive that you aren't supposed to like them. I just couldn't respect their actions and I can't believe that Avery went along with them when she did. I had a real issue with that. It wasn't cool especially at that stage in the relationship between Grey and Avery. Earlier in the book I could have handled it better, and it did drop my rating from an A to an A-.But it was still an amazing book, and I recommend it.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S5GKP41LI4YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503947025#wasThisHelpful","R1S5GKP41LI4YI","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I've never had a book make me want to go out and get two kittens like this book did. LOL. And Bonnie and Clyde were just the tip of the fun inside this story.There are little details about these characters that I love that really make the story. Parker is a law enforcement officer who tracks down big-game poachers. He's on vacation because his last investigation left another investigator dead and Parker injured. The real issue with that is the guy he was investigating got away and Parker refuses to let the case go. That brings him to Idaho.Zoe is a private pilot and she is one tough chick. She basically raised her two siblings, but after they both found love, now she's dealing with a bit of empty nest syndrome. Although she's trying to fix that by going on a series of dates. It's time for her to find The One too...or at least someone who can give her the next best thing....a Big O. And then Parker moves in.Like all Jill Shalvis books, this is a heart-warming, easy read with tons of happy moments, and a few sad ones too. Jill writes sexy, sassy romance in just the best way. There are some GREAT scenes in this book. One of them is the football scene...I seriously love Jill Shalvis' alpha, tough-guy heroes and they are at their best when they get competitive. But it's really the one-on-one scenes where the chemistry is blazing between Parker and Zoe that this book shines. Whoa, these two are so HOT together. I really do love them. Zoe is a bit awkward, but so honest about it that I couldn't help but fall in love with her. And i love how Parker is just so flabbergasted and overwhelmed by her. He has no idea how to take her, but she intrigues him for just that reason. She's different and he falls in love with her for those differences.For both these characters, their siblings are so important to them. They have very different relationships with them, but for both of them those relationships are HUGE in their lives. I loved that about them. I enjoyed so many little things about this book, but mainly the romance...oh, and their love for the animals, their sweet pets...Oreo, Bonnie, and Clyde. Those three were such a huge part of this story and added a great depth to the characters.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R147YA3L2IDR9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=042527019X#wasThisHelpful","R147YA3L2IDR9A","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I've said it again and I'll probably say it every time I read one of Lauren Layne's books...these are, hands down, some of the most intelligent, fun, entertaining contemporary romance stories on the market today. Every single book I've read of hers has been just brilliant with characters that I fall in love with. I smile almost the entire time I read because her dialogue is always spot on and witty and just so intelligent. I always feel better, happier, for having read one of her books.This one was no different, but what was different in this book was Penelope. Wow, I LOVED her.The Oxford series is a spin-off from the Stiletto series. Both these books are built around the high-fashion, high-social life of the NYC magazine scene. Oxford is a men's magazine and they've decided to expand their sports section to a significant portion of the magazine. To achieve that, they need an editor for the job. Cole, who's been working freelance for the sports section of the magazine for years, should be a shoe-in for the job, but that's before Penelope applies.Penelope is the antithesis to this group of characters that have made appearances in the series. She's a transplant from Chicago and is not one of the beautiful people. She's a tomboy completely obsessed with sports. She's one of the guys. Cole calls her Tiny (I LOVE his nickname for her) because she's a diminutive little thing, completely lacking in feminine curves. In other words, NOT his type at all. But she adores sports as much as he does and he's fascinated. Add to that, she's just an upfront girl...what you see is what you get. She's genuine, doesn't play games, and is truly a nice person. She's a good friend...so why is he so turned on by her?Honestly this is just one of those books that's a pure joy to read. My one issue with Lauren Layne books is that they end. I hate watching that countdown on my kindle when I know the book is going to end because they are just so much fun to read. The snappy dialogue and the beautiful people are fabulous, but I loved this one because the girl next door got the playboy. Cole has been around the Stiletto girls for a long time as their resident manwhore. I loved watching him fall in love. It was a GREAT book. Now, I'm ready to find out what's behind Lincoln's facade...something happened to him and I'm dying to know what it was. Who broke his heart? The scenes with him hurt my heart.

"My Review:For The Christmas Cottage...If you like sweet as candy holiday romances then this is the story for you. At times, it felt a bit over the top and I really, really did NOT like Ava, Lacey's best friend (which should make reading the second book in this interesting.) But honestly those were my only complaints. The set-up was cute. I liked the history behind Lacey and Ean from when she made a fool of herself when she was 14 years old. And I'm always a sucker for a good snowed in story. I even liked the little bit of magic about the Christmas Cottage.Overall it was a fun little read and would definitely provide a good, holiday-movie-like escape for the holidays (think Falalaholidays of movies) for a couple of hours.For Ever After...I had to DNF this one. I made it about halfway through reading it, but I never liked Ava in the first book, and I wasn't finding much redeeming about her in this one either. (Chances are...she grows some in the story, but I just didn't want to finish to find out.)

"My Review:Ooh, I really am liking these stories featuring the Drigan wolves. This book is Neil's story, he's the second oldest after David. He's always been the playboy in the group, but lately he's had that itch under his skin. He's unsettled and doesn't quite know why. That, and there's a scent that continues to play on his senses that smells of flowers and death. He needs to track it.When he finds it, he discovers Marissa. Marissa has had a hard time. Her entire family died on Halloween, the holiday that used to be her favorite. So this is a really hard time of the year for her. Add in to that, strange dreams, an ex who's acting weird, and unexplainable bruises...this year is a little bit harder than most. The one bright light in all of that is Neil...even though she really doesn't understand him and his actions half the time.This is the perfect read for this time of the year. Halloween plays heavily into the story and it's all perfectly creepy and eerie with lots of things that go bump in the night...literally. Marissa is being stalked, but since her memory keeps getting erased, she has no idea that it's going on. She already has issues with the time of the year, the Templars are NOT helping things. She's confused, but a lot of that is not her fault.Then there's Neil...poor guy. He's doing everything he can to do the right thing...to be the good guy, and every time it seems like it's costing him the girl. Because she doesn't understand, and he can't tell her. But he's also half wolf...he's not going to give up his woman or let her be hurt.It was a good book. I enjoyed the relationship, although Neil was my favorite. One of the Templars kept describing Marissa's soul as fractured and that was a good description of her. She's broken so it's hard for her to respond the way she should. She's trying to protect herself, even though as the reader you can see that absolutely, Neil is the best thing for her. Like I said, that just made me love Neil even more. Knowing that he will always protect her and have her back even if she won't allow a relationship...sigh...that's commitment, and seriously, how can you not fall for a guy with that kind of commitment.I loved getting to see David and Kelsey again in this book and loved watching their mechanisms from the sidelines as they tried to get Kelsey and Neil to their happily ever after. I love how protective David is of Marissa. That familial devotion is something that she needs desperately. In fact, knowing after all she's lost, that she'll have the pack as her family now is just perfect. She needs that to heal.I liked this one and if you're looking for something a bit spooky, but with romantic leanings for this October's reads, this is a good choice!I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26T7A9I1LSQ5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116TESI8#wasThisHelpful","R26T7A9I1LSQ5Z","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Review:The premise on this one is interesting.Alexis has had some really hard years, but it comes to a head when her sister becomes pregnant...not that that is a bad thing, but it just points out to Alexis that maybe her life isn't all that she'd hoped or dreamed. She drops everything to go on an impromptu European tour.Luke has had his own troubles the last few years after an IED blew him up a little over a year ago. Like Alexis, he's a little broken and a lot scarred on the inside and out. But when Ryan comes to him to chase after and look over Alexis, he's not going to turn down a fellow PJ.Throughout this story, these two characters are truly finding themselves again through one another. They've both dealt with huge blows to what they know about how they should function in life. As a result, they're floundering...for purpose...for 'why's'...for answers to where they go from here. Luckily, they do find those answers...with each other...and across an interesting jaunt across Europe...which is a fun setting/backdrop for the book.Overall, I liked it. I'll admit that you have to suspend a tiny bit of disbelief because Europe isn't a tiny place and for Luke to just find Alexis is highly unlikely. It's even more unlikely for him to honestly expect he could follow her across Europe and she wouldn't notice the same American lurking. But once I got past that, I did enjoy the story.I enjoy the angst that comes from emotionally wounded characters and both Luke and Amelia are great ones. It just creates such an emotionally satisfying story when main characters like this find healing through their love. This one was well done on that front. I also felt like I'd had an armchair tour of Europe at the same time. Overall it was a great escape for the afternoon.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHF9VHG6P61AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BEDMPQ#wasThisHelpful","RHF9VHG6P61AF","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Review:Yay...this series is back. I wasn't the biggest fan of the last book so I was a bit worried going into this one. The series has redeemed itself. I loved this story!Gray is making history. She's the first general manager of a hockey team. Yes, she got the position because her father gave it to her, but she's one of the most intelligent people in hockey (literally), has two Olympic medals from her own days of playing, and has a phenomenal track record for recruiting. She's up for the job. She just has to prove it to the guys that she can do this.Her number one supporter is the back-up goalie for the Cold Fury, Ryker. She recruited him two years ago and he's always respected her for that. Now that the number one goalie having to sit out because of injuries, he's playing to prove both of them right. He's up for taking the first string position...and that will just strengthen Gray's place on the team since she negotiated for him.But suddenly Ryker is seeing Gray in a new light. She's attractive, and fun, and interesting. And he's interested in her. But...she's his boss. And there we have the conflict. (Do you like how I'm writing this review all in fragment sentences?)The book worked for me. I loved how over-the-top intelligent Gray is...she had her master's degree at the age of 21. She's one of those women who's simply perfect at everything she does...she's smart, athletic, and gorgeous. But I think the best thing about her (besides her incredible chemistry with Ryker) was her amazing relationship with her father. Her mother died when she was four and she's incredibly close to her father. I loved that even though he's an incredibly successful man, he doesn't put the business first. Gray is first...always...and he truly respects her and her abilities. In so many books, the mc's have dysfunctional relationships with their parents. It was fun to read about a really, really good father/daughter relationship and I love how he helps her sort out her problems in the end.Then there's Ryker. Wow, what a great guy. He's raising his two daughters alone after his ex ran off a 19 yo teammate. He could be really bitter, but again in a super-healthy father/daughter dichotomy, he's focused on doing what's best for his girls. I loved that about him and the many scenes of him with them...melt my heart.The book is just really good. The story line was complex with a lot of layers. Gray is making history, but if her relationship with Ryker comes out, it could ruin both their careers. And you know...this is a novel...someplace something is going to go wrong. Because they both work for the Cold Fury, this book is really heavy on the sport of hockey. I really enjoyed that...both the analysis of the backroom decisions and what Ryker is dealing with on the rinkIt was just flat-out a good book. If you enjoy sports themed books, esp hockey, I pretty much guarantee you will like this one. I definitely recommend it.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10YOUZJYYUBHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R10YOUZJYYUBHJ","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This is one of those books that started out really strong, but then lost a bit of its appeal as it progressed because the conflict got a bit too drawn out. But it was definitely worth the read.Max and Karson meet one night at a bar. Max has been celibate for six months and is feeling a bit desperate. But he's been celibate because he wants something real for a change. Hook-ups aren't cutting it. For Karson, he will only engage in hook-ups. He got involved once and had his heart completely shattered. But their eyes meet and things happen...and then neither one can let go of the moment. For me, this was the best part of the book. This meeting changed both men. They can't seem to walk away from one another and the chemistry between them is fantastic.Where the book didn't work though was with Karson and his conflict. He had his heart broken by Andrew...and this was a long time ago. While I could understand how that might make him leery, it doesn't make sense in just how long he is consumed by this idea that he can never have anything more and that every guy out there will be like Andrew. Then to have Andrew suddenly show up in the book was just way too convenient after so long apart. None of that aspect of the story line worked for me...at all. And that makes me sad because the book start out so incredibly good. And then it just kind of fell apart with the conflict.So, while the book didn't work for me in every aspect, I did enjoy reading it, and would definitely read this author again.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S4BIV2UW113J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YE20316#wasThisHelpful","R2S4BIV2UW113J","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This is the first in a new paranormal shifter series by Dee Carney. I felt like it was a great start. She has an interesting world with a really unique twist on the shifter world. Most shifter series talk about the human and the wolf (or other animal) that live within the same body. But Dee Carney took that a step further. In her shifter world, three separate beings inhabit the shifter body...the human, the wolf, and the beast.The beast is the most feral of the three and is only let out on a full moon. But for the hero in this book, Brick, his beast is breaking out of his bonds. Something that will likely result in Brick being killed for being feral...and no one can figure out why sometimes shifters go feral.There's also a suspense aspect to this story. There's a serial killer on the loose killing the pre-adolescent shifters of the pack. (Note: this story was not completed in this first book, so I'm guessing this will be an ongoing plot line throughout the series.) Thrown into all of this with new warning is the new doctor in Fire Creek, Kim.Kim has her own complicated story. Something happened to her medical career in LA which ruined everything. There's a lot of the story devoted to how much she has lost materially. I'll be honest, for me that aspect of her character skirted really close to the edge of too much, making her a shallow person that I didn't like. Almost...it was a really close thing, because she's pretty caught up in material things for a lot of the book, which seemed really shallow esp considering how she ended up there. That was the one thing that I wasn't real fond of about in this story.But everything else in the story did work for me. I loved Brick and the men we got to meet from the pack. There is definitely some great potential there for upcoming stories. I found Brick's issues fascinating and the whole medical investigation going on by Kim to find out ""why"" he's having issues was great. I could totally buy the explanation of it all and liked getting deep into Brick's head with his interactions with his beast and wolf.It was an interesting book and a great start to this series. I definitely plan to read more as they release.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MQM4ZPICPSYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQTXN7E#wasThisHelpful","R3MQM4ZPICPSYF","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Overall: 3.75Performance: 3.5Story: 3.75I know, I know. I'm one of the last people in the world to start this series. And I understand now why it's been so widely loved. The book, overall, was good. The characters are interesting and they each have really angst-filled back stories which make for a riveting and emotional story.This story is about Rylee and Colton. Rylee is a social worker type who manages a house full of young boys who've had incredibly unfortunate home lives before this. Colton is a racecar driver who before he was adopted and taken in by his current family was just like one of those boys that Rylee is always championing. He has deep emotional wounds. But Rylee hasn't had an easy life either. A couple of years before this, she was in a car accident with the love of her life and listened to him slowly die as they were trapped for days before anyone found them in a ravine. Yeah, that leaves some emotional wounds. The set-up is fabulously well done to give characters that have huge flaws, but you love them anyway because they've had such a tough road getting to here.For Rylee, romance has been one person...Max, who died. Opening herself up to a player like Colton is just not something that she's comfortable with. For Colton, he's honest with himself and others. He knows his emotional scars run too deep to ever stick to one relationship. It's just not part of his psyche.Like I said, I totally get the appeal of this series. For the most part, I enjoyed the book, but this is a long book which makes for an even longer audiobook. The back and forth between the two characters just got to be a bit much for me. Colton pulling Rylee into his sphere and then pushing her away again because he ""can't be what she needs him to be."" I got so tired of that...and then knowing that the series goes on for three more books...ugh. And I know that the author obviously has to go deeper into their story than that eventually, but it just wore me out emotionally. I don't think this series overall is one for me (and note...that's not that surprising...I'm not a huge NA fan and this book is definitely written in the NA style)And just a note about the narration on this one since I listened to the audiobook. Overall the narrator had a good range of voices and those NEVER wavered...which I like in my narrators. But she had this weird inflection where she would use a higher pitch at the end of them that almost made them sound like questions. It was odd. Again, it wasn't a huge thing, but after 12 hours of audio, it got old.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MRCCWQ81CARA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1452648549#wasThisHelpful","R2MRCCWQ81CARA","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:I really liked this book. I wasn't sure because I'd never read this author before, but I read a good review so picked it up on a whim. I'm so glad that I did.Five years ago, Chris made the biggest mistake of his life...driving when drunk. It killed his girlfriend/fiancee, ruined his football career, and alienated almost his entire support system who couldn't forgive him for his stupid mistake...including his own family. He's sleeping on his best friend Michael's couch. Michael was the only person who stood by him, but with a criminal conviction on his record, it's hard to find a job. He's at rock bottom both mentally and with his life when he sees the flyer for becoming a porn star. What does he have to lose?The thing I really love about this book is not only Chris...he's a great angst-filled hero. But the company he goes to work for is fabulous...owned by a triad of men who are committed to taking care of their models/stars. This quickly becomes a place where Chris is accepted and feels like home to him...something he hasn't had in 5 years. I liked the way that it was all set up and hope that this is truly the way places like CockyBoys are...because looking in from the outside, it seems like they might be. I would imagine that porn could be a really difficult place to work without that camaraderie between the players in it.And I really loved the way the romance between Chris and Linc developed. They were two of the last to hook up on film. That worked for me. What also worked for me was that Chris didn't suddenly decide...wow, he likes cock. No, the story went into how difficult it was for him to become sexually active with a person who he didn't feel that attraction to...i.e. guys. This is purely a gay-for-you story. In fact, both the heroes consider themselves bisexual by the end. But it's not a wham-bam, I'm gay story. The author handled all of that really beautifully and I applaud her for that.But just a little warning...the book is really hot, but it remains focused on the romantic interest, not the porn...although it is in the book. It's just not quite as present as I expected especially since the main hero is new to homosexuality...and I will admit, I was a little disappointed with that. I would have liked to have had his first time with a guy on the page, rather than in retrospect. But I understand and respect why the author wrote it the way she did. That's just sex...not the connection that the two heroes have between one another. And when they get together....well, let's just say, my kindle was steaming.Needless to say, I recommend this one and am looking forward to more in the series. It's a great set-up and I'm so thankful to have found a new author to love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THM1BSGSGB5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MIG1BG#wasThisHelpful","R3THM1BSGSGB5H","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:Overall: 3.25Performance: 3.00Story: 3.5This is the second audiobook that I've accepted for review with this author/narrator combo. I should have paid attention to my feelings after the first book, because I don't think the issue is with either the author or the narrator. I just think together, they don't do well.The narrator overall is great. He has very distinct voices for his characters. I just don't necessarily like the way he interprets the characters. Something about his inflections make the dialogue seem ridiculous. His voice for the heroine in particular made her sound like she didn't have any brains. And yes, she made some questionable choices in this story, but she sounded completely clueless for a lot of the book.For the last forty-five minutes of the audio, I knew I wasn't particularly liking it...the dialogue just felt off and a bit ridiculous...so I really started paying attention to what was being said. And honestly, I think I would have liked this book better if I'd been reading it. But I didn't read it, I listened to it and that meant I had to deal with the narrator's interpretation of the story. That's what I had an issue with.This is a short story, but it had an interesting premise with the bear clan and the cat clan wanting to take over the territory. I like that Griff just came out of hibernation, so he spends a lot of the book very sleepy. It made him seem really lovable. The romance is quick and to tell the truth, very little of the book is really focused on it. It's more concentrated on the conflict between the shifters and the danger to Amy. But like I said, it's a short story. There is a lot there for the length of it.I received a complimentary copy of the audiobook in return for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123IZ0TPH4YMC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOVSAMS#wasThisHelpful","R123IZ0TPH4YMC","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Rating: BMy Review:This was a fun, light read. I happened to love the Alaskan lodge setting and thought it was perfect for a romantic setting. I also really loved how different Zak and Sabrina are on the surface. But then they begin to connect and realize that they aren't as different as they first suspected.Both of these characters are heavily defined by their roles within their families. For Zak, he was the oldest son who took over as head of the family when his father died. He takes that responsibility seriously and hasn't strayed from it...ever. So he's never really had much of a personal life. He simply hasn't had time.For Sabrina, her family has high expectations of her. Her father is a full-time politician while her mother was a well-known actress. As a result, Sabrina has spent her life in the spotlight, always doing the right thing to make sure that she is a good representation for them. She's never done her own thing...although she did secretly get her yoga instructor certification because that's where her passion lies.And that right there ^^^ the yoga mixed in with the Alaskan hunting lodge dynamic...I loved that! It was a fun idea and I liked how the romance/partnership developed between Zak and Sabrina. And then there were the sled dog puppies, scrabble games, and Bunny...lots of things to love from this one.This book is the first in the series. It was entertaining and fun. The author has some room to develop, but it's off to a pretty good start. Zak owns the lodge with his three other brothers and I cannot wait to read more of their stories. They were really well-defined characters in this book and I am looking forward to more.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JBWMVFKFOUSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V6CWLU#wasThisHelpful","R3JBWMVFKFOUSJ","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My Review:This is another one of those series that I've liked from the very beginning, but I really, really liked this installment. We got to see Penni and Dan in the last book and I LOVED them together. Dan needs a happy...so badly, so I loved when it looked like they were going to hook up.But when this book begins, things haven't gone like I expected them to in the three months between the events in the last book and this one...and I liked that bit of surprise. I think the biggest surprise is that Penni has quit working for the Secret Service and is now adamant that she see Dan. What she doesn't realize though when the BKI team sends her off to find him is that he's actually out on a mission. She certainly never planned to crash into their mission.But that's where I love Penni...she's trained and is a pretty tough chick in her own right, so she can handle it when things go south. On the other hand is Chelsea...I loved her too, just because she isn't quite so efficient. She's worked a desk job for the CIA and has never done field work, but she's determined to be a valuable part of the team. I loved her ambition and determination even when she's terrified.I truly enjoyed this team of four. They are awesome together and loved the back and forth dialogue between all of them. It made this book a really fun and entertaining read. And then there is Dan and Penni together. Their chemistry is through the roof and it built some great sexual suspense in the book esp since they had the rottenest timing throughout the story...although I have to say I was worried about Dan's 'equipment' when they hit the turbulence on the plane. That could have been a serious problem...eeks!There were a lot fewer scenes with the entire BKI team in this one (or at least it seemed like it), and normally that might have been a problem for me because I love this team dynamic. But this group of four were so entertaining, I honestly didn't even miss it. This book definitely goes at the top of my list for one of my favorites in this series so far.I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJX8VBJZWXR02/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402294549#wasThisHelpful","RJX8VBJZWXR02","A23GRXCXQU3SM8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23GRXCXQU3SM8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The DROK Fuse TAP is a much safer alternative then using a wire tap.Remember to check your fuse type before ordering because this are regular blade fuse.  Some cars uses micro base fuse.In the bag, there was the DROK Fuse TAP, 2 wire connectors, an insulator, and 10 regular fuses (2A, 3A, 5A, 7.5A, 10A, 15A, 20A, 25A, 30A, 40A).The fuse tap is elevated so it can sit alongside the other fuses while I plugged in the original fuse and one of DROK's fuses.

"I regularly take a high potency vitamin D3 supplement so was pleased to receive this product for an honest review.Important to me is the sourcing of the ingredients and Viva Labs assures their vitamin D3 is produced in the US from US-derived ingredients (with the exception of the lanolin which is sourced from New Zealand or Australia). Ive used other Viva Labs supplements and have been highly impressed with the quality of their products.This vitamin D3 is a small softgel capsule. It contains extra virgin olive oil and no soy or GMOs. While during the sunny months, one can get an adequate supply of this essential vitamin, the 5,000 IU dosage is perfect for the cooler months when sunshine is limited.I personally take the 5,000 IU dosage year round and my 25-hydroxy vitamin D test always comes back with optimal readings (between 50 and 70 ng/mL).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNRN9PE5QYBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JUT04I#wasThisHelpful","R3HNRN9PE5QYBM","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sonia Lacasse has created a masterpiece in Paleo Home Cooking. The book is beautifully illustrated and contains more than 150 grain-free, gluten-free, dairy-free recipes and a number of useful guides to making your own sauces, stocks and mayonnaise. Sonias sugar-free desserts use only modest amounts of pure natural sugars such as honey, maple syrup or dried fruits. In addition, there are guides to stocking your Paleo kitchen and helpful hints on the best kitchen tools to have in your arsenal. Theres even a recipe for making your own dark chocolate chips!The recipes use only real food, and they are simple and simply delicious. I have three rotisserie chicken carcasses in my freezer, and after seeing the delectable Brown Chicken Stock on page 76-7, I know what Im making tomorrow!The first recipe I tried was the Chicken Fingers with Spicy Honey Dijon Dipping Sauce (p. 158). This turned out to be a family favorite. The coating is wonderfully spicy and flavorful and is a perfect foil for the sweet, mustardy dipping sauce. The Honey Sesame Chicken on page 160 was also very tasty, however, Im on the fence about the date paste used as a sweetener. Maybe will use a tad less for my next batch.A new recipe for me was the Cauliflower Fritters (p. 254). They are light in texture and lightly browned. Be sure to squeeze as much water out of the steamed cauliflower as you can to achieve the desired lightness. These call for ghee, however, I used organic butter with good results. A favorite was the Smoked Ham and Asparagus Omelette (p. 146). To accommodate my Kosher diet I used sliced strips of chicken breast in place of the ham and the resulting dish was superb. The dish is not an omelette per se but tasty thin crepe-like rounds wrapped around the asparagus, chicken and sliced mushrooms. If you tolerate cheese, a little grated Gruyere is very nice on this dish.Ms. Lacasse has a blog (The Healthy Foodie) for her followers where she offers more of her delightful recipes.

"I received a bottle of LOreal Paris Skin Care Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Moisturizer for an honest review. Heres my take on it.L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition is a daily moisturizer with an SPF30 protection. This works well for me because I have rather dry skin, exacerbated by almost daily contact with chlorinated water. As a water fitness instructor, I appreciate both the thickness of the moisturizer as well as the SPF protection. And the scent is delightful!The bottle comes with a built-in pump that opens and closes. It dispenses a very small amount of lotion, one pump not being quite enough for all-over facial protection. It contains five essential oils: orange peel, jasmine, lavender, rosemary and pelargonium. The scent is definitely floral, but no individual scent dominates. Very pleasant to use and highly emollient. I am entirely happy with this product and it leaves my skin feeling baby soft and wonderfully hydrated. A little pricey, but definitely a keeper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TALVZQ9I0TUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01648QGU4#wasThisHelpful","R3TALVZQ9I0TUZ","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a bottle of Joint Support with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM and Hyaluronic Acid for an honest review.Zenwise labs is known for producing quality products and since I already take each of the four listed ingredients for osteoarthritis and a damaged knee, I thought the four ingredients combined in one tablet would be helpful. At first glance, I found the tablets to be large, and I have some difficulty swallowing large tablets, however, these are soft enough to be broken in half easily. Due to the curcumin, a product of the turmeric plant, these tablets are a pale yellow in color.In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, they also contain bosweilla and curcumin, both known to help with inflammation issues. Its far too soon to know if this product has positive effects, but since its a continuation of the ingredients I am already takingand in the same dosages, I feel confident that the results will be beneficial.

"I received this lovely gift jar of pure American made chocolates for an honest review. Not difficult for this chocolate lover! Firstly, four varieties of wrapped five-gram chocolates arrive in a lidded glass jar tied with a chocolate brown ribbon. What could be prettier? There are 121 chocolates in the jar30 each of Bittersweet Dark, Semi Sweet, Extra Dark and 31 Milk Chocolate.Im liking them all. But probably favor the Semi Sweet (62%), a deliciously satisfying dark, reminiscent of the 72% chips used for baking, only much smoother and tastier (the squares being 70%). The Milk Chocolate at 41% is sweeter but still robust enough to outshine any bar chocolate. The Bittersweet at 70%  has only the barest hint of sweetness but is equally satisfying, and one square is enough to satisfy a craving. Extra Dark at 82% is perhaps my least favorite, however this exceptionally high quality chocolate is rich and robust, a bit like the strong Black Magic coffee beans I grind for my morning cup of Joe. Each square wrapper I stamped lightly with a best by date to ensure maximum freshness. Mine all are marked 2016 and 2017.These quality chocolates present beautifully in an attractive lidded gift jar that can be used long after the sweets are enjoyed. The package is a bit pricey, but for this quality and for gifts it is lovely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RQSAVY24VC1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116DEBFO#wasThisHelpful","R3RQSAVY24VC1C","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally I choose dark chocolate, but the opportunity to try the Cailler Milk Chocolate Selection presented itself, so I indulged.This is a beautifully packaged 7.9 ounce box assortment of 16 rich milk chocolates made in Broc, Switzerland. A small booklet accompanies each box. It pictures and describes the confections. The assortment includes creamy centers, caramels and nutty pieces, mostly almond or hazelnut. Each piece sits in its own shaped depression for full protection.The candies are small and one can easily eat three pieces without too much sugar overload. The milk chocolate is delicious, though a bit sweet for my taste. Also, even though they are delicious, I found the flavors seemed similar, perhaps because the milk chocolate and sugar is a bit overwhelming. Still, this makes a delightful gift for the milk chocolate lover. Five stars for packaging and overall beauty. One star off for the price and mingled flavors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA8D1B6IWJODP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGI0#wasThisHelpful","RA8D1B6IWJODP","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have osteoarthritis and knee joint degeneration. Ive been taking curcumin for a while to cut down on joint pain since I choose not to use NSAIDS. I had the opportunity to try Ubervitas Turmeric and Curcumin capsules for an honest evaluation.While its too soon to assess the benefits to me personally, I can say this: Ubervita is a respected company and they source only the highest quality of organic turmeric curcumin for fighting arthritis and joint issues. Their Bioperine is a patented formula that delivers a high absorption level of curcumin, the main ingredient in the spice turmeric. It has long been used for relief of joint pain, but also for its anti-inflammatory qualities and now is used as a preventive for tumor growth.The capsules are large. One to three capsules per day between meals is the recommended dosage. I would say that my symptoms are less intense with its daily use, though I will need a couple more months to determine just how effective it is overall. I also take an anti-inflammatory supplement and hyaluronic acid and hope with this supplementation to avoid knee replacement surgery. So far, the prognosis is good, and I am back to regular walking and exercise after months of debilitating bone-on-bone discomfort. I appreciate that Ubervitas Turmeric Curcumin is also an anti-oxidant and is helpful for relieving headaches. In fact, since taking turmeric I have not had to resort to ibuprofen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFVE0CBTVACT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RN5Q3K#wasThisHelpful","R1UFVE0CBTVACT","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the fact that this surge protector offers six plugs plus two 24 Watt USB ports to keep your smartphone or Kindle charged.

The surge protector plugs into the lower three-pronged outlet with a plastic nub resting on the existing faceplate so you actually can use only one of the faceplate outlets.

I plan to add another for my kitchen use where I keep my phone plugged in.Definitely an improvement over other brands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTWSS9MC0SYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKSX0Y0#wasThisHelpful","R2OTWSS9MC0SYX","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These amethyst and white sapphire stud earrings are very smart looking and suitable for business to dressy wear. The earrings are about 10mm in diameter with genuine amethysts and tiny created white sapphires encircling the gemstone. Theyre designed in sterling silver for a nice classy look. I have short silver hair and the combination is great.They come boxed (box is quite large and could be better presented for gift-giving) and have the silver backs and non-slip grippers to keep the posts from falling out.Another reviewer commented on the amethyst stone not being very sparkly. This is true, but I find them subtly elegant and love wearing them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVBKBTRM1DJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DED01E0#wasThisHelpful","RFVBKBTRM1DJ4","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why eat tasteless Paleo food when you dont have to? says paleo chef and cookbook author Juli Bauer.A blogger extraordinaire at Paleo OMG, Juli, along with George Bryant, is the author of The Paleo Kitchen, a cookbook previously reviewed by me. Now, in Julie Bauers Paleo Cookbook, this amazingly talented lady shines again.I love Julis direct approach, her sassy personality that comes alive on the pages of her latest book, and of course the recipes. Be sure to read Julis introduction where she explains why she created this book. These pages will help you to know her better and look forward to the taste treats further along. Also in the Intro are tips to make Paleo easier as well as the basics one getting started with a Paleo lifestyle needs to know.The recipes are divided into sections: Breakfast; Poultry; Beef; Pork and Lamb; Fish and Seafood; Soups, Salads and Sides;  Snacks; Desserts; Drinks and Shakes and basics which covers all the sauces and dressings. As a former fan of Nutella, I loved Julis Easy Chocolate Hazelnut Spread (p. 292) which recreates the decadent chocolate hazelnut confection in a healthy way. I also suggest her Truffle Aioli thats simply delicious with French fries and uses homemade mayo and white truffle oil.Street Fish Tacos (p. 150) is a winner and is becoming my new go-to taco dish. The recipe calls for homemade tortillas (p. 290), avocado cream, seasoned tilapia fillets, and a red onion, cabbage and cilantro slaw infused with fresh lime juice. Muy Bueno!Each recipe is a culinary masterpiece, gorgeously presented by Juli and photographed by the winning team of Bill Staley and Haley Mason of primal palate fame. I love how this book is laid out and am delighted with the recipe selection. (Check out the Winter Squash Salad (p. 172) with its Maple Mustard Vinaigrette. Yum!)This beautifully presented cookbook deserves a place on your shelf. I guarantee Julis fresh approach will have your family singing her (and YOUR) culinary praises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ5QV9LMII3TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141FSYTI#wasThisHelpful","RZ5QV9LMII3TH","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a bottle of Neutrogena Body Oil for an honest review. Earlier this year I reviewed another brand and was skeptical since brand x left a film on my body that I didnt like. Not so Neutrogena Light Sesame Formula. This oil really absorbs into your skin and leaves it soft and supple (and since Im no spring chicken, that says a lot!)I love Neutrogenas other bath products and this one ranks right up there with the others. I use it after my bath while my skin is still damp. The oil vanishes into my skin within minutes, leaves it soft and very delicately scented. Ive also used it smoothed on my face as a light day moisturizer. I could add a few drops of essential oil, however, I love the delicate fragrance already there so wont do that. This is truly a delightful boon to any skin type.

"If you struggle to achieve the right work/life balance and most of the self-help books on this topic all seem pretty much the same, I invite you to read Bogus Balance by Deirdre Maloney. Not only does she stress-relieving tried and true aids, she was in this same situation. Until she discovered in her own life that you cant really achieve that balancethat trying to do so creates family problems, relationship problems and a host of other stressesand she set about learning how to achieve bliss and that it requires making choices, only then did she come to grips with her problem.Deirdre learned in her own life and in interviews with many others who had arrived at a blissful compromise that sacrifice, choice and deciding what one really wants out of life are the keys to achieving a happy, balanced and blissful life. You cant have it all, so you must decide on what part of all you need.Life is a journey, and you can choose stress or bliss. In our electronic and digital age it becomes harder to do. Thats where choices come in. Deirdre offers her own perspective on making the right choices based on personal experience and research. Divided into three sections, the book covers I. Breaking down the bogus part, II. Building up the blissful part, and III. Battling those sneaky bliss-busters.Maloney writes in an easy and believable style, but inside are deeply relevant principles to help you make the best choices for your individual life needs. Not only is it readable, it warrants rereading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HTTGJYMY9H10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984027351#wasThisHelpful","R3HTTGJYMY9H10","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a FoodSavor vacuum sealer and it came with a supply of FoodSaver bags. When I ran out, I bought a different brand. Bad idea! Not only were the bags thinner, often I couldnt get a good seal. I thought my old vacuum sealer must be failing. When I had the opportunity to try these FoodSaver bags, my faith in that little gem was restored.I garden and like to extend my harvest by saving all the produce. These bags are especially nice for freezing and storing excess bell pepper strips. On shopping trips to Costco, I dont hesitate to buy in bulk because I know I can pack what I dont need now into freezer bags and store with confidence therell be no freezer burn. I package chunks of wild-caught salmon, bulk ground beef, homemade seasoned tomato sauce and so much more.I have a chest freezer and have never experienced freezer burn using FoodSaver bags.

"I have osteoarthritis and prefer not to take NSAIDS. For years I was taking a combination of Glucosamine and Chondroitin, and then my trusted nutritionist recommended adding MSM to the formulation. This has kept me relatively pain free, however, I have difficulty swallowing large capsules or tablets. Viva Labs Triple Strength Glucosamine, Chrondroitin and MSM capsules are a smaller size and perfect for me.I have used other Viva labs supplements and find they are of high quality With a combination of 750mg of glucosamine sulfate, 600mg of chondroitin and 500mg of MSM it provides a 5:4 ratio, considered ideal for maintaining healthy cartilage and forming connective tissue in a synergistic formula. The glucosamine sulfate is bound to potassium chloride which helps the stability of the glucosamine. What does this formula do for me? Virtually no pain or joint discomfort.I follow a holistic diet that precludes putting manufactured anti-inflamatories in my body. This formula takes the discomfort out of everyday activity.The large 240 capsule bottle lasts for 4 months if taken as directed (two capsules per day).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7E96DWQE9YI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSUPCS#wasThisHelpful","R7E96DWQE9YI8","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love a good pair of kitchen shears and have been very pleased with my current shears. However, in the interest of giving a fair, unbiased comparison to another brand, I was happy to receive these Fiskars Heavy-Duty Shears for an honest review.Firstly, after considerable difficulty opening the plastic package, I gave the shears a run-through of the basics: paper (a bit too wobbly with the separating design to effectively cut paper), string (worked well), chicken breasts (easy peasy, even with my arthritic hands), thick steak (again, very easy to cut through). They are thin and curved to make trimming easy and theres a power notch that enables you to cut bone without wearing on the blades. They come with a protective sheath and have a take-apart design to place the used shears in a dishwasher.Touted as part cleaver, part chefs knife, they work well for most applications. While I like the idea of a take-apart design, it also makes the shears a bit too wobbly to cut paper effectively, and my inability to do this makes me knock off one star for precision, because they are not precision when they dont perform all the tasks. Still, I give them high marks for meat and tendon cutting and for being dishwasher safe. I also appreciate the lifetime warranty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14ZJQ6NX3R39E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJUNHVU#wasThisHelpful","R14ZJQ6NX3R39E","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a pair of the blue Motorola Talkabout T460 Two-Way Radio Pairs for an honest review. Heres my take on them:They are fairly compact ( 4 1/2-inch body with a 2 -inch antenna) with a range of features that are easy to use. They sit well in the hand, are reasonably lightweight for hand holding, and also have a hard plastic belt clip for easy transport. 22 channels and 21 privacy codes ensure the availability of finding a private channel.While the directions seem fairly simple, I had to go through the instructions a few times to have a flawless operation. Maybe Im not that intuitive, but with so many buttons and not being familiar with walkie talkies, it was confusing at first.You power on the device by turning the cap on top clockwise (all the way for high volume). Press the music note on the face of the device to ring the other person. Then to talk, theres a cartouche to depress (the top for high power, the bottom for low). My husband and I tried both and didnt notice any degradation using just the low power. However, in our forested, mountainous living area, theres no way we could get more than a couple miles transmission range with either power output. At three miles the signal dropped off entirely. This tells me that range is dependent upon terrain and forestation or structures.The top round button is a flashlight; not really powerful, but bright enough for map-reading or similar. An orange emergency alert button on the same side as the two mentioned sends a strong signal. I managed to get the latest weather update through the NOAA weather channel. In short, everything worked as advertised except the range.These units do not come with a charging cradle, however, each has a power cord with a plug on one end and a micro-usb connection on the other. With the micro-usb, the devices can be charged with a solar charger if youre away from an electrical outlet. On the negative side, battery life is about 24 hours, even with little use which, along with having no charging cradle, knocks one star off my rating. Still, this is a nice pair of radio units and worth considering. They seem well made and damage/weather resistant.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMPVZ3EF7YJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BKQ4#wasThisHelpful","RTMPVZ3EF7YJF","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this George Foreman GFO200S Indoor/Outdoor Grill for an honest review. Heres my take on it.With a 200 square-inch cooking surface, this indoor/outdoor grill will easily serve 12, so no need to cook in batches. The temperature is controlled by a round dial, and items cook evenly. As with the George Foreman original two-plate grill, the surface slants downward so grease runs off and is collected in a tray. The stand and legs snap on easily for patio use or you can set in on a table or counter to use indoors. (A note of warning: the unit gets hot, so be sure to place it on some type of insulating board as it can crack Corian.) The grill plate is treated with a tough non-stick coating so is easy to wipe clean. Its also lightweight and attractive. These are the pluses.On the negative side, the stand seems a bit flimsy and the unit is rather large to store. Being electric, this is not an item youd want sitting out in the weather.indoor and out, you may want to do some careful comparisons with competing offerings. Another point worth mentioning is the grease-collecting tray, though dishwasher-safe, is not very sturdy.I give it five stars for cooking ease but am taking off one star for flimsiness and storage difficulty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDRXFL9GMFHPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWZA#wasThisHelpful","RDRXFL9GMFHPK","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are Wellness Core fans and have used this brand on our 21-year-old kitty and now on our two-year-old indoor male. Hes been getting a mixture of grain-free wet food and the Wellness Core Indoor Formula and hes done very well with this combination. When I had the opportunity to preview the original formula (slightly higher in calories and with the addition of fist to the formula), I ordered a package. He really loves any food with fish as an ingredient, and Original Formula is no exception. As with the Indoor Formula, he gets a mixture of dry kibble and wet food in small portions a few times a day. It agrees with him and he has a wonderfully glossy coat, good teeth and is in great health.I am as concerned about what kind of diet he eats as I am about our food. Wellness makes quality pet foods and I am confident hes getting a good nutritional balance. Its nice to know that the people at Wellness also recommend a combination of wet and dry food to help increase the level of water in the cats diet.Yes, Wellness Core cost a bit more than grocery store cat food, but we believe in optimal nutrition for our fur babies, and it is so worth it to know were giving him the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27E5AOFX8YARZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M0JL92#wasThisHelpful","R27E5AOFX8YARZ","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Microbiome is the name given to the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut. Its become popular today to rethink not only our lifestyle and what we eat, but how clean we are in our personal lives. In this age of over-dependence on vaccines and antibiotics for every little ailment, and the need to sanitize everything we touch, we are actually depriving our bodies of the balance of good germs to bad that actually build our immune systems and keep us healthy.Gastroenterologist and author Robynne Chutkan explains why we need to eat a peck of dirt before we die and much much more. She explains why using hand sanitizers may be counter-productive and why we need to eat more natural, fermented foods.Ive been treating hormonal and gut imbalance and found Robynnes book helpful and very readable. In addition to explaining the how and why, Robynne offers a number of recipes for simple gut-healing foods as well as cleaning products.  She ascribes to the live dirty, eat clean life and suggests we do the same. I found her writing style both refreshing and informative.She also shares practical advice Ive never seen elsewhere. For example why its so much better to have a natural childbirth than a Cesarean section, because the fluids a baby gathers as it comes down the birth canal provide essential bacteria to build the babys immune system and which helps to prevent allergies.The diet in Robynnes book is mostly a low sugar, high fiber onethe ingredients we need for a healthy gut.Very well done, and kudos to Dr. Chutkan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BJAAQM3KWI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1583335765#wasThisHelpful","R34BJAAQM3KWI3","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me kale is an acquired taste, so Im usually putting it in salads and making a somewhat spicy dressing to overpower the kale taste. Kale chips are a some and some item. Some are quite tasty and some are pretty blah.Rhythm Superfoods Kale chips rank somewhere in between. Theres a decent ranch taste, but the consistency is rather dry and bland. My sample bag had three or four chunky bites and the rest were crushed into little bitty pieces that required a spoon to eat.Sodium is 220 mg. and sugar 3 g. per serving, both a bit more than I like to see, but the taste is better than average and they are relatively healthy. They have 7 grams of fat per serving (two servings to a bag), derived mostly from sunflower and sesame seeds.These snack bits are rather pricey for what you get.

"Ron Cantor has penned a very fine fictional book on the identity theft many churches and gentiles have had in trying to eradicate the ""Jewishness"" of our Lord and Savior. Though written as fiction, Cantor backs up what he says with scriptural documentation. The facts remain: Yeshua (Jesus) was a Jew, a Rabbi, a teacher in the synagogues, as were Paul and Peter.

"The Phantom Aquatics Impulse 1500 LED Dive Light offers a sealed magnetic side switch with three brightness settings. The switch, as well as the flashlight body, is well made and durable.While installing the batteries is fairly intuitive, it took a bit to figure out how to unscrew the case as it came with NO instructions save a tiny card that tells you to remove the batteries after use.It comes with a neoprene hand holster and an adjustable wrist lanyard with a rubberized tube, but no instructions. I checked online and found nothing.Using the latest USA CREE XM-L2(U2) LED, it provides a maximum 1500 lumens output and has over 18 hours runtime. It is a robust tool, weighing in at a little over 1  pounds. The light intensity, however, is incredible, particularly at the high beam. The batteries are rechargeable and the unit comes with a generic charger. It took just three hours for the battery charging lights to go from red to green. Also, there are three additional o-rings to use as replacements whenever needed.Instructions on the tiny card say to wash off any salt water after use. I will be using this powerful light for camping and similar activities.My only complaint(s) had to do with overall weight and the difficulty of keeping one of the o-rings from bulging out of the flashlight body when screwing the barrel back on.

"I tested these earbud headphones today while riding my spin bike and have to say they do the job quite well. Of course they dont have the sound quality of my Monster earbuds, but for workouts, they are better because they stay in place, thanks to their over the ear design.They were easy to put on and easy to adjust. I listened to a podcast and found the voice quality very acceptable. They are comfortable to wear, and not likely to fall off. I used them with an iPhone 4 and was able to pause the sound for mobile phone use. Unfortunately, I live in a cell dead area so wasnt able to test the phone quality. Not a problem for me since these will be used almost exclusively for podcasts and music while running or exercising.Noise isolation is average since they dont have a tight ear canal fit, but again, not a problem. The bottom line is they are inexpensive, they stay put and do the job. The green color is kinda neat, too.

"We adopted our fur person two years ago, and since then weve had him on a grain-free diet. I was happy to try Instinct Raw Boost Mixer Chicken Formula Dry Food for Cats since it fit all my criteriaraw, grain-free, gluten-free, preservative-free. Its not a complete food but an additive to your cats regular diet. Our boy eats moist food with a little kibble, so the mixer seemed ideal as a treatfive or six chunks on top of his wet food.Unfortunately, its not one he loves. He eats it, but only after leaving it in the dish for a while, so I guess to him the flavor is not irresistible. I love the all-natural ingredients and feel it is a superior food source, however, based on the taste test, I can only give these treats four stars.

"I loved Russ Crandalls The Ancestral Table and was delighted to have the opportunity to review Paleo Takeout. Its good looking, the photos are wonderful and the recipes easy to follow no matter your skill level or whether you are new to Paleo or a long-time follower, as am I.Russ story of how he came to Paleo (stroke by age 25) is inspiring and a shout out for letting nutrition and diet do the work instead of over-medicating. As for the content, its everything you want to see in a Paleo takeout bookfavorite restaurant recipes made Paleo, variations on a common theme (as in the recipes for Sweet and Sour Chicken, General Tsos Chicken, Orange Chicken, etc) with the sauces, and a variety of themes ranging from Chinese to Japanese and Korean, to Southeast Asian and beyond, and ending with American classics.My first recipe from the book was the Sweet and Sour Chicken (p. 64), followed by Orange Chicken (p. 66). Both are taste sensations, and the leftovers are pretty darn good. Russ has perfected the art of Paleo breading. The trick is to flour the meat first, THEN dip in beaten egg and plop in the hot grease. Done this way, the coating stays on and has a soft, bready texture. I added the thinly sliced green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds but added some torn cilantro, a personal favorite with Chinese takeout.My next menu from the book is going to include a Greek Gyro (p. 256). Theres recipes for the gyro meat, a flatbread, Greek salad and Tzatziki Sauce. One of my pre-Paleo Santa Cruz treats was a visit to our local Greek restaurant for gyros in pita bread. Ive been hungering for this dish and am ecstatic to know I can have it again in a Paleo-ized version. (All I need to make this Hellenic perfection is a bottle of retsina.)Russ shares recipes for beef, chicken or bison broth, barbecue sauce, chili oil and mayo, honey mustard and ketchup to keep the menu Paleo. There are recipes for guacamole, perfect oven fries, both cauliflower and grain rice and even a perfect burger bun.I guarantee youll have exciting adventures cooking up the delights in Paleo Takeout.

"I was offered the CM4 Q Case in Pacific Green for an honest review. Here's my take on it:The case comes nicely packaged in a small box with a screen cleaning cloth and a flat screen cover included. The clear screen protector is easy to apply, however, I chose not to use it. The case fits easily over my iPhone 4 and looks very classy. The front is a silicone that's easy to handle and the back has a suede-like cover that holds up to three credit cards and/or cash. The buttons are responsive and the camera works equally well with or without the cover.I love the look and like how comfortable it feels in the hand. Definitely the nicest case I've used. Easy to spot with the attractive color, great soft feel and for the minimalist, a no-brainer when shopping. You can insert a credit card, your driver's license and an insurance card and you're set to go.

"I received this bra in exchange for an honest review. Heres my take on it.The taupe pattern is attractive and the underwires are minimalized, almost to the point of being unnoticeable. The fabric is lovely and the bra fits well and has adjustable straps. I found it very comfortable to wear though Im not sure Id call the effect of the bra slimming. It was, however, well-fitting and didnt slip and slide as do my other Playtex Secrets bras (different style and fabric). I have worn it under both light-colored tee shirts and a rayon blouse with equally good results. Have not washed it yet. Washing instructions recommend hand-washing, however, I generally toss my unmentionables into a zippered net bag and wash on the gentle cycle and will with this bra, too.Would I choose this bra again?

"I teach classes at a local gym and need to make note of my times to be there plus a myriad of other appointments and scheduling, so Ive been using planners for years. I prefer the weekly/monthly format since most of the time Im filling in only the monthly pages. This one has a minimalist look and the size is convenient. It, however, is the first one Ive used that is not spiral bound, and that will take some getting used to, but since this was sent gratis for an honest review, Im putting it into service starting next month.To its credit the pages lay nearly flat and the day squares are a decent size to jot notes. I dont care for the orange font on the pages or index tabs because they are hard to read in low-light situations. I would also prefer the tabs be reinforced rather than merely printed on paper. The planner has two ribbon place markers, probably a good thing. The cover is a hardboard material with a burlap-like finish and it looks like a composition book.Its well organized and practical, so Ill give it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APW92WKK81HQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC6CAI#wasThisHelpful","R2APW92WKK81HQ","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am reviewing a wireless dual band range extender provided free in exchange for an honest review. I have previously reviewed two similar products by a different manufacturer, however, using an older model router.Recently, I exchanged my Comcast modem for one of their WPS model router/modems. Interestingly, with this stronger router, my need for a range extender lessened since I wasnt experiencing the drop-off rates I had noticed before, so I wasnt sure how effective the TP-LINK RE210 AC750 Universal Wireless Dual Band Range Extender would be. I do, however, have a very large house with many walls between the router and the areas where I need wi-fi, so I figured this would be a decent test.First of all, the setup couldnt have been easier. After plugging in the range extender about 15 feet away from the router, I managed to set it up using the WPS button on the top of the router. Then I moved it to the desired location and found it functioning perfectly. It even set up the password automatically! (The same as my router/modem with an ext tacked on.)I mainly use the wi-fi with my smartphone to read email when away from my computer or to listen to podcasts in other areas of the house. The router/modem accommodates all that, but astoundingly, I can now listen to podcasts out in my greenhouse and the vegetable garden which are at least 60 feet from the building. This I could not do with just the router/modem, and not before with my old non-wps router and the other range extenders. So I give this unit a solid two thumbs up for performance. Its not the sleekest piece of equipment with its boxy shape and dual antennae, but it does the job and does it well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296ZYFY2KD1R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQD2BYK#wasThisHelpful","R296ZYFY2KD1R7","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this Brinks commercial marine resettable lock for an honest review. Heres my take on it.Touted as the ultimate lock for marine environments, I figured it would be perfect for our emergency gate at our castal mountain home where we normally get an abundance of rainfall and fog.I really like the concept, the sturdy boron shackle and the resettable combination. Everything including its construction should garner it a solid five-star review, howeverThe back opening where you move the lever, opens easily as directed, but the front, where you need to set the dials to either open the lock or reset the combination does not open easily. It took me four tries to get the front open, then I was unable to get the lock to open after resetting it. I gave it to my husband to figure out, and while he managed to reset the combination, hes having the same problem with the front cover not opening easily. Unfortunately, this is a game-changer for us since we have to be able to open it to use it. Perhaps we were send a bad lock, but I can only give it two stars with a faulty front dial cover. Im sorry I cant give it a more positive review.Update: Another lock was sent and this one works well. We are using it on our outside gate with no problems. I have therefore adjusted my rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MHSQNWE5J1N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NV6X67O#wasThisHelpful","R1MHSQNWE5J1N0","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent this Stainless water bottle by Contigo for an honest review. Heres my take on it.I like the cool design and color. I like that the water really stays cool and that the liner is BPA-free, also that it doesnt leak when lying on my cars leather seat (Have to lay it down since my vintage Volvo doesnt come with drink rings that fit the diameter of this bottle.).It snaps closed and has a carry handle, that, while not comfortable to carry, at least offers that option. The push-button lid snaps open and makes it easy to use.I use bottled spring water at home so this is what I fill the bottle with 100% of the time. My only complaint aside from the nominally uncomfortable carry handle is that the interior can only be cleaned using a bottle brush. Even with spring water, a film will build up over time and will require cleaning. The opening is small enough that not any bottlebrush can be used.Otherwise, I am enjoying using this bottle which is a good-looking and efficient alternative to my old stainless bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGHQKLJUL8U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","R1JGHQKLJUL8U1","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our two-year-old tuxedo loves this Pro Plan True Nature Grain-Free Chicken & Liver Entre. Hes been getting a diet of grain-free since he came to live with us at four months of age. Our last kitty spent her last few years on a diet of moist, grain-free food, and we could see the benefits, so we decided to start this guy on a strictly grain-free diet.On opening the first can, I noticed both smell and texture were visually appealing. I checked the ingredients online before ordering and was satisfied they were suitable. Kitty loved it from the first mouthful! I think in cat food as in other things in life, you get what you pay for and the cost is comparable to other high quality brands such as Avoderm and Against the Grain.

"I should state up front that Ive been usingand lovingdown pillows for the last three decades. I need to replace one of my down queen pillows so took the opportunity to give shredded memory foam a test drive.Some time in the middle of the night I need to flip my down pillow over to achieve the loft I prefer. I thought memory foam might make this practice obsolete, so I settled on the shredded memory foam. Bad decision for this reviewer. Not only is the memory foam pillow heavy, that new car smell is rank. It is also very lumpy. Furthermore, the loft is way too high for me to rest comfortably. This pillow is probably the most uncomfortable pillow Ive ever used. I love down, love the fact that I can wash it. The shredded memory foam is only surface cleanable, plus the benefits of breathable bamboo are negated by putting a pillow case over it. I will bite the bullet and purchase a quality down pillow.I had high expectations for this pillow. Perhaps other will find it more to their liking.

"I feed our two-year-old tuxedo a diet of grain-free food so was interested to try the Wellness CORE Air Dried Natural Grain Free Dry Cat Food. Hes an indoor-only kitty, so the indoor formula was perfect.I like that the formula is mostly meat (70%), but noted it also has some veggies (peas) and fruit (cranberries) as well as other nutrients. Upon opening the sealable bag, I noted the scent is not unpleasant, however, the kibble is somewhat moist, not at all like the Wellness CORE dry food we normally give him. He gets a diet of moist and dry food, and while we originally tried him on Wellness CORE wet food, he would not eat it, though he likes the dry kibble. So, first serving he ate well, but he doesnt seem as interested in subsequent servings.

"I find my iPhone needs a charge about halfway through the day. Now, with the OtterBox I can charge my phone with the push of a button when out and about. I also appreciate the added military spec drop protection.The case fits well but is a little hard to put on or remove, probably a good thing so it wont slip out if dropped. Also, since it is a charging case, its a bit thicker than a phone with an ordinary case. Its not a problem for me but it does add extra bulk.

"As a Christian I have long been aware of the significance of the Passover but have focused more on the last supper observance. However, for some time my research has guided me into a deeper, more Mes-sianic following. Rabbi Moffics conversational style made understanding the Passover seder from a Jewish point of view much more meaningful by showing the parallels between Jewish history and the ancient Israelites flight from Egypt and their relationship to Messianic times. History and theology are woven together into a seamless tapestry that should add significant meaning to Gods relationship with his peopleboth the true vine and those grafted in.I appreciated the chapter on Blessing and Questioning at the beginning of the seder as Rabbi Moffic shows the reader how to prepare for a Passover seder in ones home. He covers everything from cleans-ing the house in preparation to the closing songs and he does it with interesting personal anecdotes that make for easy, but meaningful, reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26PK9GBTLWGI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426791569#wasThisHelpful","R26PK9GBTLWGI9","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a long anticipated book from Urban Poser blogger and chef Jenni Hulet. Suffering from an autoimmune condition in 2010, Ms. Hulet went from active mom, yoga instructor and chef to being barely able to get out of bed. Over a course of tests, Jennis condition was diagnosed and she began a course of recovery. Now she delights in creating beautiful and tasty delicacies for those who also suffer from such conditions.My Paleo Patisserie is a stunning hardcover book by Victory Belt Publishing. Beautifully photographed, this book is a must for your baking collection. I love Jennis reasons for creating her book, listed in the Why Paleo Patisserie section. The Food as a Common Language theme resonated with me as did the Artisan Approach. Other short sections include helpful tips and weight versus volume in the Getting Started section. Other sections discuss various ingredients and the equipment required. Other short sections include helpful tips and weight versus volume in the Getting Started section. Other sections discuss various ingredients and the equipment required. Chapters 1 through 9 cover Fillings, Frostings and Glazes, Choux Pastry, Tarts (my favorite dessert), Cakes, Cookies, Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts, Marshmallows and Savory Pastries.As a Primal/Paleo follower and avid culinary artist I was excited to try some of Jennis creations to upgrade my own grain-free dishes. After looking over some of the outstandingly beautiful and creative desserts, I, too, wanted to see if I could create dishes as beautiful and tasty as Jennis.My first foray into Patisserie was Jennis gorgeous and oh-so-tasty Citron Tart (p. 114). Made with a nut-free crust and lemon curd, the result is as delicious as it is beautiful. Im a fan of lemon curd, and this one is made with honey or maple syrup for sweetener. To say we loved it is an understatement!If eclairs or cream puffs are your passion, theres a section with many flavors and shapes; I particularly liked the Double Chocolate Blackberry Cream Puffs (p. 95) made using Chocolate Choux Buns (p. 76) and Chocolate Whipped Cream (p. 49) which is coconut cream for those with a casein intolerance. They are not only delicious, but a sight to behold, and every bit as artistic as any wheat flour confection. Another outstanding recipe is the Italian Almond Cookies (p. 175). We love these almond flour and maple sugar morsels for our afternoon tea, and so will you.While none of the recipes is difficult for an experienced cook, some are certainly more involved. Its definitely a book for someone who loves the creative process and appreciated perfection. But dont shy away from it just because you might feel its too advanced. Every method used here has easy-to-follow how-to tips to guide you through.Mr. Hulets expertise and culinary skills shine in the breathtakingly beautiful book. I highly recommend it to anyone intrigued with beauty, great taste and looking for thoroughly professional results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN558DQLYXRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628600446#wasThisHelpful","RLN558DQLYXRP","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this timepiece is lovely with its bold look and the gold and black styling. Much larger and heavier than other watches I have worn, but bold pieces are popular and with the curved tonneau-shaped case, it lays flat on my wrist. Also, the dial is fairly easy to read, even with my imperfect vision.The watch has a Japanese quartz movement and a 36 mm gold-plated stainless steel case. The triple-row bracelet has a deployment-clasp closure that opens on the inside, thus avoiding accidental opening or catching on clothing.I like most things about the watch, however, it is, as I stated, large, more of a unisex style except for the pink spade at the twelve oclock position. Being large, it is also fairly heavy which might be problematic for some. I think this design is best suited to a large woman. Even so, most women will need to have the band resized. I have average-to-large wrists and I needed four links taken out.On the plus side, the watch is both dressy and sporty so is suitable for all occasions. Its easy to set and so far, mine has kept excellent time. As another reviewer noted, the battery stops when the stem is pulled out, a nice touch for extending battery life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QCT061X3PWAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00945U1F6#wasThisHelpful","R3QCT061X3PWAV","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This towel (30 W x 84 L) fits nicely over my yoga mat and works well for hot yoga. I havent tried it over a mat for power yoga, however, I feel it works better to help absorb sweat than as a mat for yoga moves.The medium grey color is nice and it seems well made.  My main complaint is that because it is microfiber, it catches on rough skin which is annoying. Also, the mat/towel is quite thin. If a quick-dry towel that absorbs moisture is a requirement, this may be the towel for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6Y7GYP1469Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2PBURW#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6Y7GYP1469Y","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I recently received for review Make it Paleo II, the new cookbook by Bill Staley and Hayley Mason, along with Hayley's sister, Caitlin Grace Nagelson. I'm familiar with Bill and Hayley's other books, having copies of Gather: the Art of Paleo Entertaining and the first Make it Paleo, both of which I love. I hadn't known about Hayley's younger sister who is a notable sushi chef. Credentials aside, I am blown away by the beauty of this book and the wonderful recipes the trio have presented.The book is divided into three sections, the first, as one might expect, an introduction to what is Paleo, the basics, ingredients, tools, cooking techniques and more. I was happy to see an explanation of why a small amount of white rice (considered an ancient grain, since cultivation began perhaps as far back as 12,000 years ago) and potatoes might be acceptable additions to a Paleo diet. (A cautionary note: even though one might tolerate this nightshade member, it's not going to help with weight loss.)The middle--and largest--section presents the recipes, each accompanied by a spectacular photo (by Bill Staley) of the finished dish. There are nine sub-sections,starting with Meat and going down the line to Poultry and Eggs, Seafood, Plants, Sauces and Dressings, Basics and Projects, Drinks, Savory Things and Sweet Things. I began my culinary experimentation with the Lamb Barbacoa Tacos (p. 80). Included are recipes for a Pico de Gallo to serve over the meat and wonderful, crepe-like tortilla, big as one made with wheat flour. The dish is not complicated, though it takes four hours in a slow cooker. The flavors are outstanding. The Beef Daube (p. 60) is another winner. The recipe calls for beef stew; I used a grass-fed chuck roast cut into one-inch chunks.Next on my list is the Orange Chicken (p. 128). It has a batter made with arrowroot starch and so closely resembles non-Paleo battered coatings. Orange zest tops the orange-y sauce. My favorite sauce has to be the Carmelized Maple Balsamic (p. 234) which can be used on salads or ice cream. In the dessert section, I was amazed at the beautifully made Nut-free Tart Crust. So many Paleo pastries show pie and tart crusts that look a bit...uh...homemade. Not this one. As a tart lover, this is definitely on my ""to-try soon"" list.All Paleo books strive to showcase their recipes and tips in a different way, offering something unique. I like Make It Paleo II on several levels including the sections on kitchen tools and how to adjust for particular dietary requirements. But in the end, it has to be the recipes that draws one to a particular book. Make It Paleo II contains many recipes that reflect my own food favorites. This is a masterpiece in culinary instruction with really good-tasting recipes I will use time and again. Bravo Bill, Hayley and Caitlin.UPDATE: This week I made the Skillet Chicken Thighs (p. 136). Oh. My. Goodness! What an amazing recipe. Stupid easy simple, too. Just be sure to buy skin-on, bone-in thighs (I used Mary's from my local natural food store). Hayley gives her simple tip for boning the thighs (and suggest you save the bones for bone broth). This is a quick, comfort food, and the crispy chicken, Mediterranean olives and artichoke hearts add an extra measure of wonderfulness. Make sure you use an oven-proof skillet so you give the dish its full 25 minutes in a hot oven. As with me, this might just become your next favorite chicken dish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDNWKY910REO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628600594#wasThisHelpful","R2IDNWKY910REO","ACQYIC13JXAOI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ACQYIC13JXAOI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I spent a long time trying to make a decision between this heater and the Aqueon 06105 Pro Heaters Submersible Aquarium Heater, 50-Watt.  Finally, I presented a question here and on the product page for the Aqueon, asking reviewers which they would choose ""today"" (it's the end of October 2015 now).  Overall, the most resounding answer was to choose the Eheim.Both of the Eheim and the Aqueon have very attractive features.  One thing I thought about was that this heater has a 3 year warranty, while the Aqueon has a life-time warranty.  Also, this heater is made with glass as opposed to Aqueon's aluminum.  Despite that, it seemed that the Eheim had better features when it came to even temp control and easy to access and read thermostat controls.This heater comes pre-set at 80 degrees.  After some initial adjusting, I found that it's keeping my 10 gallon tank at 80 degrees with the thermostat set at 75.  The weather is a bit warm right now, so I might have to adjust the thermostat as the temperatures get much colder.  One thing to bear in mind is that this 50 watt heater is around nine inches in length.  That's a lot longer than any aquarium heater I've used in the 50 watt size.I really like that I can easily see the numbers on the thermostat dial.  Also, because the heater is so tall, the thermostat dial is very close to my aquarium's surface.  All this makes it very easy to set the thermostat without endless fiddling, or worse, having to take the heater out of the aquarium.  When the heater is on, there is an easy to see amber indicator light.  The two suction cups that affix the heater to the wall are very effective.So far, I'm very pleased with this product.  I will update this review as time passes to let you know how things progress.  In the meantime, I'm posting some pictures from my initial experiences.Um, not sure what is up with Amazon, multiple copies of my phots keep showing up despite my removing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K7QT6TZ97FUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U82YEY#wasThisHelpful","R1K7QT6TZ97FUR","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, this detergent smells great!  We have also used the lavender liquid hand soap and the lavender surface cleaner by Mrs. Meyer's, so we had an idea of what to expect as far as scent.  It gets our clothes just as clean as Ecos detergent (which does a good job).  The scent is not overpowering, just clean and floral.Something to consider with regard to our experience:  We have a high efficiency front loading Whirlpool Duet washer in which we wash super large loads.  If the Whirlpool recommended amount of detergent is not used, the clothes do not come clean.  Therefore, we often have to use almost twice as much detergent as the Mrs. Meyer's suggested amount.  With our high efficiency washer, we save more in the long run.. but for us, we have had to keep detergent quantity requirements in mind  when counting how many loads a bottle will yield.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ANG5X0IBJVOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074FFY3M#wasThisHelpful","R3ANG5X0IBJVOX","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Depending on your intended use for this light, this light may be ideal or it may fall a bit short your expectations.  I purchased this light in search of light that would be good for our live plants while still providing the light spectrum for ideal fish color enhancement.  To that end, I actually ordered this light, the Zoo Med Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb T8 15 Watts, 18-Inch, and the Zoo Med Reef Sun 50and50 Fluorescent T8 Bulb 15 Watts, 18-Inch.  In this review, I intend to help you determine which light might be best for you.After the Zoo Med Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb T8 15 Watts, 18-Inch, I found the Trichromatic to be the next best for maximum plant growth. This light is more in line with ""sunlight"" and is in the ""yellow"" light spectrum. This probably provides the most natural looking light of all. After using this for a while, I noticed that algae growth was stimulated. Plant growth was very good.  In contrast, the Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb has a tones that fall more into the red spectrum (sort of a pinkish).  The Ultra Sun definitely provides a more natural appearance.  If that's your goal, then this light might be good for you.While the Zoo Med Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb T8 15 Watts, 18-Inch seemed to provide the most ideal light for plant growth, my family and I really don't care for the pink hues it casts in our aquarium.  The aquarium is still quite beautiful, but we can't help but compare it to the other two lights.  Ultimately, though, it is this light that we use most of the time.  When we have guests over or when we want a change, we briefly switch over to the next light...The Zoo Med Reef Sun 50and50 Fluorescent T8 Bulb 15 Watts, 18-Inch is our favorite of these lights.  This light casts hues that are in the ""blues.""  As such, we feel that the colors of the fish really stand out under this lighting.  The one drawback is that the lighting is less than ideal for live plants.  After a couple weeks of exclusive use, our plants looked a bit less healthy.  So, we alternate the 50/50 light with the Coral Flora Sun.  We really don't use the Trichromatic light because we don't care for the ""natural"" look.  We actually prefer the other lights because of how the fish colors are enhanced (particularly the blue colored fish).  This might not suit your taste, so if natural is your goal, the Trichromatic could be best for you.  Again I caution, algae growth will likely be stimulated.As a side note, I've noticed that Amazon's prices for these light fluctuate greatly.  Sometimes they are a bargain compared to pet shops, and sometimes they are ridiculously high.  If price is important to you, you might want to do some price comparing before you buy.I wish you much success with your aquatic hobby.  I hope my comparisons have given you some insight on these products.  If you happen to be near a tropical fish store, you might want to call them to see if they use any of these lights.  That way, you can visit the store to see for yourself how these lights look in an actual aquarium.  If you have any questions about my experiences with these lights, please feel free to ask me in the comment section.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R180PWC3N2GUJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002AQA8E#wasThisHelpful","R180PWC3N2GUJQ","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've found that SubstrateSource is very reputable.  For me, purchasing a plant sight unseen seemed pretty risky, so I had low expectations. In my case, I ordered three plants from SubstrateSource and all arrived in excellent condition (the only blemish was some slight yellowing, no doubt due to not having a light source for a short period).  This plant was anchored in a substance that has a sort of fiberglass consistency.I bought this plant in December 2014.  It's now early August 2015.  My aquarium lighting is not the best, but I do use a Zoo Med Coral Flora Sun Plant Growth Bulb with some effectiveness.Keep in mind, please, that this plant grows VERY slowly.  That being said, it really seems to thrive under my light conditions.  Below is a photo of the plant today.  It's leaves have spread out a bit.  Since it's low growing, it makes a good foreground plant.I've very happy with this purchase, and I recommend SubstrateSource.  If your worried about a ""mail-order plant,"" this company is top notch.Special Note:  When ordering two or more plants at the same time, Substrate Source combines shipping cost and that reduces overall cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTXFSQ9EHOYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YWDMYM#wasThisHelpful","RSTXFSQ9EHOYU","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has been over a month since I set up this aquarium (I wanted to review this after some time had passed to give you a better viewpoint of this aquarium).We have a very aggressive red betta with pink/purple highlights (very unusual).  We were keeping him in a breeding chamber in our community aquarium, but over time I felt that that was not a proper home for him.  So, I bought this aquarium to upgrade him to more palatial digs.  I have to say, he seems to love it.I need to tell you a few things that I did differently:1.  I immediately created a post filter sponge to slip over the output nozzle.  As others have noted, the force of the filter output is quite strong and our betta was swirling around in a vortex.  He did not like that at all!  However, after making this very small modification, everything works perfectly.2.  Instead of the filter media that came with the aquarium, I used the following:  A Seachem 100ml Purigen bag instead of the charcoal that came with the aquarium.  I also used Seachem Matrix for the bio-media.  I contacted Seachem to verify that these products would work well with this filter set-up and they said it would be more than fine.  The Seachcem 100 ml Purigen size bag is major overkill, the the Seachem representative told me that it would just mean that it would last longer.  Since the Purigen is pre-bagged, I just use it in this form because it's way more convenient for me.3.  I added a large Marino Moss ball and a small cave ornament with some artificial plants (after aquarium as some decent substrate, I intend to add some live plants instead of artificial).4.  I added a Cobalt 25 watt heater.  It's black and thin, so it is pretty unobtrusive.  It's an awesome product (although they can be expensive when not on sale).With the above modifications, this aquarium has worked extremely well for me.  Now, I'm not saying you need to do any of these things, I just want to mention how I've done it.  Lots of folk who've written reviews have set up this aquarium in very different ways.  My method is just one of many options.  All the additional things I'm using were purchased here on Amazon and the pricing was competitive, and in some cases, a real bargain.  One last very important thing.  I used Seachem Prime to remove chemicals before adding betta and whenever I've made water change.  Neutralizing harmful chemicals in tap water is very important, so make sure to use some product (not necessarily Prime) to purify your tap water.  I change the water about 30% every week and I vacuum the bottom waste with a siphon.Our aquarium has pretty well cycled (algae bloom is finished).  I think this aquarium is fantastic and I'm very pleased with it.  5 stars all the way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J8QEX2KGA9QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047XMQBM#wasThisHelpful","R2J8QEX2KGA9QH","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is very addicting.  The concept is simple:  Match three or more colored orbs for a successful move against an opponent character.  You have lots of characters to play with and progress is challenging without being so hard that you want to quit.  One special thing that I like about this game is that the developers are constantly making updates and providing more content.  You have an option to pay for extra perks, but you can also play for free without pressure to buy stuff.  As a very young child, I watched Dr. Who back when it was broadcasted on Public Television (in some areas called PBS).  As a youngster, the monsters and villains were terrifying... but I still loved the show.  This game brings back some nice memories.If you grew up with Dr. Who, are a new fan, or just love science fiction games, you might end up really enjoying this one.  If you find ""matching"" games tedious... move on, this game isn't for you.UPDATE 2/25/2015:I wanted to add a few comments to the review I wrote yesterday.  I'd like to stress again that purchasing content is by no means necessary in this game.  Like most games of this type, it just speeds things along.  However, profits from proceeds of this game go back to the BBC to help continue their programming.One thing about the game developers really touched my heart.  A fan of the game wrote to the developers and told them he and his daughter relax to together while playing the game.  His daughter has some difficulties, so game play was hard for her.  Well, the developers actually prepared a special area in the game called ""Anna's Playground.""  This game area is easier to play, so virtually anyone can enjoy game play.  I thought that was most considerate.Yesterday I had a game question... so I sent an e-mail to Support.  I got a very polite response in less than 24 hours.  Very impressive.Also, I got my first weekly newsletter today.  In it are descriptions of special new limited time game bonuses and introductions of new content.I don't think I have ever come across a game where developers are so diligent and really care about their gamers.  Well done!UPDATE 7/2/2015:  I wanted to add some comments to my review.  I am still addicted to this game.  Substantial new content is added each week, so the game remains fresh.  I WANT TO CAUTION YOU:  My Kindle Fire HD had to be reset to factory defaults because it was getting glitchy.  While all my game progress and characters were preserved, my time crystals and time fragments were lost.  I don't really have a problem with this, but you show know about this from the beginning so you don't have a shock later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YQ9DAKRYW0VB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IN3XF76#wasThisHelpful","R2YQ9DAKRYW0VB","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit, I had reservations about ordering such an item via mail order.  However, the fine reviews quelled my concerns and I decided to try it.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The positive reviews are correct.  The moss ball arrived with just the slightest yellowing on one side.  I suspect that that spot was simply the end it sat on... so it was not exposed to light.My daughter soaked the moss ball in filtered (non-chlorinated) water and rinsed it several times.  Then she molded its shape into a nice ball and placed it in our Fluval Spec (two gallon home of our betta).  It sank pretty well and remained stationary.  Our betta looked at it with some interest.  It's now been ten days since we received the moss ball.  It's lush and verdant.  The bonus baby ball is near it, so it looks like mama and baby (kinda cute).  Our betta likes to perch on the fuzzy ball from time to time.This was money well spent for a superior product.  I very highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZXAPWJIRAAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVC527I#wasThisHelpful","R2YZXAPWJIRAAA","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to go in our Fluval Spec 2 gallon tank.  It fits in the tank well and it looks nice.  I cringe when I see some of the artificial plants on the market, but the plants attached to this ornament are pretty decent looking.  The small cave in the center of the tree stump is just the right size for our betta to hang out in.  He went in for the first time (that I've seen) this morning.  He stayed there for a while with his head peeking out.The thing I'm pleased with the most is that the wood looks extremely realistic.  I'm exceptionally happy with its appearance.  The artificial plants are individually detachable if you don't like that look, so you have some choices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIPVUMMKU9L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DHW4W#wasThisHelpful","R1GIPVUMMKU9L2","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To help give you a well rounded view of what kinds of Zoo Med bulbs are out there, I'm going to reference three Zoo Med bulbs I've purchased here on Amazon.  I chose to work with the growth enhancing bulbs after we decided to add live plants to our aquarium.With regard to this light, the spectrum of colors are definitely in the range of pinks.  My experience was that plant growth accelerated very well.  Over a period of just over two weeks, there were some noticeable growth benefits. However, the pink hues seemed oddly unnatural and my family and I found that to be unappealing.  On a positive color enhancing note, fish with red colors or red accents became more vibrantly red.Since we weren't wild about the pinkish hues given off by this light, we decided to try Zoo Med Ultra Sun Trichromatic Super Daylight 6500K Fluorescent Bulb T8 15 Watt, 18-Inch - This light is more in line with natural sunlight and the color spectrum is in the ""yellow"" range.  In the case of this light, plant growth was also accelerated.  However, I noticed that algae growth was stimulated as well.  With the Ultra Sun, to use the colors of our fish seemed to wash out; they appeared duller.  Of course, this light is the most natural in appearance.  I think we are just spoiled by the color effects of the other lights.Lastly, I've worked with Zoo Med Reef Sun 50and50 Fluorescent T8 Bulb 15 Watts, 18-Inch.  This is actually the first light we tried (before we began using real plants).  This light really isn't geared toward plant growth.  It provides light in the short wavelength blue region (more essential for photosynthetic corals and invertebrates).  While I found that plant growth was not really accelerated so much, the 50/50 light still acceptably maintained plant life.  My family and I felt that fish color enhancement was best with this Zoo Med light.  In my wife's words, our aquarium ""looks like a tropical jewel"" with this light.  Because of the blue hues of this light, the colors of blue fish are particularly stunning.FINAL THOUGHTS: Ultimately, despite the color enhancement properties of the 50/50, we mostly use the Coral Flora Sun  We alternate every other week or so with the 50/50 (when plants look sickly, we switch back to the Coral Flora Sun for extended periods).  While we love he color enhancing effects of the 50/50, we are obliged to use the pink hued Coral Flora Sun to maintain plant health.Of course, all the color effects are subjective when it comes to personal taste.  I just want to give you a general idea of what your options are based on my experience.  If possible, see if your local pet shop carries and uses one or more of these lights.  That way you can get a true idea of the lighting effects.One last thing:  You might want to price shop.  I've noticed Amazon prices for these lights fluctuate greatly.  Sometimes the prices are much better than pet shops and sometimes they are much worse.  If this is important to you, you might want to do a little homework before you buy.  I wish you much success with your fish keeping hobby!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3B71YCOL0S2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PBAUOO#wasThisHelpful","RB3B71YCOL0S2","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I planted these last season (2014) and I had good results with germination.  I had some fungus problems with my tomatoes in 2014, so these did not have ideal conditions.  Despite the fungus, these plants did a fair job at continuing to produce despite yellowing and withered leaves.While the color and shape are beautiful, our family found this tomato to be lacking in flavor.  They are beautiful in salads or as a garnish.The dish of tomatoes I posted is mainly the pear tomatoes.

"I bought this case for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  She gets many, many compliments about it.  It goes especially well with a blue iPod.  The pattern is distinctive and elegant, but it's still fun.I bought this through Amazon from Importer520.  I ordered it on December 4th and got it on December 15th.  It went from California to Georgia.  I thought that was a reasonable amount of time for shipping and it was well worth the wait.  It was a surprise for my daughter and she was thrilled by how it looks.UPDATE 02/19/2015:I'm noticing that some folks are not very happy with their purchase of this case.Let me outline my specific experience with this case:1.  I paid 1.88 for this case with 3.49 shipping from Importer520 (which was listed as a USA Seller)2.  I got the case 9 days after I ordered it.3.  The case looked exactly like the one shown on the description page. It has all the correct cutouts (not just one big open space like at least one reviewer noted).4.  My daughter has had this case for 2 months and the corners of the right side are chipping a little bit. Honestly, it looks like normal wear (my daughter is VERY hard on her devices).  All other parts are still vibrant.  She still gets compliments on it.If you are finding that your are having a bad experience with this case, please take advantage of Amazon's A to Z guarantee.  If you happen to get this case through ""Prime,"" you will probably have quicker recourse with any problems you might have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJQPMZ138HP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2C10O6#wasThisHelpful","R3NJQPMZ138HP4","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When these finally mature, they make for excellent disease resistant plants.  Last season, about 50% of my seeds germinated (under ideal conditions where other seeds had 100% germination).  I was not happy about that.  However, of the plants that went on to mature (four of them), I had extremely disease resistant results.  I kept two plants and I gave away the other two plants. The friends I gave them to had very good results as well.I was struck with tomato fungus in my garden this last season.  Only this variety from Organic Seed Supply and Sungold (from another Amazon vendor) continued to produce non-stop after other varieties withered away.I disagree with some of the other reviewers with regard to the flavor of this tomato.  If these are vine ripened, they taste delicious.  They are perfect in salads or even just to pop in your mouth as you pass a vine.  Yes, there are other varieties that might have more flavor, but these are quite decent.  If you want extra sweet disease resistant tomatoes, I recommend Sungold.I had to knock off a star for rate of germination.  With so few seeds in my shipment I expected more.  Regardless, despite the germination issue, they make for a variety that is easier to grow once they get going.I just bought more of these for next season.  As of today (01/10/2014), they are a buck cheaper than last year (2.99 instead of 3.99).UPDATE 3/18/2015:  This year's batch of seeds was excellent.

"This is a beautiful set of potholders.  The fact that they come in many colors makes them particularly attractive.  They have a nice terry cloth texture and they are adequately thick.  We bought these in blue.  We actually liked the generic color because it goes well with existing blue patterns in our kitchen.  Keep in mind that, as the description says, these are ""basic.""  However, they do not have a cheap feel. Our family is very happy with these.UPDATE 01-11-2015:  One thing I want to add is that you need to keep in mind that these potholders are smaller than the average size you typically come across.  However, for me this turns out to be a positive.  You see, when I pickup pot lids, I'm notorious for accidentally getting the potholder into the stove flame.  They often drape over the pot, and I fail to notice that they are draping into the fire too!  With these potholders, it very easy for me to pick up pot lids without having to worry about setting the house on fire.  :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VO2VTJEW4IMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WOJLHY#wasThisHelpful","R3VO2VTJEW4IMB","A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BNVMPIHDYGNQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was interested in this book because the author is a fellow alum from Barnard, and I'm interested in life changing transitions. Chaya is a terrific writer; her command of the language is strong and rare in a younger writer. She does a good job of explaining the different types of religious communities.  To an outsider, these differences can be baffling.Chaya led a happy life in the Orthodox community, where she always felt loved. She enjoyed a happy childhood. She also enjoyed some lucky breaks. A high school teacher encouraged Chaya to do solid academic work and apply to colleges outside the community. Chaya's family didn't block her, although she had to do some negotiation. She was lucky with her roommates and friends at Barnard, too.Chaya also manages to  humanize the community members.  Unlike the movie Fill The Void, this movie doesn't show the community as stifling. Chaya shows that women in her community could be stylish, smart and fun. They are, she says, like everybody else. The community members weren't villains. She loved them.Ultimately Chaya's positive relationship with her religion leads to my biggest concern with the book. There just wasn't a lot of conflict. Chaya didn't seem to need a lot of soul-searching. She didn't have to sneak around or sacrifice her life. She excelled in college.and even after college, she still remained in touch with her family. As she said, they guessed she had fallen away from the religion. The book forced her to bring her new life out in the open.Still, readers will gain insight into a world most of us will never know about. It's a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLN5TZGXSYI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805243178#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLN5TZGXSYI4","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not as good as Suzy's Case - the first Tug Wyler mystery - but not bad either. Held my interest due to good writing and complex but not overwhelming plot.Tug, the hero and POV character, is mostly likeable but can be annoying. He's quick to cut a deal: he's always in trouble with the Bar Association.  He comes across as dominated by his wife, who's definitely manipulative and close to abusive. In this book he reveals she's a lawyer (I may have missed it earlier) which makes her even more dangerous. I just wish he'd get some backbone.The other characters are practically caricatures. Cookie the dancer has been sidelined with a horrible brain injury that's hard to read about. (It looks like this series should come with a warning, Not For The Squeamish.) The subplot - or side plot - of the pro bono case is more realistic than the main story, although the solution seems a little too pat.The plot in Suzy's Case was somewhat more plausible; we were taken into issues of medical cover-ups and left to question the notions of fault and blame. The plot here comes with a far more mundane foundation, just barely believable. I was repelled by Cookie's doctor friend almost immediately. His treatments are so obviously unethical and bizarre that they're more of a turn-off than a source of curiosity.Still, I found myself caught up and reading (which is more than I can say about many mysteries these days). And I'll look for Tug's next case and hope he begins to take charge of his personal and professional life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VIIPJC45T9O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497662761#wasThisHelpful","R10VIIPJC45T9O","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While some reviewers found the characters ""unlikeable but fascinating,"" I just found them unlikeable, bordering on bizarre. Henry Hayden claims to be the author of novels written by his wife who seems fine with the program. They've done well and in some weird way it makes sense - she's the creative and he's the marketer.But he's got a pregnant mistress and some kind of strange past.  The mistress can best be described by words I can't use here.  Henry seems to be a little compulsive about all women, although he does love his wife.This is the kind of situation you see on Judge Judy, where you sense the characters are sabotaging their own happiness. I wasn't able to get past their flaws to appreciate the plot or writing. I just didn't want to spend time with them. Some readers, of course, will feel differently.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GU5JK2G7C3GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147679555X#wasThisHelpful","R3GU5JK2G7C3GI","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For most of the book, I was enchanted! I loved Jessica's sardonic style as she described her introverted childhood, vet school experience, and her luck in landing a job in the same city where her husband works. Her stories about her patients and colleagues are delightful, without being disrespectful.Jessica tells us about her personal life too. Her wedding had to be planned around her new job - she got a musician from Craigslist! - and her experience with puppies and kittens didn't prepare her for welcoming a human baby. She's very open about the challenges of having a baby and juggling a professional life ... even with the help of the dog!Jessica's a good writer. At times I laughed out loud as I was reading.But few if any clients seem to have adopted mixed-breed dogs. They're all mentioned by breed. It's better to adopt and then use the extra money to pay for flea treatment, vaccinations and more. And there was a reference to her husband buying a dog from a breeder. I've volunteered with rescue groups. A responsible breeder is far superior to a pet shop (these days many pet shops have started sponsoring rescues, not selling their own). But why not go to a shelter or rescue group? If you're nervous, find a dog who's been in foster care. You'll find puppies of all breeds in rescue. With so many dogs who are homeless and so many shelters filled to capacity, she had a good opportunity to reinforce ""adopt, don't shop."" And many adopted dogs live long, healthy lives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ILFBZU2FQTZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554936#wasThisHelpful","R3ILFBZU2FQTZ3","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently, a friend said, ""At some point I'd like to go work for a non-profit. I'd like to do some good at work.""As a consultant to career changers, I shuddered. I warned her that non-profits have totally different work environments than for-profits, and the career path goes one way. Instead, I suggested, why not work for a fun organization and donate the difference in salary?I didn't know this option had a name: ""earn to give."" But it's an option MadAskill explains in this book.The author presents five questions to help us assess how best to spend our charitable dollars, then illustrates each with a chapter. It's hard to argue with the questions. But coming up with data to answer them will be harder than the author suggests.For example, the author suggests that a small cutback in meat or egg consumption can have a meaningful outcome - a reduction in supermarket orders, ultimately leading to production decreases. But I've read elsewhere that faced with reductions in sales, cattle raisers will kill off some stock and produce less. They won't change their methods of raising the animals. It might be better to donate to organizations that lobby for humane production methods and support farmers markets that provide humanely raised meat, poultry and eggs.Another chapter suggests that voting is like donating thousands of dollars. I do vote and believe votes count - up to a point. The author illustrates with someone who's thinking of a career in politics. In the US, many of our social problems derive directly from lobbyists. In fact, it's been argued that legislators and even the president can't do much because the lobbying groups are so powerful. Obamacare was heavily supported by insurance companies who stood to profit. We haven't outlawed sugary soft drinks, which have been associated with many forms of poor health. I wish the author had talked more about the value of communicating with legislator; he does mention a demonstration that had an impact.Other data is even harder to come by. For instance, the author points out that the acclaimed ""Scared Straight"" program actually seems to increase teenage crime. The average person doesn't have access to this research and has trouble judging specific charities.The author concludes with specific suggestions for giving money, both causes and organizations. But what's missing is that, when it comes to giving money and setting up bequests in a will, we often donate when we feel a personal connection. We don't run the numbers.Although I appreciate the values assigned, I must admit I'll continue contributing both time and money to small, low-overhead dog and cat rescue organizations, where 90% or more goes to the animals. I do have other charities, but I believe animals affect quality of life, and animal cruelty has wider repercussions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CM19N1YMK3UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409105#wasThisHelpful","R3CM19N1YMK3UW","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I chose this book because I'm fascinated by identity changes. Heidi Neumark's daughter discovers that Heidi's father was Jewish. That's a shock to Heidi, who's happy in her career as a Lutheran pastor.Heidi digs into the family background. She discovers that some of her relatives had sought baptism as a way to escape the Nazi persecution, although at one time, the Nazis nullified these conversions. In a moving sentence, she points out that the faith she loved also was the means for her family's loss of their religion. She doesn't tell the story in a purely linear fashion, which will delight some readers and annoy others. And the book, while classified as Christian, doesn't get into belief, prayer or devotion; it could be read easily by an atheist.This book would be stronger with more of a storytelling orientation. I came away with a lot of questions. I'd have liked to learn more of Heidi's background. Perhaps readers of Heidi's earlier books know her background, but I was curious to know more about Heidi's background and what led her to become a pastor.While Heidi's search for her roots held my interest, the real story seems to be about Heidi's new identity and how she responds to her new self-perception.  She briefly mentions that she gets moments when she feels she is part of the Jewish community, yet she remains firm in her faith and vocation. Her response reminds me of Madeline Albright, who wrote simply that she had not been raised Jewish and would not be changing at this point in her life.This book also leads to the question, ""Just what is a religion?"" If Heidi had discovered her parents had been Roman Catholic or fundamentalist Baptist, would the emotional impact be equally strong? If ties to Judaism go deeper, then the question of something deeper than religion or nationality gets raised, with even more controversial implications.As a divinity school graduate, Heidi is more than qualified to explore these issues. Maybe she will in a future date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HXVQNMFA4ALC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1630881244#wasThisHelpful","R2HXVQNMFA4ALC","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sumner stacks the deck against her self with the prologue and opening. She warns that readers might think the heroine is older than 12.5 years, and indeed much of the time the heroine seems ageless. Aris (short for Aristotle) lives in a very small Georgia town with her mother and younger brother, who's also precocious. Her mom, Diane, has a New Age orientation to life and the family just doesn't fit into the town. However, despite living on an adjunct professor's salary, the kids go to a private school, The Labs. They're lucky: they'd be eaten alive in a public school.The book is framed as the novel Aris is writing, using her 30-day novel writing guide. There's not much going on, aside from comings and goings of this very strange family. We learn that Diane had married Aris's father, Joe, and they were living in Alaska when Joe was killed in a car accident. Diane's family moved them to Georgia and they remain, mainly because Diane can't figure out where to go or how to get there.This book practically begs to be discussed in a female-dominated book club. I can just hear people talking about Diane. It's hard not to be judgmental: she's just coping, not taking charge of her life. Yet she's kind and responsible. She treats the kids like adults, almost as if they were her siblings.We learn the dark side of the family background when Aris snoops through her mother's journals. Diane has conveniently recorded her own feelings, including her reaction to elements of her husband's past. The previews hint at a secret that will change their world, but in fact only Aris is changed, because she doesn't share her discovery. And she's not changed by much. What was more shocking to me was the way Aris dealt with her mom's journals. It's the kind of thing that only a child would do without really thinking about why she was doing it or understanding what might happen.The ending of the book seemed a little forced, in at least one part.The writing is so good that I had no trouble staying focused instead of sneaking peeks at the end. It seemed way too good for a twelve-year-old, and I'd be curious to hear from readers with kids that age. Definitely recommended for book clubs and people who wish they had book clubs to share their reactions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLY3SIR55CU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101873477#wasThisHelpful","R3VLY3SIR55CU9","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this book because I like basketball, but in fact it's not really about basketball at all. It's one of those one-year quests to achieve a goal; we're seeing a lot of those one-year diary style memoirs and this one's better than average.Dunking in basketball isn't easy, even if you're tall and fit. Asher Price starts out the year with some skepticism. Like Morgan Spurlock in Supersize Me, he begins with a nod to mainstream medicine. He gets basic measures taken, meets with specialists and creates a regimen of exercise and nutrition. He talks to his friends who went into fitness regimens.Asher soon sees results; in a pickup game, he's surprised how easily he moves. His whole life gets changed by the experience.Along the way, the book detours into basketball history. Some of this detail was more than I wanted, but I appreciated the author's effort to take the focus away from himself at least part of the time.There's one scene where he drives to Baylor University to meet Brittney Griner, in her senior year. She doesn't dunk and he doesn't get to interview her, but he's impressed by her athleticism. I'm impressed that he mentioned the women's game, which has been vastly underrated and generally ignored.As always, I can't help wondering what happened after that year. Was Asher changed for the long term? Did he modify his diet?And I came away thinking it's time to pay more attention to my own nutrition.

"I haven't read the earlier books in this series but I've been looking for a new mystery series to follow. This one seemed promising, with quirky characters and a  setting in Montana, one of the few states I've never visited. A body is found in the chimney of a visiting writer. It turns out to be a young woman named (improbably but aptly) Cinderella. Sheriff Ettinger enlists her old friend (who apparently has been more than a friend) to help find the killer. The plot takes some twists and we never forget we've got snow, snow and more snow.Overall, the book held my interest. The characters of the female sheriff (Martha Ettinger) and the male detective (Sean Stranahan) were intriguing. The storyline was intriguing, although the pace was slow and thoughtful. I liked the way the sheriff is presented as a complex person in a difficult situation - small town sheriff *and* female - without glossing over the challenges or creating an easy romance. Although the book is listed as a Sean Stranahan mystery, the sheriff steals the show.The most frustrating part of the book was the author's naming conventions. We have Ettinger and Etta, the mother of the dead girl. A lot of characters have similar names beginning with the same letter. The sheriff is identified as ""Ettinger"" sometimes and ""Martha"" in other places. I had trouble keeping the characters apart, especially in the beginning.Additionally, the characters weren't especially likeable. I admired the sheriff but she's not someone I'd want to meet for coffee. Sean seems warmer but he's defined by his actions. The book moves from one viewpoint to another so it's hard to get inside someone's head. On the other hand, these characters fit the cold, spare landscape, where survival takes a lot of energy. I lived in Alaska and there's some similarity.Overall, though, it's quite a good read. It passes the airplane test: would keep me going through a long trip. I'm now inspired to track down the earlier volumes, and suspect this book is not the best to begin the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYUIWVN7451E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670014702#wasThisHelpful","R1PYUIWVN7451E","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Ice Twins begins with an English family recovering from a horrible tragedy. Lydia, one of a pair of identical twins, was killed in a fall. The remaining twin, Kirstie, announces one day that she is Lydia. She begins to act like Lydia. The parents, understandably, get worried: what if they buried their child under the wrong name? Adding to the mix are the family's financial difficulties - caused by the father's emotional reaction to Lydia's death - as well as marital tension between the parents and a move to the middle of nowhere. The family's emotional isolation seems mirrored by their geographic setting.Tremayne creates horror and suspense extremely well. She evokes a strong sense of place.  However, the novel  was hard to get into. Sarah, the twins' mother, was not a likeable character from the beginning. She came across as whiny and needy, not heroic. Angus, the father was not especially strong and just somewhat more likeable than Sarah.The story is more of a thriller than a mystery. There's not a lot of insight into the psychology of the characters. I didn't see it as a psychological thriller because the story was more event-driven. The ending was disappointing. It didn't grow organically from the story and left a bad taste.However, I went with four stars because it's the kind of book some people will really love. For me it was a little claustrophobic to be caught up in the dynamics of this grieving, totally dysfunctional family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9RDVH33E3WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455586056#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9RDVH33E3WJ","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Choosing this book from the Vine list was a gamble. On the one hand, I was concerned that it would be a series of pious homilies. On the other, I've read books by Benedictines - View From A Monastery, Ear of the Heart - and I loved the movie The Cheese Nun. These Benedictines are down to earth, gutsy and funny. I like reading murder mysteries featuring nuns and enjoyed the TV series The Sisterhood.There haven't been any reviews. So I took a chance.The premise is that John Schlimm, age 31, finds himself living in his isolated home town, doing some substitute teaching, getting his life together after a series of disappointments. We aren't told much about his former life, including a stint working with Nashville recording artists. Perhaps Schlimm wants to dismiss his ""sinful past,"" but the few tidbits we get don't sound that horrible. I'd like to have gotten much more background to create a context for this five-year period.Schlimm comes across as an enthusiastic, somewhat naive young man. He writes about the difficulty of getting a new job, but he's single and well-educated: why didn't he widen his options? Why did he see ""coming home"" as the only choice?An old friend introduces him to the ceramic shop where he meets the delightful, diminutive Sister Augustine. He returns for more conversation and even helps with some of the ceramics. Although he's got a problematic job situation, he finds a way to purchase some of her items. Ultimately he applies his not inconsiderable PR skills to help Sister Augustine sell more of her products.Schlimm reports his visits to the ceramic shop in simple, straightforward fashion. He doesn't ponder what he finds so appealing. I've taken ceramics classes and the impact of a first-time studio visit can be powerful. We don't get a great deal of insight into Schlimm's reactions and feelings. Sister Augustine's actual advice isn't especially unusual, new or startling. Forgive yourself. Take time to be in nature. Not really answers to life's greatest questions.At one point he writes about how much he enjoys getting access to someone who seems to have answers to all his questions. He doesn't compare this experience to others that he might have experienced or heard about, such as a close friendship, mentorship or even psychotherapy. After all, a lot of people are willing to give you answers to everything you ask!I can see why this time was so special to Schlimm and I wish he'd focused more on the ""why."" Feeling accepted? Talking to someone who wasn't connected with his world? It also would help to have the book divided into stages of his journey so we'd clearly get a sense of his new life emerging as he visited the nun.Ultimately, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. Mostly, the writing was not as strong as expected and even somewhat awkward. The author keeps referring to the nun as ""my friend.""  I love cats but ... ""Sister softly petted Blitzen, who responded in purring whispers from her lap."" And ""she looked down at Blitzen, petting his thick calico fur."" And more. A lot more.I wish the author had stepped away from his experienced and considered another angle. We learn little of what goes on in his life outside his visits, except what he shares with Sister Augustine. Did he have moments when he thought, ""I'd better not tell her this!"" or, ""What would Sister A think?"" And I wish he'd created more of an authorial tone as a framework so we'd get a sense of his personality. Peter Grethers did this really well, writing about - of all things - a cat.Five years is a long time for a young man in his thirties. Most people change over that time, with or without special friendships.The book is congenial and pleasant to read. Ultimately, it could have been much more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCXOOIPSBLRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553446576#wasThisHelpful","R1DCXOOIPSBLRQ","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like other  reviewers, I thought the book would be a light-hearted book about a dog. I expecteda straightforward story of a woman who wasn't used to dogs who learned to love the dog. Alas, like life itself, the story gets more complicated.Mia falls in love with a terrific man whose situation presents challenges: different religions, different backgrounds, different prior marital statuses. So Mia has to adjust to new kids and a dog, Eddie.But the situation is far from straightforward. The dog isn't exactly cute and loveable. He doesn't like Mia. And in turn she's protective of her furniture  the sure sign of someone who's not a dog owner.Jim isn't exactly a responsible dog owner. There's no excuse for a badly behaved dog. And Mia  seemed a little anal about her furniture. Just get a few throws, for heaven's sake. Dogs matter more!What makes the book interesting isn't so much the dog as Mia's career as a New York Times reporter. I'd have liked to learn more, as she's succeeded in a super-competitive world.  I was also intrigued by Mia's Puerto Rican background and her interfaith, cross-cultural marriage.These elements make the book stand out from the usual ""bad dog"" genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33O7KWNAW14I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916779X#wasThisHelpful","R33O7KWNAW14I5","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would agree with other reviews: the jar is really large! It's hard to tell the size from the photo. Other skin products I've reviewed tend to come in tiny jars. This one will last a long time.I don't have especially sensitive skin. I've been using it for a few nights and noticed a difference already. Definitely smooths and tones the skin. I didn't have any adverse reactions.I didn't notice a particular fragrance. And I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't feel like a typical mask - more like a very strong night cream.

"This is one of the most frustrating books I've reviewed in a long time. With books like Singled Out and Going Solo, the choice to live alone and be single shouldn't be puzzling, especially to the kind of readers this book will attract.That said, the most difficult parts of singlehood aren't related to loneliness or existential angst or feelings of missing something. The challenges of being single arise from infrastructures and institutions that assume people live in families and come in pairs. Vacation packages, especially cruise ships. Health care. Restaurant reservations.  Bella DePaulo's book, Singled Out, captures the reality.So my first quibble is that a lot of this book just seems irrelevant. Women may be defined by their marital status in some situations but a lot of women don't define themselves this way.Second, the book really doesn't explore the spinster role. Bolick spends a lot of pages explaining her social life, which morphs from serial monogamy to what she defines as the dating norm: going to bed with a lot of people she doesn't know very well. That's a life choice.Third, Bolick identifies five women who function as virtual role models. As she points out, they're unconventional but not all spinsters. I enjoyed reading about them but kept wondering why we were getting off topic.In fact, I'm not sure Bolick really ""gets"" singleness, whether we call it spinsterhood or something else. At the end of Chapter 9, she concludes a very interesting write-up of Maeve Brennan by noting that Maeve had moved around frequently among hotels, writers' colonies, and  friends' cottages. She felt ""asphyxiated"" by closeness. ""Had she stayed in one place and set down roots,"" writes Bolick, ""we think to ourselves she wouldn't have ended up alone in a nursing home.""Anyone, rooted or rootless, can end up alone in a nursing home. Unless you have not just family, but the right sort of family who will visit frequently and take advocacy roles, you stand a good chance of an abusive old age with the special curse of being isolated and alone without the joys of solitude and privacy.Finally, Bolick refers to her male partners by a single initial only. It's somewhat disconcerting. Why not just invent pseudonyms with an introductory note that names have been changed? Even if she used their real first names, all but a tiny number of readers would know who they are. It's hard to keep track of R, S, and W and this style is a little quaint.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TG95AGWL69CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385347138#wasThisHelpful","R1TG95AGWL69CQ","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This would be great for a book club, as others suggested. It's got a lot of angles that would lead to discussion and disagreement. As other reviews explain, TifAni FaNelli ends up at snobby prep school after being expelled from her plebeian Catholic high school. Like any teen, she's eager to conform and fit in. And since this is a novel with sinister overtones, you can bet she'll work her way into the most difficult, troublesome clique in the school. Naturally they're not what they appear to be.The novel opens when our heroine - now morphed from wrong side of the tracks TifAni to suave head-turning New Yorker Ani - gets ready for her wedding to the perfect guy. He's rich, good-looking, well-established and kind. OK, the sparks aren't flying, but she's getting what she wants.We soon realize Ani (Ah-nee, not Annie) has never fully recovered from some traumatic experiences in high school. And she's asked to participate in a documentary that will force her to revisit her memories just before the wedding.There's s lot to question in this novel. Who names their daughter TifAni? The kind of parents who seem distanced from their own daughter. The mother is a piece of work who blasts her credit cards to buy her daughter the right clothes and accessories. The father is a shadowy figure.Why hasn't Ani gotten some kind of help to deal with these experiences? She goes to a progressive college and in New York half the people are seeing shrinks. Surely someone would have made a suggestion.Then again, Ani's done well for herself career-wise. She's got a magazine job that's not exactly journalism, but she's paying dues and getting noticed.And yes, Ani's mean. Maybe it would be no accident that she'd be drawn to other mean types. Ultimately she's self-centered and vengeful.The plot gave me a sense of deja vue, except that Ani's edgier than most heroines in her situation. I didn't really ""get"" the significance of the action that led to Ani's final decision; I went back and read to see if I missed something. If I didn't, the final twist seems anticlimactic and over the top. A spoiler alert would be welcome.  However, I bet a lot of readers will predict the final, final outcome well before getting there.The writing and pacing are good, though.  It's a good book to take on  long airplane ride and I have hopes for the author's future novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9Y85EPMOYBHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789630#wasThisHelpful","R9Y85EPMOYBHA","A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an unusual little film starring George Arliss as master concert musician Monty Royale whose young pupil Grace (Bette Davis) confesses her love to him. He's of course flattered but unsure of what the coming years will bring considering their age difference. He agrees to marry her if she feels the same in six months. However, near the beginning of the six month period something happens that leaves Monty unable to enjoy his own music - he is left completely deaf from an explosion. He becomes a bitter man who shuts himself away from everyone. He does take some training in learning to read lips so that he can deal with the world in his new condition, and this training leads him to realize that he now has the means to bring happiness to people in a different and more individualized way than he could as a musician. With the aid of some powerful binoculars left behind by Grace, he can read the lips of the people in the park across the street, learn their troubles, and with his large family fortune and influence, save lives or maybe just bring someone some welcome happiness.Soon the joy of living has reentered Monty's life, and he is happy that the six month waiting period is soon to end and Grace will be returning from California - they can be wed. He's people watching at his window when Grace suddenly appears in the park across the street. She sits down with someone and begins to have a conversation. Monty ""listens in"". What will he discover and how will he react? Watch and find out.In addition to the fine work of George Arliss and Bette Davis, the supporting roles are well played here too. Ivan Simpson is great as Monty's gentleman's gentleman who has no trouble sternly lecturing his master when he needs it, yet is such a formal person that he cannot leave the house -even on an urgent errand - without his hat, and there is even a very small part played by a very young Ray Milland. Highly recommended for fans of early 30's films. It has some precode elements in it, particularly the part where Monty is wrestling with God and his loss of belief, but I would not call it a precode at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG5P3QJG761U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLOJQA2#wasThisHelpful","R2VG5P3QJG761U","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, most women initiate divorces. But there was a time when it was the other way around since women had few options outside of the home. If you were a woman, you'd just better hope that as the bloom fell off of your rose that your husband did not get the 7, 17, or 27 year itch. This is about the impact of one of those marriages with an itchy husband, an unlikely cad, Lewis Stone as Marlett.I like how this movie takes the time to build up the characters, always a trademark of screenwriter Frances Marion. A great deal of time is spent in the beginning to show the respect and friendship wealthy author Marlett has with his only child, Lally (Norma Shearer). Then a tell - she asks her dad as they walk up the drive, what book he is working on. He says it is a romance involving a 45 year old man. She, about 20, laughs at the idea. Marlett says that the middle aged are made of flesh and bone too. That life is not over at 30 as youngsters think, and that they thirst for romance, that ""last"" romance, indicating that dad might be thirsty. When they get to the top of the drive, the slender and glamorous Mrs. Chevers is talking to Lally's mom about her son, Doug, who is away at Princeton. Lally's mom is graying, a bit overweight, a bit sedentary, and Marlett calls her affectionately ""mama"". Indicating that he thinks of her as first Lally's mom - and a good one - and then a wife.A year passes and Marlett and his wife are planning to divorce, as is Mrs. Chevers from her husband, but Lally yet knows none of this. She walks into her dad's study and catches Mrs. Chevers and her father in a passionate embrace, talking of marriage. Then her dad tries to justify it. He says that he and her mother are not the same boy and girl who made all of those promises 23 years before. I like Lally's translations - that perhaps he sees her mom as a fat and a bit boring ""unlike the slick Mrs. Chevers"". He says he intends to keep the house. She reminds him that doesn't matter to her since her mom is being bundled out of that house and Mrs. Cheever is being brought in to replace her. Lally says her final goodbye to him and plans to never marry because she will not be made a fool of as her mother has been, and the male sex has fallen mightily in her esteem because of her father's fall, which he won't even acknowledge as a misdeed.So off go mother and daughter for a summer vacation before mom goes to France for a divorce, which was the custom in that day. When Lally reiterates her vow to never marry, her mom is happy, which seems odd. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Marlett is not succeeding at hanging out at his old haunts with his new mistress. They both get the cold shoulder from everyone. I'm not sure why this scene was in here other than to show that people did pass moral judgment on affairs and homewreckers at that time, and that a smooth transition did not await them both if they proceed.On vacation, Lally meets a guy (Robert Montgomery) who really fancies her. They dance, they enjoy each other's company, and maybe Lally is softening on men just a bit until she discovers his full name - Jack ""Doug"" Chevers - son of the woman who has ousted her mother, a symbol of why she decided to not take men seriously in the first place.So Lally is one confused girl. She has a mom who encourages her to play the field due to her own bad experience with marriage. She has a dad who thinks ""until death to we part"" is just a phrase people like to kick around at weddings, and she has a beau who is insisting on marriage now - as in right this minute. How will this all work out? Watch and find out.This is very good writing by Frances Marion who had already had a couple of short lived marriages that did not work out and one that did that ended in her husband's sudden death just the year before. Thus she could approach this subject of love from the viewpoint of someone who had seen all of the angles. I'd highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CK7A7XKY5HIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GWDT34#wasThisHelpful","R1CK7A7XKY5HIF","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The amazing piece of timing here is when Warner Bros. began work on this biography of entertainer George M. Cohan, WWII had not yet broken out. The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred the day before shooting began. When the film opened people on the home front badly needed some morale boosting, and this film gave it to them. It's just a joyous musical costume piece from start to finish with nice comic touches balanced with some sentimental moments (supposedly Walter Huston's deathbed scene had even taskmaster director Michael Curtiz crying). There's nothing in the way of real conflict or even much heavy in the way of romance between Cohan and his fictitious film wife ""Mary"", who was modeled after Cohan's actual second wife in some ways. Cohan was actually married twice. Oddly enough, it was Cohan who said he wanted as little romance in the film as possible.The more I learn about Cohan the more I realize that Cagney was perfect to play him - both Irish Americans, both about the same size and build, and George Cohan's style of dancing and singing were about the same as Cagney's. It's hard to believe that Fred Astaire was Cohan's first choice to play himself. Astaire was a great talent, but I don't think he could have conveyed the combination of mischief, optimism and energy that was Cohan the way that Cagney ultimately did. Several people criticize Cagney's dancing here, but that eccentric style was Cohan's, who always considered himself more of an overall entertainer than a dancer in the first place.If you're ""date conscious"" as I am, there are some matters of plot that might bother you. Cohan was born on July 2 or 3, not July 4. Cohan's mother outlived his father by eleven years and Cohan's father was not ""very old"" when he died as is said in the film - at least by today's standards. When Cohan's father died in 1917, he was only 69. Cohan's sister did die young - she was only 39, dying in 1916, plus she was not his little sister. Instead Josie was a year older than George. The film has Josie marrying when she would have been close to forty, when she actually married at the beginning of the 20th century and thus was the one to break up the four Cohans, not George. Also, Cohan received his Congressional Medal in 1936, not as WWII began as shown in the film. However the plot device of having George M. recount his life story to FDR, receiving his Congressional medal in the Oval Office, and then dance joyously down the White House stairs and into the streets joining a group of marching soldiers in a chorus of ""Over There"" was probably a great way to bridge Cohan's patriotic past with what was then an uncertain time that certainly needed a dose of his optimism.The one thing that I did find a little odd - and one thing isn't much in a two plus hour long movie - is that it is hard to spot the actual point in the film where Mary becomes George's wife. There is quite a bit of domesticity shown before the two were married. Mary is cooking for George, staying in his apartment alone waiting for him to come home from the show, and acting very much like they are already married. The only way you know they are not is that George very subtly pops the question to the point that I'm surprised even Mary knew what he was asking! I know this doesn't seem like much in today's world, but considering that they were trying to paint Cohan in the most positive light possible and that the living arrangements might be misunderstood, I am surprised that the censors of that time never raised the issue.At any rate, I highly recommend this one. You'll have a great time, at least in part because you can see that Cagney is having a great time. He always said this film was his favorite, and it shows in his performance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHW3ZYRWV5XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JKS8#wasThisHelpful","R1DHW3ZYRWV5XP","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...the cost of which ironically drove the Laemmles into bankruptcy and caused them to lose the studio after 25 years. Of the three versions this is the version that splits the difference of being truest to the novel, truest to the original musical produced by showman Ziegfeld, and the most entertaining unless you are one of those millenials who just cannot stomach anything not in color, in which case, I pity you.Irene Dunne plays the role of Magnolia Hawks, daughter of the captain of a Missisippi showboat and his hatchet faced shrew of a wife., When we are first introduced to Magnolia she is a teenager. This is probably the strangest part of the film - watching 37 year old Irene Dunne parade around as a wide eyed 17 year old. Irene Dunne was always a beautiful lady, but it is a stretch to believe her as a naive teenager at this point in her life.The cast here is just wonderful. There is the tragic Helen Morgan as the equally tragic Julie who is hiding what in that time would be a terrible secret. Alan Jones plays Gaylord Ravenal, who is as pretensive as his name and a coward in the face of tough times to boot - Magnolia makes the mistake of loving AND marrying AND having a child with the weasel. He is off winning a big gambling pot when Magnolia is giving birth, and when Magnolia's mother complains about his absence he takes wife and infant off of the boat, just assuming that the good gambling times will continue to roll. They do not. Here Jones is just right for the part for completely unflattering reasons. He LOOKS like a man who'd get going when the going gets tough, leaving wife and daughter penniless and estranged from her parents.Then there is Hattie McDaniel as Queenie and Paul Robeson as her husband Joe, both workers on the showboat. Paul Robeson gives an unforgettable rendition of ""Old Man River"". Nobody else who ever sang the song could even begin to measure up to his voice and to his impassioned delivery.The end was just a little too much for me to take, having read the book. Now I realize that just about everybody dying, as happened in the novel, is just not going to work on film, but I would have handled the return of Ravenal the Rat after some 20 years of complete abandonment of wife and daughter somewhat differently than Magnolia.Magnolia is at the end of a successful singing career that she was forced to cultivate after her husband deserted her, and her daughter Kim is just launching hers. It is a big affair, and time has not been kind to Gaylord Ravenal. Long having given up gambling as a profession he is now a lowly theatre watchman in ragged clothes looking much older than his age. He has the nerve to show up at Magnolia's box - where her entire family is - and turn into a duet a song that Magnolia is singing to the audience as one last performance in her career. I would have thrown that cowardly rat husband of hers right off the balcony, my foot firmly planted into his bony behind. This is one place where having a little bit of her mother in her might have helped Magnolia. The only change I'd make to a near perfect film. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGFQEARIU51M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J70UXEM#wasThisHelpful","RPGFQEARIU51M","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... or at least that seems to be the case for Daniel Pardway (Lionel Barrymore) as he comes to Chicago with his new bride shortly after the great fire of 1871. Daniel sees in this fire opportunity, and he builds a great department store ""The Bazaar"" in its aftermath. In the meantime, on the personal front, he and his wife have four children. Daniel's wife dies due to complications of the birth of the fourth, Freddie. With his wife dead, Daniel pours all of his energy into both his store and his children, with the hope, rather the expectation, that the children will have as much enthusiasm for the store as he does.In the meantime, Daniel overlooks loyal employee Abe Ullman (Gregory Ratoff), who has been with him since his first sale, first as a customer arguing that the price is too high, and five seconds later as an employee telling the throngs of customers that this is a great deal. Ultimately he becomes the general manager of the store for decades.I'll stop describing the plot right here, because it would be too easy to give it away by saying anymore. Let me just say this is a great tribute to the acting of everyone involved. Lionel Barrymore was 55 years old when he made this film, and at the beginning he seems every inch an energetic 25 year old for which the sky is the limit. During the film he realistically ages from 25 to a decade past his actual age. Gregory Ratoff was really a revelation here. I'm accustomed to seeing him play hypertensive bosses with few brains, but here he shows a great deal of range and mystery. Is he just a hired man for an unappreciative boss who often makes him a verbal punching bag for life's frustrations, or is he perhaps actually looking out for himself? Watch and find out whether and how.Of the four Pardway children, I thought Eric Linden was the standout. Over at Warner Brothers he was usually given ""Gee Whiz"" Jimmy Olsen like parts. Here he gets to play a real rotten apple with no gratitude and seemingly no conscience.Good acting, good camera-work, good direction, and for a plot that seems to be going by the numbers, a couple of surprises at the end - I'd recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RF8VRK1OOWLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1RB9BU#wasThisHelpful","R2RF8VRK1OOWLF","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...or at least the end of television as we once knew it. It was all such a simple yet diabolical plan. Get a group of random people together, divide them into two ""tribes"" and pit each of them against each other, collectively and individually for a great sum of money. Maybe they were eccentric and weird before, maybe not. But tell them one hundred million people are watching and they WILL become eccentric and weird so they can claim their 15 minutes of fame as well as all of the money.The awful truth is people will lie, cheat, and steal when you give them a great enough reward (the cash) with great enough hardships - no shelter, not enough food, harsh weather. This ain't Gilligan's Island my friends.I've told you how this was such a simple plan. Now I will tell you how it was diabolical. It destroyed television as we had known it since its inception. It got huge ratings, partly because of the spectacle, partly because the audience became attached to ""the islanders"", and partly because people could feel better about themselves because each of us felt we would never sink so low.Networks figured out that no longer do you need paid actors or writers or art design. Just find some random group of awful people in normal situations or normal people in awful situations and watch the feeding frenzy. And then it spread from the networks to cable. A&E, which once aired ""Breakfast with the Arts"" now shows stuff like Duck Dynasty, Dog The Bounty Hunter, and Hoarders. The Discovery Channel? Gone was investigative reporter Bill Kurtis and Walking With Dinosaurs, in with ""Naked and Afraid"" and ""Moonshiners"".As for soap operas? Not exactly the apex of quality television, yet a guilty pleasure for quite a few, even myself in my college years. But it was scripted and required paid actors. Why pay Susan Lucci to act awful into her 60's on ""All My Children"" when you can get some Bridezilla to act like a rutting pig for free? So one by one the soap operas fell, until only a handful still exist.Why my rating of 2? I'd give it a 5 for being a milestone in television history, although it's a bad milestone. I give it a zero for having any redeeming value whatsoever and for  influencing television for the worse - it's an absolute miracle that something as good and as original as Big Bang Theory could take root and thrive in this environment. 5/2 = 2.5. Rounding down it gets a 2.Coming soon - my review of ""Walking Dead"", where Survivor finally becomes scripted.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R313EX8XC0DZ6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001ZDKXI#wasThisHelpful","R313EX8XC0DZ6W","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gun Crazy was an independent production made without any big name stars, yet it fascinates me and I pull it out every now and then for a repeat viewing. The script when laid out blow by blow seems almost pedestrian - a Bonnie and Clyde story with no real surprises but without the Depression as a backdrop as a possible motivation for all of this mayhem.Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, though, this story is set in booming post-war America. Bart is a guy who loves guns but cannot kill. He killed a chick once as a child and as a result of the overwhelming remorse he felt cannot even bring himself to shoot a menacing animal with a bounty on it years later. Bart has good friends, a sister who seems to be well grounded and has been taking care of Bart since their parents' death, yet he commits a crime to get a gun when he's about fourteen when he's got to know this seemingly impulsive act will mean he's caught almost immediately - he is. He's sent to reform school for the theft, goes into the Army for four years but does not see combat, and here it is the present - 1950 - and he's returned home for a visit.So here Bart is an adult, he has good support from family and friends but he's still gun crazy and has the misfortune of running into sure shot Annie Laurie (Peggy Cummins), a little lady who has big dreams without the problem of a pesky conscience. So Bart's dilemma is that of so many in film noir - a bad set of coincidences coupled with a fundamental character flaw - he just can't say no to Annie Laurie. If he hadn't gone to the carnival that night and done trick shooting against Annie Laurie in a scene that sure looks like foreplay with guns, he probably would have gotten that job with Remington for forty bucks a week and been happy with that. But here he is, in the sexual clutches of a femme fatale who is ""dead behind these eyes"" - to quote another movie entirely.Initially, Annie seems to pick Bart because he is a straight arrow, someone who genuinely cares for her, and right before they marry she even vows to ""try to be good"". Bart goes for Annie Laurie because he can't believe that a girl so pretty and so exciting seems to ""get"" him and actually wants an ordinary working stiff like himself - but isn't this how so many guys feel on their wedding day?Ultimately their curse is their first impressions of each other were correct - Bart is basically a straight arrow, and Annie Laurie is exciting and craves a constant high level of excitement - and danger - in her life. So to keep Annie, Bart has to feed her with big wads of cash and even bigger wads of excitement that can only come from robbery, and with armed robbery there's always the chance of murder, and we all know what happens to murderers in the age of the production code.This film is so visually interesting. One reason I think I like it so much is I like to look around in a scene and just not at the players. Also it has that great and powerful score going for it and Bart and Annie's song ""Mad About You"" which is so true of both of them but in very different ways. Plus you never get ""inside"" the characters to find out why they might have turned out this way. Why is Bart so weak? Why is Annie so bad? Remember, this may be 1950, but these two grew up in the Depression and who knows what they saw as kids. It's all left for you to fill in the blanks. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XUCMX33NQTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000244EWY#wasThisHelpful","R1XUCMX33NQTG","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author did a great job of outlining topics of interest in image processing for cinema, and then proceeded to describe everything in the most confusing manner possible.. When he describes algorithms he will say something like ""Step 1 - remove high frequency components from image"". Well, that's great, but how exactly do you do that?  He never shows example image matrices or example convolutions with actual numbers in them to convey his point, and there are very few illustrations of what exactly you are doing. For example, it is not difficult to understand deinterlacing from an image of multiple frames and some equations, but instead the author mainly just talks about the concept. I already know about these concepts, SHOW ME HOW.  And show me how in algorithms with concise steps and DESCRIBE the actual steps with equations. There are plenty of images in the book, but they are mainly before and after images. Thanks  but no thanks, because I already know what the image should look like if the artifact is gone!I really wanted to like this book. Too bad. Especially too bad because the author has a background in electrical engineering and computer science, so I would expect a book that speaks to the algorithm writing audience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LWCL7KVJG30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439899274#wasThisHelpful","R21LWCL7KVJG30","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you buy only one of these overpriced Universal MODs, buy this one! If you buy two buy ""If I Were King"", but that is another story. I'd like to think that Dick Powell was wealthy enough by 1951 that he could largely pick his projects, because this one is a gem of Dick Powell parodying the Dick Powell private investigators  of the noirs. He plays a German Shepherd dog who inherits a large fortune from an eccentric owner and then is murdered by poison. When he arrives in Animal Heaven he says he knows who the murderer is and wants time back on earth to bring the murderer to justice. It's nor juar his untimely death that requires justice, though, because his kindly keeper was next in line for the estate, and down on earth she is suspect number one, so he also wants to clear her name in the process. He is given that chance, but he must return to Animal Heaven by the new moon or forever remain a ""Humanimal"" - human in form, animal in nature. To become a humanimal and return to earth not knowing that you are one is the punishment of bad animals. Rex will return knowing his state and his mission. He is given a deceased Kentucky race horse as his companion and helper on his mission.It's just hilarious seeing Dick Powell sitting in a PI office as Rex Shepherd, talking like Philip Marlowe and nibbling on dog kibble instead of peanuts. Goldie, his human-horse companion, has hat styles that are pure palomino. The murderer is no mystery - you learn the identity pretty much up front. The trick is catching the perpetrator. Also, as a human, Rex finds he is having new rather confusing feelings for the woman who was his keeper during his life as a dog. How can this all work out and not bust the production code? Watch and find out.Let me also say that the transfer is outstanding. All I have seen in the past are poor VHS transfers from TV airings.

WHY, since her family was a secular rather than a religious church going family, would her parents tell her pastor who then announces it to the entire congregation???? Second, WHY would her mom's therapist, when Alice went to her first session start out by saying ""I guess you won't be so hung up by sex from now on will you?"".

"... because in spite of being released on DVD via Sony's MOD program, hardly anyone ever reviews the film and I've never seen it on TV, not even on Turner Classic Movies.This was a blind buy for me, and it is among the best of the early production code films, which often got ridiculously sentimental in attempts to not violate the code. This one is a little sentimental, but it's interesting and a bit different too. In spite of having everything going for it - good quality script, acting, and production values, it does have a near anonymous cast, even for classic film fans, and that may be the reason it is overlooked.A 65 year old woman (Henrietta Crosman as Martha Abbott) walks out on her family after basically being made to feel old and unwanted. She leaves a home she owns outright and shares with her difficult nephew and nephew's wife. We never see the argument that drove her out, but we do get to meet the nephew and his wife when they go to the police in a panic about missing aunt Martha. You see, it turns out they probably don't want Aunt Martha back as much as they need her to close on the house - after all she holds title, and they can't sell without her.Meanwhile a trio of jewel thieves are about to get pinched for their latest robbery. The youngest among them walks into the park where he sees Martha, sitting there looking lost and forlorn He starts a conversation, and stuffs the stolen jewels into her things. The police come up and question them, search the boy, and eventually figure these are not the thieves and leave. The jewel thieves take Martha home with them, at first planning to turn her out the next day. But then a cop sees the back door open, starts wandering around, and is instantly disarmed by Martha's demeanor since she seems like everyone's grandmother. The thieves now see the usefulness of Martha as an apparently harmless front to their operations, and they hire her as a cook and housekeeper.Martha is not as clueless as you'd think though, and she soon figures out what the three are up to. But she also figures out that Tommy is not a hardened criminal like the other two, although outwardly he is very gruff and pretty disrespectful of Martha. She can see that the other two thieves plan to use Tommy to take the real risks in their operation, all the while acting like they are teaching him some kind of trade. She hangs around to try to make Tommy see the error of his ways and to act as a bit of a matchmaker between Tommy and ""the girl next door"" - literally - Judy.Ivan F. Simpson plays Smeed, the most outwardly tough of the two hardened thieves, and that's an interesting bit of casting since I'm used to seeing him play gentleman's gentleman types. Arthur Hoyl plays the other thief, which is not an unusual turn for him since he usually played back-stabbing underhanded types. Of the three thieves he is the most slippery and very good at controlling Tommy, making him think he is always thinking of him.I'd recommend it to anybody who likes films from the 1930's. Plus the audio and video quality of the DVD itself is wonderful. There are no extra features.Summary:Film itself: 4/5DVD quality (audio, video) : 5/5I round up to a combined score of 5/5.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UD4VB3BK7J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SGVTOE#wasThisHelpful","R8UD4VB3BK7J1","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... and that's the case here. The story is told mainly in flashback as The Durango Kid (Charles Starrett) recounts the tale of a stolen stash of gold known only to blind outlaw Bill Donner and a child in which Donner confided, but is desired by outlaw Frank Fenton. The ""ghost town"" was once a thriving place, but Fenton ran everyone out of town by terrorizing the settlers, all so he could have the place to himself and eventually find the gold. There are lots of good action shots in this film mainly because about two thirds of the film is stock footage from past Durango Kid westerns. Only the ending shots and the scenes where Durango is recounting the tale are new footage. There are some macabre elements here you don't normally see in these westerns, such as outlaw Bill Donner locking his partners in the hidden vault with the gold and leaving them, now two of the richest men in the world, to die in a grave of gold. In another scene Donner is captured by Fenton's gang and then returns blinded. It is not clear whether Donner blinded himself so he could not be forced to divulge the location of the loot, or if Fenton did it out of meanness, and in this case, stupidity.If you haven't seen the past Durango Kid westerns and therefore recognize all of the stock footage, and you like westerns in general, you should like this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SI6YBT9O6FSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IFYMWA#wasThisHelpful","R3SI6YBT9O6FSK","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a tale of a prosperous Hungarian farming family that takes in a gypsy girl (Myrna Loy as Nubi) who says she has run away from her tribe and will be beaten by her gypsy husband if reclaimed. They hide her, take her into their home as a servant, and come to regret that decision.Although directed by the renowned Alexander Korda, he did a poor job here, possibly not having veto power over the diction coaches in this very early talkie. This is Loretta Young's first talkie and it shows. She is very good at conveying emotion, but she probably is the most wooden member of the cast in speaking her lines. In her next surviving talkie, ""Loose Ankles"", she has improved tremendously. ZaSu Pitts is endearing, what little we get to see of her. As dizzy and well-meaning as ever as servant girl Lena, she is captivating even under all of those peasant petticoats.After watching Nubi laze around the house not doing her work, seducing all the men of the house to the point she has the servant man singing a ballad to a bovine, and enticing the son in the house, Paul, to steal Lena's life savings to buy her an expensive necklace you've got to wonder - Why didn't they just throw the dame out? The parents had to have figured that Paul's allowance disappearing and Nubi practically slumping from all of that fancy jewelry she was suddenly wearing had to have some correlation.I have seen some early talkies that are poorly paced, but this one should hold your interest, if only from the standpoint of watching the clean-up of a multi-vehicle accident from which you cannot turn away. There is one interesting rather precode line spoken by the father to the mother when talking about Nubi carrying on with Paul. The mother believes Paul has stopped paying attention to his fiance because he is in love with Nubi. Dad is more insightful - ""Paul is not interested in love, he's interested in sex!""Recommended, if only to see how Loretta Young and Myrna Loy started out in talking pictures.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EJ3CJM3BRGL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004XQO8TQ#wasThisHelpful","R6EJ3CJM3BRGL","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's the question this 70 minute little movie asks in reference to hot-head independent cab driver Matt Nolan (James Cagney) and waitress Sue Riley (Loretta Young). The two are brought together after Sue's dad, Pop Riley (Guy Kibbee), has his cab deliberately smashed by a truck driver due to a war between the independent cab drivers such as Pop and Consolidated Cab. Pop grabs a gun and shoots the smirking truck driver dead in the back.Pop dies in prison and Sue becomes a pacifist, urging the other cab drivers to shun violence. Matt wants the cab drivers to take the fight to the Consolidated Cab company. Matt and Sue are attracted to each other despite their differences and marry. Matt promises to change and keep a lid on his hot head. But then a drunken member of Consolidated Cab's muscle men, Buck Gerard, kills Matt's brother and Matt wants to kill the guy himself before the cops can find him - anything the police can dish out is too good for his brother's murderer, he figures. But then Matt would be a murderer too and Sue will do anything to prevent having a second loved one sent to prison. How does this all work out? Watch and find out. Sure, Matt is in the wrong here, but Sue takes some questionable actions herself begging the question - why doesn't she just call the police and TELL THEM where Gerard is, once she knows? Warner Brothers keeps this rather routine plot interesting with a good solid cast. Besides leads Cagney and Young you have George E. Stone as Matt's cab driving friend and constantly gabbing Leila Bennett as Sue's friend Ruby, which make for very colorful double dates. Then there is David Landau who looks as mean as he acts here as Buck Gerard, the drunken muscle that kills Matt's brother. Dorothy Burgess is Marie, Buck's girl. She's an attractive well-spoken girl and you can't help but wonder what she sees in such an abusive slob who is bound to turn his violent personality on her from time to time.Some strange coincidences of film history make this one worth watching closely. Notice who James Cagney's character loses the dance contest to in the opening half hour or so - George Raft, famous for his Charleston, as an uncredited extra! During that dance contest a small part of ""Yankee Doodle"" plays, 10 years before Cagney plays the song's author, George M. Cohan.Also, when Sue and Matt are double dating with Skeets and Leila they are going to the movies. The camera shows they are going to watch ""Her Hour of Love"" starring Donald Cook and Evelyn Knapp, both Warner Brothers stars of the day. They even show a rather stilted love scene from the movie once inside the theater. Problem is, that film never existed! I wonder why Warner Bros. just didn't show a clip from a real film they were trying to promote at the time rather than going to all of this trouble? It would have been cheaper, and, after all, the word ""cheap"" was music to Jack Warner's ears.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXP5L0N2NBXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WQUK06#wasThisHelpful","R1PXP5L0N2NBXP","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... that Westerns simply were not made during the transition to sound since they so depended upon motion and outdoor scenes - something that early sound technology could not handle. In 1930 silent Western star Buck Jones made his first film in two years because of this. This is his third sound film.The film opens with some fantastic WWI battle scenes that are partially stock footage. Buck risks his life to get his wounded comrade in arms, Ramon, out of the line of fire and to medical attention. Unfortunately, his friend doesn't make it and succumbs weeks later to his injuries. Ramon's family, the wealthy Del Reys, remember Buck's kindness in not allowing their son to die alone on a battlefield, and Senor Del Rey, head of the family, writes to Buck of his gratitude.The war ends and Buck comes home to Arizona. As he gets off the train he meets Juanita Del Ray, sister of his friend Ramon. However, each does not know who the other is. She is cold to him, and that's strange in and of itself because here she is wearing fur in the middle of the Arizona desert! Even after he rescues her from a runaway buggy she is snobby to him. When Buck gets home and has a heartfelt reunion with his old mother, he discovers his younger brother Tommy has been away from home for some time, worrying mom.Buck hasn't got to search long before he discovers Tommy is in jail - left the fall guy in a bank robbery by the Murdock gang. Buck doesn't want mom to drop dead of shock, so he devises a plan. He convinces the sheriff to hold him in Tommy's place while Tommy goes home, visits mom, and tells her he's going off to seek his fortune and will be gone a long time. This will cover the time Tommy is in jail for the robbery. Now this works great for Buck, Tommy, and mom, but the sheriff should have thought this one through. What if Tommy doesn't come back? The law doesn't let you put one man in jail for another one's crimes! Freedom may be the creed of the early west, but apparently it doesn't necessarily follow that these sons of the pioneers - even the lawmen -know anything about the Constitution.Well lo and behold Tommy doesn't come back. So the sheriff does put Buck in jail in his place, although I'd like to see him explain this substitution to a judge. While in jail, Buck is left in the charge of the world's stupidest deputy - Honestly folks, he makes Barney Fife look like Columbo. But that doesn't make Buck's escape from jail any less humorous.The reason Tommy never came home? He was kidnapped by his old gang on the way to see mom, because he knows too much and he might talk. Funny they didn't think of that WHILE he was in jail left holding the bag! Now free, Buck shows up at the Murdock gang's cabin looking for Tommy. This begs the question - If Buck knew where the Murdock gang was hiding why didn't he just tell the sheriff? At any rate, the gang spots Buck, which isn't hard to do because, there he is, in a great profile dressed up in what has got to be his Western Sunday best. Buck, who is smart enough to escape from jail, apparently loses his IQ altogether when he sees his brother, sent out at gunpoint by the gang to lure Buck. Buck walks right into the Murdock gang trap and once again he is a prisoner.Murdock sees the letter of introduction to the Del Rays and Buck's discharge papers and decides to steal his identity, 60 years before identity theft is part of the vernacular. You see, Murdock has had his eye on the famous Del Ray jewels for some time.However, Murdock didn't need this elaborate subterfuge, because Senor Del Ray takes Murdock on his word that he is Buck. Mr. Del Ray seems mighty naive, even showing Murdock the location and beauty of the family jewels, and ignoring that Murdock gets completely wrong some facts about Ramon's death, which should have been a dead giveaway seeing that he was supposedly at Ramon's bedside at the time of his death. When Buck escapes the gang - humorously once again - he is not so lucky. Mr. DelRay doesn't entertain the possibility he could have been fooled. He just locks Buck up - again. Too bad Buck didn't introduce himself to Juanita Del Rey when he saved her earlier in the film. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.Now you might think I didn't care for this film, given the fact that I called out so many of the plot holes. You'd be wrong. This early sound film is well acted with plenty of good action and humor as well as pathos. The fact that some of the fine points of the script seem to have been cobbled together doesn't change the fact that Buck Jones caught on to how to play the cowboy in sound Westerns fairly quickly.As for the quality of the video and audio - it is completely top drawer. There is just the slightest hissing in the audio but the sound still comes through very clearly.Summary:DVD quality: 5/5film itself: 3/5","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCL1SDET2CSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009M4KSNY#wasThisHelpful","RVCL1SDET2CSB","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This one was a blind buy for me from the Warner Archives, interesting to me because it was Harry Langdon's first talking feature film. Here Langdon plays Tim, the operator of a carnival shooting gallery, and Ben Lyon plays Georgie, occupation unknown, whom we first meet at a poker game being played in a bookie's office from the looks of the surroundings, with bookie Hank (Fred Kohler) and associates. Apparently Georgie and Tim are buddies, and also apparently Georgie routinely cleans out Hank and his associates at their poker games. When an extra ace is discovered after George collects his winnings and leaves, Hank jumps to the conclusion that George cheated and tracks him down to face off with him over it. In self defense George hits Hank hard enough that he crashes through the railing of the rooming house hallway in which they are arguing and falls several stories. Being chased by both Hank's gang and the police, and with Hank not looking particularly alive the last time he saw him, George decides to hide by - joining the army??? (The time is WWI).The U.S. army is NOT the French Foreign Legion, and the police would have no trouble tracking George down if they so desired, but that's beside the point apparently. Tim has already joined the army, so the rest of the movie is set in Europe with Lyon and Langdon as two privates in the war with the rest of the script just being a bunch of comic bits strung together like so many disconnected comic Vitaphone shorts. There really is not much of a story here. The odd thing about it is that all of the soldiers shown here in ""the army of occupation"" as it is blandly called by the title cards, inexplicably see less combat action than marine Gomer Pyle saw at the height of the Vietnam War - which was absolutely none. Instead they shovel horse manure when they run afoul of the gruff captain, played by Noah Beery in a role that reminded me very much of his brother, and spend the rest of their time drinking, singing, and fraternizing with the local Germans who don't seem at all bothered by the fact that they are being occupied and treat them like tourists.I'm no expert on WWI, but somehow I don't think this was a typical wartime experience. As for the comedy, I found Ben Lyon likable as always, doing the best he could with comedy material that was obviously meant to give the spotlight to Langdon. I like Langdon in his silents, but here he just seemed to wrestle with incorporating the dialogue he was given with his traditional befuddled expressions and slapstick from his silent years.Oddest scene/line in the film: Tim and George want to escape the MPs by donning the horse costume that two of the German saloon performers were wearing, but they are getting nowhere with these two fellows due to the language barrier. George turns to Tim and says : ""Let's just knock these two guys off"". That stunned me and I replayed this section of the DVD just to make sure I didn't misunderstand what was being said - I didn't. George, who has not been portrayed as anything more than a rather streetwise fellow up to this point is suggesting killing two men to escape punishment for being in a bar off-limits to military personnel? This seemed like overkill to me (pardon the pun) and something that belonged more in Little Caesar than in a buddy war pic.I'd recommend this one mainly for fans of Harry Langdon and early sound enthusiasts.As for the transfer - both sound and picture quality are excellent. I don't know if Warner Brothers did any restoration work, but it looks and sounds great - no hissing at all in the soundtrack, which is so common in the early talking films.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13P0J4X6F5MHN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007CZ3DL4#wasThisHelpful","R13P0J4X6F5MHN","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... and although that was probably not the intended lesson of this film, you've got to wonder why Dr. Lloyd Clayton would burn so much material belonging to his dead brother when he truly didn't understand the power that brother Elwyn had. With the ""Dr."" in front of his name you think he'd have more of an appreciation for the value of information. Brother Elwyn turns out to be a vampire in the untraditional sense. He dies and rises from the grave a vampire without having been made one by another vampire, and the recipe for this transformation is never made clear. Not to worry, though, because Elwyn has veteran vampire lackey Dwight Frye to serve him faithfully, here as the rather excitable Zolarr.Also unlike other vampires, Elwyn just doesn't bite you and be done with it, he enjoys talking you to death - at least in the case of his brother Lloyd. Instead, at mealtime, Elwyn begins to slowly drain the blood and thus life from Dr. Clayton's ward, Gayle. Soon there are rumors among the townspeople that Dr. Lloyd Clayton is slowly poisoning Gayle so that he can usurp her inheritance. So if Elwyn is successful not only will Lloyd probably be hit with a murder charge, but ward Gayle will become one of the undead too. However can this mess be fixed with all of the answers to Lloyd's questions now in ashes? Watch and find out.This is one of my favorite public domain horror films. The main problem with the film is that the elements survive in a rather washed out state being a bit hard on the eyes and the ears. However, if you can get past that and the low budget, the acting in this one is pretty good and the script is a good one with a bit of a twist on your traditional vampire tale.

"I doubt this film could have been pulled off without Ronald Colman in the title role as a descendant of the prominent Apley family of Boston. His entire life is taken up with people of similar background, and he considers anything outside of the Back Bay of Boston to be a foreign country. The film is set in the years prior to WWI and horse drawn forms of transportation are still the norm. He believes in his own form of noblesse oblige, and is very satisfied with his ways of giving back to the community - Tuesday Night Club on Tuesday, Wednesday Night Club on Wednesday - need I say more?In this rarefied museum piece of a life, George's children are about to turn everything upside down. His daughter is in love with a Harvard professor - so far so good - who is a Yale man! And the young man is teaching that Emerson is a rebel! Even worse, his son is in love with a young lady from Worcester whose father is president of a tool and die works! ""A foreigner"" as George himself says. To top things off a flashing electric sign advertising Grapenuts has been put within sight of his front door.Like I said before, if the part of George was played by anybody else but the dapper and charming Colman, this guy would probably come across as insufferable. As it turns out, George really has a generous soul, a point that is driven home by Colman's portrayal, but his point of view is crowded with traditions that are centuries old whose origin he doesn't really understand himself, and to step away from them - or to see any member of his family step away from them - leads to a sense of discomfort that makes him feel that he perceives a wrong that must be righted.I'll let you watch and see how this all works out, but it really is a delightful comedy of manners with real heart and delightful character actors in the supporting roles. Highly recommended.As for quality, the sound and picture are excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GA3TP8MTHIS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AB2O0TO#wasThisHelpful","R1GA3TP8MTHIS0","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... as I remember seeing it on TV in the 1970's when I was still in high school. In every way imaginable I saw myself as Henrietta -awkward, shy, clumsy, dismissed by everyone. Forty years later I still recognize that awkward person Elaine May is portraying. Yet Henrietta seems completely clueless that she is perceived this way, which was something I found hard to buy, but it does make her more endearing and make this film more about Henry's journey as he marries this totally helpless yet wealthy creature in order to get out from under his financial problems and discovers he has to take over every aspect of her life outside of her profession as botanist in order to preserve her wealth and his rarefied sense of order. You might say Henry dislikes his new wife so much because he initially sees himself as her - he says so at the beginning of the film when he finds out he has no money. He confides in his gentleman's gentleman that he has no talents or ambitions other than being rich. This is not the case, but this is how he sees himself. This really IS the case for Henrietta yet she does not see herself that way. So, in a really quirky way they are made for each other.There really is only one big plot hole I could find. How did Henry know that he would be the beneficiary of Henrietta's estate if he should manage to either kill her or arrange ""an accident"" and get away with it? Someone with so much money and so many hangers-on as Henrietta would almost certainly have a will prior to their meeting and the two just recently got married.Elaine May has always been an underrated talent, and as for Walter Matthau, what can I say? In 1968 he makes ""The Odd Couple"" and has me believing he's a the world's biggest working class slob, oblivious to his financial condition as long as poker night happens, and three years later he's got me believing he's the world's biggest snob interested only in savoring the finer things in life and dedicated ""to traditions that were dead before you were born"" - to put it in the words of Henry's (Matthau's) gentleman's gentleman.If you have a chance, give it a look. It is full of subtle dry humor executed to perfection by the cast. Only after the cynical 70's began could such a film be made. Maybe if it had been made after Watergate the public would have been cynical enough to appreciate it at the box office.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVTG3U6V6WSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089TQ7AG#wasThisHelpful","R2WVTG3U6V6WSR","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... because my copy isn't here yet.

"... as this film that starts out rather slow becomes a Hitchcock-like game of cat and mouse across the country involving a psychopath bent on vengeance against a group of crooked gamblers that drove his brother to suicide after he lost money that belonged to his company in a card game. The psychopathic brother is hunting the gamblers down one by one and hanging them - which is the way his brother killed himself. Up to the end all you see of this guy is a big beefy hand with a large black ring on one finger. The gamblers that know they're targets don't even know that much about the appearance of the man out to get them. And this is their one hope - to find out what the guy looks like so they can at least have a chance.At first Charlton Heston may seem out of place here as a gray character at the center of a film noir, but he carries the role admirably. Dean Jagger is the police captain that introduces himself as head of vice but for some reason gets involved in first the suicide of the guy the gamblers took, and then in the murder cases of the gamblers. It's very strange though that he keeps dragging Heston's character downtown just to tell him he's doomed to die at the violent hands of the rampaging murderer - and then seems to do nothing about it other than to taunt him. You'll see several actors playing against their normal type here including Jack Webb as one of the gamblers that is at first a bully full of bravado turned to quivering coward as the killer closes in, and Harry Morgan as an ex-soldier turned simple by something that happened in WWII that is never explained.Only one thing is a bit annoying in this film - for some reason the makers of this film seem to think Lizabeth Scott's nightclub singing is some kind of treat for the audience. I found it distracting and found myself groaning every time she'd show up for another number.Another thing that's very interesting - five years after WWII ends much of the problems of the characters is laid at the feet of the destruction and upheaval of that war citing problems that must have been common in American society at that time - hastily made wartime marriages that went lukewarm after the war, men who went soft in the head as a result of being soldiers, men who went hard as a result of being soldiers. If you want to watch a highly effective little thriller I highly recommend this film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDALCV8G27WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J216KE#wasThisHelpful","R3EDALCV8G27WY","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't expecting much from this film. I watched it mainly because it stars two favorites of mine - Chester Morris and Thelma Todd. I was very pleasantly surprised. The film opens with John Hawks (Chester Morris), a collegiate football star, winning the big game. Later that night, at a society party, he meets Alison Corning (Thelma Todd) who personifies every argument in favor of the inheritance tax you've ever heard with the saying ""spare the rod spoil the child"" thrown in for good measure. She's beautiful, spoiled, used to getting whatever and whoever she wishes, and will do anything for a thrill. John's bad luck is that she wants him from first sight. She convinces her big Wall Street financier dad, ""Steve"" as she calls him, to give John a job at his firm. John is hardly enamored by Alison. He can see right through her, and on the surface that's got to be a pleasant experience for any guy, but then you get to the not-so-gooey middle. This is what repels him.So John takes the job, not really knowing what to do after college anyways, but soon he sees that Alison is the apple that has not fallen far from the tree. Dad is all about making money and he doesn't care if he has to scam orphans and widows to do it. When John refuses to hard sell some worthless stock to an old lady in exchange for her solidly performing bonds he's tossed out without a second glance by dear old Steve.John then decides to take to piracy on the high seas - after all it's not too different from what Alison's dad is doing - except he will steal from crooks not orphans and widows. John sets his sights on one bootlegger in particular, and with the help of a wealthy friend who backs him financially by helping him buy a boat (Frank McHugh as Chub), he starts to regularly hijack gangster ""Big John's"" haul of bootleg liquor and sell it to Steve, his old employer, who is into bootlegging himself as a sideline.Now the problem here is that John doesn't spread the pain around to various bootleggers - he picks strictly on Big John's boats. He should realize that Big John did not get where he got by dropping out of Sunday school and sooner or later he is going to retaliate. I'll let you watch and see how this all shakes out.I just thought it was very clever and timely for a filmmaker to equate the robber barons of Wall Street with piracy on the high seas. In fact, it makes pirates look noble compared to the Wall Street banksters. There's also some gritty reality thrown in via Mayo Methot's Sophie, the typist for Big John who's beautiful but beaten down by life in the Depression and the constant companionship of ruffians just trying to make a living. Her relationship with Ned Sparks' ""Slim"" is touching. Slim is one of Big John's men, and the couple is helping out John Hawks in his acts of piracy against Big John in return for a percentage, hoping to get out of ""the life"" once and for all. The ever present danger of getting caught - if they are lucky, by the law, if not so lucky, by Big John, makes them underplay their emotions for one another and their emotional caution turns out to be quite touching.If you like Chester Morris or Thelma Todd, if you want to see a different kind of gangster film, if you think that many of the people running Goldman Sachs and AIG deserve to be cell mates with Bernie Madoff but will probably never learn their lesson from anybody or anything in this life, give this almost forgotten little film a chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N4H2X9Q45U8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JU8HEC#wasThisHelpful","R1N4H2X9Q45U8G","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... is just one of the many quotable quotes in this film that will stick with you. This one is one of my personal favorites and just about as perfect as modern (post 1970) movie making gets. The messages and comparisons of the film are rather obvious, but the individual scenes, the characters, and the acting are superlative.Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a complex individual - he's a physician - a healer of men - who is scared to death of all mankind. In fact he seems to be scared of all living things including a friendly neighborhood dog. He's gotten away with pure research positions up to the present, but now, in 1969 and in need of a job, he takes a job as a physician in a chronic care hospital. Now here's the complexity - You'd think a man who is afraid of other people would just sit back and perform his rounds and be grateful to be around patients who are as physically catatonic as he is emotionally catatonic. However, his humanity and intellectual curiosity are stronger than his fear and desire to hide as he begins to notice ""patterns"" in both the behavior and in the records of some of his patients that makes him believe that they may still be ""alive inside"". This leads to research that pinpoints one illness that all of the patients had in common - encephalitis lethargica that spread worldwide from 1917 to 1928. After the illness subsided, sometimes years later, would the catatonia gradually set in.Dr. Sayer manages - with great difficulty - to get funding to try a new drug on these particular patients, and they awaken, some after 40 years, many in their 60's physically, but in their 20's emotionally.The focus of the movie, though, is on the friendship that forms between Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro), a 50 year old victim of the disease, and Dr.Sayer. Leonard's mother (Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Lowe) is one of the few people visiting on a regular basis after all of these years - Leonard has been here for 30 years, ill since age 11, catatonic since age 20. So the focus is on Leonard's love of life once awakened versus Dr. Sayer's fear of it - this is the obvious part of the film. However that doesn't take anything away from De Niro doing a great job of playing someone who isn't a tough guy for a change and from Robin Williams from playing one of his most dramatic roles, both characters extremely vulnerable in their own way. Julie Kavner is pitch perfect as Dr. Sayer's loyal ,hard working, and assertive nurse and assistant. Ruth Nelson gives a performance of a lifetime, just two years before her death, as a mother who has dedicated her life to a son she remembers as and has cared for as a child for almost 40 years but is a bit perplexed when he awakens as a man and his fancy turns towards love. For once she has a rival for her son's attention, which is not unusual. What is unusual is that she has to deal with this 30 years later than most mothers.There are heartbreaking scenes, there are funny scenes, and one scene in particular that brings to light how people sometimes will dismiss something as possible because it just seems too horrible. My favorite scene in this latter category: Dr. Sayer, when doing his research on the catatonic patients, visits the eminent physician Dr. Peter Ingham (Max Von Sydow). Ingham was dealing with the catatonia when it first developed in the 20's and 30's. When Dr. Sayer asks Dr. Ingham how he knows that the virus has not spared the patients higher faculties he responds: ""Because the alternative is unspeakable."" Classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29AMRUSFG085C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043X1FL8#wasThisHelpful","R29AMRUSFG085C","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The set up of the mystery is pretty conventional. An over-amorous leading man (Paul Cavanagh as Wylie Thornton) feels like he must mate with every woman between 18 and 35 who crosses his path. All the while he's telling each of them that she is the only one for him. In one case though Wylie over-achieves and actually marries one of the women (Natalie Moorhead as Alma). That is a mystery in itself since Wylie is quite the social climber yet when he marries he does so with his secretary, the two are not living together, and he treats her badly but expects her to keep their marriage a secret. Even stranger is she DOES keep their secret and continues on as his secretary! But Natalie Moorhead does shine in the part of the wife. She sleeps with Wylie when the urge hits her then ridicules him in the morning and demands extra spending money. Maybe that's why he seems to hate her so much - she's the only one of his women who seems to see him for the not so wily ham actor that he is.When Wylie is shot at his birthday party after the lights go out, there are a multitude of suspects. Two detectives are brought in on the case - Martin Gallagher (Sam Hardy), a young detective, is in charge. His subordinate, Jim Hanvey (C. Aubrey Smith), is a much older man. The younger detective is always going off half cocked and jumping to conclusions, and the older detective is methodical and does not confront the younger detective about his careless methods. He just investigates in his own quiet way. In the end, when the younger detective thinks he has solved the crime, Hanvey lets him believe he is right and take the credit because it doesn't mean false arrest for anyone (I'll let you watch and see what I mean), plus, as Hanvey tells the actual killer, he would have done the same in their shoes. Thus the ending is definitely precode in that an actual killer goes unpunished.The unexpected history lesson I was talking about is when one of the reporters is hounding the younger detective for information. When the younger detective tells the reporter something he thinks is ridiculous his retort is ""says Hitler!"". I guess a popular alternative phrase in 1933 would have been ""nuts to you"". In other words, in 1933 at least, Hitler was seen as just a buffoonish little man.I'd recommend this as one of the better poverty row productions I've seen. It really is a showcase for C. Aubrey Smith, who usually played supporting roles in films at the bigger studios. Just don't expect much in the way of sets because these smaller studios didn't have the money for such niceties.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ZQS1NQ2K3KA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PPGAN0#wasThisHelpful","R21ZQS1NQ2K3KA","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll Be Seeing You captures the loneliness of two people who - besides their own serious problems - just don't fit into the bustling wartime image we often see of America in film during that time.The opening scene is in a busy train station. We quickly focus in on two travelers. She (Ginger Rogers as Mary Marshall) is uncomfortable when she tries first to buy a stick of gum and then a chocolate bar and is rebuffed by the sales clerk as though she had been asking to buy gold bullion at a five and dime. He (Joseph Cotten as Zachary Morgan) is uncomfortable because he wants to buy reading material and all that is available is full of news about the war and images that you can tell make him squeamish.Zach is suffering from what would be called PTSD today due to battle fatigue, and he's ashamed of that fact, afraid of winding up like the shell-shocked WWI soldier he knew as a boy.Mary is a convict out on Christmas furlough, although what she is serving time for will probably be a shock to modern sensibilities - I know it was for me. She is also ashamed - understandably perhaps for being a convict, not so understandably for what she did to become one. I'll let you watch the movie and see what I'm talking about here.Against this backdrop of people who feel badly for the positions they are in due to social mores of the 1940's - soldiers are always brave and good girls never get themselves into the position Mary got herself into, these two lonely people find each other and connect. At first Zach lies to Mary about his situation, but then tells her the truth. Mary chooses to keep the truth from Zach, partly because she loves him and doesn't want to lose him, but mainly because her company is making him well - he says her self-confidence is giving him confidence - and she doesn't want to set back his recovery.Mary is staying with her aunt, uncle, and cousin during the holidays, and this warm family setting has both of them healing just a bit. Shirley Temple plays the cousin that is too young to know why Mary is in prison or wear lipstick according to her parents, but is apparently old enough to go out unchaperoned with a Lieutenant on leave who is probably five years older than she! Spring Byington plays the aunt who is supportive overall but still drops phrases from time to time that leave you wondering about the overall wisdom of her advise. For example, she keeps telling Mary to settle for second best and pretend it's first best - that's what she did!. Rather wacky advice by today's standards, but maybe mainstream feelings for people who married during the roaring twenties, and then raised a family during the depression and world war.I highly recommend this sentimental favorite of mine. I'm rather surprised it hasn't become more of a Christmas standard, because even though in many ways it is a unique snapshot in time, the story of two lonely people finding each other in a world that would probably judge them severely if they were open about their problems is universal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33QKPRVB2JST5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002KPHXI#wasThisHelpful","R33QKPRVB2JST5","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...because I can't see what's different from what happened here and what the banks did that caused the global collapse of 2008. Turning hard assets into derivatives and selling them on the market? Knowing that a product is worthless and encouraging its trade anyways? This sounds familiar, it's just Enron traded derivatives on fuels and the banks did it on real estate. Thus I guess there is nothing different here other than the banks committed crimes on such a large scale that all of the criminals wouldn't fit into prisons without us building more, plus all of those campaign contributions! Congress couldn't let THAT dry up! So here we sit with 0% interest rates on our savings until the banks recoup every cent that they lost, so I don't see how this is different from what was threatened in Crete - confiscation of a portion of all depositors' funds to make the banks there whole, except here in the U.S. it is happening slooooowly, so nobody complains of outright theft. But I digress.Now to the film itself. It takes almost two hours to chart the history of Enron, from the beginning in the mid 80's to its sudden collapse in 2001. There are interviews with everyone involved with the company from accountants to regular employees, and like all Ponzi schemes, people might have had their doubts and suspicions, but nobody wanted to upset the money train especially if they are on that train. And like all Ponzi schemes Enron came to a sudden abrupt end when there was no way to hide the fact that all of the money and the profits were not real.Also very interesting is the gladiator/macho corporate culture described, largely caused by COO Jeff Skilling waking up one day, realizing he was a nerd, and wanting to throw off that nerd persona. He lost weight, worked out, got Lasik done on his eyes, and began to organize adventure trips for himself and an inner circle of Enron executives, some of which involved actual bodily danger. He instituted an Enron employee ranking system in which employees were ranked from 1-5 and those in the lowest ranks were automatically terminated. It was the Billionaire Boys Club minus the murder and involving a much bigger club.Of course, now the scandal looks almost quaint compared to what we've been living with since 2008.In 2005, when this film was made, such an implosion by a company that had been named ""most innovative company"" for six consecutive years by CEOs, 1996-2001, the last year being the year of Enron's collapse, was still quite the spectacle. The irony is that if Enron had collapsed in 2011 instead of 2001, I doubt anybody would have gone to jail. Heck, it might not have even been newsworthy except in Texas! Also, the company might have even received a federal bailout.The highlight of the film for me - a video ""Christmas card"" to Ken Lay made by Enron execs in which they do a comedy sketch about ""creative accounting"" which turns out to be EXACTLY what the company was doing that hid their problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3UEQEEPH2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C3L2IO#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3UEQEEPH2H","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this as a deal of the day, and everything seems to be in order. I briefly inspected each season and didn't see anything overtly wrong. I've been viewing season one and so far so good. I'd actually give the series 4.5/5 stars. The early seasons were best, but there was lots of turnover in characters over the years, starting with George Clooney once he realized he could have a bigger better career as a movie star. When one particularly unlikeable member of the cast met a demise worthy of a Looney Tunes cartoon, the shark entered stage left. Even then, though, there were some good episodes up until the end and it's definitely better than what is on TV today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KH76AKLXT0JQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J9ZFJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1KH76AKLXT0JQ","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an American, getting a peek at post-War Britain in decline, a look at Olivier as a most interesting character in the person of never-was vaudevillian Archie Rice, and a look at several British players (Joan Plowright, Anthony Bates, and Albert Finney) very early in their careers is priceless.Archie Rice is a despicable character, and the drama centers on his problems of having all of his financial issues - including some long overdue tax debt - come to a head just as he can finally get no more work as a vaudevillian even in the bad music halls. He has a way out - one of his relatives will pay off his debts if he'll accept his drunken wife's nephew's offer to run a motel in Canada. But like any Briton who can remember England's finer days he's just not about to cut and run, and even though I can despise the lying, the cheating on his used up wife, his odd ideas about parenting, and his willingness to use his own father, I can't help but admire his ""pioneer spirit"" to use an American term. He'd rather fail on his own terms than succeed on someone else's.Joan Plowright is the other lead, and she plays Archie's daughter, Jean. She shows some pioneer spirit herself. She shares some characteristics with dad - she's a painter who can't paint, Archie's a vaudevillian who can't entertain. Unlike dad, she owns up to her shortcomings and wants to make a contribution anyways by teaching art to poor slum kids. She has a way out of Britain just like dad does. Her fianc has been offered a job opportunity in Africa, and he encourages her to leave her dead country behind, but she just isn't ready to give up on England or her family just yet. The two have a falling out and Jean goes to visit her dysfunctional family, in which she finds comfort.I just don't get people who say that they don't like this one because it's boring, depressing, ugly. Every minute of this film held my interest and stayed with me long after I'd watched it. I think you need to have lived awhile, to have had disappointments, and to have dealt with those disappointments in ways you may not be proud of to really appreciate this film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLH451GF4CDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005AUK8#wasThisHelpful","R1YLH451GF4CDH","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"... is the best way I can describe the flavor of this film, which is not nearly as bad as its current low rating would have you believe. In fact, if you like 50's and 60's Allied Artist horror on the cheap, I think you'll like this one. Remember Allied Artists was a poverty row outfit, and they could usually afford just one star. In this case it is Lon Chaney Jr. as armed robber Charles Benton, betrayed by two other bank robbers who turned state's evidence at the request of sleazy lawyer Paul Lowe, who wants a fall guy for the robbery and a chance at a smaller split for the 600K payroll heist for which he hired the three thieves in the first place. Benton realizes all of this, and the last thing he says before he is executed is that he is going to get the three who betrayed him.Now the lawyer isn't nervous at all, but the two other robbers think maybe Benton took some of the money - which at the time of his death only he knew the location - and hired a hit man for them. What they are definitely not expecting is for a couple of scientists to pay off the morgue attendant at the prison to hand over Benton's body. The pair are experimenting with electricity as a cure for cancer and need a fresh human body for their next test. Well ""It's Alive!"" turns out to be instantaneous tragedy for this pair instead of temporary triumph as in the case of Victor Frankenstein. Benton is unexpectedly brought back to life with a molecular structure that can't be penetrated by any substance, vocal chords burned out so he can't speak, superhuman strength, and with a desire to pick up where he left off and kill the three guys who betrayed him. I'll let you watch and see how this all pans out.The Dragnet comparison comes from the voice over of police Lt. Dick Chasen who is narrating the whole story. With Allied Artist horror you really don't expect much in the way of great acting or good art design, but more could have been done for the continuity and even the dialogue. For instance after Benton returns to life the narrator calls him a ""Monster Made Man"". Huh? What monster made him? I believe he meant to say ""Man Made Monster"". The narrator talks about how Benton wants to save killing crooked lawyer Paul for last, but then later after he kills the first of his fellow robbers he goes looking for the lawyer. In the jail house conversation Paul was trying to get the location of the hidden loot out of Benton who refuses to tell, but later Paul has somehow figured out how to get the loot but just can't open the strongbox it is in. Benton is established as a character who just wants to kill the three who betrayed him, yet mid-film he shows up in the middle of some suburb attacking and killing random people. Usually the best horror establishes the ""monster"" as someone for whom you have some sympathy and thus ambivalent feelings. Here Benton is pretty much just a mute killing machine after he is revived.I'd recommend this one, just realize you are dealing with an outfit that didn't have much in the way of funding to begin with and try to meet it half-way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STK0Z818CQ3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8O4V66#wasThisHelpful","R3STK0Z818CQ3R","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The author teaches a class on optics for engineers, and I took a peek at his syllabus and exams. Thus I'm confused as to why a book written for engineers by an author who obviously has a problem solving approach in his class by the same name as his book doesn't have more of a problem solving approach to the subject than it does. It avoids derivations, but then it avoids the practical side of the subject too. Any examples shown are so simple that they really don't show the engineering approach to the subject. As an engineer I was hoping to see more of a design approach to the subject and maybe some design examples with capstone design problems as you pick up more skill and knowledge through the book.I'm sorry I don't like this book, because I really wanted to like it. I still suggest Hecht's Optics in tandem with Schaum's Outline of Optics by the same  author. The textbook gives you the theory, and the Schaum's outline gives you the problem solving skills, which is what I had really hoped to get from this book.

"Even if insightful into his personality, though, it's not entirely honest about some of the stranger incidents in his life. Cagney just refuses to say anything bad about anybody, so you'll never know by reading this that his mother hated his wife, that his two kids were constant disappointments, and that they were raised in a house separate from where he and his wife lived. He does have much to say, good and bad, about the Warner Brothers. He talks in great detail about the problems he had with them and about the studios ruling with an iron fist. Cagney's solution - he'd just walk out any time the Warners got unreasonable with him, and it's a strategy that paid off for him, because he'd always return under better terms. He talks a great deal about ""The Irish Mafia"" collectively and individually, and you can see that Cagney was truly an ecologist and lover of nature at heart. He says he left acting in 1961 because he just didn't care anymore and couldn't see carrying on under those circumstances - he thought his public deserved better. He was tempted to come back once, he said, in 1964 in ""My Fair Lady"", but ultimately decided against it. Deep down inside once he had enough money to do so, he really just wanted to work on his farm for the rest of his life, and that's what he did. He was not your typical Hollywood fellow.Cagney does mention two people anonymously as people he did not like or respect. One would have been the queen of Warner's lot in 1931 - Cagney tells his life story chronologically so you can tell pretty much when events happen. He basically said she was beautiful and was well off financially through investments but could not act. Since this was before Ruth Chatterton's time at WB, I wonder who she could have been?  A hint - if Cagney really liked an actor or actress in the cast of a film he was doing, he'd mention them. If he did not, he'd say nothing. Thats's how I guessed who this actress was. Other than that, I'm not saying anything. The other person he talks about negatively - but anonymously - has got to be Mervyn LeRoy since he describes a director who would get great scripts, great players, and then pump up his part to the head office so he would be sure that he got the credit for the outcome. He describes this director right after he talks about ""Mister Roberts"", and since LeRoy was the director of that film that is what gave it away.I'd buy this for an insight into Cagney's outlook on life rather than an accurate blow by blow description of every event in his life negative and positive. He certainly was, as Pat O'Brien often called him, ""a far away fellow"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XGGNKQX84FL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385520263#wasThisHelpful","R1XGGNKQX84FL5","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Each season is in a sturdy case with each DVD securely lodged within its case. The encasing box is made of cardboard, but it's sufficient for the job.

"This book sounds just like Bickford the actor - you can almost here that gruff New England voice of his as you read the book. It starts in the beginning - at his birth actually - and goes forward through his childhood and days on the stage. As for his days on the screen, it focuses from his recruitment by MGM to do ""Dynamite"" in 1929 through the making of ""East of Java"" in 1935 where he was mauled by an animal on the set. The resulting scarring of his neck caused Fox to cancel his pending contract with them for leading roles. He was a guy who could definitely roll with the punches and was quick to use his fists and he led a very interesting life. You can definitely tell he really enjoyed his days on the stage as he tells the stories about that part of his life with the greatest fondness.What is still a mystery to me is anything about his wife and two children and his relationship with them. I wouldn't expect him to write some embarrassing tell-all piece, but considering he was married for over 50 years to the same woman, I would think he would at least mention her name just once - he does not. This is particularly puzzling since he goes into great detail about the friends he had and their nature and his parents and siblings. If you knew nothing else than what was in this book you'd believe Charles Bickford died a childless lifelong bachelor.I'd still recommend reading it if you can find a copy and you're familiar with Bickford's work. It is a very interesting read by a talented enigma of a man.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T7M9LF21WUTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007DY3Q2#wasThisHelpful","R2T7M9LF21WUTL","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm pretty much copying the content of my review of volume one of this set in that I praise that one and pretty much have a so-so assessment of this one.TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Astaire & Rogers (The Gay Divorcee / Top Hat / Swing Time / Shall We Dance) is essential for someone who doesn't really know this dancing duo that well. This volume is really for the completist. ""Flying Down to Rio"" and ""Roberta"" don't even star the pair. Gene Raymond and Delores del Rio star in the 1933 precode ""Flying Down to Rio"" and Ginger and Fred are fourth and fifth billed feuding - and dancing - members of an American troupe that is performing in Rio. Its main virtue is that it is a precode and therefore some of the lines and situations are priceless. ""Roberta"" stars RKO's queen of the lot at the time - Irene Dunne - and Randolph Scott before he found his niche in westerns. It's a good romantic comedy, but just don't expect too much of Fred and Ginger. ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" is the last film the duo did together for RKO and is ironic because, if the Castles are remembered at all today, it is because Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers played them in a movie. Plus, because the two are happily married in the film, you're missing all of the fun of the misunderstandings, squabbling, and sexual tension of their other RKO starring vehicles. ""Follow the Fleet"" stands alone in this set as one of the best that Astaire and Rogers did together. There's lots of great music and a good supporting cast. It's just too bad that in this second volume that there wasn't room for ""Carefree"", since it is one of the few films in which the plot has Ginger putting one over on Fred rather than vice versa.If you are really that big of an Astaire/Rogers completist maybe you should consider Astaire & Rogers Ultimate Collector's Edition (Flying Down to Rio / The Gay Divorcee / Roberta / Top Hat / Follow the Fleet / Swing Time / Shall We Dance / Carefree / The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle / The Barkleys of Broadway). It's been around long enough that it is usually always on sale somewhere and it is much more durably packaged than these Greatest Films Collections tend to be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RB95HR6LHEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F265IE#wasThisHelpful","R20RB95HR6LHEO","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"... but interesting and worthwhile just the same. Actually I'd give this one about 3.5/5 stars. MGM gives this story of early forays into night flight in South America the star treatment, but unfortunately we don't get to see most of these stars do what they do best - interact with one another. John Barrymore, as head of the night flight operation, spends most of his time robotically barking out orders or reproaches. Lionel Barrymore, as the inspector who gets no respect, is very good here, gets quite a bit of screen time, and winds up having a prolonged and interesting scene with Robert Montgomery who plays a young pilot.Helen Hayes, whose most famous film role as Madelon Claudet is no doubt destined to be ignomiously dumped onto DVD-R via the Warner Archive, has lots of screen time here as the wife of a pilot (Jules - played by Clark Gable) who is waiting on her husband to return from his first night flight for a late night celebration supper. As his arrival is delayed more and more throughout the night, so grows her panic.The oddest thing here is the misuse - or should I say lack of use - of Clark Gable. Throughout the film he is stuck in a plane, mute and motionless. Except for a few log entries that he makes and some of his facial expressions we are really denied a performance here or for that matter, an idea of what is going through his mind.I'd say it's worthwhile just because it's such an odd departure from what MGM generally did in the 1930's plus it's been locked in the vaults for 75 years due to rights problems. It's interesting to see how Warner Home Video has taken almost a film school approach to what they put out on DVD in the last couple of years. Practically all of their documentaries on film history wind up on pressed DVD, but some pretty entertaining precodes, noirs, and even more modern films such as ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" wind up in the Warner Archive on DVD-R, a medium that doesn't usually have a life span greater than a couple of years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OEASLM9NUQBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OBQDGG#wasThisHelpful","R3OEASLM9NUQBB","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 4/5 star film if compared with other hour-long B features of the day, not when compared with the A features of the same time period. There are plot holes big enough for ace pilot 3-star (Lyle Talbot) to fly his plane through, but that's OK, because the pace is brisk and the film is full of action. I won't list all of the questions that the characters - not to mention the screenplay writer - should have been asking, because I'd give too much away.Suffice it to say that pilot Bob 'Three Star' Halsey gets himself grounded for hot-shotting in the air near the airport where he is based. His boss would love to fire him, but both the boss and Three Star know he's too good a pilot for him to lose him to another airline. Of course Halsey has a girl, Judy Wagner (Ann Dvorak), and Judy has a brother who is also a pilot based out of the airport. Up to now Judy has been having to share Bob with his love of the air, but along comes an espionage plot centering around an important invention needed by the military that is to be transported by the airline that soon changes everything.There are some great aerial scenes here, and although the laws of reason - and sometimes physics as well as the limitations of human eyesight - are being violated left and right, it turns out to be fun although somewhat formulaic without being corny.Don't let the fact that this is an Alpha print dissuade you, it is as good a transfer as they would show on TCM - good contrast, minimum noise and scratches, good sound - it looks like a Warner Home Video release.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLBQ89KBYT6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001DMWV6#wasThisHelpful","R3SLBQ89KBYT6N","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Du Barry was a Lady is a musical that doesn't quite work, but there are some good bits by stars Ball, Skelton and Kelly. The oddball in the bunch is Room Service.

"Warren William was a great actor, particularly of the precode era, and Warners has packaged together three of his films that are not particularly interesting - a feat I would have figured difficult to accomplish.  Strangely enough, only one film is a precode - ""Woman from Monte Carlo"" - and William seems to sleepwalk through his role. The other two were made just after the precode era ended and the newly enforced production code was really cracking down on any sexual inuendos or - believe it or not - even making businessmen look corrupt or greedy. The cynical truths about life were victims of the code until war broke out in Europe and reality began to seep back into the movies. This lull in reality in the movies really hurt William's career and his chance at playing roles at which he excelled.There is such a wealth of material to draw on starring William from the precode era - ""Dark Horse"", ""Case of the Howling Dog"", ""The Mind Reader"", ""Match King"" - why did WB choose these???

"...although it starts out strong and ends strong. In season 4 House has recently lost his entire team - Chase, Cameron, and Foreman. He starts out trying to prove that he can do without hiring a diagnostic team, but ultimately he relents. How he chooses that diagnostic team drags down the coherence of the plot through episode nine. House starts out with 30 or so candidates and whittles them down over several episodes. By the time he did pick a team I was just tired of the whole game. The cases, for the most part, just aren't that compelling either as opposed to previous seasons. Oddly enough the original members of House's team wind up back at Princeton Plainsboro Hospital, but only one ends up working for/with him by the end of the season. The other two declare that they are just ""Housed out"".The best storyline is when Wilson begins to date Amber, one of the last candidates weeded from House's team. The primary reason House got rid of her - she is too much like himself. For Amber it's all about winning. House is puzzled because he assumes Amber is dating Wilson to get back at House for firing her, plus he is somewhat confused by the fact that for the first time Wilson is not dating an emotionally needy girl. Of course he tries to break them up.I'd recommend it because House remains much more interesting than anything else on TV these days, but this season just doesn't rise to the greatness of the first three seasons.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3IYD9T5YE4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A4VH2U#wasThisHelpful","R3F3IYD9T5YE4P","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First an explanation of my rating. Are these movies great ones with Jean Harlow's talent prominently exhibited - of course, so five stars for that. Is this simply a rehash of material that has been available on DVD for over five years in an attempt to cash in on Jean Harlow's birthday - absolutely, so one star for that. I average to get three stars.Jean Harlow spent the lion's share of her career at MGM so Warner Home Video has control of virtually her entire filmography save a few Columbias she did early on. What WHV controls that is not on pressed DVD includes (In reverse chronological order):Saratoga - Good but heartbreaking because Harlow died during filming and you can very easily tell where a double takes over, always shot from behind.Personal Property - An OK remake of the superior precode ""Man in Possession""Suzy - If you liked Hell's Angels you'll love this one.Riffraff - Almost precode in content, a story of a rocky cannery row marriage.Reckless - MGM used Harlow's personal troubles as a plot.The Girl from Missouri - You can almost see the demarcation line of the precode era running down the middle of this story of a girl in search of a marriageable millionaire.Bombshell - The best of what is not out on DVD yet. Harlow parodies herself.Hold Your Man - Practically two different movies. The first half is brassy, the second half sentimental. Some don't like it but I loved it.Red Dust - The plot is merely a framework for some great precode moments.The Beast of the City - On DVD-R via Warner Archives. It deserves more respect than that fate.The Secret Six - Harlow's first appearance in a credited role for MGM. She doesn't do much here but what she does is done well. Strangely enough, never shown on TCM any more.I have no problem with the TCM greatest films franchise as far as bringing cheap collections of classic films to the masses, but Harlow still has plenty of fans since her humor and brassiness are timeless. If WHV thinks a boxed set of pressed DVDs of her yet unreleased films would not sell well on the 100th anniversary of her birth, they need to have their collective heads examined. More than likely their heads are fine though. The films I mention above are probably all destined for the Warner Archive where you can count on over-priced pixelated DVD-R's that randomly freeze made with loving care by a ten buck an hour employee who is just waiting for the recession to end to trade jobs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T7NLFA3OPHQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047BXR1C#wasThisHelpful","R1T7NLFA3OPHQC","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't you just hate it when such a potentially helpful book exists and you can't at least see the table of contents? Well, I provide that below. As for details, I find it a very helpful and very heavily mathematical book. You won't just see the same old stuff on convolution kernels, histogram equalization and matching etc. rehashed with very few technical details and lots of pretty color plates. Be prepared to look at theorems and a few derivations, but the book is practical too. I'd highly recommend it to the professional who is ready for some more advanced material. As for IDL/ENVI, the algorithms are described well enough you don't have to use that as an implementation language. If you don't know ENVI/IDL this is a pretty good tutorial without trying nearly as hard as programming books on that specific subject.Preface to the Second Edition xiPreface to the First Edition xiii1

"I'd say if you're a newbie at classic films and want to see what has made this team remembered over the years, these are their four best joint efforts. There are two collections of Astaire and Rogers films already being sold by Warner Brothers that have all of their films, if you're interested. However, the films at the beginning and end of their partnership aren't nearly as good as these. At the beginning of their careers you have two films - ""Flying Down To Rio"" (1933) and ""Roberta"" (1934) that don't even star the pair. Instead they are supporting players trading smart remarks and only doing a couple of numbers. Their last film at RKO ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" is rather ironic because today if people remember the Castles at all it is because Astaire and Rogers played them. The two are a close happily married couple throughout and it is just missing something without the sexual tension and comic mix-ups of their other films. Their last pairing ""Barkleys of Broadway"" is actually an MGM musical in the MGM tradition, so it is not really typical of what the two did at RKO either.I'd recommend this set if you're not an Astaire/Rogers completist nor think you may become one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCZSPVC14TTT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406UJZG#wasThisHelpful","RCZSPVC14TTT7","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Madame Satan is an early talkie musical that was Cecil B. DeMille's second try at a talking picture. The first half of the film is your basic precode bedroom farce, made particularly amusing by that spitfire Lilian Roth, here at only age 19. The second half is the bizarre musical portion set on a dirigible. We're in Golden Dawn territory here folks, so prepare for lots of jaw dropping moments.My problem with this product was that the first one pixelated on two of the four players in my house. Believing that since I shelled out Warner's highway robbery price for their remastered DVD-R's I should be able to watch this film in any of my DVD players, I requested a replacement. This one played on three of the four players, but refused to even be recognized by the fourth. The rejecting DVD player was not one of the two that rejected the original disc. So if you get this one, try it out immediately and make sure you don't have a bad disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ9MHUCGBSYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DK8UVE#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ9MHUCGBSYL","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three of these four films are Berkeley from his heyday including the one that started it all, 42nd Street. The other two very good ones in order of quality are ""Footlight Parade"" with James Cagney - Dick Powell was recovering from an illness at the time - and ""Dames"". The thing that makes me scratch my head is the choice of ""Gold Diggers of 1937"" to round out the four.""Gold Diggers of 1933"" was the Busby Berkeley musical, in my opinion, that had the best combination of plot and music, yet it is omitted. Berkeley was really hampered by the introduction of the 1934 production code, so ""Gold Diggers of 1935"" has a really inane plot, but it has probably the best number ever in a Berkeley film, maybe in any musical film of the 1930's ""Lullaby of Broadway"". I feel like either of those would have been a better selection. You can have the best of Berkeley by buying The Busby Berkeley Collection (Footlight Parade / Gold Diggers of 1933 / Dames / Gold Diggers of 1935 / 42nd Street) which is a five star set if you ask me. It's been out for some time, so you should be able to find a copy on sale relatively cheap.The included ""Gold Diggers of 1937"" has one plus in its DVD incarnation. It includes the only surviving footage of the lost early talkie color film ""Gold Diggers of Broadway"" as an extra. If you can find an individual copy of that film on DVD used, it is worth it just to see these two excerpts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WC0A8FPS0NJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00406UJWE#wasThisHelpful","R1WC0A8FPS0NJH","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set will include:Lassie Come Home (1943)Son of Lassie (1945)Courage of Lassie (1946)Hills of Home (1948)From the press release:In an unusual departure from its practice in their TCM's Greatest Classic Films line, Warner is including a new-to-DVD title, Hills of Home (1948), in its just announced TCM Greatest Classic Films: Lassie set.The fourth entry in the Lassie film series, Hills of Home stars Edmund Gwenn, Donald Crisp, Tom Drake and Janet Leigh.It will be a 2-disc set and will street on February 1st. All the bonus features from the previous three releases will carry over, plus two new ones:Vintage Short Fala at Hyde ParkClassic Cartoon Puttin' on the DogEnd of press release.This was actually pretty good news from my standpoint since I have always been exceptionally fond of ""Hills of Home"" and wondered why Warners didn't put it out on DVD when they were releasing all of the other Lassie films. Hills of Home has plenty of Lassie in it, but it mainly focuses on Edmund Gwenn as Dr. William McClure, a village doctor in late 19th century Scotland that gets tricked into taking Lassie as payment for his services, and then learns that the dog has a flaw that makes her worthless as a working dog - she's afraid of water. McClure has always been a stoic and practical man, but he finds himself binding to Lassie in spite of her flaws. It's a very heart-warming film and I highly recommend it as I do this economical set of Lassie films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXURFT8D24FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047BXR1M#wasThisHelpful","R3GXURFT8D24FY","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's like Fox looked at the DVDs they had lying around in their warehouse, scooped some of them up, and made a collection out of them. And don't get me started on how bad the packaging has been on their big classic collections the last couple of years. I shouldn't single out Fox too much, since Warner Brothers has been doing this too, minus the packaging issues. The point is, the big studios are largely done with classics on standard DVD. At this point they are only interested in re-releases of their tent-pole classics on Blu.There is already a summary of all of the movies in this set at the top of the page, so I won't go through that again. The important thing to point out is that all of the films here have been released individually and sometimes in overlapping box sets repeatedly with one exception - Cavalcade. That film was the Best Picture of 1933, and along with Paramount's ""Wings"" these were the only films to win the Best Picture Oscar to never be released on DVD. With Cavalcade's release, Wings will stand alone in that category. Cavalcade was a British release, and looks back on thirty years of British history through the experience of one wealthy family. Thus, don't be expecting a precode or anything remotely similar to what was released in the U.S. in 1933.The actual press release states that Fox does not plan to release Cavalcade individually, so I guess the question you must answer is this - is having Cavalcade worth several hundred dollars?I'm actually giving this four stars because the movies here are good ones, and it might be a good buy if you don't already have any of them. Let me also point out that a well-packaged and more economical choice for the classic movie fan might be the Fox classic quads.

"From the press release:""The 18-disc set will feature 15 films with 5 new-to-DVD (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Viva Zapata!, Man on a Tightrope, Wild River, and America, America.) The other 10 make up films already released by Fox, Warner and Sony.The collection will also include a collector's booklet and the documentary, A Letter to Elia.The studio confirms that at this time singles will not be available. So anyone wishing to purchase the previously unreleased titles may only do so through this set.""I have most of what is already previously released - as I assume many classic film fans do. It's a shame they won't sell 1945's  ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" separately, as that film alone would likely make big sales. It's been tops on a list of most wanted classic flims for a long time. As for the documentary, it's airing on PBS in October.Finally there is the issue of packaging. If Fox was going in on this alone I'd look back at the horror that was the packaging of The Alfred Hitchcock Premiere Collection, The Paul Newman Tribute Collection, and the Murnau-Borzage at Fox Collection and just assume that this set too would come with the DVDs looking like they were packed by Catwoman with her claws extended since apparently Fox is too busy reselling the Alien(s) series of movies in every conceivable format to be bothered with classic film fans anymore.  However, there is hope in that regard with Sony and Warner's involved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8U7YFWYJXJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042DN4UY#wasThisHelpful","R3O8U7YFWYJXJJ","A2E3F04ZK7FG66","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E3F04ZK7FG66?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is a fantastic book for people who like to think philosophically and rigorously.  One probably needs to go through it multiple times to truly understand all the points.  Hoppe doesn't try to prove his arguments empirically, instead he reasons his way into the powerful conclusions.  It is a treat to read.  If you love liberty and want to explore a fantastic defense of pure capitalism, then I don't think you can do much better.  Definitely a required reading for all Libertarians of any flavor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEZCUSI57FM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478302917#wasThisHelpful","R2BEZCUSI57FM3","AQ6YJM2J2LNOP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6YJM2J2LNOP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

What makes it so good in my opinion is that Huemer draws his conclusion from some rather straightforward assumptions that are non-controversial.

Both parts are great.

"thI've read most of Harrison's books and I think they are all excellent.  This latest book on ""Good Thinking"" is no exception.  The book starts out why good thinking is important.  He follow that up with a general overview of how the brain works and describes how our subconscious mind (what he calls the shadow brain) strongly influences our behavior and thinking.  There is a lot of advice and examples of how we can and must be skeptical and override this shadow brain's influences on our thinking.This is just a really good book on how our thinking goes haywire and why.

"I'm really torn about this book.  I am a strong advocate of the rights of the accused and no matter what someone has done they deserve a fair trial.  At the same I can think of nothing worse than butchering one's family.  While Morris makes some valid points about how unfairly MacDonald and the defense were treated, he simply fails to make a vigorous defense of MacDonald.  Now that may not be what the book is about but Morris clearly believes in actual innocence.  When you want to make an argument in favor of a position - MacDonald did not murder his family - you are OBLIGATED to take and present the best case for the opposition.  This is where Morris fails miserably.  He simply drones on and on about Helena Stoeckley while hardly addressing blood or pajama top at all.  He did NOT present and dismantle the best argument for MacDonald's guilt.  He barely presented it at all.  For this he gets a fail.  For presenting evidence that MacDonald was treated unfairly he gets a decent grade.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHGLG2Q2WBP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143123696#wasThisHelpful","R2NHGLG2Q2WBP7","AQ6YJM2J2LNOP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6YJM2J2LNOP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It tries to do too much and one doesn't know what is really important and what is not.  I'm afraid some readers will get bogged down and give up on it.

"There is a lot to like about this laptop.  It seems very well built.  It has a good feel and has a large and bright screen.  It also has a DVD drive which many computers no longer have.  I find I still need one occasionally.  Once it has finished booting everything up it seems quick and responsive.  There are a couple of things I don't like.  First of all for the size of screen I don't think the resolution is high enough.  I have gotten used to very high resolution screens and this one just seems to low.  Secondly there is no solid state drive included.  This is really not much of a problem once the laptop has booted and started everything but it is noticeably slow the first few minutes.  Of course all features cost money and the more you add the more it costs.  So I think for the price this laptop is really well done.  It will not perform like a $1500 laptop but then you aren't paying $1500 either.

"This book was fascinating in many ways.  It is a rather unique way of looking at human history.  The author is very insightful in explaining how we came to be the way we are and why.  I took off a star because I think he ventures into areas and tries to make connections where none exist.  He wants to call everything a religion (like capitalism for example) that pretty much empties the word ""religion"" of any meaning.  He states some claims as if they were fact when in reality they are just his own speculations.  Regardless this still is a very good book and I beleive the author does make some very insightful observations.

"This book has three parts.  The first part is a description of a government that is beyond rehabilitation by the political process.  According to Murray even if you had a favorable congress, president, and supreme court you could only affect the margins.  In this part of the book Murray is simply outsanding.  While I long ago gave up any hope for the political process to restore liberty I have never read such an easy to understand, simple, and clear analysis of why.  This part of the book is compelling and convincing.The second part of the book proposes civil disobedience in the form of violation of rules of the regulatory state and having a ""Madison Fund"" to provide free legal defense to fight it.  While I think this is an excellent idea for the people involved who would otherwise be ruined by the beauracrats, I remain extremely pessimistic about it ultimately having any real effect.  To be fair Murray admits it is a long shot, but he argues it COULD work.I have long been in favor of simply ignoring the government and ignoring politics.  The state depends upon people being involved (which is why they are desperate for you to ""participate"") and it depends upon us voluntarily acting like sheep and following the rules.  I realize if you are a small business owner or are in a trade requiring licensing you can't completely ignore the government.  But most of us can (with the exception of still having to pay our taxes).  This kind of mass civil disobedience in my view has a lot more probability of success.The final part of the book talks about changes in technology and diversity within the country that are important factors.  This was interesting analysis but to me really didn't lead much of anywhere.Murray has given up, or so it seems on politics.  Now if we can just convince a lot more distinguished individuals to do the same we may get somewhere.  Well done.This is a good book.  It some ways it is a really good book.  The first part is alone worth the price of the entire book and in my opinion worth a lot more.  The rest of the book was interesting to me but not outstanding, so that is why I knocked a star off.  I still highly, highly recommend the book though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R295BEKNL9FZ3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385346514#wasThisHelpful","R295BEKNL9FZ3J","AQ6YJM2J2LNOP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ6YJM2J2LNOP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good book.  It is broken into two parts.  This first part explain the problem - that our cultural changes have vastly outpaced our evolution.  The second part of the book is supposed to be prescriptive and it is to some degree, but it also contains a lot of analysis of the problems we face.  I found the first part compelling while I thought the second part dragged a little.  Overall though it was well worth reading for the thoughtful person.

"This book rights highly mostly on the fact that it provides a very good account of something that I believe is almost unknown among the general population.  That being that corporations in concert with some politicians and religious leaders created the idea that America is founded upon Christian principles during the middle of the 20th century.  I already knew it was a myth that our founders were Christian or their political ideas or anything else about the founding of the country was based upon Christian principles, but I had no idea really where that idea came from.  It's a fact that colonial America was not a particularly religious place.  It's absolutely amazing what happened in regards to religion and politics in the 50's through the 70's.  I've lived through what happened since.If you want to know the history of the Christianizing of American politics read this book.

"I was surprised at this book.  As a lifelong libertarian I thought I would check out what one of the ""leaders"" of mainstream libertarianism had to say and I wasn't expecting much.  However, I have to admit that I was very surprised at how well the author captured what libertarianism is all about.  The book is called ""The Libertarian Mind"" and I thought it described very well how a libertarian views things and thus provides as good a picture of the libertarian mindset as one can probably do in a book like this.  There are major differences in viewpoints among libertarians - there are right-wing and left-wing libertarians as strange as that may sound, but in the end they all view the state as the major problem in modern society.

"This is an easy book to understand and it seems that was the whole point of the author.  Someone criticized it for not being about philosophical arguments for God.  Never mind only a tiny percentage of people can follow those arguments and obviously those people weren't the target audience.  The author does a good job of laying out why believing in the Christian God (and other gods) is irrational.  In some ways I think he beats a dead horse.  For example he spends about 1/3 of the book on the futility of prayer.  While the ""argument against prayer"" is undoubtedly effective and important I think it could have been done more concisely.  Otherwise this is just a really clearly argued book.  It's interesting and easy to understand.  Not a great book but a really good book nonetheless.

I knew from the sizing chart that these panties would be a little larger than my usual size 9, but they turned out to be a lot bigger. Two sizes down is probably more what I'm used to. Not only that, each panty was a different size--up to half an inch longer along the side seam than the smallest one. The smaller ones are usable though baggy, but the larger ones are really too large for me. The nylon material is thin and somewhat see-through.

"""Don't Call It Love"" is a book that describes relationship dependency and how to break that cycle. I've had difficultly understanding why a teenager I mentor seems to seek out chaotic, emotional roller coaster relationships. This book did help me understand where she's coming from, but it's intended to be read by someone who needs help rather than someone who wants to help. The overall tone of the book was encouraging and hopeful.The majority of the book was a series of questions, lists, and descriptions relating to relationship dependency. The authors described various traits of relationship dependency, the 8-phase addicted-to-relationships cycle, and the fears that drive this behavior. They explored how emotional and spiritual abuse contributes to relationship dependency. (Spiritual abuse is when someone deliberately uses God's approval--and this someone ""speaks"" for God--to control another person.) They also explained how brain chemistry can reinforce bad patterns of behavior, how this can be retrained, and various attachment styles.Finally, they talked about the truths you need to know to replace the lies that feed relationship dependency. The authors are Christians, so these truths are based on Biblical truths. This included more questions and lists, but these showed how knowing the truth changes the answers that you might have previously given. They also included a 12 week recovery plan that gives a prayer, Bible verse, the truth learned from that verse, and actions to take that week.The book gently helps the reader to recognize and admit unhealthy relationship patterns in their lives and encourages them to want something better. I think it'd help someone frustrated with their relationships.I received an ebook review copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DXCP0B4WWJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800726758#wasThisHelpful","R16DXCP0B4WWJ2","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't comment on this food's ability to control weight, but I assume the manufacturer knows what they're about in that regard. My three cats enjoy dry cat foods, and two have yet to meet a dry food they don't love. When I first opened this bag, they all came running like the smell was driving them crazy. I put out a portion on top of their old food (as you don't want to switch foods too quickly). They tried a few bites then kept running back to the bag with an air of confusion like the taste didn't match the wonderful smell. They've been eating it for a week now. My pickier cat prefers the old food when offered a choice, but she will eat this food. I'll mention that the old food is not a weight control variety, and my picky cat does not need a weight control food. My two male cats eagerly eat this food now that they've gotten over that initial confusion, but they're more likely to walk away from the unfinished food than with other cat foods we've tried.The ingredients generally look like quality, whole foods.

"""Dirty Old London"" is a history of the sanitary movement in London in the 1800's. The author covered household refuse (trash/garbage), street mud (a mix of dirt, ash, dung, trash), night soil (from cesspools to sewers), corpses (changes in graveyards), bathing and laundry (how can the poor get clean?), public toilets (what to do when you just have to go!), soot (from boy sweeps to mechanical brushes), and attempts to clean up the slums including model housing for the poor.The author talked about what had been done in the past, what people proposed should be changed and why, and what was actually done and where (since it didn't happen everywhere at once). We're given dates for when the idea was proposed and for the various tries that people made, so we see how long it took to make these changes--including changes in people's attitudes. There were quotes from government and association reports, newspapers and magazines, and even court cases.I found the information easy to follow and extremely interesting.

"""Devotions on the Hebrew Bible"" is a collection of 54 devotions written by 38 different people. The stated intent is to encourage professors, students, and pastors to continue to use their Hebrew Bible and to demonstrate that a knowledge of the original languages can be spiritually rewarding. I'm self-taught to a level that I can basically do detailed word studies.Most of these devotions could be read by someone unfamiliar with Hebrew. You'll gain insight into verses with a Hebrew word that doesn't translate well into English or a sentence pattern (chiasm, word plays, repetition, etc.) that is significant but lost with English translations. However, you'll follow the author's point better if you understand what statements like ""qal passive participle"" mean. A couple of the devotions were technical and focused on subtle nuances of meaning. Frankly, those lost me. But I enjoyed the rest and gained some interesting insights in the process.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK9HU416CG4Z1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310494532#wasThisHelpful","RK9HU416CG4Z1","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Case for Hope"" is about what we put our hope in, why we can have confident hope in Christ, and how to live that hope out. Due to the title, I expected a bunch of interviews like in his early books (""Case for Christ"", ""Case for Faith""). While some interviews were worked into the flow, it's more his take on the subject than exploring other people's answers. I thought he did a good, Bible-based job of explaining the hope we can have through Jesus.He started by explaining the different uses of ""hope"" in our culture and what biblical hope means--a sure hope, not a please-let-it-be-true hope. He explored why we can have assurance that Jesus was the Son of God and how his death and resurrection provides us with hope. This hope can transform our lives, and our hope can still be sure even in times of doubt. He described various people whose lives have been transformed by knowing Christ, even people who actively rejected Christ. At the end, he provided a 30-day Journal. Each day had a scripture on hope to think about and room underneath to write down your thoughts.The author did a good job of describing biblical hope, why we can feel confident in it, and how this can change our lives. I'd recommend this book to new Christians or those who feel like they don't have a confident hope in anything.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher through BookLook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CN8QI1I1PDLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031033957X#wasThisHelpful","R2CN8QI1I1PDLW","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Killing Trail"" is a K9-detective mystery. Officer Mattie Cobb is learning to trust her dog and pick up on what he's telling her. Since she's going to run the local high school's anti-drug program, she also has to move beyond her past as a foster kid and rebellious teenager. Cole Walker is very busy with his veterinarian practice which has led to his wife leaving him and their daughters. Add to that pain, his teenage daughter's friend has been murdered. He struggles to be there for his daughters while dealing with his own pain.The characters were realistic and likable. Robo is a well-trained working dog who loves his job, so don't expect a ""cutesy dog."" The author clearly put a lot of effort into getting the K9 and vet parts correct. These details made the story feel real without slowing the pace.The crime was a clue-based, puzzle mystery. About halfway through, I had two strong suspects. Mattie soon picked up on the more obvious one. I could understand why she didn't suspect the other one despite various clues also pointing that way. The story keep my interest to the exciting, action-packed end as I wanted to see how it all played out.There were no sex scenes. The was a fair amount of bad language.

"""Instruments of Darkness"" is a suspense novel set in 1780 in England. There's an unknown, lurking menace in the nearby Thornleigh Hall. Harriet knows the recent murder will be left unsolved unless she takes action, and she believes in justice. But pursuing justice puts her at odds with the powerful family at Thornleigh Hall. She asks for Crowther's help because he has studied the marks left on a body by murder and because she wants to talk the case over with someone level-headed.The characters were well-developed so I understood why they acted as they did. Our heroes steadily pursued answers and stood for justice even when threatened or in danger. The secrets of Thornleigh Hall were slowly revealed and evidence gathered. The suspense mainly came from physical danger, but Harriet's reputation was also under threat.Innocent people died in horrid ways. Minimal ""gore"" detail was used to describe these scenes, but it disturbed the characters and may disturb the reader--which I think was the point. It was worth any risk to stop this evil. (A dog also dies. It was the historically accurate way to legally prove the presence of poison in a food or drink. Harriet and Crowther spending so much time together alone seemed less historically accurate.)There was no sex. There was a fair amount and a wide variety of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this interesting suspense novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FX4JPFA30J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067002242X#wasThisHelpful","R31FX4JPFA30J0","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a raw probiotic supplement that contains 16 probiotic strains. They guarantee that you get 50 billion live probiotic cultures per capsule. These diverse strains are resistant to stomach acid and bile (and so are more likely to survive long enough to get into your gut). The strains are listed on the bottle and packaging, but to give an idea: 40 billion of the cultures (and 11 of the strains) are lactobacillus and 10 billion of the cultures (and 5 of the strains) are bifidobacterium. There is also prebiotic fiber from organic potato and organic acacia. The capsule is made from Non-GMO vegetable cellulose.Store in a cool, dry place. No refrigeration is needed because the capsules are in a desiccant-lined bottle. There are 30 capsules per bottle, and adults take one each day. It can be taken with or without food. You can swallow the capsule (which I always find difficult) or open it, mix the contents into something, and eat it. They suggest taking it with water or raw juice. The expiration date on mine was June 2017 (which is nearly 2 years). It's gluten free, dairy free, soy free.I often eat food containing probiotics, so I didn't notice any difference when using these capsules. They were easy enough to take mixed into my daily smoothie.

"In the era of cell phones, people generally wear watches as jewelry, and this watch is an eye-catching conversation starter. It's 1.75"" across the face (not counting the knob). It's heavier and bigger than I expected. It came in a large jewelry case and contained the bear minimum of directions: just how to set the watch. This is a wind-up watch, and one full winding lasted about two days. It has an hour, a minute, and a sweeping seconds hand. Setting the watch is a simple matter of pulling the knob out, twisting the knob to set the time, and pushing the knob back in. Wind the watch when the knob is in to set the hands in motion. The arrows on the hands and dots near the Roman numerals use glow-in-the dark paint. Minutes/seconds are marked around the edge. Due to some decorative work, it's not as easy to see the gears as I'd hoped, but I can see all the gears that visibly move during operation.As a child, I loved watching a similar watch that my grandpa owned. I realized this was a men's watch (and I'm an average-sized woman), but the memories tempted me into reviewing this watch. The wrist band is made of black leather. The smallest hole still left the watch loose on my wrist, but it looks like it should fit most grown men. It should fit around 7"" to 9.5"" wrists. I've never fastened a watch using a clasp system like the one used on this watch. There is a metal part that snaps open and swings out to allow you to thread the wrist band into place. Then you secure the peg through the hole and swing the metal part back into place. Sorry, horrid description. Hopefully the pictures will help. I haven't yet got the hang of it. There are no directions.Overall, I'm pleased with my piece of nostalgia, though I wouldn't pay the price they're asking considering I can't even wear it.  Male clock-work watch fanciers might like it as long as they know how to secure the wristband on their wrists.UPDATE: I decided that if you don't use the first, fixed-in-place loop to secure the wristband closed, it's fairly easy to put this watch on and take it off. When taking it off, I slide the moving loop off and lift the top band away from my body to click open the clasp. I had a man try it this way, and it also was much, much easier than when he tried it using both loops. Still, I'm giving it 3 stars instead of four because this clasp system doesn't work as easily as I'd want.UPDATE: My initial impression was than this watch was pretty accurate. However, I decided to test it for two weeks, winding it up fully every day. My watch is 7-8 seconds slower every day. So by day 8, it was one minute slow. In a year, it'll be about 48 minutes slow. The watch is easy enough to re-set (as long as you aren't trying to synchronize it with another clock), but I had been under the impression that wind-up watches were more accurate than this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZU5YO1J7UJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXN9FC#wasThisHelpful","RNZU5YO1J7UJB","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Making of Home"" examines how houses and people's attitudes towards them have changed over the last 500 years in the USA and European countries. She started by describing what houses used to look like for the majority of people. She examined how ideas and ideals about houses changed as some countries began to value private spaces in homes. House layouts changed and rooms became specialized instead of general purpose. Gender roles and ideals changed as industrialization meant men went to work rather than worked out of their house.She talked about developments in heating (hearth to stove to central heating), windows (open to glazed and/or screened), lighting (fire to gas to electric), and plumbing and sewer systems. These developments changed house layouts and people's attitudes toward privacy and cleanliness. This desire for privacy and ""healthy country living"" led to the creation of suburbs as transportation technologies allowed commuting longer distances. She also touched on a multitude of other topics, like how nostalgia and the availability of servants affected building styles.I've always enjoyed this author's books, and I learned a lot from this one. However, I wondered how many of her conclusions would hold up under a deeper look. For example, she pointed out that London didn't have enough pew space to accommodate London's full population on Sundays. While I agree that not everyone went to church, she apparently assumes each church held only one service, which would be inaccurate. Overall, though, it was a good survey of how changing technologies and attitudes in industrial countries influenced house designs, how they were furnished, and even where they were located.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3L2PPT292CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067359#wasThisHelpful","R2N3L2PPT292CI","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Part of Our Lives"" looks at how social issues throughout American history have affected how public libraries are used and what books they carry. The author spent a chapter describing the first public-use libraries in America (including social libraries and circulating libraries) and what prompted people to switch from that to public libraries supported by taxes. The rest of the book was about changes at and the spread of those libraries.The author focused on what the library users of the time wrote about the libraries, so much of the book recounted controversies about what reading materials should be put in the libraries and what materials or activities should be banned (usually based on the major social issues of that period). He also quoted people explaining about how libraries and books impacted their lives.He also talked about how libraries changed over time: closed stacks to open stacks; the various programs they hosted; allowing women, children, and blacks to use the library, and so on. I enjoyed learning how library use changed over time, but I didn't realize how much of the content would be recounting heated debates. I don't enjoy controversial debates.

"""The Cactus Creek Challenge"" is a humorous romance set in 1888 in a small town in Texas. The humor came from the many funny situations the four contestants faced in their new jobs. I liked the romance between the baker and the stable owner as it progressed slowly and made sense. Each had to build their trust in one another and overcome their reservations about marrying again.We're told that Ben was nice in the past; he simply didn't realize Cassie was a grown woman now. Well, he was very dense when it came to women, but even Cassie began to doubt Ben was worth winning after a while. He belittled her, dismissed her abilities, wouldn't take her seriously even after she proved her worth, and didn't respect her as a person. Since we never saw what he was like before the contest, I had a hard time liking him. In her turn, Cassie refused help even when she needed it because she wanted to prove Ben wrong. She finally realized her pride was making a mess of things and added maturity to her cleverness. Ben also found some humility. They did a lot better when working together than when fighting each other.The story wasn't deeply historical or Christian. The Christian element was a few, brief prayers and a few hymns sung to quiet a horse. There was no bad language and no sex.

"The title of this book is misleading. It's a selection of 20 Bible stories that are as much about the men as the women. So Miriam's story was also about Moses and Aaron, Abigail's story focused mostly on Nabal and David, and so on. The author took about 5 pages to retell each Bible story. She switched between tenses, so she'd start off in present tense (""run""), have a few ""am running"" mixed in, then switch to past tense (""ran""). It found this distracting, and it felt poorly edited to me.The author added fictional elements to ""flesh out"" the stories, but it was usually physical descriptions or comments like: Pharaoh made a ""brainless attempt"" to overtake the Israelites as they left Egypt. She also portrayed people in ways I don't agree with, like in Rahab's story: ""Their husbands give her looks that tell her they are wondering what it would be like to caress her honey-gold skin"" and this pleases Rahab. So we're left to believe God saved this apparently unrepentant woman simply because she decided He was more powerful than her gods. And some details didn't need to be added, like David watched as Bathsheba ""rubs a sponge across her body--caressing her face, her neck, and then her breasts.""Each story was followed by one page (or less) of information on ""The Times"" which told where the story is found in the Bible and about the larger historical context of the story. We're also given information on topics like harems, eunuchs, kinsmen redeemers, and such. The New Testament stories also included some cultural background information. She also included 4 or 5 questions about each story, like ""What three to five words would you use to describe Abigail's character?""I've enjoyed this author's books in the past, but I was very disappointed with this one.

"""Activate Your Brain"" contains advice for managers on how to get the most out of themselves and their team at work. I've read this advice in relationship books for years. The author found brain studies that back this advice up then applied it to business-related situations. It's good advice and will work, but it's not new just because they put a brain on the cover.The first two chapters were heavy on jargon with references to ""mammalian brain, ""reptilian brain,"" ""human brain,"" and the names of hormones connected with certain behaviors. His related advice was very basic, like think about the consequences before you say something, or don't make big decisions while tired, or break difficult tasks into easier steps and then do the first step. If you haven't heard this advice before, then you'll probably find the whole book very useful.The rest of the book focused more on real life situations and applications than on brain studies, though he'd still refer to how the brain works. He covered things you can do to keep yourself at top performance, like exercise (both mental and physical), nutrition, sleep, and relaxing activities. He covered effective ways to motivate workers (especially during stressful times), the benefits of cooperation & collaboration, and building trust in relationships. He also talked about things like control, confidence, and focus.The author did a good job at encouraging the reader, and he suggested practical ways to apply his advice. The application was usually specific to an office/business environment.

"""Out on the Wire"" is a graphic book that looks at how narrative nonfiction radio shows are created. The author assumed the reader has a certain familiarity with narrative nonfiction radio, and she used examples from shows that have aired. Narrative nonfiction is basically taking a series of interviews and/or narration by an individual and piecing bits together to tell a story--like how a T-shirt is made.The author interviewed various people involved in producing the five radio shows. She drew this book like she was piecing together bits of video interviews. The person's clothing, hairstyle, and background would change since she mixed together interviews done at different times. Unfortunately, many of the people looked very similar as drawn characters and she'd jump back and forth between people as well as in time. I found it difficult to keep track of who was from what show and what they did. Also, without audio clues, the frequent ""ha ha"" text sometimes felt out of place as it's not clear why they are laughing.The book mainly focused on storytelling aspects like coming up with the idea and the focus, getting engaging interviews, how to put the interviews together to form a story, and edits/critiquing. It also talked about sound cues (music, sound effects, ambient sounds) and editing the actual audio of the interviews. But it's not a how-to on the technical aspects of radio shows; it's a collection of useful tips about forming an engaging story.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R281SCXEY7T0KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348436#wasThisHelpful","R281SCXEY7T0KY","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""God's Crime Scene"" is an apologetic book that looks at evidence about the origins of the universe from the point of view of a cold case detective. Does the universe (including the earth, humans, and even their minds) show evidence of outside tampering or can the evidence be explained in purely naturalistic terms?The author looked at many ""lines of evidence"" (cosmology, biology, etc.) as he examined the case. I felt he did an excellent job of distilling the arguments down to explanations that non-scientists can understand. He quoted people from all sides of the debate, and he presented a wide range of possible explanations in the process of finding which one best fit the evidence.He used examples of various cases he's worked on to show how a detective examines evidence to determine if it's from an outside source and who is responsible. He then applied these methods to the evidence found in the universe. This helped to illustrate his points so I could more easily understand his reasoning.He only examined whether there was a Divine Intruder or not and, if so, what the evidence can tell us about this intruder. He did not attempt to argue who the Divine Intruder might be. He has another book that examines the Christian Bible to see if it's trustworthy evidence, and it's a good companion book with this one. I wouldn't hesitate to give this book to anyone who is uncertain if there is a god or not. It's also a good resource for people who like to debate this sort of thing with atheists and agnostics. This book will especially appeal to those who are interested in detective work.I received this ebook as a review copy from the publisher through netGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11957NJ53A4Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434707849#wasThisHelpful","R11957NJ53A4Q5","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a grill expert--I've only eaten other people's grill efforts and only had grilled food a handful of times. The hassle of non-electric grills was more than I wanted to try, and I'm not fond of ash on my food. But I love cooking indoors (near electric outlets), so this looked like just the thing for me! It's a little big for my 3 person family. (The grill surface is about 18""x10"".) We've started grilling some veggies on the empty space, basically grilling the whole dinner. We've used it for sausages, salmon steaks, homemade beef burgers, turkey burgers, and fish burgers. We used to cook these in our electric skillet, where they'd sit in the fat drippings, tended to cook unevenly, and sometimes edges got dried out.We followed the directions in the little booklet that comes with the grill. We used their heat level (simply numbered 1 through 5), timing, and left the cover on as instructed. This has resulted in awesome-tasting food every time. The moisture and heat is trapped by the lid and creates an even, moist cooking action. So the food is evenly cooked and moist. The food's bottom gets the grill marks, but the rest of the food remains uncharred (and clean of ash since its electric).The cord is plenty long for a kitchen counter and worked fine for having the grill on our deck next to the outlet. The stand was easy to put together and holds the grill securely. At 2.5 feet from floor to cooking surface, it's lower than most grills-on-stands that I've seen but actually a nice height for us women cooks! This grill is a little longer than our skillet, so it's a little more challenging to maneuver when washing it. However, overall, it's actually easier to clean up than our skillet. Just running a paper towel over the (cooled!) grill will remove most of the char from the drippings. And, yes, most of the fat drips into the channels, down the tilt, and into the fat catcher that you slide in under the grill surface on one end. The handle was a little difficult to screw fully on, but otherwise assembly was a breeze. We love this grill and are using it once or twice a week.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA793AAK1BXKD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUWU#wasThisHelpful","RA793AAK1BXKD","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Hidden Agenda"" is a Christian romantic suspense novel. It's the third book in a series. You can understand what's going on without reading the previous novels. However, some events from the previous novels are spoiled in this one, so I'd recommend starting with the first book.The suspense is high from start to finish. It's mainly created by the physical danger, but it's also from the relationship tensions. Who can they trust after all the lies? Also, Ivan is deaf, but he's now an adult. He wants his sister to stop mothering him and see him as a capable adult. These relationship dynamics and complex characters kept the story interesting.Suspense novel romances always develop too quickly, IMO, and these two were complete strangers before meeting. So I appreciated that Olivia and Michael realized they need to get to know each other under normal circumstances to see if their on-the-run attraction is a enduring one.The Christian element was mostly in how their faith effected their decisions, like the siblings saving a man they weren't sure of or people deciding to forgive the lies that they were told by loved ones. There was no sex or bad language. Overall, I'd highly recommend this suspense novel.I received this as an ebook review copy from the publisher through NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BARINKSVA439/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800721926#wasThisHelpful","R1BARINKSVA439","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Death of an Airman"" is a historical mystery set in 1934 in England. It's actually a reprint of a story that was written as a contemporary mystery. It's in the style of Christie; as in, the focus is on finding the clues rather than developing characters, but the characters still come across as real people.There were three viewpoint characters: the Bishop, the local detective, and the Scotland Yard detective. The detectives were clever. They tracked down reasonable leads, asked good questions, and would quickly realize when the various scenarios they came up with didn't match the clues. We learn the clues as each character finds them, so we have a chance to guess new scenarios before the detectives do.It's not easy to make all the clues fit together. Like the detectives, I would guess, realize that doesn't quite work, but how about this, but no... I had a good idea of whodunit and how shortly before the detectives. They were still missing critical information that the reader knows. I like it when you can guess just before the detectives, but they're still clever fellows. Nice!There was no sex. There was a fair amount of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this intriguing mystery.I received this as an ebook review copy from the publisher through NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16273QLUQ06CK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204829#wasThisHelpful","R16273QLUQ06CK","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Green Musician"" is a children's picture book based on a 1,000 year old Persian story. It's for ages 6 and up. The story is a nice, fairly simple one about a talented boy who finds a way to play for the king even though a rival tries to prevent him. It's a good message about not letting obstacles keep you from your dreams.The illustrations have the look of watercolor paintings, and they do a good job of telling the story along with the text. I enjoyed just looking at the illustrations for a bit. At the end, the author explained what happened to Barbad after the events in this story, as the tale is based on a real, historical person.

"""Classic Human Anatomy in Motion"" is an anatomy book for artists who draw, paint, or sculpt human nudes. Much of the information can be applied to clothed figures, too, which is how I intend to use it. I appreciated that the nude figures were treated respectfully (rather than shown in sexually suggestive poses) and really were anatomically accurate.This book contained many high-quality illustrations. Many of the illustrations showed the bones and muscles of the human body as you'd find them in an anatomy book. The author also pointed out which features can be seen on the surface and to look for them as reference points when drawing. She described the motions that each joint can do and how muscles work, so you can more realistically render the human body when it's in motion. To quote the book description, ""each chapter builds an artistic understanding of how motion transforms the human figure.""Rather than having the reader repeat her drawings as exercises, the author described how to draw the figure you are interested in (from models, everyday life, pictures, or video). She suggested warm-up exercises and ways to suggest an active (rather than passive) figure. She gave some advice about working from your imagination, but she generally assumed that you'll have some reference to draw from as you work.I'm familiar with human anatomy from my college days. I was impressed with the quality of this work, and it was a good refresher course for me. It has helped me understand how to apply that knowledge to my art. Overall, I'd recommend this book to artists who want to improve their depictions of human figures.I received this as an ebook review copy from the publisher through NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PL86DV51AUOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770434142#wasThisHelpful","R1PL86DV51AUOO","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""No Comfort for the Lost"" is a historical mystery set in 1867 in San Francisco. The mystery was clue-based. Pretty early on, I correctly guessed whodunit and why. However, the mystery was more complex than that implies, and there were parts of the overall scenario that I didn't guess. The mystery kept me engaged in the story.While the writing was good at giving me a feel for the city at this time, some things seemed a little ahead of their time. There probably was anti-Chinese sentiment around at this time, but I was under the impression that it didn't start to become a problem until several more years had passed. The germ theory of disease was not generally accepted until the late 1860s, and Joseph Lister didn't start experimenting with using carbolic acid until 1865, yet our heroine followed these cutting-edge medical ideas. Again, it seemed just a few years too soon.I liked the detective, but I didn't like Celia. She's basically guardian for her teenaged, half-Chinese cousin. She lives in her cousin's house and her medical practice is funded in part by money from the cousin's dead father. Yet when this cousin was in danger, Celia refused to take her to safety or let her go to safety. The cousin is extremely lonely and made a poor decision, but Celia could only see her mistake and tore this poor girl to pieces over it.Celia refused to go to safety because she felt she must stay in case some poor person needed her medical help. Then she spent her time running around, not even caring for the critically injured person at her house. At the end, she still believed that the murdered girl was innocent and reformed despite the series of poor decisions she made in her life. I guess it's easier to forgive the dead; Celia doesn't forgive the living.There was no sex (though unmarried sex was referred to as having happened). There was occasional bad language.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4RS005L3CF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451474899#wasThisHelpful","RI4RS005L3CF4","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Atheist Who Didn't Exist"" is a Christian apologetics book. The purpose is to point out the problems with 'bad argument' sound bits for atheism so that Christians and Atheists can carry on a more thoughtful dialogue. The author took an atheist claim and rephrased it in another context so that it was easier to see how the argument held up. He started each chapter with a silly story that illustrated the argument in the new context, then he explained why it isn't a good argument.I think he did a good job of showing why the arguments don't work. However, I can't use his stories to make a similar argument since he personalized them. I'd have to think a while to figure out how to explain his argument to someone else (which may be a good thing).The author's humor won't be for everyone. It's mainly teasing about things few Americans have any stake in (like English sports teams that don't do well). However, the author sometimes went beyond silly stories and teasing. He poked fun at Dawkins, for example, not just Dawkins' bad arguments. That bothered me. Christians are supposed to be known for their loving attitudes, and I doubt Dawkins is feeling the love.There are references to drinking alcohol and a few uses of bad language, which will turn off some Christians. Overall, I liked the method the author used to illustrate the problems with certain atheist arguments. However, I'm doubtful that the author's brand of humor would help in explaining the point to an atheist who takes those arguments seriously.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1WQJ5JCEKIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857216104#wasThisHelpful","R2T1WQJ5JCEKIN","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Waiting for Spring"" is a historical romance set in Wyoming in 1886 to 1887. This novel spoiled some of the events in the previous novel, and I'd recommend reading the series in order.Ironically, if I hadn't loved the first novel so much, I probably would have liked this one more. The previous novel had an element of mystery, but in this book we knew exactly who the bad guy was and his plans. The hero was passive for much of this story and only really engaged with life (and the heroine) near the end. I had a hard time liking the hero at first, though I didn't dislike him. The heroine was interesting and had some challenges to deal with in raising her blind son.I realize it's difficult to get technology correct in periods where technology was changing very quickly. However, while electricity was technically available at this time, it's very unlikely that a financially struggling household in the west would have their house fully wired for electricity. The heroine's house is.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7TYWLCONTQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800734602#wasThisHelpful","R1G7TYWLCONTQA","A2IIB10X0CECYV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IIB10X0CECYV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Noah Webster"" is a biography of Noah Webster for teenagers. The author told about Noah Webster's life, but she also explained enough about what was going on at the time that someone unfamiliar with it can understand how Webster's actions met a need and impacted the country.Webster had political opinions and tried to influence people to support a strong Federal government through his writings. But he also loved words, and he wrote educational material (a speller, reader, etc.) before he wrote a dictionary. It was interesting to learn the political and social backdrop behind things we take for granted today, like how spellings differ between American and British English.There were some illustrations of people, events, and books mentioned in the text. The book moved quickly and kept things interesting, which should appeal to teens.

"This book is extremely well-developed and and a major contribution, not least because it it one of the best explorations of information ecologies that are vastly more intricate and cover vastly more time, energy, and locational space, than most realize. It was recommended to me by Stephen E. Arnold, my most trusted IT advisor and author of the book not sold on Amazon, CyberOSINT: Next Generation Information Access.Another major value of the book is its centrality to the choices of Amazon's erudite readers. Here are ten other books -- culled from thirty -- that are being bought by buyers of this book. What this really means is that we are at the very beginning of breaking out of a very lazy insular academic system (citation cabals, Elsevier controls, only 1% of written papers being published, mono-lingual research, etcetera), and migrating ever so slowly toward a World Brain in which all minds are connected to all information in all languages and mediums all the time. These other ten books are also recommended, with the caveat that they are at best the 3rd grade level in relation to where we can and must go.01 Cataloging the World: Paul Otlet and the Birth of the Information Age02 Indexing It All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data (History and Foundations of Information Science)03 Data-ism: The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else04 ""Raw Data"" Is an Oxymoron (Infrastructures)05 Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact06 The Expert Library: Staffing, Sustaining, and Advancing The Academic Library in The 21st Century07 The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences08 The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information09 Obfuscation: A User's Guide for Privacy and Protest10 Truth: Philosophy in TransitThe last selection is my own, not culled from group-think. All of my non-fiction reviews across 98 categories can be found at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, via the Reviews page.I disagree with the author about the need to make massive investments in knowledge infrastructure. The weakness of the book -- a weakness that pales in relation to its larger value -- is a lack of understanding of where information technology is going and particularly open source information technology.  There are over 60 ""opens"" that have been grouped into nine main open sub-categories at the Peer to Peer (P2P) Foundation page Open Source Everything, all of them data intensive:01 Open Data02 Open Governance03 Open Health04 Open Infrastructures05 Open Intelligence06 Open Manufacturing07 Open Provisioning08 Open Software09 Open SpaceOpen Data -- with much work still to be done, includes Open Geospatial also known as Open Geo, Open Anthropology, Open History, Open Language, Shallow Web, Deep Web, Dark Web. In dealing with data we must be acutely conscious of the fact that less than 1% of archived digital big data is actually processed (Mary Meeker, 2014), and less than 4% of the Internet is indexed (Google, 2014).  Add to that the fact that roughly 90% of what we need to know is not in English, not online, and not ""visible"" to academics or government bureaucrats or merchants from their air-conditioned cubicles, and you get a  sense of my larger concern.In relation to information technology, we are now beyond Open Software and Open Hardware and moving rapidly to the intersection of Open Cloud, OpenGeo, Open Standards, and Open Spectrum.  The mesh network by-passing Internet Service Providers complicit in government interception, is emergent. Commercial search is an abysmal failure, compounded by commercial fraud -- Volkswagon's long-standing crime would have been quickly caught had their software been open source -- similarly Oracle's and others dismal security protocols would be quickly revealed and fixed if they were not using proprietary code to avoid accountability.One final observation: scholarship is in severe disrepute with the avant guarde who now see rote learning as a Stone Age construct. Scholarship is only but one of the eight data tribes -- the others are civil society (including labor unions and religions), business especially small business, government especially local, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government/non-profit. Whatever knowledge infrastructure we develop must recognize that all eight tribes have to able to share information and make sense together across all boundaries; and that education, intelligence (decision-support) and research must embrace holistic analytics, true cost economics, and open source everything engineering as their shared foundation going forward.  There is no government, no bank, no corporation, and no university today -- I single out Stanford, whose President probably never saw my email -- doing this today.  Needed are an Open Source Agency, a World Brain Institute, a School of Future-Oriented Hybrid Governance, and a United Nations Open-Source Decision-Support Information Network (UNODIN). In twenty years of seeking a university president or a government vice president (see my open letter to Biden) interested in creating a Smart Nation, I have failed. I dare to hope this new book suggests that the rest of the world is waking up to the possibilities.Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYUQF9IH1OVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028565#wasThisHelpful","R1XYUQF9IH1OVA","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a co-signer of the below letter to the President of the United States of America from Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), as delivered yesterday and also posted in ConsotiumNews.com by Robert Parry. A better more truthful book, albeit fiction to avoid the legal bru-ha-ha, is Broken!, a story of torture and treason far closer to reality than the version offered by the perpetrators themselves.MEMORANDUM FOR: The PresidentFROM: Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS)SUBJECT: Veteran Intelligence Professionals Challenge CIAs Rebuttal on TortureFormer CIA leaders responsible for allowing torture to become part of the 21st Century legacy of the CIA are trying to rehabilitate their tarnished reputations with the release of a new book, Rebuttal: The CIA Responds to the Senate Intelligence Committees Study of Its Detention and Interrogation Program. They are pushing the lie that the only allegations against them are from a partisan report issued by Democrats from the Senate Intelligence Committee.We recall the answer of General John Kimmons, the former Deputy Director of Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was asked if good intelligence could be obtained from abusive practices. He replied: I am absolutely convinced the answer to your first question is no. No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices. I think history tells us that. I think the empirical evidence of the last five years, hard years, tell us that.But the allegation that the CIA leaders were negligent and guilty was not the work of an isolated group of partisan Democrat Senators. The Senate Intelligence report on torture enjoyed bipartisan support. Senator John McCain, for example, whose own encounter with torture in North Vietnamese prisons scarred him physically and emotionally, embraced and endorsed the work of Senator Feinstein. It was only a small group of intransigent Republicans, led by Saxby Chambliss, who obstructed the work of the Senate Intel Committee.Indeed, some of us witnessed firsthand during the administration of President George W. Bush that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence were virtually paralyzed from conducting any meaningful oversight of the CIA and the U.S. Intelligence Community by the Republican members of these committees. Instead, they pursued the clear objective of protecting the Bush administration from any criticism for engaging in torture during the War on Terror.It is curious that our former colleagues stridently denounce the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee but are mute with respect to an equally damning report from the CIAs own inspector general, John Helgerson, in 2004.Helgersons report, Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Activities (September 2001-October 2003), was published on May 7, 2004, and classified Top Secret. That report alone is damning of the CIA leadership and it is important to remind all about the specifics of those conclusions. According to the CIAs own Inspector General:The Agencys detention and interrogation of terrorists has provided intelligence that has enabled the identification and apprehension of other terrorists and warned of terrorist plots planned in the United States and around the world. . . . The effectiveness of particular interrogation techniques in eliciting information that might not otherwise have been obtained cannot be so easily measured however.In addition, some Agency officials are aware of interrogation activities that were outside or beyond the scope of the written DOJ opinion. Officers are concerned that future public revelation of the CTC Program is inevitable and will seriously damage Agency officers personal reputations, as well as the reputation and effectiveness of the Agency itself.By distinction the Agency-especially in the early months of the Program-failed to provide adequate staffing, guidance, and support to those involved with the detention and interrogation of detainees . . .The Agency failed to issue in a timely manner comprehensive written guidelines for detention and interrogation activities. . . .Such written guidance as does exist . . . is inadequate.During the interrogation of two detainees, the waterboard was used in a manner inconsistent with the written DOJ legal opinion of 1 August 2002.Agency officers report that reliance on analytical assessments that were unsupported by credible intelligence may have resulted in the application of EITs without justification.The CIAs Inspector General makes it very clear that there was a failure by the CIA leaders, who include Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin, Counter Terrorism Center Chief Cofer Black, Counter Terrorism Center Chief Jose Rodriguez and the Director Directorate of Operations James L. Pavitt. Lack of proper guidance and oversight created fertile soil for subsequent abuses and these men were guilty of failing to properly do their jobs.We do not have to rely solely on the report of the CIAs Inspector General. In addition, the Report by the Senate Armed Services Committee on Detainee Treatment reached the same conclusions about the origins, evils, harm to U.S. policy and intelligence collection of enhanced interrogation, a euphemism for torture first used by Nazi Germany during World War II.Indeed, all independent analyses of the enhanced interrogation program have concluded it constituted torture, was ineffective, and contrary to all American laws, ideals, and intelligence practices. We also have the testimony and record of Ali Soufan, an Arabic-speaking FBI Agent, who was involved with several interrogations before torture was used and who achieved substantive results without violating international law.The sworn testimony of FBI Agent Ali Soufan, who is the only U.S. Government employee to testify under oath on these matters, completely contradicts the authors of Rebuttal:In the middle of my interrogation of the high-ranking terrorist Abu Zubaydah at a black-site prison 12 years ago, my intelligence work wasnt just cut short for so-called enhanced interrogation techniques to begin. After I left the black site, those who took over left, too  for 47 days. For personal time and to confer with headquarters.For nearly the entire summer of 2002, Abu Zubaydah was kept in isolation. That was valuable lost time, and that doesnt square with claims about the ticking bomb scenarios that were the basis for Americas enhanced interrogation program, or with the commitment to getting life-saving, actionable intelligence from valuable detainees. The techniques were justified by those who said Zubaydah stopped all cooperation around the time my fellow FBI agent and I left. If Zubaydah was in isolation the whole time, thats not really a surprise.One of the hardest things we struggled to make sense of, back then, was why U.S. officials were authorizing harsh techniques when our interrogations were working and their harsh techniques werent. The answer, as the long-awaited Senate Intelligence Committee Report now makes clear, is that the architects of the program were taking credit for our success, from the unmasking of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of 9/11 to the uncovering of the dirty bomber Jose Padilla. The claims made by government officials for years about the efficacy of enhanced interrogation, in secret memos and in public, are false. Enhanced interrogation doesnt work.The former CIA officers who have collaborated on this latest attempt to whitewash the historical record that they embraced and facilitated torture by Americans, are counting on the laziness of the press and the American public. As long as no one takes time to actually read the extensively footnoted and documented report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, then it is easy to buy into the fantasy that the CIA officers are simply victims of a political vendetta.These officers are also counting on a segment of the American people  repeatedly identified in polling results  that continues to believe torture works. Such people have no proof that it works (because there is none that it works consistently and effectively), they simply believe it instinctively or because of people such as this books authors arguments to that effect.That is why it is so important that the truth be told and this book and its arguments be debunked. Americans must learn the realities of torture  that it rarely if ever works, that it dehumanizes the torturer as well as the tortured, that it increases the numbers and hostility of our opponents while providing no benefit, and that it seriously diminishes Americas reputation in the world and thus its power.  Torture is wrong and the men who wrote this book are wrong.The book, Rebuttal, is a new incarnation of the lie extolling the efficacy of torture. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, a time of perceived crisis and palpable fear, the leaders of the CIA decided to ignore international and domestic law. They chose to discard the moral foundations of our Republic and, using the same justifications that authoritarian regimes have employed for attacking enemies, and embarked willingly on a course of action that embraced practices that in earlier times the United States had condemned and punished as a violation of U.S. laws and fundamental human rights.As former intelligence officers, we are compelled by conscience to denounce the actions and words of our former colleagues. In their minds they have found a way to rationalize and justify torture. We say there is no excuse; there is no justification. The heart of good intelligence work  whether collection or analysis  is based in the pursuit of truth, not the fabrication of a lie.It is to this end that we reiterate that no threat, no matter how grave, should serve to justify inhuman behavior and immoral conduct or torture conducted by Americans.For the Steering Group, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS)Fulton Armstrong, National Intelligence Officer for Latin America (ret.)William Binney, former Technical Director, World Geopolitical & Military Analysis, NSA; co-founder, SIGINT Automation Research Center (ret.)Tony Camerino, former Air Force and Air Force Reserves, a senior interrogator in Iraq and author of How to Break a Terrorist under pseudonym Matthew AlexanderGlenn L.

"This is a five-star academic work, a superb up-to-date compilation of what can be known legally and ethically about US military bases in all forms from the formal to the undeclared and covert, around the world. It's inclusion in the American Empire Project puts the author in the company of such great scholars and iconoclastic observers as Andrew Bacevich, Noam Chomsky, Robert Dreyfuss, Chalmers Johnson, and Howard Zinn.The author provides a compelling combination of history, anthropological-sociological narrative, and political-economic calculation as to the cost of what some estimate to be as many at 1,000 bases around the world.The references are a fine mix of books, articles, online sources, and as a good a range of Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congressional Research Service (CRS), and other limited edition publications including PhD theses.I find multiple bottom lines in this book that could but does not go far enough, but is certainly an excellent starting point for getting to a total true cost that I believe is at least five times the author's calculation of $170 billion a year and that is only in relation to total cost in dollars -- if the cost of environmental pollution, geoengineering, false flag terrorism, and everything else is added up, the overseas bases that enable our ""secret teams"" and our not so secret occupying forces are the base of a multi-trillion dollar criminal industry that leaves no country untouched.01 Drawing on RAND and former senior Department of Defense leaders, the author shows how any given base overseas costs at least twice what it would cost, per year, if it were located in the USA02 The effectiveness costs of destroying the military's ability to do its own logistics including combat and support engineering, in favor of private military corporations (PMC).03 The internal social costs of a constantly deployed military include truly horrific internal rapes -- not just men of women but men of men -- and an aggregation of pathologies that I find worthy of an immediate shut-down.04 The external social costs of this same deployed military are huge -- from entire cities devoted to prostitution around the largest of US base networks (Korea and Germany stand out) to criminal relationships carried over from one command to the next. External costs also include inflated land prices, distortions in local and national government spending (e.g. granting land and waivers to US forces in lieu of pursuing the public interest).05 The opportunity costs to American society of misdirected spending on the military are very well covered by the author, and merit careful study. These opportunity costs span both the alternatives in the way of poverty remediation, expenditures on domestic infrastructure, education, and family services, health care, are more; spending by troops and the military within the US domestic economy instead of foreign economies; and tax avoidance by the PMCs.06 The outright waste cost of a system that is out of control -- the military simply does not do cost-benefit analysis and -- my own comment here, has no strategy because it lacks intelligence with integrity.07 The total cost of Empire -- the vast costs, including the four trillion dollar war that destabilized Iraq and and began the unraveling of the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa. The author offers less in this area than I would have liked as context, but his focus is on bases and their direct costs.In addition to this book, below are five books the author has drawn on that I find noteworthy, followed by five books I consider helpful to understanding the criminally irresponsible overseas presence of the US military -- as I am publishing in CounterPunch today, our National Military Strategy is nothing more than dishonest platitudes -- we have a hollow military spread too thin, a military that cannot win wars. The time has come to close all of our overseas bases without exception, and to bring our forces home while we retrench, eradicating 30% of the budget known to be waste (which is actually 50%, but we start with 30%), while creating a 450 ship distributed Navy, an air-mobile Army, and a long-haul Air Force, all based firmly at home.Author ResourcesThe Bases of Empire: The Global Struggle against U.S. Military PostsAmerican Soldiers Overseas: The Global Military Presence (Perspectives on the Twentieth Century)The Sun Never Sets ...: Confronting the Network of Foreign U.S. Military BasesGreat Power Competition for Overseas Bases: The Geopolitics of Access DiplomacyAmerican Military Forces Abroad: Their Impact On The Western State SystemContextual RecommendationsKilling Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II - Updated EditionDevil's Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam (American Empire Project)The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated SoldierThe Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our WorldThe book has an index which will be a valuable aid to professionals.  It could be slightly improved in its next printing by adding a bibliography and an itemized listing of bases with their costs and numbers sorted by country, but there are a number of good offerings online, inclusive of color maps (for example, there are 44 US bases surrounding Iran), so perhaps this is not that great a lack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDSRM3LLAJOSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791698#wasThisHelpful","RDSRM3LLAJOSB","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book as a ""must read"" gift from a colleague finishing his doctorate with a focus on transformative leadership, and after reading it, I quite agree, to the point of rating this book at 6 stars (my top 10% across 2000 plus non-fiction books). In brief, this book is a massive detailed literature review that covers academic and practitioner definitions of leadership and finds them all wanting for the simple reason that they are mired in leadership as a supervisory hierarchical relationship in a reductionist system in which the followers are the means and the ends are defined by someone other than the followers.This book can be read deeply or quickly, as you might wish. Read deeply, it is a systematic dismantling -- even trashing -- of the entire leadership ""industry"" and all of the books, all of the courses, all of the ""best practices"" that in the aggregate have left us with a world dominated by the 1% and the 99% impoverished and abused. The ""leaders"" have, in brief, lacked both intelligence and integrity.I remember discussing this point with Harrison Owen, author of Wave Rider: Leadership for High Performance in a Self-Organizing World and having him tell me that after he articulated his original concept of ""open space"" as explained in his earlier work, Open Space Technology: A User's Guide, to a top manager for a major national leadership association, he was told something along these lines: ""You do realize that you have just destroyed the basis for a multi-billion dollar leadership training industry."" Precisely.There are several major aspects of this book and the approach to leadership that I want to highlight here with the observation that this book eliminates leaders and restores the Athenian concept of every citizen a leader, for the best of outcomes.01 The West and its industrial hierarchies and scientific reductionalism have perverted the meaning of ""ethics"" which has in the past been about seeking the best means and best ends for the greater good of the community -- ethics as happiness as found in the Constitution of the USA is about the greater good, not selfish joy.02 All organizations are political entities and communities, and in the ideal all should be democratic. Richard Wolf, author of Occupy the Economy: Challenging Capitalism (City Lights Open Media) speaks to this point on his own.03 Michaiavelli's better known ""The Prince"" is not, in the author's view, Machiavelli's best work.  He recommends instead -- and provides a detailed summary of -- Discourses.04 Leadership is a process by which communities, enabled but not directed, adapt and transform. Status quo organizations do not have leaders, they have managers and supervisors.05 Leadership is as important during the degenerative phases as in the constitution phrase. Leadership thus represents DEVIATION from CONVENTION.  QUOTE (104): A person who consistently hods an unconventional view may be considered a deviant right up until the time when that unconventional view is widely discovered by others as the way to go.""06 Education today sucks at creating informed educated citizens ready to be co-leaders in a constructive democracy that works toward ends good for all. The author spends several pages slamming education for not teaching critical thinking and comprehensive understanding (replacing these with empiricism and experimental lucifera); with abandoning true educational objectives for vocational training; and with being intellectually and morally lazy, fragmented by discipline and sub-discipline to the point of being an archipelago of babbling idiots.07 The author concludes by suggesting that just as we must see leadership and citizenship in a new way, so also must be take a new view of everything -- science, business, politics, life.The author singles out J.C. Rost and R.M. Pirsig as worthy of deeper study, one work for each is linked below:Leadership for the Twenty-First CenturyLila: An Inquiry Into MoralsI have a review list, ""Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Leadership for Epoch B"" that is easily found online, all leading back to their respective Amazon pages; with my remaining four links I will highlight four books most might not think of as essential to this topic and our shared future.Philosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated EditionThe Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World that Works for AllWhere Have All the Leaders Gone?The Leadership of Civilization Building: Administrative and civilization theory, Symbolic Dialogue, and Citizen Skills for the 21st CenturyBest wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R139SPGCLJ1G0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761824529#wasThisHelpful","R139SPGCLJ1G0N","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book stems from a conference and is a very nicely presented double-spaced precis of the world-class contributions from the conference.Highlights:HELEN CALDICOTT QUOTE (3): The Fukushima disaster is not over and will not end for many millenia. The radioactive fallout, which has covered vast swaths of Japan, will remain toxic for hundreds of thousands of years.""NAOTO KAN QUOTE (19): Considering the risk of losing half our land and evacuating half our population, my conclusion is that not having nuclear power plants is the safest energy policy.DAVID LOCHBAUM: Fukushima was result of multiple foreseen but dismissed hazards. The cost of the recommended safety measures would have been a tiny fraction of the final cost of the total disaster that will be adding costs for a century into the future.HISAKO SAKIYAMA: Virtually all hospitals included in today's nuclear reaction plans are themselves so close as to be rendered victims themselves in the event of any real nuclear disaster.STEVEN STARR: 13% of the Japanese mainland has been contaminated with cesium-137 while the Pacific Ocean and its seafood have been widely contaminated.AKIO MATSUMURA: Fukushima could explode again and double-down on threat to humanity. Meanwhile, US stands silent, Japanese government is covering everything up, and no reporters, scientists, or other governments are demanding any form of transparency.TIMOTHY MOUSSEAU: Roughly a third of wildlife disappears from radiated areas -- but the studies are not being done or if done not published because no government, no university, no foundtion, wants to pay for bad news.ALEXEY YABLOKOV: WHO, IAEA, ICRC have falsified just about everything about Fukushima specifically and nuclear risks generally.ARNOLD GUNDERSEN: Fukushima was made in USA, with GE knowingly repressing risk information, cutting corners, and failing to provide all of the safety features known to be needed (including provision for a 46 foot tsunami correctly forecast).ROBERT ALVAREZ: Because US has dithered on a ""permanent"" nuclear waste solution, the ""temporary"" pools are now holding five times their planned capacity. A standard US nuclear storage pool fire would be sixty times worse than Chernobyl.KEVIN CAMPS: CIA helped fund the post-war politicians in Japan, and part of CIA's mandate was to ensure they all bought into nuclear power.CINDY FOLKERS: US manipulating radiation standards in post-Fukishima era to allow twelve times more radiation poisoning of children than now allowed in Japan, and to explicitly cover-up the radiation in agricultural and seafood products that would otherwise sharply constrain those markets.DAVID FREEMAN: Risks aside, nuclear power is unaffordable.  QUOTE (217): Even with the latest improvements, the cost overrun is abvout one or two billion dollars."" Nuclear power is now an ""existential threat"" but the public is completely ignorant of the fact that they have 30 years of nuclear waste piled up in their backyard waiting to be set on fire.HELEN CALDICOTT: Absent public education, we appear bent on self-destruction.The book could have been improved with a bibliography and some visualization, but I certainly found it very informative and troubling. In combination, public ignorance, government and corporation corruption, and complacency among academics, media, and think tanks, have allowed the creation of an aging nuclear industry certain to explode in our face again.See also by Charles Perrow:Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk TechnologiesThe Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist DisastersBest wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZZSTUPDW560/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595589600#wasThisHelpful","R2CZZSTUPDW560","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Decline and Fall: The End of Empire and the Future of Democracy in 21st Century America, that was the serious book, and then this book and I have to say that the both go very well together.This book is the playbook for how a hollow US military over-reliant on satellites for location and communications, over-reliant on carriers that are too easily killed by supersonic wave-hopping missiles, over-reliant on a very mediocre US air force that cannot maintain air superiority or long air-based supply lines, is smashed by the Chinese when an amoral thoughtless US presidency goes one regime change oil field hijacking too far.I read a lot, almost exclusively in non-fiction (the other fiction book apart from this one that is memorable to me is TYRANNICIDE  The Story of the Second American Revolution, I strongly recommend it as a complement to this one). Everything I have read in the non-fiction arena supports the narrative that the author has woven here.In one place he has put the perfect storm:+ Chinese take out US satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) and communications.+ Carriers and other ships easily sunk by supersonic wave-hopping anti-ship missiles that exist today+ Air Force runs out of its shit F-22 and F-35 aircraft, meaning US not only loses air superiority, but it cannot supply far forward units in Africa by air+ US helicopters become toast in face of advanced anti-air missiles carried and aimed by one man+ Iran opens a second front against Saudi Arabia and Russia support China againsst the USA+ Diego Garcia falls to Chinese commandos preceded by cyber-attacks+ US degenerates domestically into riots, gas lines, and police brutality -- Feds try martial law and have it stuck up their ass -- Governors expel DHS and federal presence+ Article 5 Constitutional Convention calledThere are many non-fiction books that support the very plausible and well-presented scenarios the author has put together in a most elegant manner.  Here are just a few, I would refer readers to my 98 categories of reviews accessible via the Review page at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence BLog.Griftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American HistoryWages of RebellionThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II - Updated EditionA Power Governments Cannot SuppressThe Nine Nations of North AmericaAmerican Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North AmericaA Constitutional History of SecessionI assume Chinese leaders have read this book -- I supect American leaders have not...and therein lies the endgame.Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarify, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M479CDQ2T1C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782200355#wasThisHelpful","R2M479CDQ2T1C0","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I come at this book with something most readers do not have, over 2,000 non-fiction book reviews here at Amazon, and I mention it only because there are some negative reviews that I think are lacking in the larger context one gets from very broad reading.  From my perspective, this book is an extraordinary primer and the author is gifted -- truly gifted as a teacher and an explainer of complex ideas in simpler captivating terms.There are many other books that go into greater detail on specifics, and I will begin by listing just four of them:High Noon: 20 Global Problems, 20 Years To Solve ThemA More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and ChangeGriftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American HistoryStop, Thief!: The Commons, Enclosures, and Resistance (Spectre)There are hundreds more. For me this book's quality is to be found it its blend of narrative, explanation of complex ideas, and provocation for the reader on the subject of ""what is to be done."" In other words, if you do not have the time or money for buying and reading all those other books, this one book is as good a starting point as any I have found and I recommend it without reservation.Early on the author intrigues me with his discussion of how industrial wealth tends to concentrate while agricultural wealth is more easily maintained in distributed fashion -- his overview of competing models of political economy and how the victory of the North in the US Civil War was a victory for artificially high prices for industrial goods against imposed low prices for agricultural goods -- and how this began the destruction of the labor-consumer class in the middle -- is one I find useful.His overview of US imperialism and particularly the Spanish American War that we contrived in order to take half of Mexico and capture the Philippines and Cuba, is a fresh take on a topic that has been covered by many others.  Below are just three books I consider important in this domains.The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated SoldierI do not agree with those reviewers who are critical of his discussion of anaclyclosis and the cycle of democracy from monarch to junta to elite to crisis and collapse. I found it a very useful and well-presented overview of a complex subject -- my own essay on Democracy Lost -- and over 100 book reviews here at Amazon -- can be accessed at Tiny URL forward slash Steele-Reform. In that larger reading context I find the author utterly brilliant and most able to showcasing the essence of history and its relevance to our future.The second half of the book I find riveting. The authors discussion of the break-down of US democracy which used to be community and caucus based, with literate citizens actively engaged from the grassroots on up; his discussion of the power that states still have in the event of a federal collapse (including the power to mobilize a 100% militai and to call an Article V Constitutional Convention), and his analysis of how the US Government may be on the verge of collapse for a loss of legitimacy while the US economy is now hollow and on the verge of collapse as well, are all important to any citizen.His discussion of the US military -- which has occupied much of my life -- and the possibility that a major US military failure could trigger the implosion of the US Government and a public revolution to restore democracy -- is most worthwhile.  He ""gets"" the naked Emperor that is our US military, and I say this having just published in CounterPunch a scatching indictment, ""National Military Strategy - Dishonest Platitudes.""I agree with his conclusions -- that government is supposed to be the guarantor of the commons -- he makes positive reference to Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions) -- and that localization and decentralization -- to include the decentralization of education -- and the end of the welfare state (with local means-driven charities resurgent) are essential to our getting through the near future.He does not touch on secession or self-determination by the bio-region, but this is implicit in the book and my many reviews of books in this area may be of interest to readers, search for Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Self-Determination & Secession. I myself consider the departure of Hawaii and Vermont to be date certain, with Alaska, Texas, and the West Coast up in the air -- I agree with the author's view that the Southwest, the region we stole from Mexico, is now for all practical purposes a twilight zone subject to political and economic re-ordering in the future.The one area I do not completely understand centers on the author's view that in facing collapse, we may not be able to make the migration from fossil flues to renewables, and we may not be able to avoid a severe depression that puts many communities back into subsistence living in which people have to work very hard, all day every day, to achieve basic provisioning -- shelter, water, food. Certainly one reason I favor an Electoral Reform Act of 2015 and the election of an honest government in 2016 is because I see that we are in a period of transition -- the old paradigm is dead and the new paradigm is emergent, but we lack for political and economic and social leaders willing to articulate the urgency of investing in decrentralized free energy, water desalination, aquaponics, zero-energy shelter, and so on.I plan to read and review the author's own Twilight's Last Gleaming next, and I am very interested as well is his book The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival MatteredBest wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasTHE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trust","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28D55R8FW2BTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865717648#wasThisHelpful","R28D55R8FW2BTT","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author taught me most of what I retain in the way of political science fundamentals during our time together at Muhlenberg College, where he was former Chair of the Department of Political Science and an Associate Dean. We had not kept in touch since I left Muhlenberg in 1974, but in 2014 I reached out to him and bought this book immediately upon learning of its existence.Published in 2003 by the State University of New York Press, this book was evidently not marketed at all, and little noted. That is a sad commentary on our times, because I find that the author has distilled multiple literatures into one coherent presentation, augmented by an original model that tells a vital story beyond Ecological Economics into Ecological Political Economy (in essence, politics), into Ecological Ethics and Ecological Pedagogy, two topics rarely covered by others.My 2068 non-fiction reviews here at Amazon, all accessible across the 98 categories in which I read at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog (Reviews page), totally support the RADICAL conclusion of the author, to wit, that there are no changes we can make -- in relation to climate change, income equality, militarism, drugs, whatever -- that will make a difference if we allow the prevailing techno-industrial-financial paradigm to persist.We have a SYSTEMIC problem in which all of our institutions -- academic, civil society, commerce, government, law enforcement, media, military, non-government/non-profit -- ACCEPT the big lie of ""unlimited growth"" as the foundation for achieving universal prosperity, while IGNORING the reality that the externalization of true cost to the public and future generations is leading to the extinction of humanity and the desecration of the Earth.Before continuing my review I want to itemize ten of the many books the author draws on to emphasize the importance that this SYNTHESIS holds for the reader who does not have the time or money to do all the reading that the author or I have chosen to do. In the case of Herman Daly, long overdue for a Nobel, the author has read all of his book, as is the case also with Herbert Marcuse.For The Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable FutureAmerican Democracy in Peril: Eight Challenges to America's Future, 7th EditionEcological DemocracyRemaking Society: Pathways to a Green FutureDwellers in the Land: The Bioregional VisionA Sand County Almanac (Outdoor Essays & Reflections)One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society, 2nd EditionEthics for a Small Planet: New Horizons on Population, Consumption, and Ecology (S U N Y Series in Religious Studies) (Suny Series, Religious Studies)Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics (Studies in Moral, Political, and Legal Philosophy)Should Trees Have Standing?: Law, Morality, and the EnvironmentI am reminded of Will and Ariel Durant's conclusion in their capstone work, Lessons of History, to wit, morality is a priceless strategic asset. Long ago I concluded that ethics are how one passes on the lessons of history that favor community and sustainability, and more recently I have concluded that every government, without exception and including the Nordics (the best of the worst) lacks ethics. They fail to honor the tri-fecta of intelligent beings, holistic analytics, true cost economics, and open source everything engineering. Between financial and political corruption as documented by among others Matt Taibbi in Griftopia, intellectual dishonesty as characteristic of the academy, the media, and the think tanks (whorehouses, every one of them), and a citizenry all too willing to be eat poison, drink poison, and having their ability to think displaced by moronic entertainment suitable only as a backdrop to drinking one self into a stupor, Western society has become reductionist garbage.At root this book is about the reality that that there is no substitute for natural capital -- a concept covered by a number of other books including those by Paul Hawken, Dieter Helm, Peter Kareiva, and Dorothy Maxwell and of course of my favorites, STOP THIEF! by Peter Linebaugh -- combined with the finding that education and ethics are the only means by which to reverse centuries of stellar accomplishments on the edges that have hollowed out the center.There are extraordinary insights throughout the book, I will mention just a few:01 It is insane to separate the teaching of politics and economics. Political economy is ""root"" for any society. To allow political science to be taught without recourse to holistic analytics and true cost economics is irresponsible; to allow economcis to be taught without recourse to holistic analytics and true cost economics is criminal.02 Social capital is an integral part of natural capital -- here I am adding my own interpretative comments, to wit, human intelligence and human innovation and human energy are the one unlimited resource we have, and we have buried that resource under a flawed assumption that technology (which comes with huge costs we do not factor in) is a substitute for human enterprise.03 Globalization undermines the local identity and decision-making in closeness to nature, the bio-regional intelligence with integrity that is essential to making the most of our limited natural resources. Elinor Ostrom received a Nobel prize for making this point in Governing the Commons. The best governance is self-governance at the local level, in touch with the facts on the ground and able to enforce, day to day, with persistent eyes on.04 Transformation will occur on our present course (even with lip service from the Pope, the UN, and G-7) -- we have to literally shut down the techno-industrial-financial paradigm that governs every aspect of our lives -- our policies, products, services, and behaviors -- and substitute a new ecologism paradigm that demands an educated ethical public -- this requires in turn moral awakening, a political revolution, and constant citizen engagement far beyond mere voting.The most original portion of the book is the latter half, and particularly the discussion of what needs to change in education and in ethics. This book is easily qualified to be a primer for freshmen entering a liberal arts program that still has integrity (too few of these now that ""life experience"" is code for take the money and screw  the student).QUOTE (129): The problem of education, from an ecologistic perspective, is that it continues to reproduce, explicitly or implicitly, the taken-for-granted assumptions of the dominant techno-industrial paradigm.Quite right. The fact that in the USA today we have between 23% and 40% unemployment (the first from ShadowStats, the second from a Congressional Research Service report, ""An Overview of the Employment-Population Ratio"") and between 20 million and 30 million recent college graduates living at home again, unable to find work, is an indictment of our present corrupt government and a confirmation of the common sense of this excellent work.The chapter on Ecological Ethics and the Conclusion focus deeply on moral agency, holistic judgment, and the breakdown of the connections between citizens, nature, and the institutions that humanity has allowed to take on a life of their own, corrupt to the bone and controlled by the 1% instead of the 99%.The chapter on Ecological Pedagogy synthesizes among many other contributions those of David Orr on six principles, and outlines so many good ideas on restoring the relevance of education to sustainable society that one could surmise that any college or university president who fails to read this book is derelict in their duty -- separately I have reviewed numerous books from Derek Bok and others on the commercialization (prostitution) of higher education, this is the one book to read if you are an educational leader with intentions toward doing good.As with all my six-star recommendations (ten percent of my reading), I find the Notes and the Index and the Bibliography essential elements worthy of study in detail. This is a master work by one of the few people I have ever met who is able to integrate -- and communicate --  the Holy Trinity of group politics, true cost economics, and citizen ethics & education.Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34LM53JI1MM6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=079145715X#wasThisHelpful","R34LM53JI1MM6D","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a brilliant piece of work, and extremely relevant today. Had America had an Operational Intelligence (OpIntel) Plot (24/7 operationally-oriented put it all together all the time watch center), I daresay the terrorist attacks on America would have been prevented in good time.I started reading this book the week prior to the attacks, having bought it off the shelves of the Army War College bookstore, whose judgment I have always respected, and I have been absolutely absorbed--thrilled--with the deep insights that this work provides on how best to manage an operationally-oriented watch center that does ""all-source fusion"" against a constantly changing real-time real-world threat.It became clear to me as I worked through every word of this superior work that modern intelligence has become too bureaucratic and that all-source analysis has become too distant from both the sources and the consumers. The Operational Intelligence Center (OIC) whose story is told here worked with no fewer than seventeen distinct sources streams, each with its own idiosyncrasies, its own fits and starts--and it worked directly with its operational clients, fully appraised of friendly plans and intentions and able to provide workmanlike inputs at every turn. We need to get back to this approach!There are a number of vital lessons to be learned from this book, which I recommend in the strongest terms as one of my ""top ten"" relevant *today*. Among them:Sharing Secrets Matters. It was the Russians who helped the British get started in 1914 with a gift of a German Naval Signal book, and it was the Poles who saved the day early on in World War II with a gift of two working Enigma machines.Ops Must Sleep With Intel. Too many times I have seen operators ignore intelligence because they do not understand it-there are too many breakdowns in communication along the way, and if the operators have not trained with, lived with, slept with, caroused with, their intelligence counterparts, the two cultures do not come together effectively in times of crisis.Ops Cannot Do Raw Sources. The corollary of the above is that Ops simply cannot keep up with the nuances of sources and is not able to evaluate sources in context to good effect.Intel Must Sleep With Ops. The intelligence propensity to compartment everything to the point of meaningless, and the ""green door"" mentality that is especially characteristic of the crypto-analysis community, amounts to a death wish. Some secret sources must be ""ultra"" secret, but some form of bridge is needed-the OpIntel Center (which the U.S. Navy, alone within today's US secret bureaucratic archipelago, does well) appears to be a vital and relevant solution.Plots Must Be Co-Located and Ideally Integrated. Early separation and distance between the intelligence plot, the commercial shipping plot and the operational plot leads to waste and death. Ultimately an integrated plot, or at least a blue-green plot next door to the red plot, is absolutely vital to effective prosecution of real-time war.Lose the Old Guys. The first thing that needs doing when preparing for a long war is to lose the old guys. No disrespect intended, but as has been documented time and again, those that get promoted in peacetime bureaucracies tend to be too conformist and too subservient to peacetime protocols to adapt well to unconventional and very fast-moving wartime conditions. [Present company always excepted!.]Hire the Retired. This is not a contradiction. Old guys with big egos and high ranks have to go-but bringing in the best of the retired, generally at the field grade level, can have an extraordinary positive impact in the rapid maturation and stabilization of the full-speed-ahead wartime watch.Doctrinal Disputes Kill. Unless there is a homeland defense doctrine that fully integrates and exercises the capabilities and internal cultures of the Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and civilian agencies (and civilian agencies!) there will be a year or two of major and almost catastrophic losses until it gets sorted out the hard way.Home Arrogance Kills (UK Version). The persistent unwillingness of home side personnel to admit that their own security measures can be broken by clever enemies, and the general sloppiness of all hands with respect to Operations Security (OPSEC) will take a heavy toll.Home Arrogance Kills (US Version). There is a theme with regard to the Americans. While their money and their manpower are gratefully accepted, their arrogance knows no bounds. They entered the war believing that there was nothing the British could teach them-further on into the war, the Americans risked Ultra by acting too aggressively on its information.Red Cell Oversight Needed. One thing that jumped out at me from this book was the urgent need for having a very senior person-a retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, managing a Red Cell to provide oversight over operational decisions to exploit the most sensitive sources. [By this I mean, a senior authority who can overrule and forbid operations whose success might endanger the special source.]Negative Reports Matter. I was really struck by the circumstances surrounding a German break-out up the Channel, in which a number of normally reliable and overlapping intelligence collection endeavors all were forced back by weather, broken down or what-not. From this I took the lesson that negative reports matter. By failing to report to the OIC on their non-status, they failed to focus the OIC on all the possibilities. Thinking the flank covered, the OIC left the flank open.Tommy Brown Matters. The book ends on a marvelous note, pointing out that without the heroism of Tommy Brown, a 16 year old cabin boy and youngest recipient of the George Medal as well as two other adults who died in the process of grabbing vital enemy signals materials off a sinking vessel, the allies would have been deaf for much of 1943. At the end of the day the best technical intelligence comes down to a brave human who risks all to make it possible.Most of my other reviews of intelligence non-fiction can be found by seeking out onlineWorth a Look: Book Reviews on Intelligence (Most)All reviews lead back to their Amazon page, and are sorted by category (e.g. all on CIA, on NSA, etcetera).Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasTHE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trust","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNJH6WQ28TSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345297989#wasThisHelpful","R2VNJH6WQ28TSL","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid piece of work that might normally have been a 4 but it surprised me just enough to warrant taking it to a 5. I love unconventional wisdom and seeing solid proof that conventional wisdom -- in this case, ""The Internet changes everything for the better"" questioned.I read this book on the same flight as I read Richard Wolff's Occupy the Economy: Challenging Capitalism (City Lights Open Media) and this is the second reason I will place the book at five: while the Internet does NOT change everything for the better, especially in the case of women and youth in Kuwait, it IS ""occupied,"" is does blur the line between the user and the producer, and it does offer a model for new forms of social and economic organization. In a strange way I could not have anticipated, these two books complement each other.The bottom line in this excellent book is that the Internet ALONE is NOT transformative, and that ideo-cultural and socio-economic contexts can severely inhibit its impact and misdirect its utilization. Kuwait, a form of monarchic socialism in which there are both a lack of trust (great fear of speaking honestly in true name in any forum online or offline) and a government ability to censor, surveil, and punish, is a textbook case in Internet emergence under severe handicap.I have to remind myself that this book was written before the Arab Spring and before twitter, facebook, and Internet access and anonymnity break-throught were elevated by Egyptian activists to a new level of art. For those interested in the Middle East in particulate, as well as the intersection between social consciousness and the Internet in the face of repressive regimes, I recommend a spectacular recent book by Elza Malouf, Emerge!: The Rise of Functional Democracy and the Future of the Middle East.The book is an ethnographic study, which is to say, based on interviews with real people in real placed, not to be confused with the quantitative data junk that characterizes most of US political ""science."" While the number of cited intereviews are limited, I am more than satisfied by the professionalism of the endeavor and the insights presented by the author.Among the most valuable elements of the book for me was the author's observation, in passing but ably documented, that as of 2006 there was a clear perception among Arabs that the US was creating a new Cold War mentality with Islam as  the enemy. The balance of the book is a superb study of the conflict between liberal (I would have said secularly-oriented) Muslims and ""Islamists"" seeking to impose Shariah (fundamentalist) blinders on everything.I have a note to myself that there are TWO major battles raging in the world today, one between the working poor (100 million in the USA, one third of the total population) and the 1% in charge of predatory capitalism; and that between and among the Muslims -- the author does not focus on the Sunni - Shia split, on funding of ISIS or Al Qaeda by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, or on the radical differences among Malaysia and Indonesia and Brunei (sane and sensible), Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (fixing to implode), and Turkey (conflicted and losing its secular foundation) but I would give this book high marks for offering multiple useful snap-shots against that larger canvas.Not addressed in this book, but hanging heavily above it as a storm cloud, is the utter idiocy and abdication of the US as a force for peace and enlightenment. The author observes that only 1 in 4 youth go to prayers in Kuwait, while at the same time five times more women are veiled than in the 1960's. The USA has been -- there is only one word for it -- STUPID about where to put its emphasis since WWII -- in my view we lost our minds after WWII and went on an American exceptionalism rampage that made us the poster child for unilateral militarism, predatory capitalism, and virtual colonialism, spending trillions on overseas based and elective wars and regime change, when a fraction of that money could have furthered the secularization of Islamic governments, provided exit strategies for the despots of Arabia (most our official best pals subsidized at US taxpayer expense) and armed the public with the power that knowledge -- and an unencumbered Internet -- gives.On this latter point, see among many other books:Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II--Updated Through 2003Griftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American HistoryConfessions of an Economic Hit ManIt angers me, thinking about the cost to the US taxpayer of liberating Kuwait from Iraq, to also contemplate how inept and corrupt our government is when it comes to actually spending and planning for public empowerment and democracy -- it does not. We have a hypocritical government that supports dictators, not an intelligent ethical government that strives to do well by the larger public.The bottom line, a quote from page 60: ""...Internet use in Kuwait does not necessarily conform to expectations for automatically enhanced democratization, privatization, and individual empowerment.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IOBPSQ49TOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0791465861#wasThisHelpful","R37IOBPSQ49TOA","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume complements - with some overlap but certainly worth reading on its own merits - the US Naval Offshore Sail Training Squadron Experiential Leadership Guide, which sites this books as  recommended additional reading.Worthy of immediate and continuous note is the opening emphasis on the legal responsibility of a sailing instructor - a duty of care with attendant legal obligations and a vulnerability to being sued if all four of the following can be proven:1. The instructor had a legal duty to the injured party2. The instructor failed to fulfill their duty3. The injury occurred to the party to whom the instructor had a legal duty4. The failure of the instructor to fulfill their duty was the cause of the injuryThe three common defenses for negligence available to an instructor are:1. Show all of the elements of negligence were not present2. Show the direct causes of the injury were an act of God (forces of nature)3. Show the injured party is guilty of contributory negligence (he or she caused the injury) with comparative negligence (apportioned fault) being an alternative to instructor absolutionI learn that US Sailing members who are certified instructors are covered by a US Sailing $10 million liability policy in addition to that offered by their sailing school employers.The legal liability is a helpful means of emphasizing the total nature of a sailing instructor's responsibility, and also helpful in showing how the balance of this book is an instructor's best defense: attention to detail, checklists, prior preparation, record keeping, and reflection including notes after each lesson are how an instructor demonstrates due diligence apart from the student's as witnesses to successful attentive respectful instruction.The other eye opener for me is the early emphasis on how important it is for the instructor to both avoid any possible perception of sexual harassment, intimacy (including the application of sun screen), or abuse in dealing with young people - to include never being alone with one of them (I am also a Boy Scout volunteer, this is the core mandate in their Youth Protection policy). I also learn that the instructor has a legal obligation to bring to the attention of the authorities any concerns about abuse that might surface to the instructor.With as the cautionary introduction, I move on to the substance which is as fine as I have ever encountered - this is world-class material with no fluff.CORE: safety is your duty, fun is your delivery, and learning is your outcome. If the student does not have fun they might not stick with sailing. If the student does not learn it is your failing as an instructor.A major shared view between this book and the US Naval Academy focus on leadership training and particularly experiential leadership through small unit offshore sailing where actions have life-affirming consequences is on the importance of understanding the everyone learns differently - most learn visually, some learn through hearing and some learn through doing. The ideal instruction combines all three, detects and respects differences in learning styles, and strives to inspire the student to be a partner in learning.I learn that the largest difference between self-learning through online courses and printed material, and taught instruction, is FEEDBACK. The book overall is extremely well developed as a guide to instructors in how to be most effective at offering feedback, including the feedback ""sandwich"" that integrates positive observations with even-handed SPECIFICS on what needs work.The recommended instructor style is that of cooperative or collaborative learning, in which students are fully engaged. The bracketing styles, not recommended, are the autocratic or dictatorial style (in academia this is called didactic - ""I talk you listen"") and the equally harmful wimp style (their word), unsure and lacking in any semblance of leadership. BALANCE is the word that comes to my mind.There is an enormous amount of value in this book for anyone of any age (I am 63) who wishes to reflect on their leadership and teaching/coaching style. I am impressed by the manner in which the book discusses every possible aspect of how an instructor comes across from use of words, timing, eye contact, posture, and so on.The book includes a section on creating and following and improving lessons plans; ten steps of risk management (alone worth the price of the book); a number of sample forms including emergency management forms; and a list of 23 record-keeping areas. That last is more important than I realized before reading this book - record-keeping is part of due diligence, part of being a good instructor, and a foundation for doing well, safely, while meeting our legal ""duty of care"" obligations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMWTATY38CDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938915003#wasThisHelpful","R1RMWTATY38CDP","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a hugely important work, one that responds to the critical needs outlined by Micah Sifry in The Big Disconnect: Why The Internet Hasn't Transformed Politics (Yet) and others such as myself writing these past 25 years on the need to reform the pathologically dysfunctional US secret intelligence community that is in constant betrayal of the public trust.Digital Humanitarians are BURYING the secret world. For all the bru-ha-ha over NSA's mass surveillance and the $100 billion a year we spend doing largely technical spying (yet only processing 1% of what we waste money on in collection), there are two huge facts that this book, FOR THE FIRST TIME, documents:01 The emphasis here is on HUMANS -- technology has been harnessed in the public interest but it is the HUMANS -- digital savants and volunteers, open source coders, and the human objects of concern (the victims in any given disaster, armed with their brains, eyes, ears, and cell phones) and their human relatives (the diaspora) that produce results. The author repeats -- a necessary repetition -- throughout the book this critical points: ""It's the humans, the digital samaritans, that made this possible."" He observes that the media -- to which I would add most governments and the UN -- completely missed the point: this is a human harmonization success story, NOT a technology ubber alles story.02 The output here is  DECISION-SUPPORT -- actionable usable information that saves lives and reduces costs. This is the acme of skill for any professional intelligence officer, but most are trapped in a system where the emphasis is on spending money wantonly on technology without being held accountable for results. Put bluntly, Digital Humanitarians are calling out the naked Emperor called secret intelligence. This is the lifeboat, this is Plan B, this is public intelligence in the public interest, and I am moved to tears by how much all this means for our future.The story the author tells is a compelling one that will stand in history as a break-out moment in the uplisting of humanity. I note with interest that while the author was trained at Harvard,  the break-out occurred when he was at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and that it was the Fletcher students and professors that rallied to nurture this seed crystal, not Harvard, which was slow to respond when invited to do so.The author and his cohorts pulled together, for the first time in history, a wide range of until then isolated pieces -- one third open source technology including Ushahidi and OpenStreetMaps, one third humans, and one third responsive bureaucracies including national imagery agencies providing imagery for volunteers to convert into open accurate maps that still do not exist for most place from the National Geospatial Agency (which is also incapable of doing what these people did, create new maps in 48 hours on the basis of high-resolution imagery using thousands of distributed human volunteers none of them having a security clearance).QUOTE: ""an overflow of information can be as paralyzing as the absence of it.""Where the book starts to have a powerful message for the next generation is when the author recognizes -- as Micah Sifry and I and others have recognized -- that the tools do not exist to make sense of massive amounts of near-real-time data. This is a problem many of us confronted in 1986-1993 but the US Government (OMB, DoD, and the CIA in particular) refused to be serious about analytic tools. Although there were a couple of success stories -- DARPA STRONG ANGEL and its TOOZL flash drive come to mind, and CIA OSWR's brilliant definition of the 18 functionalities we need (CATALYST: Computer Aided Tools for the Analysis of Science & Technology), the corruption of the military-intelligence-industrial complex is such that the big money is spent on technical collection that is not processed, NOT on human or open source intelligence or analytic tool-kits. That corruption is still with us today, and nothing being overseen by the DNI, USDI, or D/CIA is relevant to our future success in this area.Reflecting on the book as I finish it, I see an extraordinary ""convergence without boundaries"" that has been effected by CrisisMappers and the ecology of human good will, open source technology, and open-minded policy makers (both government and non-government).  Key ingredients include:PEOPLE (validated people -  they are who they say they are -- trained and tasked responsibly)Online training ready to go for new volunteersOpen source software and hardware and databases and so onMicro-tasking as a concept (complex back office makes simpler front end micro possible)High resolution imagery, increasingly from on site UAVs but also from government donorsPolicy-ethics renaissanceArtificial intelligence in context -- AI in support, not ruling, AI doing tasks, not deciding)The persistent challenge is Big (False) Data. That aspect of this book is alone priceless. The author points out that it is not just lies in social media and Short Message Service (SMS) that kill, but media lies and mistakes, government lies and mistakes, ""humanitarian"" agencies lies and mistakes. As one who has said for decades that ""the truth at any cost lowers all other costs,"" I regard this book as the first bullet fired in the first modern skirmish between industrial era hierarchies willing to ""pay any price"" legalized crime (see Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the  Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies and Griftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American History and an emerging hybrid governance public sector that is combining citizen integrity and intelligence with open source tools and a transparent approach to data, which in the aggregate are revolutionary.There are a few specific companies and individuals who are highlighted in this book, I urge the purchase of the book if those specifics are of interest.Three take-aways as I put the book down:A Critical thinking is a vital part of all this, sits on top of training, tools, and task managementB Turn on your location!  Only 3% of tweets are usable in geospatial terms because most have this feature turned offC #NOSHARE is a hash-tag intended to shut out the machines, ""for human reading only."" It won't work, but it's a thought to holdAs impressed as I am by all that Patrick Meier, his co-founder Jen Ziemke and others behind the scenes (such as Eric Rasmussen, one of two principals in STRONG ANGEL, the thinks he can remain anonymous) have accomplished, I am not completely satisfied that they have prepared for the next phrase. There are some compelling stories in this book about digital data wonks supporting digital activism, but there is a great deal missing because of the deliberate schism imposed by governments that ""shut out"" their citizens and make decisions on the basis on religious, financial, and ideological pressures instead of ethical evidence-based decision-support, and this emergent ""Puerto Allegre on Steroids"" convergence without boundaries.  Below I offer some additional books that complement this one. There are two tinyurls I would offer those who wish to think about what is NOT in this book  that needed to be in the next edition: /EIN-UN-SDG and /Steele-Reform.It will be a while before a Nobel Prize is awarded for information initiatives (I made this point in Sweden in December 2004), but if and when that day comes, the totality of what Patrick Meier addresses in this book, and its future potential as a foundation for creating a prosperous world at peace in which holistic analytics, true costs economics, and open source everything engineering are firmly grounded in CrisisMappers, Ushahidi and more, I for one will be applauding on that day.See Also:Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)By Clay Shirky: Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected AgeDemocracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against ImperialismHolistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics, and the Bioeconomics of EvolutionNonzero: The Logic of Human DestinyMomentum: Igniting Social Change in the Connected Age (Hardback) - Common","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHUCV6SOO5XO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482248395#wasThisHelpful","RHUCV6SOO5XO2","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel so strongly about the misdirection of this book, its eminent author not-withstanding, that I actually did a press release responding to the early publicity. I hope you find it interesting, because we will lose many more lives and pay much migher costs in damages if we fail to reform national, military, and law enforcement intelligence at the strategic, operational, tactical, and technical levels.FORMER SPY AND NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT RESPONDS TO SIR JOHN KEEGAN'S NEW BOOK TO THE EFFECT THAT INTELLIGENCE DOES NOT WIN WARSWashington, D.C., October 23/PRNEWSWIRE/ -- Robert David Steele, a former spy and founder of the Marine Corps Intelligence Command, applauds Sir John Keegan's commentary ""Forget about James Bond -intelligence never wins wars"" as filed on 22/10/2003. However, Steele says, ""As a long-time admirer of Sir John's prowess in understanding warfare, I must respectfully say that in this instance, he stands with the American Colonel who plaintively observed to the North Vietnamese Colonel that America won all the battles in Viet-Nam-to which the man replied, as recounted by Harry Summers, with (and I paraphrase), `So what? That is irrelevant to the outcome.'""Steele goes on, ""Where Sir John misses the point is with respect to the distinct role of intelligence at the strategic level. As Sun Tsu (and perhaps even Colin Gray) would no doubt observe to Sir John, `If you've gotten yourself into a war at all, then you have failed to win by other means, and it is this that is the larger intelligence failure.'""Steele concludes, ""It is my own experience that 80% of the American national security budget is wastefully expended on a heavy metal military that is useless 90% of the time. Indeed, of the $500 billion a year we spend today, we should reduce the amount spent on conventional and nuclear forces by half, while re-directing the savings toward special operations, gendarme, peace, and homeland security intelligence and counterintelligence. America has begun a hundred-year war on six different fronts precisely because the President lacked intelligence in every sense of the word, and because he and his ideologically-motivated handlers also lacked the kind of long-term diverse strategy for securing a sustainable long-term peace that can only come from a full understanding of diverse threats and circumstances. Yes, soldiers win wars. Intelligence professionals prevent wars by being prescient, clever, and covertly effective.""Mr. Steele is the author of On Intelligence: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World (2001); The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political-Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption (2002); Information Operations: All Information, All Languages, All the Time; and THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest; and a contributing editor of Peacekeeping Intelligence: Emerging Concepts for the Future (2003).

"This is a hugely disappointing book. It reads like a graduate thesis badly overseen (with zero in the way of serious literature search). While the author has some experience in the foreign service (perhaps in the clandestine service) and as an action officer and minor manager in the Pentagon bureaucracy responsible for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, he knows little about intelligence in all its complexity, less about the information revolution, and nothing at all across 80% of the relevant literatures he fails to discover or cite.The laudatory remarks by academics are part of the self-licking academic ice cream cone -- take them with a liberal dose of salt. The author, lacking broad or deep experience in the craft of intelligence, is too quick to buy into the facile pronouncements of others, and renders potifical inanities such as ""intelligence or information, no matter where or when garnered, is not decisive in war."" It reminds me of my review of a book the author clearly loves and cite, by John Keegan, Intelligence in War: The value--and limitations--of what the military can learn about the enemy -- better scholarship there, but as with this author, missed the point completely.The reader desiring to study the craft of intelligence will learn vastly more from others -- see my summary reviews of over 300 proper books (all linked to their Amazon page) on secret intelligence at the easily found list, Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Government Secret Intelligence [never mind my own books, articles, and briefings easily found at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog], or the pioneering work of 800 international practitioners, the best of the best being itemized and their work linked at OSINT Literature Review, Name Association, Lessons Learned, also easily found free online.I went through this book twice to ensure I was not being to harsh -- the title and sub-title offered so much promise. The author is over-reliant on Sherman Kent's Strategic Intelligence for American National Security and a handful of books by a mix of sychophants (the academics) and practitoners (generally the ones that failed). The index, while mediocre, confirms that this is not a study that should be used in any classroom, and certainly nowhere near the towering work Intelligence Power in Peace and War by Herman, Michael published by Cambridge University Press.When discussing secrecy, the author fails to mention Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan or any of the other authors of important books on secrecy, two examples below:Secrecy: The American ExperienceNation of Secrets: The Threat to Democracy and the American Way of Life When discussing open sources, the author has no clue. At a minimum he should at least have cited these two works:No More Secrets: Open Source Information and the Reshaping of U.S. Intelligence (Praeger Security International)Open Source Intelligence in a Networked World (Continuum Intelligence Studies)This book has its little gems -- perhaps twenty paragraphs in all -- but it is not a book that needs to be read by anyone actually interested in a topic I addressed, with a foreword from Senator David Boren (D-OK), in 2000, Spies and Secrecy in an Open World. It is a book that tries very hard -- with limited success -- to justify what we do and pretend that what we do in the way of secret intelligence of, by, and for the government and its financial masters is useful. It is not. It is nothing more than a pork pie, as William Binney has said, that keeps the problems alive and the money moving. It provides, as General Tony Zinni has said, ""at best"" 4% of what a serious commander needs.The author -- and those who praise this work -- are not to be trusted. These people are completely out of touch with the reality of -- to take just one example -- CrisisMappers, and they have absolutely no idea what it means to integrate holistic analytics, true cost economics, and open source everything engineering. They are failures in serving the public interest precisely because no one has ever held them accountable for getting a grip on the truth.Annoying.  I am sending the book to Retired Reader for a second opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5QG4NHXP7NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804792658#wasThisHelpful","R1M5QG4NHXP7NM","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Way beyond my expectations, this book is a six-star instant classic that is not only essential for anyone that wants to be thoughtful about being prepared and investing a penny now to save thousands later, but it is a great gift item as well.  I am rating this a 6 star book, in my top ten percent across the 2000+ plus non-fiction books I have reviewed here at Amazon.On my first reading, three aspects of this book jumped out at me: common sense, magnificent graphics and illustrations, and lots of stuff I did not know -- fireplace ashes still releasing carbon monoxide, real risk of a mobile home or eighteen-wheeler being dropped on your home in a tornado, importance of having an inside hose outlet (as easy as a threaded insert to your kitchen sink), utility of a smoke detector in the attic and a carbon dioxide alarm in the garage (we have neither).  Bottom line is that I am blown away.This may be the most practical useful book I now own or have ever owned, as tempted as I might be to recall the Boy Scout Handbook and my offshore sailing first-aid book, Advanced First Aid Afloat.  It is spectacularly well-organized into Well Before, Days Before, Just Before, Suddenly, During, Just After, and Well After.The serious reader will need to schedule time to actually ""do"" what this book calls for, in three steps:01 Collect information -- emergency contacts, relevant locations, etcetera.02 Buy and store long-term supplies and equipment and for specific looming emergencies, short-term supplies.03 Instal specific recommended items (alarms, internal hose, etc.) and build the strong room.It certainly merits comment that the author is an architect with engineering and environmental experience; he has written a number of other books useful to professionals, and the book has won numerous literary awards.On my second pass I learned still more, and will note that the author also covers preparedness and response for biological, chemical, and nuclear accidents. I would stress, as Charles Perrow does so well in The Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist Disasters and his earlier book, Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies, we are our own worst enemies. There is a massive chlorine tank about the New Jersey turnpike, if it ever catches fire, hundreds of thousands will be grieviously affected.This is a hugely impressive book, very ably put together, readable, illustrated, everything you need to double or triple your preparedness and your ability to protect and comfort your loved ones from your present state of preparedness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192EAYH3DXPYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497528186#wasThisHelpful","R192EAYH3DXPYP","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a hugely important book that should be in any personal or organizational (e.g. sail training program) library.  It is organized into the following parts:  weather (and waves), faulty navigation (poor  thinking), failure of gear or rigging, failure of ground tackle or mooring lines, collision (think submerged free floating shipping container), fire or explosion, and towing mishaps.While some of the short stories go back to years before modern electronics, the fact is that modern electronics can fail (and be wrong or not updated even when working). Each vignette ends with a lessons learned summary.Here is what I pulled from the book:Bad -- really bad -- stuff happens even when you have done everything right. Plan for and practice for the worst case. When its catastrophic and not your fault, get over the guilt and move on.- Weather. Freak weather and freak waves happen. Assume dismasting. Assume loss of steering. Assume capsizing and need to cut access hatch. Assume loss of antennas and installed electronics. Assume broken bilge pumps clogged by tin can labels and such.  Now what?  Have answers.- Navigation. When in doubt stand off. Do the azimuths and the chart work. Do not approach at night where there is any doubt.  Have someone up the mast (or a webcam?) in hazardous reef areas.- Rigging/Gear Safety. Stays will snap, double stays are nice, know what's beneath the surface (""10mm"" mounts could be on top of 6mm threads). Have the lifeboard accessible and where it won't be holed by pieces of mast flailing about. Think about batteries and bilge pumps and portable options. New batteries for all hand-held emergency beacons and radios. Flourescent strom sails. Consider a flourescent deck or at least foredeck.- Mooring/Ground Tackle. Corral reefs can cut through steel chains. This I did not know. The right amount of weather stress can snap chains and rip cable mounts off the boat.Surface Radar/Alarm. They are expensive, but there is so much hazardous debris out there (and pirates when anchored) it might be worth thinking about sonar and surface radar, and if in a fleet, at least one boat so equipped.  The whales I could understand -- free-floating mostly submerged containers now scare me.Fire Avoidance. Will your fire extinguishers actually work in gale conditions? May be a bridge too far but a useful standard by which to test and buy.Towing.  This is hazardous.  I had no idea.  Some very useful lessons learned, it is a class by itself, including techniques for using deployed anchor as base for your end of the tow line, trailing a drogue to avoid over-running the tow line, weighting the middle of the tow line, having the two line be long enough for multiple waves.  Stuff I never learned.Damage Control Mind-Set.  What will it take? Where are the tools? What is the sequence of events? Was the sailing plan filed on both end? Did you do a PAN PAN when you could?Grag Bags. Passport, credit cards, car keys, knife, light, personal EPIRB properly registeredShort Trips. No difference -- be as ready as if you were crossing the Atlantic.This is a precious book, most useful, a fine substitute for learning the hard way through mishap and having to abandon ship.

"The authors, being from New York, know what the NYT and Mother Jones both missed in their stories on Governor Cuomo banning fracking in New York: that it was a legal couple Helen and David Slottje that went village by village educating townships that then passed anti-fracking ordnances. Search for this headline to get to the photo essay: Dryden: The Town That Changed The Fracking Game. To everyone's delight, the Appeals Court upheld those local decisions instead of doing what they usually do, yield to federal and corporate corruption. Today fracking has been banned in Quebec, many US states at various levels of governance, and world-wide (search for List of Franking Bans Worldwide)for the simple reason that it uses clean water we cannot spare, contaminates what is left of the clean water in rapidly falling aquifers, and creates earthquakes -- a new CRS Report is just out, free, Human-Induced Earthquakes from Deep-Well Injection: A Brief Overview, easily found online.This book desperately needs Look Inside the Book to show the contents, and its price needs to come down to under $40 before it will be reasonably available to the folks that should be reading it. It is however cheaper at Amazon than at the publisher's site!I am helping Virginians fight three pipelines for fracking from West Virginia, it is tough going because the two-party tyranny has been bought and paid for by Dominion and the other two pipeline sponsors -- even Tom Steyer's money could not keep Virginia's current Governor informed on this specific issue. However, to end on a positive note, I believe that Dominion will eventually see that renewables -- where it has started to invest -- are the sustainable win-win (as should the other two sponsors but we are focusing on Dominion first); that public education is going to illuminate all the lies about projected economic benefits along with the truth about ""true cost economics"" and the real burden that will be imposed by their land grabs, and that there are enough angry wealthy people -- and endangered species -- to turn all three of the pipelines into legal and publicity and financial nightmares.By the by, fracking is a derivatives futures bubble that is about to burst. Fracking wells being sold on the market today as investments are the equivalent of homes known to contain toxic mold -- within the year, I speculate, the City of London and Wall Street are going to be treating fracking as a toxic investment to be avoided at all costs (after they dump what they have on the ever naive labor pension funds).This is a timely book, particularly as the price of oil collapses and the price of water is starting to rise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KXGQWORPRFJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627221638#wasThisHelpful","R2KXGQWORPRFJU","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the pre-cursor book to The Accidental Admiral: A Sailor Takes Command at NATO which I have reviewed most favorably and strongly recommend. This book -- while free online as are all NDU Press books, is a very high quality production with some complex graphics and color photographs. It is fairly priced and absolutely recommended in print if you favor books you can hold in your hands.There have been other books by military commanders but to the best of my knowledge only General Tony Zinni, USMC (then commanding the US Central Command with two wars and 12 task forces) and General Wesley Clark, USA (then commanding NATO during the Kosovo mess) have risen to what this book strives to be, a gold standard for whole of government multinational engagement.Battle Ready (Commander Series)The Battle for Peace: A Frontline Vision of America's Power and PurposeWinning Modern Wars: Iraq, Terrorism And The American EmpireDon't Wait for the Next War: A Strategy for American Growth and Global LeadershipOne learns in reading this book that the author (who is fluent in Spanish -- the other languages of the area are Portuguese, Dutch, and English, one country each) ably articulates a diplomatic passion for doing vastly more within the Americas, long a neglected back-water where (my view now) predatory capitalism has been the order of the day. Two books that capture that overview are:Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a ContinentConfessions of an Economic Hit ManInnovation and inter-agency planning are core concepts in this book -- and of course lacking still today across the US Government. Although we are now normalizing relations with Cuba, a long-overdue correction to an ideologically-driven and intellectually-flawed policy, the reality (in my view) is that the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Inter-American Defense Board (IADB) are dead men walking -- they will be displaced by UNASUR (the 12 South American countries with a new HQS in Quito) and eventually, perhaps, by CELAC (everyone except the US and Canada, often called US Lite). In brief, the excellent ideas in this book may be too late but I hope not -- 2016-2020 are a long-scheduled break-out period in US history, I can only hope that this author will be part of whatever national and regional leadership emerges as we transition out of the ""anything goes"" era so ably represented by, for example:Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America's Moral IntegrityThe chapter on innovation is central and would be an excellent stand-alone reading for any school at any level. One learns that the Innovation Directorate had four divisions: Joint Experimentation, Strategic Assessment, Knowledge Management, and Decision Support. This is an utterly brilliant chapter all the more valuable because the author clearly respects human innovation -- it is ""not just technology"" -- and the author see the disconnect between strategy (we have none) and money (we spend too much).  Not to be found in this book are critical comments about anyone else -- for example, the Atlantic Transformation Command (ACT).Among the great ideas in this book are that of a Humanitarian Task Force in which Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) personnel are fully integrated. This idea was implemented while the author was in charge of the US Southern Command (USOUTHCOM).Now imagine if US were willing to help create a multinational intelligence and operations center (MIOC) and a regional information-sharing network unique to the Southern Hemisphere and then BACK OFF -- be an observer and enabler rather than the 900 lbs gorilla. Imagine a MIOC built around CrisisMappers and able to deliver peace jumpers and a regional air-sea traffic management plan as I envisioned for Haiti on day one. Imagine a MIOC that can do holistic analytics, true cost economics, and render support across all domains to open source everything engineering.Imagine is the USG were willing to support the highest priority of UNASUR and Ecuador in particular, free clean energy (which brings with it free clean desalinated water) along with a debt jubilee and free cellular devices for every citizen (imagine Carlos Slim and James Stavridis on the same page -- this is real transformative power).This book is the SOP for the theater-architecture of the past brought to its greatest point of innovation and effectiveness. It does not go far enough. Until the USA is prepared to respect the sovereignty of the indigenous nations it presumes to ""protect"" and until the USA is able to understand what I just briefed in Ecuador (at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog click on page Espanol -- see also my easily found Hourglass Strategy), the USA will continue to be the predator playing on the edges -- the ""tonto util"" (useful idiot) whose wallet will be picked by corrupt elites at the same time that the larger public considers the USA just another form of organized crime.From where I sit, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Cuba, and Ecuador are several steps ahead of the USA -- and USSOUTHCOM -- in creating regional coherence and a platform for multinational approaches to peace and prosperity in the region independent of whatever the USA may think or want. That is a good thing. For me, this is a hopeful book -- a good beginning to a good conversation. Unclear to me is whether the US Government is capable of maturing fast enough to avoid being shut out of the South as China and Iran and Russia move in at speed.One final allowed link: Homeland Earth : A Manifesto for the New Millennium (Advances in Systems Theory, Complexity and the Human Sciences)Semper Fidelis,Robert David Steele VivasCo-Founder, Marine Corps Intelligence ActivityINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2E9RPR54MS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780392273#wasThisHelpful","R1U2E9RPR54MS0","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enough substance to warrant my finishing the book and writing a summary review.I accepted this book from a publicist because of my strong interest in ""third way"" economics. I like the concept of Collaborative Commonwealth very much, an alternative concept is one put forth by Michel Bauwens and others as Open Cooperativism. The two concepts are not as similar as one might think.What I like most about the book is its very clever use of the water analogy (drops become streams become rivers feed lakes and oceans); its starkly interesting positioning of collaborative commonwealth as being in the sweet spot between the extremes of predatory capitalism and unbridled socialism, and its combination of clear patriotism including a defense of all of the Constitutional Amendments with an equally clear indictment of the US Government as the ""gang in possesion"" looting the Commonwealth and helping the banksters -- including the private bank known as the Federal Reserve -- squeeze the last drop of blood out of We the Economic Slaves.I am troubled by the author's fear of authority and hence of any use of the word revolution as in abolish  the present corrupt government -- someone has clearly frightened him with the knowledge that dissent in the USA is now treated by the Department of Homeland Security as grounds for assuming you are a terrorist with no civil rights -- and by the rather rough nature of the book -- this is an essay with many references and many important points but it reads like a powerpoint briefing rushed into print.Related Books I have Reviewed:Fusion Economics: How Pragmatism Is Changing the WorldEconomic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-BeingThe Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, Revised and Updated 5th Anniversary Edition: Eradicating Poverty Through ProfitsStop, Thief!: The Commons, Enclosures, and Resistance (Spectre)935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America's Moral IntegrityOther Books I Recommend in Larger Context:Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)1491 (Second Edition): New Revelations of the Americas Before ColumbusBeautiful Trouble: Pocket EditionWhat Wags the World: Tales of Conscious AwakeningDesigning a World That Works for All: How the Youth of the World are Creating Real-World Solutions for the UN Millenium Development Goals and BeyondRecommended as a Kindle, print is over-priced -- this is an article pushing a website.

"This is a hugely important book that I hope will become popular in the USA, and translated into other languages. I learned of its existence while attending a Findhorn Foundation event in Scotland, ""The New Story Summit."" At one point there was a discussion of how United Nations ""peacekeepers"" are sent in to keep the peace but do so at the point of a gun, without any training in human interaction or the fundamentals of story-telling, narrative weaving, listening, observing, and all the other human ""arts."" This one story impressed me greatly.Having now read the book, I want to emphasize my enchantment by confessing that I am a Naked Truth kind of person, the diametric opposite of the Story Teller. As with UN peacekeepers, I have been badly trained, equipped, and organized for a world in which conversation and story-telling are alternatives to confrontation and violence.Although the author and the book focus on the role of story-telling in relation to peace-making, I would emphasize its value in creating common prosperity at well -- in creating the means of self-governance with respect for the limits of nature and the importance of doing no harm.The book consists of 12 chapters, among them chapters on Being Moved, on Learning to See, and on Community of Belonging. There is also a strong chapter on technology as a negative, and I am reminded of Jerry Mander and Bill McKibbin, among others. Within those 12 chapters are 33 exercises and many stories as well as provocative quotes. This is a very well put-together book, one that should be listed at Amazon USA and not limited to Amazon UK (US buyers can order it, but they cannot ""see"" the book at Amazon USA, they have to search for it globally first).For me -- someone who clearly needs instruction in this vital domain -- the bottom line from this book is clear: story-telling is a means of opening minds, heightening consciousness, building bridges, reducing mis-understandings, healing souls, and generally connecting and reconnecting people to one another and to nature.As a Naked Truth kind of person, I am constantly reminded by this book that absolutes are not helpful -- stories allow for contextual nuance and can avoid the black or white objectivism that characterizes Webberian bureaucracy, modern stove-piped government, rule by secrecy, and corporate misbehavior cloaked in scientific rationalism.Fully half the training having to do with story-telling revolves around listening -- not speaking, but listening. Learning to see. Learning to hear. Learning to feel. Learning to embrace empathy. Being non-judgmental.Above all else, story-telling leaps across all boundaries -- story-tellers without borders are easily as important as doctors or engineers without borders. What I draw from this book is that story-telling is a form of human engagement that makes creative emergence possible. It ""stirs the pot"" and opens up possibilities that could never be achieved in a traditional confrontation between teams of negotiators seeking to dominate any given outcome.The book ends with reflections on how we might pursue story-telling to advance truth and reconciliation while addressing the many obstacles to progress including complacency.The author was honored in 2014 with selection as Chair of the Storytelling and Peace Council. One can learn more at thenewstory.nu.Rather than link to ten specific titles as I normally do, I want to point readers to my lists of book reviews at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog (Reviews), where I have organized -- with direct links to each book's Amazon page, lists focusing on, among many other topics, complexity and resilience, consciousness and social IQ, and truth & reconcilation.This is a fine book for self-study and self-awareness, but it is best used as a group study guide with the exercises being undertaken by groups of at least a dozen people at a time.Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasThe Open Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, & Trust","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9QJH9FIYJM0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784620734#wasThisHelpful","R9QJH9FIYJM0L","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a first-class book on the convergence of many illicit networks that Congress has not legalized. A sure sign of the book's very high value and inherent quality is provided by the Foreword from Admiral James Stavridis, whose own book, The Accidental Admiral: A Sailor Takes Command at NATO I just reviewed most favorably.The foreword very diplomatically brings out two core points: that many ""small"" or informal or non-state threats are converging to create a firestorm that most states are not trained, equipped, nor organized to address; and that we must, if we are to prosper going forward, begin to think in holistic terms -- whole of government, whole of society, whole of international society -- all phrases used by Admiral Stavridis.Since I have been saying this since I first ghost-wrote for General Al Gray, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, the 1989 article ""Global Intelligence Challenges in the 1990's,"" whose most unique element was the characterization of the differences between conventional threats and emerging threats, all of this resonates with me.From the National Defense University Press, which I hold in very high regard, this is the single best book I have seen on  the diversity of the illicit threat networks.  Each chapter is individually brilliant and all of them offer compelling turns of phrase and good graphics. ""Deviant globalization"" and ""the geography of badness"" jump out.There are three flaws, each easily corrected in a new edition of this book, which I do recommend:01 The book desperately needs an index. This is the most common deficiency found in think tank and government university publications and one I abhor. The lack of an index is the main reason why this book loses the fifth star.02 The book lacks a coherent focus on the failure of intelligence.03 The book would benefit from a preface or an epilogue that acknowledges the single most important lesson I myself have learned since I started championing intelligence reform in the 1980's: if you lack integrity at the strategic and policy levels, if you fail to do counterintelligence against financial, religious, and ideological traitors at the strategic and policy levels, then you will never, ever, get it right in acquisition and operations.Here are some other books that round out the strong value to be found in this book:High Noon: 20 Global Problems, 20 Years To Solve ThemA More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and ChangeGriftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American HistoryIllicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats are Hijacking the Global EconomyWhy the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global RageThe Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the WorldBreaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)Where Have All the Leaders Gone?We are out of balance.

"This is three books in one, and none of them do justice to the author, who is easily considered by my naval officer colleagues to be a person of most extraordinary intellect and absolute integrity -- he is considered a ""five star"" flag in every possible respect, and there are many of us whom he has mentored or who run with those he has mentored, who hope he will one day be Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State or both. I discussed this book with CAPT Scott Philpott, USN (Ret), among those selected by the author as an innovator, and this point cannot be overstated: to the extent the Services have toxic leadership that must be retired, those mentored by Admiral Stavridis and a few other leaders (General Tony Zinni, for example) are the vanguard for a new generation of leaders who are agile, clear, daring, frugal, and above all, able to bring to bear intelligence with integrity.As I go through the book a second time, I see time and again evidence that this author was an original thinker who prospered in the face of massive bureaucratic resistance to change. I am reminded of how Admiral Crowe refused Admiral Rickover's ""invitation"" to join the nuclear submarine force, risking career termination only to go on to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then Ambassador to the United Kingdom. There is absolutely no question in my mind but that this author is destined to return to government at the Cabinet level.The first book, chapters 1-8, is a politically nuanced account of an extraordinary career. The author is one of two plebes from his Naval Academy class to make four star rank, the other being Marine Corps General John Allen. While there are portions of this first book that I might take issue with, I note with interest that the author uses quote marks as a form of loyal dissent, and a careful patient reading of this first third of the volume will yield some gold nuggets.The second book, chapters 9-16, is where most of the lessons learned are to be found.  This is a handbook for innovative leadership, and richly suited as a guide for mid-career officers and leaders in any domain, military or civilian. The word that jumps out at me, although it does not appear in the book, is ""hybrid."" This may be the only senior officer that actually gets what I have been saying for 25 years, to wit, we not only need to get serious about all the non-state threats and all threats all the time (what he calls convergences, when many small threats come together to create a firestorm larger than any state can handle), but we must come together across all boundaries. He stresses multinational, inter-agency, and public-private alliances.The third book is a combination of appendices, a world-class annotated bibliography that in divided between non-fiction and fiction, with the fictional works being of great historical and cultural importance, and a world-class index. Although ""intelligence"" is not properly presented in the index, there are a number of important references to intelligence successes and failures throughout the book, and it is therefore one that intelligence professionals should study.Published by the Naval Institute Press, and including 24 pages of high-quality photographs, this is easily a five-star book, but one that does not quite do justice to the five-star admiral who uniquely blends military sagacity with strategic, innovative, diplomatic, cultural, and legal understanding.

Given those two recommendations, my own review is pro forma, summary notes for smart people.This is a most extraordinary book that I found deeply absorbing, inspiring, and practical. It is an original work in every possible sense of the word, and brings to the public insights, concepts, and methods that are essential to creating peace and prosperity among vastly diverse groups whose cultures, mind-sets, life conditions, and existing forms of governance and economics are not just in conflict, but downright pathologically dysfunctional.Within this rich offering are a few things that are simply not found elsewhere, that could and should redefine and mature Western and Eastern understanding and practice:01 Practical application of the pioneering work of Clare W. Graves02 Practical integration of previously unpublished work by Don E. Beck03 Most extraordinary handbook for mapping the psycho-social political-economic environment of any conflict04 Precise articulation of a new concept in context, that of Indigenous Intelligence05 First rate graphics including graphical depictions of leadership forms for each of the value-system bands06 Practical model of dealing with Flamethrowers, Zealots, Ideologues, Moderates, Pragmatists, and Conciliators07 Thoughtful conclusion on how to approach functional (hybrid) governance and (honest) capitalismFrom Don Beck's foreword:QUOTE (xii): The goal (is) to understand the needs of all mind-sets and to begin to craft ""full-spectrum"" solutions, which are fundmentally different from those that a single perspective would offer.This is not something any Western intelligence agency, international development authority, or major university is capable of doing today, not because they cannot, but because they refuse to mature.The author begins with a very sound summary of Arab history, highlighting artificial boundaries imposed by the West at the point of a gun (boundaries that disrupted the relationships among tribes and between tribes and nature), land barons and proxy tyrants, and predatory capitalism.See also: The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State and Web of Deceit: The History of Western Complicity in Iraq, from Churchill to Kennedy to George W. Bush as well as Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025Her core focus is on teaching young men and women how to build indigenous institutions that are sustainable in the face of as well as in the aftermath of failed Western (and now Eastern) interventions that may be well-intentioned but are abysmally ignorant and often very destructive. Although the author states that educational reform is at the core of the Arab Memone Project, that aspect remains to be addressed more fully.See also: Philosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated Edition and Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)The discussion of the ""confluence of civilizations,"" a not-so-subtle slam on Samuel Huntington's book about clashes that neglected the deep wisdom of the psycho-social practitioners such as Graves and Beck and long underappreciated Charles Hampden-Turner, is utterly fascinating, as is the author's appreciation for Turkey as a rising model (to which I would add Iran, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Nigeria).See also: Radical Man: The Process of Psycho-Social Development. and The New Turkish Republic: Turkey as a Pivotal State in the Muslim World (Pivotal State Series)There are several central values to this book, one of them being a very concise practical summary of the work of Don Beck in relation to politics, economics, and regional challenges for change. Another is the author's articulation of just what it means to have Indigenous Intelligence.QUOTE (109): Indigenious Intelligence (II) is the multidimensional capacity of an individual or group in a specific society to interpret its value-system's complexity to non-natives.  ...  Indigenous Intelligence informs governance by assessing the life conditions of the people and the challenges they face. It paints a more complete picture of the obstacles facing stakeholders in a society, not just the elite and the privileged.Another major value within this book is the natural design process that it develops in relation to Arabia, and its pointed emphasis on the need to meet separately with each of the major mind-set categories (Flamethrowers, Zealots, Ideologues, Moderates, Pragmatists, and Conciliators) before meeting as a larger group -- other practical recommendations not now understood by US and other diplomats and aid managers are offered.As someone who has studied revolution his whole life (search for starting point Graphic: Preconditions of Revolution in the USA Today) and twice failed to get the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to understand that revolution must be studied and appreciated holistically, I find the Beck - Maalouf emphasis on deep appreciation of life conditions, memetic codes, mindsets and world views, systems & structures, and behaviors & actions to be the epitome of intelligence with integrity.On page 177 I am charmed and inspired by a map of Israel-Palestine that charts the level of emotional and intellectual maturity of specific areas at four levels. This is precisely the kind of fundamental appraisal that is needed and not practiced today by any of the ""eight tribes"" or information networks that must come together to achieve hybrid understanding and wisdom (academia, civil society, commerce, government, law enforcement, media, military, and non-government/non-profit).The author concludes with a discussion of how locally-designed and locally-suited functional governance (I would say hybrid governance) must be empowered by functional capitalism (I consider capitalism dishonest, we are better off focused on the term citizen-centered economics). This is an essential original offering and one that will merit close study in Arabia as well as around the world. This section includes some excellent charts -- it does not include any reference to true cost economics or open source everything engineering. It ends with a deeply provocative chart, ""Functional Democracy & the Eight Levels of Human Existence,"" co-developed by the author and Don Beck for this book specifically.See also: Global Public Policy: Governing without Government? and Critical Choices. The United Nations, Networks, and the Future of Global Governance as well as Stop, Thief!: The Commons, Enclosures, and Resistance (Spectre)Two appendices, the Notes, and the Index, are world-class and make this book a reference work of lasting value.From my vantage point, this book defines an aspect of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic (DIME) analytics that is both missing from all current endeavors and essential to crafting a future of peace and prosperity for all. This book should be required reading for diplomats, intelligence analysts, corporate commercial risk managers, and so many others. It sets a new gold standard for the integration of psycho-social analytics in local to global collaboration for constructive change. It is not sufficient in and of itself -- holistic analytics addressing the ten high-level threats to humanity and the twelve core practical policy domains from agriculture to water are needed, as are true cost economics in detail and open source everything engineering -- but it is certainly the ""missing link"" in ethical local to global engagement and a major life-affirming world-changing contribution to humanity's forward progress.Best wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BA4VFOMEE9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590792866#wasThisHelpful","R2BA4VFOMEE9S","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book -- I disclose that my chapter is one of two concluding chapters -- is one of the most practical, comprehensive, and perhaps -- we all hope -- inspirational books to be published on aviation applications for peace and war in recent memory.  Since Look Inside the Book is not available [UPDATE: it *can* be seen for the Kindle edition], I will first list the parts and chapters, and then summarize my appreciation for this pioneering endeavor.PART I THE UN'S FIRST ""AIR FORCE""01 Planning, Organizing, and Commanding Air Operations in the Congo, 196002 Peacekeepers in Combat: Fighter Jets and Bombers in the Congo, 1961-196303 A Fine Line: Use of Force, the Cold War, and Canada's Air Support for the UN Organization in the CongoPART II AIRLIFT: LIFELINE FOR UN MISSIONS04 Above the Rooftop of the World: Canadian Air Operations in Kashmir and Along the India-Pakistan Border05 Humanitarian Relief in Haiti, 2010: Honing the Partnership between the US Air Force and the UN06 Flying Humanitarians: The UN Humanitarian Air ServicePART III AERIAL SURVEILLANCE: EYES IN THE SKY07 Aerial Surveillance: Eyes in the Sky08 UN Observer Group in Lebanon: Aerial Surveillance During a Civil War, 195809 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Supporting UN Operations: A Commercial Service Model?PART IV THE UN AND NO-FLY ZONES10 The UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission and the Southern Non-Fly Zone, 1991-200311 Observing Air Power at Work in Sector Sarajevo, 1993-1994: A Personal AccountPART V: COMBAT: ENFORCING THE PEACE12 Air Operations in Somalia: ""Black Hawk Down"" Revisted13 Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia, 1995: Humanitarian Constraints in Aerospace Warfare14 Combat Air Power in the Congo, 2003-15 Allied Air Power over LibyaPART VI: EVOLVING CAPABILITIES16 Advances in Aviation for UN Peacekeeping: A View from UN Headquarters17 Peace from Above: Envisioning the Future of UN Air Power  [free online, search for < 2014 Peace from Above: Envisioning the Future of UN Air Power >]Thirteen authors came together to create this work under the editorial leadership of Professor Walter Dorn, bracketed by the field experience of LtGen Romeo Dallaire, whose book Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda is essential reading in the global to local security literature, and the combined UN aviation field and headquarters leadership of Kevin Shelton-Smith,  Chief of the UN Aviation Projects and Planning Department.It was my privilege to hear all these authors present their views at the conference sponsored by Canada, and I consider all of them to be extraordinary world-class figures whose aggregate knowledge as offered in this book is priceless to any Air Force anywhere -- and of course to UN leaders including those seconded from Member states who need to understand the progress the UN has made in what is arguably the single most important foundation for UN safety and security in expeditionary operations (intelligence is the other plank,  the UN is challenged in that arena and likely to remain so for the next decade or two -- but for one view of the possible, search online for < 2012 Robert Steele: Practical Reflections on United Nations Intelligence + UN RECAP > and see the book in my signature line.Since I have listed the table of contents to help those considering the purchase of the book, I will not do my summary review, but there is one brilliant observation made at the conference by Robert C. Owen of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, to wit: ""Bandwidth is more expensive than pilots."" While I strongly support the use of drones and especially micro-drones for humanitarian relief -- and applaud all that is being done by Dr. Patrick Meier and CrisisMappers -- I consider the Western move away from live pilots to be one of the most dangerous, ill-considered, and deeply unprofessional developments in modern aviation history. Technology is not a substitute for thinking -- a thinking pilot with 360 degree situational awareness and the judgment to NOT achieve a 98% collateral damage ratio such as CIA has compiled with its assassination drones, is priceless.I consider the editor, Professor Walter Dorn, to be the dean of the UN scholars, and one of the world's top authorities on peacekeeping technologies -- indeed he is a member of the new UN High-Level Panel on Peacekeeping Technologies, and I am very much looking forward to the book that will emerge from that. Until then, my all time favorite UN publication is A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.Best wishes  to all,Robert David Steele VivasPEACEKEEPING INTELLIGENCE: Emerging Concepts for the Future","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K67TBYXE9GKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1472435494#wasThisHelpful","R1K67TBYXE9GKH","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book, a gift, to be charming and useful. It should certainly be used as a textbook at the national intelligence university as well as mainstream schools. I consider this book a hybrid, one that integrates an outsider application of a social constructivist perspective, with an appreciation for selected insider sources who were ostracized at the time but ultimately proven correct when the agency they sought to serve was proven wrong.The book examines four of CIA's many failures -- the Iranian revolution, the collapse of the USSR, the Cuban missile crisis, and the failure to predict 9/11. Noteworthy in the book's findings are that the insularity of the CIA culture, and its lack of language-qualified individuals as well as diversity mindsets (e.g. the feminine point of view in relation to Russian economics) along with its oblivious with respect to ethnic and religious divisions, all tended to lead to the CIA asking and answering the wrong questions.What I find particularly appealing about this book as a study tool is its review of how CIA failed in each of the key elements of the intelligence cycle (the authors focus on tasking, collection, analysis, and production/dissemination) and their conclusion that missing from the intelligence cycle is a first step, that of Hypotheses.The book is limited in its sources -- the very best authors critical of the CIA are not represented here -- and also naive in its assumptions. It fails to understand what Paul Pillar has made so clear in Intelligence and U.S. Foreign Policy: Iraq, 9/11, and Misguided Reform as well as Morton Halperin before him in Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy, which is to say, the policy world is deeply corrupt, deeply ignorant, and not at all interested in the truth even if CIA were capable of getting a grip on the truth.The book is generally strong on the first three cases, and very weak on the last. 9/11 was allowed to happen.  The Director of Central Intelligence at the time, George Tenet, personally aided and abetted the Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, in shutting down ABLE DANGER and otherwise squelching warnings -- including blocking these warnings from reaching Congress -- of 13 other countries. For the best overview of 9/11, including the 13 early warnings that allowed Dick Cheney and his cohort to schedule a national ""exercise"" three months in advance of the day so as to control everything, search online for Mini-Me: 9/11 Convergence + NEW Information + Comment by Robert Steele + List of Advance Warnings from Over 13 Countries.The book makes a token attempt to include Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) as a safety net, but is completely oblivious to all of the truly important international authors on this topic (easily found by searching for OSINT Historic Contributions Directory (List)). Their oversight is understandable -- these vital works appeared in journals and conferences not indexed by the reference works that academics rely upon. As with CIA, insularity is a handicap.Those wishing to see my summary reviews of over 300 books on secret intelligence, each review leading back to its Amazon home page, can search online for Worth a Look: Book Reviews on Government Secret Intelligence, the CIA section alone has 70 entries, most not cited by these authors.On balance a stellar personal effort by two outsiders, at the intersection of cultural failure, source failure, process failure, and political failure.Best wishes to all,Robert David SteeleON INTELLIGENCE: Spies and Secrecy in an Open World (2000)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APNHCW4QY168/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804793360#wasThisHelpful","R2APNHCW4QY168","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book at the suggestion of Miriam Knight, and found it engrossing. This is not a conversation between the author and God, but rather between the author's mind (from the World of Form) and the author as a soul (straddling into the World of Light).There are multiple bottom lines, I will list just four that jump out at me from my notes:01 Finding your authentic self -- and hence finding sustainable happiness and positive effect -- must be rooted in a deep critical appreciation of how false our current world is, particularly its materialistic and reductionist nature, the false assumptions about scarcity, valuation. This sets the stage for personal liberation.  - The author does not belabor the evil in our current industrial-era world that some call Vampire Capitalism -- but does concisely lay out how the World of Form is an artificial world in which scarcity, time, distance, and speed are among the many contrived concepts that serve to enslave the average person to a lifetime of largely meaningless working to live instead of living to work (at one's calling). Peter Drucker, Buckminster Fuller, and Russell Ackoff would all embrace how the author describes a world in which we have all been herded into an artificial construct, the commons have been fenced, private behavior once natural has been criminalized, and all the joy and creativity has been sucked out of education, the media, and more crafts. The World of Form is a false world, a false God, with false priests, rabbis, and immans (a few exceptions notwithstanding.  Here are just a few books that totally reinforce the author's message on this core foundational aspect of the book:The Manufacture Of Evil: Ethics, Evolution, and the Industrial SystemGriftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American HistoryBreaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025Grand Illusion: The Myth of Voter Choice in a Two-Party Tyranny  - The whole point of the book is to help any individual discover that they are a soul within the World of Light, perfect in every way, and that their highest calling and greatest potential within the cosmos lies in rejecting the World of Form, embracing the World of Light, and being one with all others, which is to say, forgive everyone else's trespasses, love everyone else as you should love yourself, and let the harmony of the World of Light come forth in your everyday being. This is not a Zen book but it resonates.  The first half frees you of illusory bonds; the second half empowers the liberation of natural joy. Here are four books that come to mind among many others (see my comment for a number of useful links to my Amazon book review lists focused on goodness):The Bhagavad Gita: A Walkthrough for WesternersPhilosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated EditionThe Zen Leader: 10 Ways to Go From Barely Managing to Leading FearlesslyThe Power of the Powerless: Citizens Against the State in Central-Eastern Europe02 Pain is physical, suffering mental, and both are the primary means by which elements of the cosmos might learn. Persisting through the pain and suffering, being resilient and having faith in the goodness of the larger cosmos and the good intentions of one self, combined with a rejection of the attachments imposed by the old paradigm (materialism, trade-offs sacrificing family to corporation) are the journey -- the way.03 Energy is the fundamental element such that matter also contains dark matter or energy spaces -- science is a religion, religion is a science, and everything is connected in a spiritual non-material manner. The brain is an energy field, thoughts do travel without industrial-era tools. Energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed. Change is transient in the World of Form, it is a non-concept in the World of Light.04 Love really does conquer all, beginning with complete acceptance of one self and then all others. There are no accidents, war is a clear indication that humanity is out of balance (including excessive control by the 1% of both money and communications media), trust and confidence in one's authenticity as well as faith in the goodness of the larger cosmos are essential to making the leap -- find and fulfill your purpose.The author strongly recommends two books, Phil McGraw's Self Matters: Creating Your Life from the Inside Out and Dawn of the Akashic Age: New Consciousness, Quantum Resonance, and the Future of the World -- I have reviewed the second.Not visible to the reader are the very many books and personalities that the author absorbed during his decade long personal quest in the aftermath of his near death experience. I suspect there is some overlap in our reading, and have posted a new collection of book review lists, search for < New Group of Book Review Categories Focused on Goodness > to get to it, all reviews lead back to their book's Amazon home page.Best wishes to all,Robert David SteeleTHE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trust","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZRB5AJTL380/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933754931#wasThisHelpful","R37ZRB5AJTL380","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been thinking recently about various emergent alternative forms of capitalism, including Ethical, Collaborative, Conscious, Inclusive, and Redemptive Capitalism, and found this book as I was working on an article about Open Source Everything and Democratic Collaborative Capitalism.First off, this is a totally up  to date book. Although it is made clear in the front matter that this is an expanded updated edition of the 2012 book, Creating Sustainable Societies: The Rebirth of Democracy and Local Economies I really do want to emphasize this book's currency up to and including Spring 2014 events and references.Having looked over a number of other treatments for how to migrate away from predatory financial capitalism with its emphasis on value-extraction and short term financial profit to the exclusion of all other considerations, I find the Mars-family endorsed concept of Mutality to be the most satisfying in terms of over-all philosophy and practice, with a strong kudos to PriceWaterhouseCoopers UK and the Said Business School at Oxford for being well ahead of the pack in their thoughtfulness. Search online for < Brewery Mutuality > to get right to 46-page PDF of very high value.This book is my other favorite, being a practical and implementable program any community can understand and embrace.Right off I encounter two terms new to me but both resonate:Crowd-Based Financial System (CBFS)Collaborative Governance System (CGS)The core term of the book is the Local Economic Direct Democracy Association (LEDDA) which requires an entire book to explain but in a nutshell is a local combination of self-governance, self-funding, and self-fulfillment. I find the book written in a startling effective manner, well-organized and ably articulated -- this would make an excellent text for both formal classrooms and informal citizen study groups.The elements of the LEDDA framework are the monetary system, the financial system, the market system, the property right system, the incentive system, the governance system, conceptual models, and the stated purpose, the latter being to ""maximize member well-being and benefit the global public.Economic direct democracy leverages the new-found information-sharing and sense-making tools and the new-found citizen activism to take the power away from governments and corporations, and restore public agency, all with greater transparency,accountability and public participation in all decisions.The outcome of a LEDDA adopted by a community is full-employment and increased income for all individual members. Human capital becomes the driving factor, not financial capital.Chapter 6 covers local currencies and token exchange systems while chapter 7 covers principled business model, what some might call a B Corporation or a social enterprise. For myself, I consider all corporations to be operating under public charters, and most government to be totally corrupt in failing to enforce the responsibility of corporations to respect social and environmental parameters. What is happening now is that a small number of corporations -- the Mars family among them -- are recognizing that sustainable profit demands a co-equal emphasis on People and Planet as well as Profit.There is a section on Intellectual Property that I find quite fascinating, in part because the author concludes -- and cites others as concluding -- that often Intellectual Property can create more harm than good for society. As a proponent for Open Source Everything, and a recent convert to the view that open source everything is a model for lifetime full employment, I find this most important.In Chapter 8 the author itemizes and explains eight differences between LEDDA and the existing financial and monetary systems:01 Debt-free money creation02 Focus on economic development03 Inflation-free money04 Income equality05 Environmental stewardship06 High transparency07 Alternative conceptual models08 Community funding decisionsEach of these receives several pages and this is a very important part of the book.The book ends with a chapter on the collaborative governance system and another on starting and operating a LEDDA. In the latter chapter examples are discussed in relation to specific economic sectors characterized by high consumer spending, including food and beverage, housing, transportation, energy, medical care and recreation, and education and communication. A separate section focuses on climate change and the citizen.I am not an economist and there is a great deal I have to take on faith here. My bottom line is that this book reeks of practical wisdom, strikes me as very authentic, and therefore I consider the author to be one of the top people who must be consulted as we move toward the creation of Democratic Collaborative Capitalism -- most of it very local in nature -- going forward.Absolutely recommended with enthusiasm.A few other books within my ten link limit:Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)Stop, Thief!: The Commons, Enclosures, and Resistance (Spectre)Collapsing Consciously: Transformative Truths for Turbulent Times (Sacred Activism)Other Inconvenient Truths Beyond Global WarmingThe Purpose Economy: How Your Desire for Impact, Personal Growth and Community Is Changing the WorldGlobalistan: How the Globalized World is Dissolving Into Liquid WarThe Great Convergence: Asia, the West, and the Logic of One WorldThe Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our FutureThe Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through ProfitsBest wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasTHE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trust (2012)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWSHJNWAVKTIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1499640595#wasThisHelpful","RWSHJNWAVKTIF","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an art video, not a science video. It is an artistic interpretation the Bible Belt has gone nuts over, to no useful end. I find that on balance, while the movie has almost no connection to reality or theology, it does have enough philosophy and cinematic value to be a solid four.The team producing this movie over-reached badly on the beginning and the sci-fi aspects they portray at the beginning.  That costs them one star. The rest of the movie is a compelling mix of extaordinary cinematography, a subtle script in which Cain keeps resurfacing including in Noah's own son, and a very happy tear-jerking ending in which man is resurrected from the dead.Not worth going to a movie house for, but absolutely worth having on background at the flat screen that is next to all smart people's double-screen workstation. Not Russell Crowe's best work, a few extraordinary facial arrangements not-with-standing, but by no means deserving of all the ignorant vitrol from creationists and absolutists out of touch with  reality.This movie joins 134 other DVDs I recommend for smart people.

"EDIT of 5 October 2014 to add bullets (highlights) from a second reading after attending The New Story Summit at Findhorn Foundation in Scotland.QUOTE Stephan Duncombe (104): """"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."" But waiting for the truth to set us free is lazy politics. The truth does not reveal itself by virtue of being the truth: it must be told, and told well. It must have stories woven around it, works of art made about it; it must be communicated in new and compelling ways that can be passed from person to person, even if this requires flights of fancy and new methodologies.""I bought this book at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) in NYC, just concluded, along with another not listed at Amazon that I want to mention, Micah L. Sifry's ""The Big Disconnect: Why the Internet Hasn't Transformed Politics (Yet).This book, at 138 pages in pocket size (3/5ths of a normal pocketbook), is an utter gem. At a minimum it forces reflection.

This is an important book, perhaps most useful as an inspiration and as a source of reflection on what is possible. It is a book I will carry in my briefcase to visit across many days and places.Here are some highlights from my notes:+ Book offers a ""pattern language,"" in essence a formula for telling a new story with new means+ See the website, a growing community+ Song creates sympathy+ Coordination across organizations and industries is key -- most are fragmented beyond imagination+ Debts are shared fictions - pull the plug+ Winning the revolution is an information challenge -- challenge the core premises publicly+ Flash mobs work well, especially under repressive conditions+ Strikes are non-violent but only work when they are general and cross-industry+ Guerilla projection (projecting truth messages against facades without doing damage) is HUGE tool+ Hoax stories that get picked up by mainstream media reveal the larger mosaic of lies that is the mainstream media+ Core practices include clear motive and story, disruptive action with disciplined non-violence, open to participation+ Strategic non-violence demands DEEP education of all participants to avoid false-flag provocations to violence+ Repressed female and minority power is a huge resource to be respected and embraced+ Highlighting human (and true) cost of any issue is not something the media does -- we must+ Play to your SECONDARY audience (the follow on viewers of the YouTube)+ Shift the spectrum of allies from hostile to neutral to friendly to stalwart+ Tell the story -- the ""naked truth"" is simply not that effective because the story grabs the heart and the heart is central+ Message discipline is vital -- leave the conspiracy theories even if known to be true - for after the revolution+ Listen to those most affected by the issue, let their authenticity be your foundation on that issue+ Challenge the behavior in context, not the person -- everyone really is a good person trapped in a bad context+ Most are ignorant of the power they can exercise by withdrawing consent and buycottingBelow I list other titles to consider in two blocks -- five in this genre, specifics of organizing, and five in the larger context of collective intelligence and public power.Organizing for Social Change 4th EditionStrike Back: Using the Militant Tactics of Labor's Past to Reignite Public Sector Unionism TodayDoing Democracy: The MAP Model for Organizing Social MovementsThe Occupy HandbookOccupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (Occupied Media Pamphlet Series)A Power Governments Cannot SuppressThe Power of the Powerless: Citizens Against the State in Central-Eastern EuropeThe Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the PeopleParticipatory Budgeting (Public Sector Governance and Accountability)Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth, and Violence at the Edge of the 21st CenturyBest wishes to all,Robert David STEELE VivasTHE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth, & Trust","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP6A5WWKYQ5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1935928570#wasThisHelpful","R2KP6A5WWKYQ5W","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not thrilled with the title because it implies to the browser  that the book is about the 935 now-documented lies that led to the war in Iraq, and that is not the case -- those lies are simply one of many evidentiary cases spanned a much broader spectrum.  As the author himself outlines early on, the book is about a retrospective review of the struggle for truth from the lies that led to Viet-Nam to date (less 9/11); a concurrent review of the corruption and diminuition of commercial journalism; and finally, the future of the truth.Start at the end -- on a whim I did, reading the 8th and final chapter first, and what I found not only persuaded me that this author is an intellectual and moral giant, but that he may yet have his most important work before him, the astonishing depth and breadth of his past 20 years not withstanding. Returning to the beginning, I appreciated the first seven chapters with the benefit of the author's own concluding perspective.I would quibble with the author in starting with Viet-Nam, but it makes sense in the context of his focus on the Constitution as the first casualty, and the long march from giving the President war powers for Viet-Nam to letting Dick Cheney get away with 935 lies leading to Iraq. For me, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the Warren Commission cover-up are a more logical starting point. That was the point at which presidents ceased being president, and the start of what Matt Taibbi would later immortalize with a new word: Griftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American History.Among the many integrated elements of this book that inspire my admiration are the woven tale of how information has been controlled by the government in a manipulative manner, and truth foresaken -- mission abdicated -- by the professional press -- along with stellar selections of quotations from key figures. In some ways I am reminded of Howard Zinn's book A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present.The perfect complement to this book's beginning is Daniel Ellsberg's Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers where I have a very long summary review. It is helpful to remember that J. Edgar Hoover was in charge of the FBI during this period, and in addition to being complicit in the assassination of both Kennedy's and Martin Luther King, was the originator of governance by blackmail -- he would surely drool today over how the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency, along with all too many ""federalized"" adjuncts at the state and local level, are able to intimidate virtually anyone daring to risk independent thought.Chapter three brings us home to the matter of race and the author's early discovery that just about everything the government says and does with respect to race is theater -- lip service -- dishonoring all that we allegedly stand for. This is the chapter that causes me to appreciate the author's broadness of reading -- every page sparkles with at least one recommended book title. Here I will add one of my own, William Pepper's An Act of State: The Execution of Martin Luther KingChapter four uses CIA activities in Chile, Guatemala, and El Salvador, as well as the Iran-Contra scandal, to explore secret foreign policy and the arrogance of power. There are some gems here, including the realization that there are many different US foreign policies on any given issue, each with its own variation of truth. The author cites Seymour Hersh in noting that [just as with Viet-Nam] the central issue here is the assumption by the Executive of war powers and enactment of treaty-level rampages without respect for the Constitutional authority of the Senate. He does not quote, but I choose to insert here, Henry Kissinger's now immortal quote from a Wikileaks cable, ""The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer."" And all those gathered in the White House laughed. As a complement to this chapter, see Ambassador Mark Palmer's book, Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025 -- the US Government is best pals with 42 of the 44 dictators on the planet. As I write this, elements of the US Government are still trying to throw Ghani in Afghanistan under the bus, and illegally instal Abdullah, a 100% Tajik who can be definition never win more than 40% of the vote no matter how much Iranian or CIA money he has going for him. Ghani won the election 60-40 (55-45 if you count the fraudulent votes Karzai arranged for Abdullah) and for reasons that escape me, the Secretary of State is in Afghanistan trying to pretend that Ghani lost, Abdullah won, and they should split the power (which in the case of Abdullah and the Panjshiri kleptocracy, means gaining a license to loot).Chapter five, ""Doubt Is Their Product,"" focuses on corporate lies and corporate pressures that have essentially shut down investigative jouralism. The author focuses on tobacco and ends with references to other industries and now the Koch Brothers (to which he might have added Justice Powell and the US Chamber of Commerce). Ralph Nader's book Unsafe At Any Speed was in fact about corporate irresponsibility -- his number two, Jim Turner, went on to focus on the irresponsibility of the industries reducing health and allegedly fostering health). True cost economics is not in this book, but I am inspired to believe this book is a starting point for the author's next 20 years, NOT just a summary of the past 20. There is so much to be done.Chapter six explores the beginning of media self-censorship, media executive complicity with government misbehaviro and misrepresentation. I am struck by the US military declaration that ""unwarranted criticism"" is censorable.QUOTE (164): ""TV is an immensely powerful medium, but its potential to make astonishing sums of money is typically realized only by appealing to the lowest-common denominator instincts of viewers.""Someone smarter than me has observed that television destroyed in-depth reporting in historical context because there are no archives from the 15th Century (when Herat in Afghanistan was the capital of the Persian Empire). As I have watched the NYT and WSJ makes fools of themselves over the Afghan run-off election [see 15 truth-full posts on Ghani at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog], I have to conclude that both TV and print media have lost their minds -- over-paid reporters are getting by recycling unverified information and no one is doing what Robert Young Pelton, one of America's greatest journalist, does: go talk to those affected on the ground, outside the hotel -- it's actually much safer on the streets than most realize.This chapter is finished in the final chapter -- the author begins to articulate a new ecology of truth-finding and truth-telling that is non-profit in nature, replacing the traditional media outlets that are financially unsustainable in their current configurations.Chapter seven has this quote and I will leave it at that -- buy the book for this chapter (and the last) alone.QUOTE (180): ""Over the years, those unhappy with my investigations have tried just about everything to discourage me. They have issued supeonas, stalked my hotel rooms, escorted me off military bases,  threatened me with arrest or with being thrown from a second-story window, hired shills to pose as reporters asking disruptive questions at nationally televised news conferences and even arranged to have death threats delivered by concerned state troopers who urged me to leave town immediately. (I didn't). And of course they have launched frivelous libel lawsuits that took years and cost hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars to fight before they were dismissed.""The last chapter floored me. This is the one chapter that should be in every single journalism course -- and every scientific research seminar, every civil activist training class, every government school, every business school (they still don't teach commercial intelligence), every law enforcement, media, military, and non-profit curriculum. This is the chapter that brings it all together and outlines an inspiring future in which non-profit journalism and a new model combining non-profit reporters, academic interns, and many others across all boundaries, come together what is in essence a healthy World Brain.QUOTE (225): ""Imagine a world in which individual researchers, public-interest activists, lawyers, political scientists, government prosecutors and investigators, corporate investigators, forensic accountants, political scientists (sic - second mention), computer experts, investigative historians, public anthropologists, and journalists are sometimes looking for truth in all the same places, using the same exciting new data technologies and analytics, exchanging ideas and information, and sometimes working and writing together, whether side by side or across borders and genres.""Wow. This is also a chapter that mentions a number of organizations that are trying -- but not succeeding -- at taking truth-finding and telling to the next level, and it includes some noteworthy book recommendations, such as Tim Wu's The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires (Vintage).The author ends with a call for a new multi-disciplinary field he calls ""Accountability Studies."" It is at this point that I reflect the benefit of connecting the author to both Open Source Everything (the technical solution) and True Cost Economics as pioneeered by Herman Daly (see for instance For The Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future.The legal counterpart to this book focused on the public's right to know and in particular the First Ammendment, is Danny Sheehan's The People's Advocate: The Life and Legal History of America's Most Fearless Public Interest Lawyer. On the economic side, in addition to Matt Taibbi's Griftopia cited above, I recommend William Greider's many books, and especially The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy.I have to say that of all the books I have read in the past few years, this one has given me more hope in relation to the emergence of public intelligence in the public interest. I pray that the extraordinary accomplishments of the author and those he organized is but a preamble to the main event: the emergence of transparency, truth, and trust as a non-negotiable public good.Best wishes to allRobert David STEELE VivasINTELLIGENCE FOR EARTH: Clarity, Diversity, Integrity, & Sustainability","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26HU7EDRZEUFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610391179#wasThisHelpful","R26HU7EDRZEUFF","A1S8AJIUIO6M9K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Martin's book explains how to shift an intractable paradigm. As such, social entrepreneurs are doers who seek to raise the bar and achieve progress incrementally over time. There are specific steps to achieve this outcome; namely, understanding a problem, envisioning a solution, building a scale and broadening the impact.Martin explained some important paradigm shifts beginning with Guttenberg's printing press. Prior to this invention, it was difficult to communicate the great ideas of the day to the masses. Essentially, know-how was communicated by a slow process of apprenticeship throughout much of the Middle Ages. Resultantly, an expert might train just one or two people over many years. The printing press revolutionized this slow process by putting the know-how before the masses quickly and cheaply. Thomas Edison accomplished a similar paradigm shift with the invention of the incandescent light. Edison invented the new bulb, commercialized the application and marketed the device extensively.A transformation moves society forward-sometimes in a single leap. Government accomplished this with infrastructure projects under Roosevelt and even Eisenhower with highways. The private sector accomplished transformative change with Henry Ford's automobile and the revolution in cell phones to every sector of society.Entrepreneurs shift between despising the current system in practice, engaging in deep inquiry and facilitating change to move segments of the society to a higher level. The idea is to discover, adapt, envision and change. Overall, Martin's book enhances the current stock of knowledge by tweaking the systems methodology for articulating change given stubborn resistance patterns, as well as societal limitations or restrictions.America's Elder Boomers: (Learn How To Live Life Better In Old Age)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q6EBM8DAYMIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDDOSCS#wasThisHelpful","R1Q6EBM8DAYMIQ","A24505CR98NLLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24505CR98NLLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main idea in Marina's book is that people pay middlemen well because they want specific attributes in products and services. As a result, experts are engaged to direct consumers to purchases which satisfy a very discriminating criteria. This is true particularly for the high end product offerings where there are frequent substitutions of lower quality goods or services.The author describes 6 different types of middlemen including The Bridge, Certifier, Enforcer, Risk Bearer, Concierge and Insulator. Each middleman produces a specific benefit which transcends just buying direct. When people come into a store, they get to see the merchandise, test it out and discuss functionality with the salespeople. Oftentimes, this aspect is priceless because customers want to know what they are buying-especially with computers.Marina's book is a valuable gem because she has researched markets well to come up with individual niches that people want and will pay big money to acquire.America's Elder Boomers: (Learn How To Live Life Better In Old Age)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJTJGJIP4UYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149787F4#wasThisHelpful","R3EJTJGJIP4UYR","A24505CR98NLLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24505CR98NLLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Money: Master The Game by Tony Robbins explains the classic types of investments which create profits for life. The idea is to anticipate trends rather than react to them. REITS can be better investments than buying a home but perform your own due diligence. ETFs classically provide a good return with lower maintenance costs. Bridgewater Associates is a top investment fund as is IEP. The new 3D technology can create literally anything and bring the manufacturing of the item directly to the user..The USA is better today in harnassing its natural resources over a decade ago. There is a 100 year supply of natural gas which provides a huge competitive advantage for businesses and consumers. The advantage the USA has serves as a moat to keep away potential competitors.Robbins shows how interest compounding is a superior investment strategy. In addition, paying mortgages on time and sometimes in advance will save thousands on the total cost of payback.Robbins explains some top investments like IEP. The author cites businesses like Cloud Coaching International, Unlimited Tomorrow-Exoskeletons, Namate Resort and Spa, Human Elevation Companies, RRI, Marcum LLP Accountants and a host of others.Overall, MONEY by Tony Robbins is a refreshing financial tool which should assist investors in identifying top investments for a lifetime of profits and rising dividend payouts.

"Dr Weidemer provides some classic warning signals which occur before the big event. Examples of these early warning signals are chronic slow economic growth (The Long Depression circa 1890s),a scarcity of high paying jobs, an investor crisis of confidence, falling bond and stock prices, inflation, multi-bubble economic pops and lastly - the Aftershock.The classic bubbles have been seen in real estate, stocks, private debt, uncontrolled discretionary spending, a government debt bubble and ultimately a currency weakness or collapse. The author stresses that governments will do almost anything to avoid going over the cliff. Currently, the $18 trillion federal debt is six times tax collections of $3 trillion+ yearly. Debt stands at 103% of GDP.Dr Weidemer's prescription is to exit stocks before the cliff. In addition, real estate should be avoided to some extent until the existing bubble pops.Dr Weidemer advises investors to diversify in TIPS, ETFs of foreign currency, certain commodities and Gold ETFs.Overall, the book has some important warnings for investors although there are individual sectors with the promise of significant growth like the internet of everything, 3D printing, driverless autos, forever stocks and more.America's Elder Boomers: (Learn How To Live Life Better In Old Age)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZLCKL3FHWHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119118506#wasThisHelpful","RIZLCKL3FHWHB","A24505CR98NLLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24505CR98NLLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Brain:The Complete Mind et al"" by Sweeney is an informative book on the inner workings of the mind and the various technological wonders used to measure brain performance. For instance, the CT scan is used to assess injuries of the brain. MEG testing locates tumors. The PET scan assesses blood flow. EEG sensors help with epilepsy.Foods like blueberries are very helpful for overall brain health. Music is an important activity to tune-up the brain and improve functionality. Dopa treatments are helpful for Parkinson's patients. In addition, the Rasen's Color Progressive Matrix Test is helpful for assessing the IQ in younger children. The author covers classic symptoms for a plethora of brain disease issues. For instance, jerking movements are associated with myoclonic seizures. The anatomy of the brain is discussed too. For instance, the pineal gland oversees consciousness and is loosely considered to be the soul of human beings.Overall, Sweeney's book is an excellent reference guide for practitioners and the public alike.Pre-Kindergarten Gold","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUX1Q1V70O260/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426205473#wasThisHelpful","RUX1Q1V70O260","A24505CR98NLLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24505CR98NLLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Evolutionary Testament of Co-Creation:The Promise Will Be Kept by Barbara Marx Hubbard is an important discussion of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. A major theme of the book is that each of us can transcend the human condition to achieve a higher state of being on a spiritual or angelic level. This brings us to the universal phase of our existence or universal awareness.In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus mentions that ""Upon this rock I will build my Church"". This saying is significant because Christ mentions the building of His Church but does not set forth details about administering it. And so, an inference can be made that rigid dogma and inflexible rules were not intended by Christ in the ultimate scheme of things.Christ further amplified this concept when He stated ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."" Ostensibly, Christ did not condemn the sexual acts of people. He did condemn acts like usury which harm people and deprive them of a thriving livelihood and quality of life.Hubbard leads up to the transformative stages of life. Examples are the inner radiation of the body, the idea of instant empathy and following our highest aspiration which leads to attending to the business of the Father or Supreme Being.The Evolutionary Testament of Co-Creation:The Promise Will Be Kept affirms the teachings of Christ and the Gospels of the Apostles. In fact, individual passages of the Bible are quoted extensively throughout the presentation. It is not the mission of the book to inculcate Church dogma. The book very much sticks to reciting the teachings of Christ as amplified by the Apostles.Church Administration refers to other things like adherence to the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The Church presides over the Sacraments like Baptism, Confirmation, Marriage and Extreme Unction. There are considerable ceremonial activities of priests like the daily mass, baptisms, weddings and funerals. In addition, the Vatican itself has special ceremonies like Canonization of Saints. Hubbard's book studiously avoids treading on Church functions and prerogatives. Instead, The Evolutionary Testament of Co-Creation concentrates on the teachings of Christ as amplified by the Apostles.Overall, Hubbard's book begins a very important conversation which can happen beyond the boundaries of Christianity by extending to the highest spiritual levels attainable by an expanded consciousness.Immortality Commons","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LT4P19O0UU3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017FM5L7C#wasThisHelpful","R1LT4P19O0UU3U","A24505CR98NLLV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24505CR98NLLV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Carpenter provides some excellent simple dinner recipes. Examples are Quinoa w/Kale, Mushrooms and Sweet Potatoes and many others. A theme of the book is to have less meat like in ""meatless Mondays"". Increasingly, more dieters are going veggie as a source of proteins and antioxidants.The meal preparation is very detailed with the time listed, ingredients and food content in grams. For instance, the number of grams of protein, sugar, fiber, fat and carbs are all listed prominently. Some preparations like the Quinoa w/Kale are non-gluten.

"This is a great high volume water filtration kit. It is quite handy for camping, hiking, or to keep for emergencies.I tested the 12 Liter unit. I first tested it at home with tap water. I wanted to see how it works before I took it into the field. With clean tap water I filled the bag then hung it from a door. I set up a jug below the clean water outlet and it started dripping away. The entire bag was empty in under an hour and gave me just over three gallons of water.We then took it onto the Appalachian Trail for a long hike. We brought empty water bottles which we used for drinking water. We stopped at the Delaware river, filled the bag, hung it from a tree and filled six 1 liter bottles in 24 minutes. I emptied the bag, rolled it up, and put it in my pack. We then hiked for a few hours and refilled the bag from a different location on the river. We filled up all 6 bottles again as we ate lunch. We hiked again and filled bottles one more time that day.The water was good tasting and very clear. I do have to say, we used pretty clear water to begin with, but it was river water which I would not feel comfortable drinking unless it was a life or death emergency. We did come across a murkier pond but I did not really want to use that water in my nice, new water filtration unit. I do think it would have worked, but I did not want to muck it up testing it.I have a few other portable filtration devices that I normally carry when hiking. They are smaller, more compact. While this unit is pretty compact when rolled up, the capacity is a bit large for when I hike alone. It is quite good for a larger group of hikers.I cleaned the unit when I got back home and dried it out. I then put it away.

"We always seem to be needing just one more lightning cable around here. And the long ones are the favorites. The 10 footer allows me (or any family member) to use the device while it is plugged in. Normally a 3 footer is a bit short as we only have one chair in the house that is directly next to an outlet.

"This is a decent looking case. It has good grip yet still slides easily into and out of my pocket.The case has a front cover, which is nice sometimes. There are many times where I leave my phone on a desk or table and still like some protection for the front glass. This front cover has a metallic slide bar so I can answer the phone without having to open the case. It does not appear to effect the microphone or speaker. The front cover also has a window towards the top where it shows the time and date, it also shows the caller id of any incoming phone calls.You can select menu items through the front window. That feature does not really work for me as I normally lock my phone requiring the touchid or a passcode, so I would have to have the front cover open anyway.My case came in black.

"I do not have a lot of experience with compression socks, so understand I am by no means an expert here. I will say they do seem to work. I tested them on two long hikes on local trails. I have hiked there many times and usually my legs are pretty tired when done. Using these socks I did notice my legs felt much better when I finished hiking. I am assuming it is due to the compression socks not allowing as much blood to pool in my lower legs. Maybe? Not sure of the reason, but I did feel better afterwards.The socks fit well. I used a size Large and they came to just below my knee but fully encompassed my entire calf. I am 6' 1"" and weigh about 220. I did like the fit. The toe and foot area is not as compressive, which is good for me because I do not like compressive or restrictive shoes or socks around my feet. For my lower legs the compression was nice. I did get a little bit of irritation after about 6 hours at the top of the sock on my right leg. I readjusted it and it seemed better. I will continue to wear these as they fit well and seem to help.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVAI9N807SLKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NTTIADS#wasThisHelpful","RVAI9N807SLKV","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With more technology added to our house every year, but no increase in the available electrical outlets, having a two port fast charger makes sense. This unit is a dual 2.4 amp charger so it easily handles large charging loads like IPads and IPhones. It also charges devices safely that draw less current so it is safe for all your devices that charge through a USB port.The orange color makes it easy to find. The finish is a matt orange texture.

"While I normally do not review cardboard boxes, these do make my life easier, therefor deserving of a review.These boxes hold three loaded stripper clips. They keep my range bag neater when I throw in a few dozen boxes on my way to the range. Using the boxes and stripper clips I can reload faster at the range, saving time which I can use for more shooting.The boxes also allow for neater stacking at home. I am a big fan of neat, not in all areas of my life, but definitely in my reloading area. There are some things that demand neatness.I am careful with the boxes and stripper clips because they can be used over and over again.The boxes are shipped flat and need to be assembled.

"I shoot a lot. Good problem to have. Range time can sometimes be long, so I try to do anything I can to minimize my non-shooting time at the range. These stripper clips can be loaded at home saving me plenty of reloading time at the range, which translates into more shooting time.The clips can be loaded bullet by bullet, but as the picture I uploaded shows you can load them directly from the bullet block. Its the block most new bullets come with. Just slide the strip along the base of the bullets to get 5 in. Lift the clip, snug the bullets, then turn it around and slide in another 4 bullets, lift then snug them up, then load the last bullet by hand. Doing it this way I can easily load up a thousand rounds in about 15 minutes or less.I use the boxes from new bullets and save the blocks. When I reload the .223, after case gaging I place the bullets into the blocks to make loading into the stripper clips easy.The loaded strips then go into stripper clip cardboard boxes which hold three clips for a total of thirty rounds. The boxes keep everything neatly stored on your range bag.The stripper clips and boxes are reusable so if you are careful with them they will last you a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PWR1KSLHG6U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXYIGZC#wasThisHelpful","R3PWR1KSLHG6U4","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My desk is a mess. I have an IMac and a PC on it. I also have charging cables connected to both. The problem I have is that I have more than one phone. I have a personal IPhone 6Plus and then I have an IPhone 5S for work. I also have a Bluetooth Jawbone device for the work phone. My ports on the IMac are pretty much full, and reaching behind to swap cables is inconvenient.Here are my main problems, the Jawbone earpiece won't charge connected to the IMac, so it needs to be plugged into a wall socket. The two IPhones will charge connected to the IMac, but then they always update, download pics, etc. Sometimes I just want them charged, not synched.This USB Smart Charger resolves those issues for me. I plug it in, place it on my desk, and now I can charge both IPhones and the Jawbone at the same time. And I also have two spare ports in case I need to charge something else. No more CPU time going towards synching my devices while I try to work. No more having to charge one phone at a time because the IMac can only synch one device at a time.I tested the USB Smart charger for power load and found it can charge 2 Iphones, my Jawbone device, and 2 IPads at the same time. And they charged at a fast rate. The charger did not get noticeably warm. It appears to function perfectly for my needs. This unit is also smaller than my other USB Smart Chargers so I will take it with me when we go on vacation too.I was provided a sample for review purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TUXFU36GVB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG9ZFWM#wasThisHelpful","R32TUXFU36GVB9","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to say I am a bit impressed at the solid construction of this aluminum stand. It has a sturdy feel to it. It is adjustable for angle, making it easily viewable on my desk whether I place it on the low portion of the desk, or up higher near my monitor. The adjustment button is solid and holds well so it will not fall. The rubber feet give it good traction. It is painted with an ""Apple like"" color and texture so while it does not match my IMac perfectly, it is close enough where it does not look out of place next to my monitor.The only negative is that I cannot charge my IPhone 6Plus or IPad while it is sitting upright on this stand. I can turn the device sideways while it charges. If there was room to have the cable attached while sitting upright this stand would be perfect for me.

"Set up for this camera was very easy. I plugged it in, then scanned the barcode with my IPhone, set up the wireless, and starting viewing live video.The cameras 115 degree field of view works well for my application. The daytime, or light feature provides a very good view in color. The IR/nightvision provides a monochromatic view, but gives plenty of detail too.I mounted the camera on a wall. I did have to use a wedge to get the proper camera angle I needed. It would have been nice if I could have rotated the camera head in the holder, but mine did not seem to want to move. Maybe it is not designed to move?After about a week I decided I wanted to hardwire the cameras. I ran Cat5 to each location and now have them connected to a server with NAS attached so I can record video. I used Blue Iris for that. I was able to adjust the sensitivity of the motion detector and also the size of the field. I set up alerts which send out emails if there is motion. It is very handy to be notified when I am away from home. I did have to adjust the sensitivity because I was getting some false alerts due to cloud cover during the day. A 1 second motion trigger works perfectly to avoid that problem.The audio feature works very well to. There is a two way communication feature which was very helpful when my son was looking for something in the garage. I was able to view and talk to him and steer him to the correct drawer for the tool he needed. I think I may have to get a few more of these and put one in the living room so I can tell my dogs to get off the couch. I am sure that will freak them out.Overall this is a very good camera in this price range. Very easy to set up and use.

"Installation was rather easy. I attached the clamp/holder to the stem of my bike, adjusted the angle, then tightened it all down with the supplied Allen wrench. My IPhone 6Plus fit in it easily after depressing the two side buttons to release the side holder arms, then squeezing them tight to close in on the phone to hold it.Having a phone mount is great, especially if I am using the GPS or mapping features of my phone. Having a phone holder that also has back-up battery capacity is even better because now My phone can stay charged for the long rides, even when I have the display lit for the entire ride while using the GPS.Overall this is  a good holder/battery combo for street riding or mild trail use.The only negatives I found were that it came with a micro-USB cable so I had to get an additional cable to use my IPhone, which uses a lightning cable. I also found out that when riding on rough trails the phone can be knocked out of the holder when hitting rocks, bumps, or just going very fast over rough terrain.

This case has a layer of screen protection and it appears that two layers of protection will keep the IPhone from being able to receive tactile input from your fingers. So limit it to one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YERMYMI4OOXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZONX3H0#wasThisHelpful","R2YERMYMI4OOXQ","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not get these glasses to fit well. Initial try had them sitting very lopsided on my face. I laid them on a table and found that one arm was much higher than the other. I was able to bend them and after a few tries got them to sit level.I tried them on again and realized they sit way too high on my face. While wearing them I could look down at maybe a 10 degree angle and I was looking under the glasses. I like a set of safety glasses that touches or almost touches my cheeks to keep projectiles from being able to easily reach my eyes under the glasses.I spent about 15 minutes bending and adjusting the the nose piece. When I was finally able to get the glasses sitting centered on my eyes the nose pieces were actually touching my eyelids. It was a bit uncomfortable and quite distracting.Ok, I know the bridge of my nose is a bit thicker than some. But I usually do not have much of an issue finding glasses that fit me well. So I tried them out on one of my sons. He is 19 years old and has a thinner nose than I do. I spent about 10 minutes readjusting the nose pieces to get a perfect fit for him. He also felt the nose piece came uncomfortably close to his eyes.The glasses arrived in a plastic bag. No case or cleaning cloth. I thought they might be a good, inexpensive set of safety glasses to keep for the times I have other shooters joining me that do not have gear. I think these might be good glasses fo hot climates because they sit so far off your face and could work well as sunglasses, but for shooting safely they do not work for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JEUUVMYY22V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OTK0WRS#wasThisHelpful","R1JEUUVMYY22V","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first thoughts were that this would be great for camping and cooking breakfast on my Weber charcoal grill. I thought it would get put into my ""camping"" bin. Only to be pulled out once a year. But now that I have it I realize it is be useful for so much more.We cook outdoors a lot around here. This griddle opens a another avenue for us. Bacon is usually an issue at our house. We sometimes cook large amounts of it, and when the AC is on and the house is closed up, the bacon smell really stinks up the house. Cooking it outdoors is a much better solution. Sausages and peppers is another great thing to cook outdoors. I can grill the sausage and use the griddle for the peppers and onions.This fits very nicely onto the grate of my Weber OTG. It also fits nicely in my XL Big Green Egg. But I also used it to fry up onions and mushrooms on my propane Weber while I grilled burgers on the other side of the grill.This is a well made, heavy duty piece of stainless steel. I expect it to last a long time. The only negative thing I have found, and its minor and more of a problem the way I am using it as opposed to a design issue, is that the trough which catches liquids, can really fill up and be a bit hard to empty carefully if you cook a large amount of greasy food, like a few pounds of bacon. Don't ask me how I know this. To avoid a spill, just get in the habit of emptying it sooner, not later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11BK0F5AVWF5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VGM012#wasThisHelpful","R11BK0F5AVWF5X","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few different pizza peels. I built a pizza oven in my yard a few years ago, so you tend to collect pizza related items after that. I do have to say I prefer a wooden pizza peel for preparing my pizzas. The pizzas seem to stick less to a wooden surface (coated with flour) and since they stick less, they have less of a tendency to stretch or distort horribly as I try to slide them into the oven. This is an issue especially since I really prefer thin crust pizza which are more fragile in the un-cooked state.I also prefer an aluminum peel with a long handle for rotating the pizzas and removing them once cooked. The longer handle keeps my arms from getting burnt and the thin aluminum slides right under the pizza.This wooden peel is quite sturdy and has a decent beveled edge to slide under the pizza. It works great as a pizza prep station and the pizzas slide off it into the oven quite easily. Once the pizza has cooked a bit this peel slips easily under the pizza so you can spin it for a more evn cook. It also works well for removing the pizza once fully cooked.I normally slide the cooked pizza onto a cutting board to let it sit for a minute before I slice it. This wooden peel could be used as a cutting surface too. I would stick to a plastic pizza cutting wheel because a metal one with too much pressure could scratch or gouge the peels face causing imperfections that could cause the pizza to stick. I like a smooth, mark free peel for my pizzas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R297TUQYKOF0QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T06WILE#wasThisHelpful","R297TUQYKOF0QK","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We purchased two of these lamps to replace some older units that sat on our nightstands for years. I wanted touch lamps because its sometimes hard fumbling for the on/off switch in the dark. I like that I can just touch anywhere on the base to turn the light on and then touch it again to adjust the brightness.  The lamps are medium sized which works perfectly for our bedroom and nightstands. No need to have giant lamps taking up a lot of space.  The brightness levels are good, the brightest could be a touch brighter, but overall I like these a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEBU4OJN4XXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOZ322Q#wasThisHelpful","R3UEBU4OJN4XXM","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I normally do not clean the primer pockets on my pistol brass. I tumble it all and then throw it on the progressive press where it gets de-capped and processed into shootable brass again. That changed when I started loading large quantities of .45 brass. With LPP and SPP primer hard to separate 100%, I decided to de-cap the .45 brass first. That makes sorting for primer size much, much easier.Since I was de-capping first, I might as well clean the primer pockets a bit before tumbling. This tool does a good job of cleaning them. I do not get it perfectly clean, just knocking out the major dirt/tarnich/carbon. I then let the tumbler handle the rest. A simple twist in the primer pocket is enough. My primer pockets come out much cleaner and that makes loading a bit easier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OW5LNCYWQDRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SF6QQW#wasThisHelpful","R3OW5LNCYWQDRX","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a fan of tempered glass screen protectors after seeing my friend drop his phone on the face and the screen protector shattered, but the glass on his phone was unharmed. I like glass much better than the feel of the plastic screen protectors. The idea of a ""sacrificial"" glass protector is great, especially for an IPhone 6 Plus, cause I don't even want to know how much that will cost to replace a broken screen.Installation was rather easy. This kit came with the tools to complete the job and easy instructions. The tools were a cleaning pad, lifting tape, and a soft cloth.

"This grill gripper is handy for removing an empty grill rack off my Big Green Egg or Weber grill. The angle it grips the grill at is kind of awkward. I can use an overhand grip or underhand grip, but both feel a bit awkward. Not really too big of a problem because I normally only use this to move the hot grill rack to the side so I can add more charcoal. I only have to hold it for a few seconds, so the awkward grip is not too bad.The finish is a rough, chrome appearance with some sharpish edges.

"There are two ways to clean the ash from your egg that I know of. One is to remove the grates and clean it from the top. The second is to pull the ashes out through the bottom door using something like this ash tool. Since I only remove the grates and plate setter to add more charcoal, I like to go with the second option of pulling the ash out the front door. I do that for most cleanings because it is easy, and if you are using a good lump charcoal you really do not get that much ash anyway.The second thing that I like this ash tool for is to slip it into the front door during a long cook to tap and unblock any holes in my lower grate that may be getting blocked with charcoal and ash.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L7XEMNWB6GL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV7UPI0#wasThisHelpful","R1L7XEMNWB6GL2","ANFJYYQ0P35CW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANFJYYQ0P35CW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think it is really working, everytime I use it, I think my neck is looking a little better. I am also using this under my eyes and on my chest. I have an open heart surgery scar and I think it is overall making my skin look younger, smoother and firmer. I really highly recommend this one if you have a similiar issue.I received my firming cream during the product launch promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZ6V9J6G21IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0PDMA0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZ6V9J6G21IT","AW0L3PCD6COJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW0L3PCD6COJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the Heavy Duty Scouring Scrubber Dish Cloth for Dishes and Cast Iron by The Crown Choice. OK, so we all need scouring scrubbers for our cast iron and stuck on messes. I have tried many many different versions and types. I love my cast iron skillets and glass baking dishes. I hate the cleanup though. It isn`t so bad if you have something good to clean them with, it makes all the difference really.So I have tried metal scrubbers, they eventually rust and can be hard to clean themselves. I have tried many nylon scrubbers and the design causes them to get food stuck in between and inside that never comes off.These are different, they are thin like a wash cloth. They have the same scrubbing power as any of the others that I have tried, but they don`t rust and they don`t get stuck on food in them. Ureka, they are just right, they offer exactly what is needed to clean cast iron and stuck on foods without trapping the gunk. They are very well made, they are not going to unravel, these are going to last a very long time.I received my awesome Scrubber Cloths for free during the product launch promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6XFEDVM4II9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016EADSKS#wasThisHelpful","RS6XFEDVM4II9","AW0L3PCD6COJ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AW0L3PCD6COJ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the Suncreen ""Protectan"": Innovative Moisturizer Daily Sunblock with Broad Spectrum Formula Uv for Thermalabs. Another great product from Thermalabs, they just keep coming with the good stuff.I have to wear sunscreen any time I go out because of a medical condition, even if I go out just for a couple of minutes, because the sun can trigger my condition. Sunscreen should be really important to everyone, the older we get the more we understand and realize how dangerous it can be. Not only do I have a medical condition, but my Husband has had skin cancer 3 times now. So we both wear sunscreen eveyday and try to tell our grown children to do the same. WIth that being said, I use termalabs tanning products to try to have a little color on my skin, everything that I have tried so far has been great quality. I was really glad to see that they have formulated a sunscreen as well.It feels good going on the skin, very silky and smooth, nothing oily about it. It does make my skin look shiny though, a great moisturizer as well as protection from the UV rays. It has SPF 30 and is water resistant up to 40 minutes, then should be reapplied. It has a very mild scent and is very pleasant. This is a nice big 5 ounce tube.

"Have you ever had professional framing done? It can cost a small fortune, and I've paid hundreds of dollars for custom frames MUCH smaller than the 24x36 size of this one. But when I wanted to frame a $5 art poster that I happened to love, I turned to Amazon for something a lot more affordable. Honestly, I was very hesitant to order a frame of this size at such a low price point, for fear that what I would receive would be absolute crap. But after reading so many favorable reviews, I decided to take a chance and I was glad that I did... if you keep your expectations calibrated to the price point of this frame, it's a five star buy. Here's what you should expect:First, do not expect to receive a five star quality frame of this size for less than $50. That's totally unrealistic. But you will get a good quality frame in which the compromises made to achieve this price point are all within reason. Just the specially designed, heavy duty corrugated packaging to ship this frame and have it arrived undamaged--which mine did--must cost quite a lot.Second, the frame itself is light beige MDF (medium density fiberboard), which is a very sturdy choice, and its surface has a vinyl covering in either the wood grain or solid color that you ordered. This may sound ""cheap"" but the result actualy looks very good--I ordered ""Espresso Brown"" and it's indistiguishable from the brown/black wood color of some IKEA shelving that surrounds it. The naked eye would not know that it's not real wood.Third, the shipping box is labeled ""GLASS"" in bold letters on all sides, but that's only to insure that the shippers will handle the box with great care. Smart move by Art To Frames! You would never get glass of this size at this price point, nor would you want it due to issues with weight, fragility and the greenish color cast of cheaper glass. What you do receive is crystal-clear acryllic, which has better clarity and greater scratch resistance than the polystyrene material often used by even cheaper frames of this size. The acryllic sheet will look AWFUL out of the box, until you remove the clear protective film layers on both sides of the sheet before mounting, which protect against scratches. Both sides of my acryllic sheet were completely scratch free, once I had removed the film and cleaned both sides of it with paper towels and Windex.Fourth, mounting is very straight-forward: put the acryllic sheet in the frame, lay the poster on top of it, secure it with the included corrugated cardboard backing sheet, then fold down metal tabs positioned all around the backing sheet to hold it tightly in place. This is an inexpensive solution, but it gets the job done. If the poster you're framing has any signifcant value, you're going to want to replace the corrugated backing board that comes with this frame with an acid-free archival backing board from your local art supply.Finally, you attach the hanging hardware, which is included as a complete set, including wire and wall hanger... nice touch! As a guide, my poster hangs horizontally (the longest sides are top and bottom), and I found that screwing the hangers into the frame 9 inches from the top gave me a really nice ""hang"" with the frame laying completely flat against the wall.One warning: I would avoid using the supplied hanging wire, or I would strip the plastic coating from it. Here's why: when you've threaded hanging wire through the hanger loop, the traditional way to secure it is to repeatedly twist the end of the wire tightly against itself. This seeemed to work fine with the supplied wire until I did a security test before actually hanging the poster on the wall. When I lifted the frame from the center of the wire, as it would be when hanging on a wall, the plastic coating on the wire proved too slippery and the twisted ends began slipping out. This would ultimately send your frame crashing to the floor or whatever was below it.  So, you can either strip the coating from the supplied wire, or buy uncoated hanging wire at your local hardware store. I happened to have some uncoated wire, which quickly solved the problem.All in all, I'm thrilled with the way my framed poster looks on my wall, and it has exceeded all my expectations at the price point.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find in helpful in making a buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGFF9ESWJBM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038JUBJK#wasThisHelpful","R2EGFF9ESWJBM1","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ella & Louis and its follow-up, Again, are two of my favorite jazz albums of all time. After buying various remasters over the years, I thought I had made a ""final purchase"" when I bought the SACDs from Analogue Productions. The sound quality, I felt, was absolute perfection, and all the more astonishing for a mono recording from the late 50s. The voices of Ella and Louis had a palpable presence in my living room, utterly natural sounding and convincingly right there. Instruments had the unmistakable weight, timbre and texture that they do when played live in a real space.So if I had reached audio nirvana, why bother buying this blu-ray? Good question. First, and most importantly, it contains all 19 songs from Again compared to just 9 songs on the SACD. (Many versions of Again are similarly truncated.) So the ability to have both albums complete on one disc was very appealing, especially at a price under $30. The SACDs, by comparison, are $30 each and contain 10 fewer songs. Second, there was the possibility that UMG had managed to wring even higher sound quality from the original master tapes, though I wasn't sure how that would be possible. Nevertheless, it seemed worth checking out.Well, enough with the preamble, let me get to the conclusion and explain from there: it didn't take much comparison to realize that, in terms of sound quality, the APO SACDs blow this Pure Audio Blu-ray away. The Blu-ray is a very nice recording. The SACDs are the unmistakable sound of real singers and real instruments in a live space. The difference is just that simple, and is not subtle or nuanced at all.Some caveats about this conclusion: if you only owned this Pure Audio Blu-Ray, you might be perfectly happy with it, unaware of its shortcomings without a clearly superior remastering against which to compare it. That said, I'm still happy that I purchased it for the 10 additional songs on Again.Also keep in mind that the superiority of the SACDs isn't going to matter if you're not set-up for SACD playback of the pure DSD stream. Otherwise you're left with the CD layer of this hybrid disc, which is simply not as good. Finally, I wanted to mention the playback system used for this comparison:For the Analogue Productions SACDs, it's an Oppo BDP-95 feeding the pure DSD signal via analog XLR to the passive pre-amp section of a Theta Gen VIII processor, then out via XLR to a Spectron Musician III Amp and Gallo Reference 3.5 speakers. All cables and interconnects are Cardas Golden Reference. For the blu-ray, it's much the same, except the Oppo is feeding a lossless, 24/96 PCM 2.0 signal into the Theta Gen VIII for decoding, then out via balanced XLR to the amp and speakers.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EQQF6WHI6HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW7FCPS#wasThisHelpful","R24EQQF6WHI6HA","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The MFSL SACD of Modern Cool, which I own, has enjoyed a long reputation as an audiophile classic. But I've actually never been a huge fan of it. To my ears, it has a very big, showy, demo disc kind of sound that might be great for impressing friends with your system, but it doesn't sound like the real thing at all, and I go frequently to hear live jazz in NYC clubs. In particular, I've never heard the bass so totally dominate the sound of a jazz group the way it does on the MFSL disc and, in general, the images of Barber's voice and other instruments are too big and unnatural. To be clear: I'm not saying that the MFSL sounds bad, because it doesn't, but if you like your jazz recordings to sound natural and live, it will prove to be disappointing.I wasn't aware that a Pure Audio Blu-ray of Modern Cool had been out there for a while, but I bought it immediately once I discovered the disc, hoping that it would be an improvement over the MFSL because I'm such a fan of the music on Modern Cool. I'm happy to say this purchase was worth every cent because the blu-ray addresses my main issues with the MFSL. Barber's voice is much more focused and natural sounding, as if she's performing live in my living room, as opposed to this huge image of her voice that occupied 2/3 of the space between my speakers. Similarly, the images of instruments are more focused and natural, as the Blu-Ray trades the showy, demo quality of the MSFL for a sound that's more like the real thing across the board. Lastly, the bass has been significantly tamed, and while I still find it a bit on the dominant side, it now sounds much more properly integrated with Barber's voice and the rest of the instruments.FWIW, Stereophile also preferred the sound of the blu-ray over the MFSL, and mostly for the same reasons I've noted above. So if you're as much of a fan of Modern Cool as I am, this is the version you simply must own. In case you're wondering about my playback system: for the MFSL SACD, it's an Oppo BDP-95 feeding the pure DSD signal via analog XLR to the passive pre-amp section of a Theta Gen VIII processor, then out via XLR to a Spectron Musician III Amp and Gallo Reference 3.5 speakers. All cables and interconnects are Cardas Golden Reference. For the blu-ray, it's much the same, except the Oppo is feeding a lossless, 24/192 PCM stereo signal into the Theta Gen VIII for decoding, then out via balanced XLR to the amp and speakers.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AN3J5B223JLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00802EYDO#wasThisHelpful","R1AN3J5B223JLX","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who knows how many shower radios I've gone through over the years? I lost count a long time ago, and I can't remember a single one of 'em as being more than just ""adequate."" Then, several years ago, I bought this Sangean H201 and have thoroughly enjoyed it during my daily shower ever since.Right out of the box, there's a high quality look and feel to this radio that impresses you--you know immediately that this is not your run-of-the-mill piece of consumer electronics junk. The reason for its higher price tag is more than evident. The design, especially the pale amber/orange illuminated display, is really elegant and features fine ergonomics. And you'll love the intelligent thought behind the hook system for hanging this radio from your showerhead.Radio reception is outstanding. I like listening to AM news radio when showering in the morning, and this is flat-out the best AM reception and sound that I've ever heard from any radio, bar none. And I say that as a resident of New York City, where AM reception is often terrible. FM reception and sound quality are also excellent.The single speaker on this Sangean may look small and and unassuming, but it will impress you with the clarity of its sound quality. And years of being in the damp environment of my shower hasn't diminished that sound quality at all.Battery life is so long from 2 D-cells, it's ridiculous. I find myself wondering all the time how it could still be running on batteries I haven't changed for as long as I can remember. And then there are the host of other conveniences: LED flashlight, 10 presets, a timed power-off option and accurate digital tuning.Last, but definitely not least, keep in mind that this Sangean is not just water resistant but is actually waterproof, and meets the tough JIS7 waterproofing standard. You can even drop it into the water without worries--it floats.So, given this glowing review, could there possibly be another radio you should consider? Actually, yes. In 2013, Sangean released the H202 as the follow-up to this model, although the H201 remains current, as well. The 202 seems essentially the same except for an improved LED flashlight and the addition of bluetooth streaming capability--for which you'll pay about 33% more. Neither of the new features is important to me and, since I've never used the 202 myself, I can't say for certain if it truly is ""essentially the same"" in build quality and performance.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SSQ7RU3L5ZUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I3F91O#wasThisHelpful","R1SSQ7RU3L5ZUW","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat became obsessed with drinking from the sink, so I bought the Drinkwell fountain in hopes of changing that habit. Unfortunately, after just a few days, he ignored the fountain and was back at the sink. I deducted no stars for this, however, as cats are notoriously finicky on an individual basis, so there are never any guarantees--I simply mention it to advise those in a similar situation and thinking about buying this fountain that it may not be the solution you're seeking.The real problem, in a word, and the reason for the two stars is this: cleaning. The instructions emphasize the absolute necessity of a thorough cleaning every two weeks to ward off all manner of dire consequences for which Drinkwell will not be responsible if you fail to do it. Fair enough. Both the pump and the fountain, itself, must be cleaned, using special brushes for the task. So are those brushes included to perform this essential cleaning? No, you'll have to pay an extra nine dollars here on Amazon to get them from Drinkwell, but not so fast: read the reviews, and most say the brushes are absolute crap, and to save your money. So you're left to improvise cleaning tools, and even then it's virtually impossible to clean the muck from some cracks and crevices.If the above does not dissuade you from buying this fountain, then I suggest you get the version with the ""Bonus 50-Ounce Reservoir"" so you have a 100-ounce total capacity. Here's why: if the water fails to main a certain level, you can damage or destroy the pump, and you'll be surprised how quickly the level can drop due to the combination of your pet drinking and evaporation. The extra reservoir will give you peace of mind about the water level. Yes, this version does cost more, but is still significantly less than buying the reservoir separately. You'll find it here on Amazon as ""PetSafe Original Fountain wiht Bonus 50-Ounce Reservoir."" Note that PetSafe and Drinkwell are the same product.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find in helpful in making a buying decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26LBUBR2S6SXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00063446M#wasThisHelpful","R26LBUBR2S6SXS","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First thing to know: I deducted no stars (obviously) because these didn't fit my Bergan Turbo Track. I really dislike reviews that downgrade a product for not doing something that it never claimed to do. I just didn't want others to make the same mistake I did, following another review here that states these illuminated balls are perfect replacements for Bergan. They are not, they are actually smaller and don't ""lock"" into the track, so my cat was able to bat them out almost immediately, swat them under a sofa and... well, you know how it goes with cats.  ;-)However, both balls worked perfectly, and the illumination was actually brighter and much more sparkly than my Bergan ball ever was when brand new. Since I have to rate based on my own experience with them, these get five stars for being exactly what they're supposed to be, but you also can't ignore reviews where reliability has been a problem, either right out of the package or shortly thereafter.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1NHCLRWUVYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057XF9R4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1NHCLRWUVYD","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether it's food for myself or my cat, I want the purest choice possible, free of chemicals, additives and fillers. This made it tough to find a treat I could feel good about giving my cat, since many had a paragraph long list of ""ingredients."" No thanks!Thankfully, I found PureBites here on Amazon, and food seriously doesn't get any more pure than this: one ingredient, freeze-dried chicken, USDA inspected. This is a healthy treat that's high in protein, low in calories... and my cat loves them! From one room away, he can now hear the sound of me handling the bag and comes running.Unfortunately... and despite the five star review... I can't guarantee that your cat will love them, too. Why not? Hey, we're talking CATS... who are notoriously finicky on an individual basis... so who knows? :-)  But based on the overall reviews, I'd say the odds are in your favor.One final tip: if you're cat enjoys these treats, start buying them in the 11.5 ounce size for dogs which you'll find here: http://amzn.to/SLNnss They are MUCH cheaper this way and exactly the same product, except the pieces are larger, so you'll have to break them up a bit.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a purchase decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBBNEKVSMVDS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MECZUA#wasThisHelpful","RBBNEKVSMVDS6","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leave it to Oxo to take a simple product like a kitchen utensil holder and smartly reinvent it in not one, but THREE different models! So while I liked this one enough to buy two of them, only YOU can decide which model suits the particular storage needs of your kitchen.The three models are alike in these ways: Stainless Steel and plastic construction Large capacity for about 16 large-handle utensils 3 separate compartments to organize utensils however you wish Easy clean-up of compartments when needed All three sell for the same priceWhere the models mostly differ is in their shape, and deciding which one will depend on your design taste and where you plan to store the holder: I prefer the aesthetics of this elliptical shape, it fits my countertop space well, and the tapered height of the side compartments allow shorter utensils to stick up more prominently in the holder, and not get lost amidst taller ones. The circular version of this holder rotates on a ball-bearing base, giving you access to all your tools in spaces that might be especially tight. The rectangular version doesn't appeal to me, personally, but it's perfect for storage space best-suited to that shape.SO this is a rare five star review that doesn't insist that this product is the best because Oxo has given us three different ""bests"" from which to choose!

"As described on this product page and initially, in actual use, the Brabantia Napoleon Corkscrew seems just about perfect. Heavy duty construction, built-in foil cutters (good but finicky to position properly), general ease of operation, and a stand-up design for storage when not in use. I mostly had no complaints.And then, one night, I pulled a cork from a bottle, started drinking with dinner guests, and forgot about the cork in the Brabantia until the next morning. It was mission impossible when I tried to eject it. The now dried cork was jammed in the mechanism and simply would not budge. I had to get a knife and start cutting the cork off of the corkscrew, piece by piece, which wasn't easy and leaves the hand holding the Brabantia while cutting in a very precarious position.Now, I could have written this off just as a weird, one-time accident, except that it has happened on two more occasions when I've forgotten to eject the cork from the Brabantia until the next day. And both additional times, I had to go through the same worrisome cutting procedure to remove it.I will say that this corkscrew works fine when you eject the cork from the mechanism promptly, which is what normally happens, but leaving it until the next day should not be the problem that it is. Deducting three stars for this flaw may seem excessive, but I felt the risk in doing serious injury to your hand warranted it, and I would not buy this product again.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBOZCHGZ1KZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RE785O#wasThisHelpful","R2QBOZCHGZ1KZU","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You'll find many reviews here that will tell you how awesome this little power strip is for travel. And it is. But that wasn't my need when I went searching for it.I needed three more outlets to plug into my A/V system power center, but didn't have the space for even a regular office power strip. The super tight confines of my equipment rack meant that the strip had to have a super short (but still three-prong) cord and outlets configured in the minimal amount of space. To be honest, I didn't think such a product existed until I found the Monster OT G400. It was absolutely perfect!While its compact size will impress you first, it's the high quality at this price that will really blow you away. Both the cable and plug are clearly heavy duty, while the thin profile of the strip itself, with two outlets per side, is an ingenious design. And since I was adding A/V equipment with a low power draw, I had no fears of overtaxing the power center that I extended by plugging this strip into it, turning a single outlet into four.Kudos to Monster for not only creating the best travel power strip on the market, but also the perfect strip for any power need in which limited space is an issue.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOHLDUFFWFES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F9YN2M#wasThisHelpful","RMOHLDUFFWFES","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the slick, unique look of this flat USB to Lightning cable, and its 10-inch length is offered by virtually no one else. (And why not?!) It's perfect for situations where the 3-4 inch cables that various companies make are TOO short, but the jump to a one meter length is too long. For me, it was exactly the right length for running a cable to my iPhone 5s (running iOS 7) in my car.Out of the box, the first thing I noticed was that the Lightning connector is slightly fatter than on my ""Apple certified"" cables. And I do mean slightly, because it still fits, but requires just a bit of force that's normally not needed, and doesn't seat with the same firm ""click"" of a certified cable.The second thing I noticed was that it didn't work--I was getting an ""unsupported"" message on my car's indicator when I tried to play music stored on my iPhone, which worked perfectly with a longer length of an Amazon Basics cable. But after unplugging/replugging this cable a few times from both my car and the phone, it began working reliably. Now, every once in a while, that message will come up again, but a quick unplug/replug will solve it--so it's not a huge issue. And given the choice between THAT, or going back to a sloppy looking one meter cable in the car, I'll put up with the occasional inconvenience for the neater look.I did wonder if that slightly larger connector would end up compromising the fit of certified connectors in my iPhone, but that hasn't happened after months of use. At this point, I'd say it's a non-issue.I've had this cable in my car through one of the worst winters in memory in the Northeast, an environment of freezing temps and then heat when driving, but no cracking or fraying of the cable so far.This would be an easy five star recommendation if Innovative was manufacturing this cable to Apple Certified specs, as Amazon and some other companies do for their cables. Unfortunately, they don't, so while this cable has pretty much performed to my satisfaction, I've deducted two stars for the Lightning connector that's clearly out-of-spec, and the occasionally buggy performance.Also, despite the small number of reviews for this cable, I cannot ignore (and neither should you!) the percentage of reviewers complaining about quality issues, especially fraying. This is not a good sign, and makes the purchase of this cable more of a coin toss. Fortunately, Amazon has great return policies!Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25J4XPDMWZYU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GT26WBO#wasThisHelpful","R25J4XPDMWZYU6","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a five-star cable for both its high-quality construction and flawless performance, even in the most demanding HD video applications. No, it's not as slick looking as the Monster MC 1000HD version, but it actually has better specs than the Monster and costs less than one-fifth the price. This is a no brainer decision if ever there was one, and a bargain to boot.BUT if you need an HDMI cable with one elbow connection like this one, you MUST also know if you need a 90 degree or 270 degree elbow (Cable Matters makes both kinds), which will depend on the connection at your TV or other A/V equipment. Here's how to find out which one you needFirst, take a close-up look at the HDMI elbow connection on this 90 degree cable. See how one side of the gold connector is slightly tapered and narrower than the other side? See how the narrower side is oriented towards the cable itself? This is a 90 degree elbow. If you look at the 270 degree elbow, you'll see that it looks exactly the same except the narrower side of the connector is oriented away from the cable. Why is this important? Here's whyTake a look at the female HDMI connection that you plan to use on your TV or A/V device. Note which way the narrower side is oriented--is it in the same direction you want the cable to go or in the opposite direction? If it's in the same direction, choose a 90 degree elbow if it's the opposite direction, choose a 270 degree. For example, I was using an HDMI connection on the side of my flat panel TV and I wanted the cable to go towards the back of the set. On the set's female connection, the narrower portion was oriented towards the back of the set so I chose the 90 degree elbow. If it had been oriented towards the front of the set, the 270 degree cable would have been the right choice.What happens if you make a mistake? The connections will still fit just fine, but you'll be left with a cable that's running opposite of the direction you want. This info can be a bit confusing, but hopefully what I've described is understandable.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZAEN8AR97T1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBF2FR4#wasThisHelpful","R1ZAEN8AR97T1L","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is Oxo's second try at a covered ice cube tray. I previously bought the first version (which is still being sold at half the price of this new one), and while I thought it was the best of what was out there, it was still prone to spills and therefore messy to refill. But as they say, ""if you don't succeed at first..."" and Oxo has delivered ice cube tray perfection this time around. Seriously--if you need ice cube trays then just stop reading now and go buy this. But for those who'd like to know why it's so great, I'll tell you:1) The anti-spill lid works easily and exactly as advertised: fill the tray, smooth the lid down with your hand, tilt the tray to pour off excess water and you're ready to go. It simply does not leak after that, even when you tilt it beyond Oxo's recommended maximum angle. Honestly, I questioned if this system really could work, and it's like watching a magic trick. Very impressive solution!2) The silicone lid protects against evaporation and freezer odors, lifts easily when you need to get cubes, and reseals the tray just as easily.3) The new lid gives the trays a lower height than other trays, so you can stack more in the same amount of space. I can now fit five trays in the same space where I could only fit four of the old Oxo trays. Also, the ability to store a newly filled tray at an angle give you additional options for more storage.4) The no spill system also works well if you just want to partly refill a tray to replace a few missing cubes.Bottom Line: this tray is the next best thing to having an automatic ice maker. If there's a way to improve it, I have no idea what that would be.

"I've seen the U.S. version of this film about a half dozen times in theaters. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan. But I've been wondering if, as some have suggested, it's a ""dumbed down"" edit for American audiences compared to the longer Hong Kong release. So when this Blu-ray's launch date was delayed, I decided to buy the HK version and I was surprised by the differences in ways I did not expect at all.Let me start with the bad news first: if you're a fan of the film, you really need to own both versions. Both have important strengths, and neither one is a wholly satisfying substitute for the other. BUT if you forced me to pick just one, I'd have to say the U.S. release would be it, and that's not the conclusion I expected to reach. Here are the pros and cons of each:HK PROS:1) It fully fleshes out a few characters who have been edited down to cardboard cutouts in the American release. In particular, you'll be astonished at how much more there is to the stories of The Razor, Madame Ip and Ding Lianshan (the guy who only shows up in the cigarette lighting scene with Ip in the U.S. version.)2) There is just a little more background information to many things throughout the film, which makes for a more complete story.HK CONS:1) It eliminates the amazing scenes of Gong Er, both as a child and an adult, practicing martial arts in the snow!!! These are some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie, and I was shocked to find them gone in the longer version.2) It doesn't mention that Ip Man trained Bruce Lee! Again, I was shocked, since this is such a key revelation in the U.S. release, and it brings Ip's story full circle. Maybe the assumption was that Asian audiences would just know this.3) The HK version just doesn't feel as taut and powerful as the U.S. release. Yes, this is a very subjective comment, but I thought the longer lengths of just about everything in the film left the pacing feeling sluggish and ""off"" by comparison.HK DIFFERENCES (not pro or con, just different from U.S.)1) The U.S. release focuses on Gong Er's later opium addiction, and is clear that she died from it. The HK version mentions but doesn't focus on the addiction, and is vague about whether she died from it it's presented as just one possibility rather than a certainty. I'm not sure which version is the more accurate.2) Gong Er is more focused on vengeance in the HK version.3) In the key early scene where Ip Man breaks the cake in the hand of the Northern Grandmaster, Ip says something very different after breaking it than he does in the U.S. version.U.S. PROS:1) Ultimately, while you lose what I've mentioned above in this edited version, the editing makes for a tighter, better paced and more powerful film. And this is why I'd pick this release if I could only choose one.2) There's a difference in the scoring of the U.S. version (though not a new score)--probably driven by the differences in editing--and it also contributes to the U.S. release being more powerful.3) It contains the unmissable scenes of Gong Er practicing in the snow.4) It contains the important info about Bruce Lee.U.S. CONS:1) Poor development of a few important characters (see above)2) Less background info throughout (but the story is still completely understandable)Well, there you have it!

"UPDATE OCT '14: The Aquarius has dropped significantly in price since my original review, and is actually slightly cheaper now than the older Ultra. So, with prices so comparable, which unit should you buy? Unless you're really in love with the updated look of the Aquarius, the Ultra still remains the better choice for the reasons I mention below. Also take a look at the video in the ""Most Helpful Favorable Review,"" where you can really see the cheap construction of the Aquarius, and how sloppily the hose holsters into the unit compared to the Ultra. This sort of negates its one advantage--the cleaner-looking design--and you'll be wrangling to holster that hose on a daily basis. No thanks!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let me not waste your time and cut right to the chase: if you're thinking about buying your first Waterpik flosser--or wondering if it's time to upgrade your Ultra model--there's only one reason to consider the pricey WP-660 Aquarius: it looks nicer and more modern than the now dated design of the Ultra. So if appearance isn't important to you, stop reading right here and just go buy the cheaper Ultra, which (as I'll get to in a moment) is better in just about every other way.As it so happens, an attractive, modern design IS important to me, especially in an appliance that I'm going to look at all the time in my bathroom. But even in this regard I'd say the Aquarius is good but not great. It is definitely NOT an improvement in design that will have you looking past its ergonomic flaws vs. the Ultra.First, the on/off water flow switch is less user friendly in operation than the on/off button on the Ultra. Admittedly, there were issues with button failure at one time on the Ultra, but the replacement handle I received from Waterpik has been working for over a year now with no problems, so this seems to have been resolved.Second, getting the handle and hose ""re-holstered"" on the Aquarius is more finicky than it is on the Ultra--plus the hose never seems to sit in the unit as neatly.Third, the Aquarius weighs significantly less than the Ultra, and you can't help but think that the weight was trimmed by using a lighter and less durable pump mechanism. Time will tell if that's really the case, but I've also found that the lightness of the Aquarius causes it to shift around too easily on my bathroom counter.Fourth, only two tips can be stored in the unit vs. all the tips being storable in the Ultra's lid. Waterpik has probably learned that its customers are fine with more limited tip storage, but again, this is no step forward.Fifth, the dual modes on the Aquarius--which could be seen as its only real advance vs. the single mode Ultra--are just a marketing gimmick. If you just want to massage your gums with the Ultra, simply dial down the water flow pressure and massage away. There's no need for a special mode to do this.Bottom line: water flossing is a mature technology, and there are few if any ""functional"" reasons to introduce a new model. So it's a shame that Waterpik didn't make more of an effort to at least achieve better ergonomics in a killer new design with the Aquarius. You can pay 20%+ more than the Ultra and get the somewhat nicer looking but ergonomically inferior Aquarius. Or you can just buy the Ultra and not bother to upgrade if you already own it. Both units will give you the same 5-star flossing ability. The Ultra will let you hang onto some extra cash while doing it.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision!","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLBDMDPXWF17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQQ0VU#wasThisHelpful","RLLBDMDPXWF17","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"World's Best Cat Litter has a lot to recommend it--which I'll get to in a moment--but if odor control is a top priority for you, then I'd suggest you look elsewhere. Fortunately for me, at least for now, odor control is not a big issue: I have a four-month old kitten who eats only dry food, so this is a best case scenario when it comes to potential litter box odor problems. And yet, I'd say that ""World's Best"" is barely okay at managing the minimal odor control that I need. I wouldn't want to be facing a more challenging situation, and I'll probably have to switch to another brand once my kitten is full grown.For now, however, I really appreciate that World's Best is a corn-based litter that is both flushable and biodegradable. I like its natural smell out of the bag, as well as its minimal dust and outstanding clumping abilities. For these reasons, I intend to keep using it, until my nose knows that it's time to switch brands. If you haven't used World's Best before, but are thinking about trying it, I'd suggest getting a smaill bag as a trial, especially if you think that odor might be a problem. The fact that ""World's Best"" now makes an ""Advanced Performance Formula"" of this litter (at a MUCH higher price)--in addition to various scented and multiple cat formulas--indicates to me that even they know that this original formula doesn't quite do the job.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a purchasing decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10WYL9FC3H9CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZPX70I#wasThisHelpful","R10WYL9FC3H9CF","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big wine guy, and for many years I unhesitatingly recommended the basic plastic Screwpull to friends as the best and easiest wine opener on the market. After over a decade of heavy use, mine broke last year, and I replaced it with a new, all-metal Screwpull model--which proceeded to break in 2 months. Under warranty? Sure. All I had to do was ship it to Great Britain at my own expense with my original sales receipt! As I read various online reviews, I found that many people felt that Screwpull quality had really slipped in recent years, so I decided to search for another brand and ended up buying the Vacu Vin Twister.After more than a full year of heavy use, it has become my new recommendation to friends and I can confidently rate it five stars. In design and operation, the two-piece Twister is very similar to the old Screwpull, which is a good thing: you simply place what I'll call the ""bottle brace"" portion around the neck of your wine bottle, and then twist in the corkscrew piece (which is automatically guided into proper position by the brace) and just keep turning--it twists into the cork, and then pulls the cork out in one continuous motion. Amost nothing could be easier. One important difference from the Screwpull is that the Twister has rubber pads that brace against the bottle--these can make it just a bit more finicky to get it fitted over the neck, but the pads provide a much more secure grip on the bottle once you do.I suppose one could argue that those ""lever-type"" openers like the Rabbit take speed and ease-of-use one step further, but they are so much bigger, heavier and more expensive. Honestly, unless you're routinely opening a half-dozen bottles of wine or more at a time, I find the lever openers to be overkill.So, whether you're a wine geek like me or just someone who opens an occasional bottle, I'd say the Vacu Vin Twister is the best overall wine opener on the market now--and at the Amazon price, it's a bargain to boot!

"I wrote a scathing, early review of the first generation Paperwhite that readers found to be one of the most helpful critical assessments. The unevenness of the lighting and weird color casts on the screen drove me crazy. A return didn't help, as the replacement was even worse. To be fair, others seemed to think these issues were no big deal, so these were problems that were literally in the eyes of the beholder. But for me, that first gen unit fell far short of what Amazon promised with the lighting, and that opinion was shared by many who had purchased a Paperwhite.Much to Amazon's credit, I read that they worked tirelessly to get the lighting on the second generation Paperwhite absolutely perfect. And you can take it from this former scathing critic that they nailed it this time around. Perfectly even and wonderfully white, with no color casts and even better contrast than before, I have zero complaints. The PW2 is not only the best e-reader ever, it is actually hard to imagine how it could be improved in any significant way.

"I've used Panasonic cordless phones for longer than I can remember and have always been a huge fan. Five stars, period, end of story. When a new model came out with features I wanted, I'd upgrade, and was never disappointed... until now.I upgraded specifically to get the Link-to-Cell feature, which is the only reason to choose this model over those that lack Bluetooth connectivity. Unfortunately, at least with the iPhone, the best I can say about Link-to-Cell is that it's a work-in-progress that will not work for you at all if you have the 5s with iOS 7.Initially, with my previous iPhone 5 running iOS 6, it paired easily and connected calls reliably, but the voice quality was so poor that I ended up using my iPhone directly whenever possible, which defeated the purpose of buying this phone in the first place. I should also mention that I live in a 2 bedroom, single floor apartment, so this was not about exceeding the effective distance for Bluetooth. No matter where in the apartment my iPhone was located, it was well within that radius. One other note: I had no such voice quality problems when using my iPhone with the Bluetooth system in my car, even while traveling at 70mph, so it's not an iPhone/Bluetooth issue.As bad as the situation was, it got worse when I upgraded to the iPhone 5s running iOS 7 -- now the Panasonic won't even pair with it, and this is apparently a known incompatibility which I have to blame on Panasonic. Why? Because the 2010-vintage Bluetooth system in my car has had no issues pairing with the 4s, the 5 or the 5s, and that's through a number of major iOS changes.One other major disappointment: if you plan on importing your IPhone contacts, where a person's multiple numbers are all stored under one name, be aware that the Panasonic has to create a new contact for EACH NUMBER that a contact has. What year do they think this is? Nearly all of my contacts now have two or three phone numbers at least, often more. So importing contacts from an extensive list of people becomes an insanely long process resulting in a ridiculously long contact list because of all the duplicates.So what I'm left with is just a cordless phone, which I already owned and didn't need to buy again. If all you're looking for is a cordless phone without the Bluetooth connectivity, this will likely be a four or five star product for you.

"This was the perfect opportunity to REALLY do it right. One of the most beloved holiday movies of all-time was having its 30th anniversary, and there's a huge fanbase waiting and willing to pay for the ultimate in a quality remastering of both the video and audio of A Christmas Story. So what do we get? Some modest tweaks to the mono audio and no video improvements at all. It's such a cynical ploy to re-sell the same movie while making the most minimal effort possible to improve it, that it feels like Scut Farkus just took my money.While I appreciate the added featurette, this 30th Anniversary Edition could have been and should have been SO much better than this.

"First, you should know that this one star review is being written by someone who has highly recommended the Screwpull to friends for many years as the best corkscrew on the market. This praise was based on my long experience with the traditional plastic Screwpull table model, which I purchased before Screwpull carried the Le Creuset branding. I had mine for at least 10 years, possibly much longer, and since I'm a wine enthusiast, it got a lot of use.Recently, though, the part of my Screwpull that grips the bottle cracked in half while trying to extract an especially difficult cork, which placed intense stress on the plastic. But I certainly had no complaints after all the years it had served me well. So I immediately bought this supposedly all-metal version of the table Screwpull that I had, figuring that it would probably last me forever.Well, ""forever"" lasted roughly two months. While pulling a very easy cork the other night, the T top of the corkscrew portion started to turn freely as it had become detached from the actual screw. That's when I realized that this supposedly metal Screwpull was made of plastic at its most critical point: the collar where the metal screw attaches to the T head is plastic, and the glue holding metal to plastic had failed. I certainly didn't expect that on this ""all metal"" model that's nearly twice the price.Yes, there's a 10-year warranty on it, but you have to mail the broken unit to the United Kingdon with your original purchase receipt. If I saved every receipt for purchases as minor as a corkscrew, I'd have to move out of my house. Plus shipping a unit of this weight back to the UK will run almost $20.It's certainly possible that I was simply unlucky enough to get a lemon--it happens--but I've now read other reviews that report the same thing: long-satisfied Screwpull users are finding that new models break quickly. Le Creuset states that they've always been the manufacturer of Screwpulls, even before they branded them with their name, but that doesn't mean they haven't changed the quality since buying out the small Screwpull company. My experience would suggest that quality has slipped but, at the very least, you should know that this supposedly all-metal model is plastic at the joint that bears the most stress, and isn't worth nearly twice the price.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you found it helpful in making a buying decision.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R255DN0V20AP99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F5BFMM#wasThisHelpful","R255DN0V20AP99","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon's leather cover for the Kindle Touch was an innovative and smart design that was marred by two big blunders:First, the leather itself, lacking any cushioning or texture and simply glued to its stiff backing, looked and felt incredibly cheap. Pleather would have been no worse. And this was inexcusable--even a bit insulting--in a pricey cover. Surely Amazon could have done better at the price point.Second, the cover flap on the case lacked any sort of closure, which left the screen vulnerable to damage when being carried in a bag. I ended up using a rubber band around my cover, but again, Amazon should have thought this issue through considering the price.Well, I'm happy to report that Amazon listened to its customers, and corrected those two mistakes in the Paperwhite leather cover. For my priorities (which may not be yours), it's now perfect.It retains the snap-in, form fitting design from the Touch cover, which means that it adds the absolute minimum in size and weight to a naked PW, while still providing total protection.The leather is now cushioned a bit and textured, giving the case a much more luxurious feel in the hand. It now looks and feels like a case worth its price.The magnetic closure insures that the cover flap stays shut when not in use, protecting the screen, and also serves as an automatic ""off"" switch when you close it.With the PW bezel now virtually flush with the screen, that extra bit of holding room the case provides around the bezel really helps to keep your fingers off the screen. (And fingers inadvertently hitting a touch screen can be a real pain.)I would highly recommend this case to anyone for whom the price isn't an issue, except for those who prefer to use their Kindles naked. Once your PW is snapped into this case, the fit is pretty snug--as it should be--and taking it in and out regularly is probably not something you'll want to do.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you found it helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X48DGJB1X4BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R5YG8S#wasThisHelpful","R1X48DGJB1X4BZ","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"IMPORTANT NEWS FROM AMAZON: Since this review and updates were written, Amazon has updated the Paperwhite product page with a new section called ""We want you to know..."" You have to click through to find out what it is they want to tell you and show you. Mainly, it's that the lighting on the screen is NOT even under ""certain lighting conditions,"" especially in a darkened room, where you will most want to use Paperwhite illumination. The Amazon photo gives you a good look at the shadow issues and the bluish color cast to the screen in a dark room. This isn't defective, it's ""normal,"" per Amazon, so I doubt they will ship replacement units for these issues any longer, although a return for refund is fine, I'm sure, if you're dissatisfied. Many may feel that the uneven lighting is not a problem, which is a matter of personal taste--but it's unfortunate that the photos Amazon has been using (and continues to use) of Paperwhite illumination in a darkened room look very different from the reality of what Amazon now ""wants you to know"" about the lighting. In the interest of fairness to its customers, I believe Amazon should pull all Paperwhite product photos that show a perfectly illuminated and white screen in dark lighting conditions, because that's just not how it really looks.ORIGINAL REVIEW AND UPDATES:This will be a fairly brief review, considering that the Paperwhite's whole reason for existing can be stated in a single word: lighting. So one would think... and one would hope... that Amazon would absolutely nail it. The pre-production units that the press ""sampled,"" certainly suggested that they did. The unanimous acclaim and superlatives for the lighting and screen quality left no doubt that Amazon had hit this one out of the park. Well... I'd like me one of THOSE units, because that's not how I'd describe the Paperwhite I received today.Simply put, the lighting is okay, not great. After all the raves about how invisible the LED light sources were, it was disappointing to spot them immediately out of the box at the bottom of screen. And then, as others have noted, the lower screen is also marred by shadowy areas between the LEDs that might be described as smudges or banding. This was definitely NOT the beautifully even glow of light across the screen that Amazon product photos have shown and which I was expecting. I'm also not sold on improved readability of the new screen vs. my Kindle Touch. It is certainly a different reading experience--I'm just not sure that it's better, at least for me.My two star rating might seem somewhat harsh, but Amazon had just one feature that it needed to get REALLY right on the Kindle Paperwhite, and they missed the mark. I'm planning to return mine and keep my Kindle Touch.UPDATE: I would invite you to read the comments below this review, as person after person checks in with the same issues. In fact, scan all the 1-3 star reviews... and even a few of the 4s... it's pretty much the same story. The only variable seems to be the level of disappointment. The unanswered question is whether these problem Paperwhites are the result of a bad production run... or if this is really the level of quality we can expect? For the time being, I trust that Amazon is reading these reviews, seeing that they have a problem and will do what needs to be done to make it right with their loyal customers.UPDATE #2: This will be very helpful: there's a YouTube review of the Paperwhite that gives you a good look at the problems at the lower part of the screen. Check out the 20 seconds in the review from 1:10 to 1:30 where the reviewer demos the issue and discusses it. I think it looks somewhat worse when you're actually holding the Paperwhite than it does on video. But this should still give you a pretty good idea of whether this screen issue is going to be a problem for YOU.  youtube DOT COM/watch?v=u-SEYSHSVKcUPDATE #3: Sincere KUDOS and thanks to Amazon Customer Service for their handling of a replacement unit. It will be a while before it arrives (which is fine) and I'll report back here once I have it.UPDATE #4: So much has been written and said about this issue since I wrote the original review. For those who might be interested, I've posted a short summary of what is ""known"" at present in comment #71 below.FINAL UPDATE: I received a replacement PW, which I compared directly against my first unit. The screens were VERY similar--within what I'd consider an acceptable level of variation during a production run--though the shadow issue was actually ""a bit"" worse on the replacement. The splotchiness was more noticeable, and extended upward into the bottom three lines of text on the lower screen. (And this is with line spacing at its widest setting.) So... I'd say the shadow issue is simply the reality of this technology at present and isn't going to be corrected. Only YOU can decide if it's an issue for YOU... check out the link I've posted above or other video reviews and photos online that do a pretty good job of showing you what to expect.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9R6YI82RMJV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OZNZG0#wasThisHelpful","R9R6YI82RMJV1","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned the last three generations of Canon's top-of-line Photo A.I.O. -- the 990, the 8120 and now the 8220. Each generation has offered at least one new feature that was important enough to me to justify an upgrade. And in terms of features, performance and price, each generation has been best-in-class vs. the competition. Measured only by those standards, they're absolutely 5 star printers.But I've also noticed an unwelcome feature in each new model: a steady increase in Canon's greed through wasteful ink usage. I mentioned this issue when I updated my review of the 990... it got even worse with the 8120, which I didn't review... and now it has reached near criminal levels with the MG8220. Seriously, there should be a law against this kind of consumer abuse and deception.I'm talking about ink usage that hits especially hard the home or home business user who only occasionally prints a color document or photo. The culprit is the programmed cleaning cycles, which were originally developed to keep the inkjet heads from clogging and have long been a part of inkjet operation. But Canon has exploited this operational necessity and turned it into a cash cow, a means of cleaning out customers' wallets. How bad has it gotten? In under three months, I have a full set of empty cartridges, without having printed a single photograph and with minimal printing of documents that had some spot color.  So it has literally cost me DOLLARS PER PAGE to print some occasional color. At this rate, within a year, I'll spend more on ink than the cost of the printer, and that's with very light use. I've actually seen the five cartridges dedicated to color printing empty by a third during a period when I did no color printing at all. I've also had it go through cartridge cleaning cycles before it would SCAN a document which, of course, requires no ink at all.Ironically, this would not be a problem for users who print regularly in heavier volume, since the ink would be used for actual printing and not constant cleaning cycles. In the tests I've read of continuous printing until the cartridges are empty (which is how the ink usage tests are always done) Canon printers perform with reasonable economy and a competitive cost per page. However, the vast majority of the market and user base for this printer is composed of people who do light to moderate printing, and their experience will be much closer to mine.That brings me to my rating which, as I mentioned, would be 5 stars if features, performance and initial purchase price were the only considerations. But they're not, and the issue here is serious, one that will have a very significant financial impact on most users that they did not anticipate. Worse yet--and the reason I'm deducting 3 stars instead of 1 or 2--is that the issue is greed-based and intentional. Canon is ripping off its customers because it can, and because what it's doing will never show up in a review or test. I'm certainly aware that every printer manufacturer plays ""the ink game"" to some degree, but Canon has taken it to a whole new level with the MG8220.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope it has helped in your buying decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDGMQIHMBXLZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GOPXYS#wasThisHelpful","RDGMQIHMBXLZR","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, I didn't expect much from this table. I figured it would be about the quality of those wooden folding snack tables that you often see at big box stores. But what I got was even less than that. It's so unfortunate, too, because this could have been a really nice little table for the money, were it not for a stupid, cost-cutting decision that results in a big design flaw that you can't see in the product photo.The top of the table, which looks like a solid piece of wood in the photo, IS NOT. Only the outer edges of the top are solid, sort of like a picture frame. The 9 inch X 9 inch center of the table top is just a flimsy piece of pressboard, perhaps 1/16 of an inch thick, that has been stapled to the solid outer edges. So, the amount of weight you can put on this table top depends on what you're willing to trust to some staples and what is essentially a glorified piece of stiff cardboard.Notice how the planter in the photo is on the lower shelf? Well, now I know why, because that shelf IS solid wood, which is screwed into all four legs. The quality of the wood used is about on par with the snack tables I mentioned above--solid but lightweight--and that would have been fine if only the table top had been solid.Assembly is easy and straight forward: the legs have pre-mounted screws at the top of each one that screw into pre-mounted threaded sleeves at the corners of the table top ""frame."" Then you line up the bottom shelf with pre-cut notches in the legs, and simply followed the pre-drilled screw guides to screw each corner of the shelf into a leg. Fully assembled, this is a reasonably sturdy design were it not for the stupid table top.I bought this table for a small empty spot in my kitchen, hoping to store my juicer on the table top and my food processor on the lower shelf. The processor actually stores well there, but there's no way I'd trust this table top to support a juicer. Consider it for lightweight items only.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found in helpful in making a buying decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381RLN2CRBKE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EQQ2L0#wasThisHelpful","R381RLN2CRBKE9","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two main considerations when purchasing oven gloves: heat resistance and dexterity--i.e., how well you can maneuver your hands and handle objects with the gloves. Unfortunately, either consideration tends to work against the other--gloves with greater heat resistance tend to have less dexterity, and vice-versa. Simply stated, the Ove Glove's great strength is that it offers the best compromise between heat resistance and dexterity currently on the market.The first time you put them on, you find your hands have as much freedom as if they were in heavy cotton gloves, and the weave of the fabric lends additional flexibility to your movement. In fact, I was nervous the first time I picked up a hot pan out of the oven with them, wondering if gloves with this kind of comfort and dexterity could possibly protect me from nearly 500 degree temps. Amazingly, they do! Plus, the fact that these ARE gloves--instead of oven mittens--is another key to the dexterity they provide.This particular model of Ove Glove has longer cuffs to protect your forearms when reaching deeper into an oven or working over a hot BBQ grill. I find the added protection worthwhile, but if you feel you don't need it, then check out the model with shorter cuffs that just cover the wrist.But as good as the Ove Glove is, it's not perfect, and here are the main minuses to consider:1) You can't carry very hot objects for longer periods of time. This won't be an issue in nearly all everyday tasks, where you're generally moving something from a hot oven or grill to a nearby cooler surface. But there are times it could be a problem: for example, I recently had to carry a blazing hot cast iron pan from my backyard BBQ grill to my kitchen--a distance of about 75 feet--and I wasn't sure I would make it without having to drop the pan. The heat penetrated the glove over time to the point that it felt like I would soon burn my hands. Fortunately, I made it. And here's the thing: I've owned silicone mitts that were more heat resistant, but they were so clumsy to use that I would often end up not wearing them and grab towels instead. With the Ove Gloves, I never hestitate to put them on, so I end up with better protection.2) Since the fabric is woven, hot liquids and hot steam will penetrate it to your skin. Again, not an issue in nearly all everyday tasks--not even for tasks like draining cooked pasta, where there's often a cloud of steam rising out of the pot as you empty it. But if you're going to be exposed to prolonged steam, there's a new steam-proof version of the Ove Glove available.3) It's washable, but still doesn't clean up all that great.All things considered, my headline for this review says it all: the Ove Glove isn't perfect, so I've deducted a star, but it's the best oven/grill glove that's currently on the market.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope that you found it helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CN3M0W0CPK4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TVR7JC#wasThisHelpful","R3CN3M0W0CPK4J","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this machine's main purpose is the transfer of legacy tape formats to DVD, why did Sony choose to eliminate the S-Video input on this model of DVDirect?! This input, which Sony has included on previous DVDirect models, is essential for getting the best quality from Hi-8 and S-VHS tapes. During the days of standard def camcorders, and prior to the introduction of Mini-DV, Hi-8 and S-VHS were consumer formats that could achieve near broadcast quality standards of that time. But playback (or transfer) of them requires an S-Video interface to fully appreciate their qualtiy. Yes, you can still transfer Hi-8 and S-VHS tapes using the regular composite video interface, but at a quality level that will be more comparable to standard 8mm or VHS.Including the S-Video input would have had minimal impact on the cost of this unit, but eliminating it had made the VRDMC6 a considerably less desirable burner for anyone who shot a lot of Hi-8 or S-VHS tapes. A two-star deduction for this loss. After buying the VRDMC6 and seeing the quality level of DVD it produced from my Hi 8 tapes, I ended up returning it for a refund.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope that you found it helpful!","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZG1W6CKXEPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EVP85K#wasThisHelpful","R34ZG1W6CKXEPD","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE 5/2014: After two years of use, the power button on the handle had become so unresponsive to operate, that it required a very forceful two-thumb push to turn on my toothbrush. I contacted Philips via their website, using their online assistant, and a replacement handle was shipped to me the same day. I simply had to return mine in the same box as the replacement, and Philips paid the return shipping. How easy was that?! My two year warranty had actually expired one month prior (isn't that always the way it goes?) but it turns out that because I registered my toothbrush--which I didn't even remember doing--the warranty got extended by an additional six months. Great customer service, Philips!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Funny, i don't remember reading that Jonny Ive was moonlighting over at Philips. But this is their second new dental product in a row--the first being the AirFloss--that might lead you to think that Sonicare design was now being done by Apple. And I mean that in the most complimentary way. This is, without question, the most modern and elegantly designed electric toothbrush on the market today, and I can only compare holding it to the feeling you get when you hold an Apple product. But is it worth the premium price being charged for it?THE ANSWER IS YES, IF...1) You have money to splurge a bit and value great design very highly. The ceramic feel of the power handle (though not actually ceramic), the hidden areas that illuminate to indicate mode and battery status, the brilliance of a travel case that both closes magnetically and charges the power handle via USB cable from your computer or the included USB power adapter--the whole package has just been thought through with incredible attention to detail. There's even an alternative to the one feature I didn't like, which was the charging glass--it looked too big and clunky in photos, which is exactly how it looks when you actually see it. Plus, do we really need to mimic the old, unsanitary practice of standing wet toothbrushes up in a glass to store them? Fortunately, there's a much smaller and more elegant charging stand included that can be used instead of the glass. You never see that in photos of this toothbrush, and I was very pleased.2) You don't care if the premium price buys you no functional or performance advantage of any type over cheaper models in the Sonicare line. You know you're paying for the design, and you're fine with it. (Yes, I agree that the DiamondClean brush heads ARE a notable improvement, but they can be used on other, less expensive Sonicare models. See below.)THE ANSWER IS NO, IF...1) You expect a premium price to buy you better functionality and performance over less expensive models. The DiamondClean toothbrush doesn't, trust me. Ignore most of the five star review hype that you read about this brush (""Cleanest Teeth EVER!"") and focus on these facts:a) The power handle, which is the heart of any electric toothbrush, is just the FlexCare+ handle with a different skin on it. Specs are identical and--if you go to a store and hold them side by side--you'll see that size, shape and weight are the same. Only the elegant, ceramic-like skin on the DiamondClean model, with it's hidden lights, is different.b) While the DiamondClean brushes DO clean somewhat better than older Sonicare brush heads, you can use DiamondClean brushes on some of the older, cheaper Sonicare models like FlexCare. Since the power handles are essentially no different, the cleaning you get will be the same.2) It drives you crazy to pay more and actually get less for your money. As others have pointed out, the DiamondClean doesn't have the UV sanitizer of the less expensive FlexCare models. And I just saw a Costco special that included two Sonicare power handles, two chargers, two travel cases, plus four brush heads that included two DiamondClean ones... all for $120.3) Design just isn't that important to you.The value of great design is very much a personal decision. While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities. But either way, I thank you for taking the time to read my review. and I hope you found it ""helpful"" in making your purchasing decision!UPDATES: The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it. The section below contains more on the pros and cons I've experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:PROS: 1) The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.CONS: 1) No vent holes in the travel case, made worse by its form-fitting plastic interior. So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth. 2) When a second family member recently joined me in using the DiamondClean, I suddenly realized that there's no storage for multiple brush heads. (Except in the travel case.) Plus, there's no system for color-coding the heads for different family members. Bottom line: you have to store multiple brush heads in a medicine cabinet or elsewhere and somehow color code them yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18IRVJC5AE9N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052JN7XG#wasThisHelpful","R18IRVJC5AE9N2","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You learn a lot about a company's commitment to its customers by the way it handles service requests for its products. Well, this was my first Breville product ever, and what I've learned about the company is that I'll never buy anything from them again based on the way they've handled a manufacturing defect on this expensive, top-of-the-line juicer.The defect, itself, was simple enough: the grounding pin on the three prong safety plug completely separated from the plug base, and I didn't want to operate the juicer without grounding it. I called Breville, sent them a photo of the defective plug, and they agreed to send me a replacement juicer in exchange. So far, so good, right?I explained that I lived in a typically small, NYC apartment, and therefore did not have the room to store the large carton and packing materials in which this big and heavy juicer had originally been shipped. Therefore, I asked them to send me the replacement juicer first, charging my credit card the full price for it in advance, and then I would use that carton and packing materials to return my defective unit to them. Once they received the return, they could issue a credit to my card. An easy way to solve the problem, while still fully protecting Breville.Breville's response: ""Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but we don't do that. You'll have to find a box and ship it back to us first.""I explained (again) that I was offering to pay them for the replacement in advance, so shipping it first was of no risk to them. I also explained (again) that this juicer was the size and weight of your average stand mixer, so ""finding"" a box that would be sturdy enough to ship it would be very difficult. The carton from the replacement would be exactly right.Breville's response: ""Yeah, but we don't do that."" At that point, my phone line went to a fast busy signal, as the rep disconnected from the call .BOTTOM LINE: When it comes to reasonable and responsive customer service, Breville ""doesn't do that.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33EHHEQU586LK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002VAFVG#wasThisHelpful","R33EHHEQU586LK","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought that I'd get right to the heart of the matter with my headline question. So let's start the answer here: if you're considering buying this grinder, then you're more than just serious about your coffee. You, like me, are probably obsessed with it, pursuing the best cup possible like some coffee-crazed Ahab hunting his Moby. Let's face it, you'd have to be obsessed to even THINK about dropping more than half a grand on a grinder, an appliance that can also be bought for less than twenty bucks.Okay, so be it. Then for you, like me, coffee is an essential daily ritual in your life, a ritual that may occur a couple, a few, or even more times per day. So when you come across something that has a truly positive impact on your coffee ritual, you're also going to appreciate it each and every day. How much is that worth to you? That's the question only you can answer, ultimately, but here are the reasons, roughly in priority order, that I felt the Baratza Vario-W was well worth its purchase price FOR ME:1) Automatic, programmable weight-based grinding with pre-sets. I'd call it the Holy Grail of Grinding, but that might sound like hype. Hmmmmm... how else can I describe it? No, sorry, I'm going to have to stick with Holy Grail... this innovation is really that good. If you weigh your coffee for consistent brewing (and if you don't, you should!) I guarantee this will bring a smile to your face every time you use it. No more weighing out your beans on a separate digital scale before you grind. Once you (easily) program the three preset buttons with three different weights, you simply press the preset you want, press start, and the Vario-W will grind exactly that weight into its lower hopper. (And yes, you can easily change those preset weights on the fly, at any time.) It has operated flawlessly for me, with repeated accuracy within 0.2 grams. If I haven't been absolutely clear about it yet, this feature is an absolute game changer in coffee preparation. And only the Vario-W has it.2) Grind quality. The ceramic, German-made Mahlkonig burrs in the Vario-W are considered by many to be the best made. And there's a top-quality motor that's turning them. Once you dial-in the grind you want (from over 200 possible settings)--you get a consistent and gorgeous grind that yields, most importantly, GREAT FLAVOR! Plus, because the burrs are ceramic, they'll last about twice as long as the best steel burrs. When you consider the high cost for replacement burrs in quality grinders ($100 or more is not uncommon), the long life of the Mahlkonigs will save you money down the road. However... all that being said... you can get great grind quality from grinders that cost much less, even other Baratzas, And while the Vario-W does allow you to easily choose from 230 grind settings (as does the plain Vario), this amount seems pointless to me beyond the marketing value. A small fraction of that amount, which is what you find on most high-quality grinders, would definitely suffice.3) Baratza warranty and customer service. If I'm spending this kind of money on a grinder, I want a great warranty and outstanding customer service. Baratza gives you both. If there's a problem with the grinder, they ship you a new one in a fresh carton, and arrange for pick-up of the broken one in that same carton. All you have to do is pack it up, they pay for shipping both ways. That's as ""no hassle"" as it gets. And if you ever have a question or a problem, they have a great reputation for being totally responsive by either phone or email. I do wish the warranty was for longer than a year, but that's pretty standard.3) Build quality and design. The build, fit and finish of the Vario-W just ooze high quality and its a really handsome appliance on the counter. It LOOKS and FEELS like an expensive, precision instrument, which makes it an added joy to use everyday. Since I have a typically small NYC kitchen, with little counter space, I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively small footprint of this grinder, and an overall size that wasn't nearly as imposing as I feared it would be. Not that I would call this grinder small by any means, but compared to my old KitchenAid Proline grinder--which was the size of a small stand mixer--it's a literal and welcome downsizing.Do I have any complaints? No, but there is one minor annoyance: ground coffee tends to stick a bit to the inside of the plastic hopper. According to Baratza, there's an anti-static agent actually blended into the plastic itself--not just a coating that would wear away over time--but I question how effective it is. I've also seen this grinder described as ""quiet,"" but is coffee-grinding ever a quiet activity? No, I think not. A more accurate description of the Vario-W would be ""not quite as noisy.""AND SO... that brings us back to the big question... is the Vario-W really worth $549? Well, unless you're as jazzed as I am about automatic, weight-based grinding, I'd say it's a definitive ""No."" You have many choices in lower cost grinders out there that will still give you a great grind. It's also a definite ""No"" for anyone who wants to grind directly into a portafilter, since there is no way to do that on the Vario-W. But if you're not in either of those two groups, then this is a grinder that will change your coffee-loving life on a daily basis, a purchase that will pay you happiness dividends every day for years to come.When you consider the high quality of its build and parts, the beauty of its design, its innovative features and the brilliant execution of them, I feel the Vario-W easily justifies its price tag. Oh, and the joy it will bring to your daily coffee ritual? Ah, that's priceless!Thank you for reading my review and I hope you found it helpful in making your buying decision!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMPXGAPB43JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058J1XMC#wasThisHelpful","R1AMPXGAPB43JP","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The field of ""cooking tips"" books is a crowded one, which already includes the superb ""834 Kitchen Quick Tips"" from Cooks Illustrated to choose but one example. So the real question is, ""How does 'Tips Cooks Love' stack up to the competition?"" Speaking as a decent cook, myself, and as the owner of an extensive kitchen library, my tip to cooks would be, ""Pass this one by."" I have two main complaints about this attractively packaged volume:First, the organization, apart from being alphabetical, seems completely haphazard. There appears to have been no guiding editorial voice in choosing what went into the book vs. what was left out, or in the amount of information for each entry. So, for example, you get more than two full PAGES of info (almost none of it ""tips"") for balsamic vinegar--that's more than the book devotes to key cooking topics like roasting or grilling--but there's no entry in ""B"" at all for a widely used cooking ingredient like basil.Second--and this is my main complaint--while this is titled as a ""tips"" book, it is really a hodgepodge of dictionary, encyclopedia, recipes (which are the longest entries in the book, running up to four pages each) and yes, some tips. In short, it's a book that doesn't know what it wants to be, and ends up master of none, especially as the tips book it claims to be. Plus, there is far too much information in this book that falls into the ridiculously obvious, ""D'uh"" category. For example, in the info about ""rice cookers"" (which could actually be packed with useful, time-saving tips), you'll learn instead that this appliance ""was originally created for Asian families who eat rice three times a day."" REALLY? Trust me: that's just one of many examples you'll find of eye-roll inducing stupidity in this book.Overall, I don't get the sense that there was a cook behind the writing of Tips Cooks Love. It comes across as a book created by a writer on contract who needed to fill X amount of pages, and who did so by pulling food topics from a hat. Then, lacking enough ""tips, shortcuts and techniques"" info to do the job, he padded the book with recipes and the kind of general info you'd find in a food encyclopedia or dictionary. If this is your first tips book, you'll probably find it interesting, but there are far better choices you could make amongst competing volumes. If you already own a tips book, there is little you'll find here that would make a purchase worthwhile.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found the info helpful in making a purchase decision!","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SYD62KLE3OZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0740783440#wasThisHelpful","R2SYD62KLE3OZL","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fair disclosure: I've had this printer up and running for less than 48 hours. But the early results have been so incredibly good, I felt a review was in order. If you, like me, have been on an endless search for an AIO that actually worked as advertised and could hold its own with minimal compromise vs. more task specific printers, then I believe your search has ended with the 990.Setup: A+. I have two Macs, one a PowerMac G5 running 10.5, the other a Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard, both on my Airport Extreme (simultaneous dual band) network, and setup was about as close to plug and play as you could get. Just BE SURE that if you're running 10.6, you download all the latest drivers from Canon's website. The software CD packed with the printer is not updated for Snow Leopard.Wireless Performance: As noted above, connecting to my home network was a snap. I've had no dropped connections over two days. Now, I've never had a problem printing wirelessly in the past, but scanning wirelessly and reliably? Forget it. At least, until the 990, which worked flawlessly on both machines from the first scan. You'd swear that Apple, and not Canon, had designed this hardware/software solution. Pop in a document, click scan, choose which computer you want to send it to and you're done.Printing Quality: A. Superb quality on both black text and color graphics, and all reasonably quick.Photo Quality: Haven't gotten into this yet, but professional reviews posted thus far indicate that the photo printing performance is excellent.Scanning/Copying Quality: A. Scans and copies are incredibly good. Haven't tried negs or slides as yet.Ease of Use: A. If Apple designed its own printer, this is how it would work. An amazingly intuitive interface.I'll post an update after I've put it through its paces a while longer, but it's a definite 5 stars out of the box. Thanks for taking the time to read this review--I hope you found the info useful in helping you make a buying decision!Update as of 10/16/09:The Bad News: Within 2 weeks of posting my review, this printer has dropped in price by $100! Oh well... that'll teach me to be first in line to buy a new model! :-)The Good News: I rated it 5 stars at $299 and I still think it's every bit as good as noted in my review. At $199, it's now a steal of a deal as well.UPDATE AS OF 12/7/09The professional reviews are now coming in for the MP990, and they're raving: Computer Shopper gave it a 9 out of 10, and [...] gave it Editor's Choice, stating that they had a hard time coming up with any ""cons"" for their conclusion. I remain totally satisfied after two months of use.UPDATE AS OF 4/3/10So, 6 months after purchase, do I still think this is a 5 star printer? Well, yes and no. The printer performance remains every bit as good as previously described. But the ink usage has been another matter. While I've owned a variety of other inkjets, this is my first Canon, and I feel it penalizes you more than other brands for light usage. After printing perhaps 2-3 dozen pages with color on them--and I'm talking very moderate amounts of color and no printing of photos--I've just had to replace all five color cartridges at a cost of $50 at Amazon discount prices. Do the math and you realize that this is a huge cost-per-page, driven by this printer's all-too-frequent automatic cleaning cycles of the print cartridges, which use up large amounts of ink whether you're actually priniting or not. Of course, all inkjets do this, but I feel this Canon takes it to a whole other level that just seems like a blatant cleaning of your wallet. That said, if you print color regularly, the ink usage may well be on par with the norm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VZIE8G0KZNN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002M78HX6#wasThisHelpful","R2VZIE8G0KZNN6","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's get right to the critical question that many people checking out this rice cooker are probably asking: is the addition of pressure cooking worth $180 MORE than what this same cooker costs with induction heating only? In my opinion, no. As the owner of the 10 cup induction-heating only model, I decided to take a chance on the pressure-cooking feature when I was in the market for a smaller sized cooker. So I was able to compare them side-by-side and could not detect any difference in blind tastings of cooked rice. Both units cook rice to equal perfection.Zojirushi claims that pressure cooking converts beta starch to alpha starch, making the rice softer and easier to digest. That may be true, though I couldn't detect ""softer"" rice. You should also know that pressure cooking doesn't speed up the process--both machines take about the same amount of time. What pressure cooking does add is some additional and more frequent cleaning requirements, though it's still pretty simple. While much less important, I would also say that the pressure-cooking models are the nicest looking of the Zojirushi high-end cookers, which could be a consideration if you intend to leave this out on your counter.Overall, this Zojirushi does a five star job of cooking rice, but no better than the much cheaper induction-only model. So I deducted one star for value.

"""A movie shot entirely on surveillance cameras!"" ""The ultimate look at our 'Big Brother' world!""As someone who makes his living producing television, I was very intrigued by the above promo copy for ""Look."" I seriously wondered if it could be the next step in reality entertainment. If a director had been able to create a compelling and cohesive story out of raw surveillance footage, that would be a giant leap past the short clips that make their way onto those ""Caught On Camera"" shows. ""This,"" I thought, ""could really be something big!"" And then I quickly realized that it wasn't.""Look"" is a pastiche of C-level fictional stories performed by C-level actors, glued together (albeit loosely) with the gimmick of shooting it all with surveillance cameras. So you have the ultimate form of down n' dirty reality video (surveillance) being used to visualize completely fictional content. This is like shooting a season of Survivor with a paid cast of professional actors who are completely scripted. What would be the point? And that's the same question I ask about Look: when you've stripped reality and true voyeurism from surveillance cameras, why bother to use them? As a technique, it's genuinely interesting for about 10 minutes, and then you ""get it"" -- after which you're left with a fictional movie that's not shot as well as it could have been with conventional cameras. Honestly, if I were not intending to write a Vine review of Look, I wouldn't have watched past the 30 minute mark.Possibly the director is making a point that surveillance cameras are everywhere, but that's hardly a profound fact that needs 102 minutes of exposition. And ultimately, I felt the fictional nature of the movie undercut whatever factual points the director might have been hoping to make about surveillance cameras and privacy.For me, this was no more than a 2 star flick, certainly not worth repeat viewing, nor do I even care about it enough to bother with the extras on the DVD. As with all movies, YMMV, and there is no shortage of 5 star raves about Look, but overall, this strikes me as a textbook case of style over substance. Whether you agree with my conclusions or not, I do hope that you found this review to be helpful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3YW99IZK8PT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TIGFE2#wasThisHelpful","RS3YW99IZK8PT","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many photographers with pro SLR digicams, I've been on a seemingly endless search for an ultracompact, truly pocketable digicam that could produce photos without great compromises in quality. And finally, my search ended with the purchase of a C-Lux 3.Before I get to specifics, a word about what ""truly pocketable"" means to me. It means that I can pocket the camera in either my jeans or the inside pocket of a sport jacket without awareness of either size or weight. If there's awareness, then leaving the camera home becomes more likely, which defeats the whole purpose of buying a camera to have with you ALL the time. For example, I have a Fuji 31fd that I love, except I tend to leave it home because it feels a little too bulky and heavy for pocket carry. So its outstanding low-light performance is meaningless when the camera's sitting in a drawer.Amazingly, many of the digicams in this category perform poorly at the type of photo for which they are most likely to be used: snapshots of people. Flash exposure is either terrible or unpredictable at best, while color balance and skin tones are anything but natural. In addition, the low power flashes on small cameras almost require a wider angle lens that allows you to get in closer, especially for group shots, and yet many of them leave you stuck at roughly 35mm. It's in all these areas that I find the C-Lux 3 really shines. Great and consistent flash exposures, speedy and accurate focus, a supersharp lens, very natural color balance and pleasing skin tones, and a lens that widens out to 25mm. I've also been very satisfied with daylight pics, as well. Compared side-by-side with a friend's Panasonic ""twin"" of this camera, this FX37, I overwhelmingly prefer the processing done by the Leica. You may feel differently if you're a fan of supersaturated color in your photos, and many people are, in which case the Panasonic might be your pick. In addition, Panasonic's sharpening is more agressive resulting in noisier photos at higher ISOs.This is not, by any means, the perfect camera. The lens is pretty slow on the long end, and while low-light performance without flash is better than nearly all of its category competitors, it's a far cry from the F31fd. Once you get above 400 ISO, things start getting noisy. So if indoor available light photograhy is your thing, this probably isn't your camera. (Then again, no camera in the ultracompact category would be.)Construction of the C-Lux 3 is first rate and very classy--having seen the camera in both black and white, you can't go wrong with either one. The white is more of a fashion statement and somewhat more feminine. Menus are very intuitive and straight-forward, with good button layout for an ultracompact. I have thick fingers and never felt cramped.The choice of a camera should always be driven by your intended use for that camera. If you've been searching for a great, truly pocketable ultracompact--and indoor available light photography is not main interest--I think you'll find the C-Lux 3 to be a very satisfying purchase. Is it worth the significant upcharge vs. the Panasonic FX37? That's more difficult to answer. For me, the difference in Leica processing of the image made it worthwhile, since I get great pics that please me right out of the camera.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M1B0383FXM17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001H8FAQI#wasThisHelpful","R3M1B0383FXM17","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of KitchenAid appliances, which often set the standard for quality in a given category of culinary machine. I have owned this grinder for about three years, and exchanged it for a new one once, under warranty, for what I thought was an issue with the hopper feed but which turns out to be a design flaw with this grinder. And therein lies the main reason for my three-star rating, with details to follow below.But first, some things to know to place this review in context: my one grinder prior to this one was a Braun burr grinder, which served me quite well, so I cannot compare this KitchenAid to Capresso or the other top grinders that are out there. Second, I do not make espresso at home, so I do not use the finest grinds of which this machine is capable, an ability which I believe is a real strength of this machine vs. the competition. I have a Technivorm drip machine  that does best with the grinder set at 5.5 or 6.With that out of the way, lets get to it. This machine, as others have noted, is unquestionably of very high quality, bulletproof construction. The downside to that equation is that it occupies a large counter footprint for a grinder--a small stand mixer comes to mind--and it's fairly heavy. I deduct no stars for that, however, since that's something you would know before making the purchase.For me, there are two real issues:1) The hopper feed is highly unreliable, and not just with very oily beans. Scarcely a morning goes by when the grinder doesn't start ""freewheeling"" because the beans have gotten hung up above the screw that feeds them into the conical burrs. This requires opening the lid and stirring up the beans to get them falling into the screw again. Is this a huge deal? No. But it means I can't turn on the grinder and leave it unattended, which I find to be an inexcusable flaw in a grinder this expensive, big and heavy. As mentioned, I returned my first grinder while under warranty for this very problem, which KitchenAid acknowedged was a known issue. Unfortunately, the new replacement unit has performed no differently.2) The grind is uneven, though only at certain settings. My grind when set to 5.5 is visibly uneven, but with the grinder set to 6 the coffee granules are all of uniform size. Why? Who knows? But again, you don't expect those results in such a high-end grinder.Overall, I'd say I'm ""satisfied"" with this grinder, but no more than that. and hence the three star rating. Having spent this much money on a grinder, and with it needing a good chunk of counter space in my cramped kitchen, I wish I could give it a five star cheer. KitchenAid, I know you can do better than this!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JILS6YTVEERM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F263XA#wasThisHelpful","R1JILS6YTVEERM","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I get to this review, in which I'll focus on the sonics of the remastered Cricklewood Green, here's a plea to Amazon: please keep reviews for remastered versions of CDs limited to the remaster! Anyone interested in buying a remaster already knows the merits of the musical content, or they wouldn't want to buy a remastered version. So we don't need reviews of old versions of the CD telling us how good the music is. The most important question to be answered in any review of a remaster is how it compares to the original version. Buyers want to know if the sonics really make it worth the money to buy it again, and yet so few reviews of remasters ever answer the question.Now, as for my review of the Cricklewood Green remaster: If you're a fan of this disc (and you should be) then just stop reading and click the Buy button now. I have owned Cricklewood Green (and the earlier Ssssh) on the original vinyl, the first CDs, the MoFi Gold CD containing both albums, and now this remaster, which sonically blows all previous versions away.My vinyl grooves are practically worn flat, so I can't speak to its sonic quality any longer. The first CDs of these albums were atrocious--the combo of '60s-era rock engineering and the harshness of the digital mastering rendered them almost unlistenable. The MoFi Gold CD, which I compared to this remaster directly, is certainly much better than the early CDs, but finishes second by a wide margin to this new version.Overall, the instruments and vocals on this remaster have more weight and presence and are more clearly defined in the soundfield. I don't mean this in that etched, artificial sort of way that you hear on some remasters--no, I've bought my share of those, and this ain't one of 'em, thankfully! What you get here is sound that sounds totally natural, while still sounding better than you've ever heard it before. Once you've heard this version, the MoFi, by comparison, sounds flatter and far less dynamic, with vocals and instruments lacking that three dimensional sound.The limiting factor at this point is the original quality of the engineering on the master tapes, which is very good but not great. So, four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SW29PFFXY99T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005B5X6#wasThisHelpful","R2SW29PFFXY99T","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like the idea of paying almost $200 for the privilege of beta testing a still buggy humidifier that doesn't work as advertised, then the Venta 370 is the product for you. However, if you have better things to do with your time and money, then heed the advice of previous reviewers and someone (me) who bought two of these sporadically functional, white-dust-generating puddle makers and look elsewhere to humidify your home. I bought these machines on the basis of believing that Venta stood for high-quality abeit at a high price. Unfortunately, only the latter half of that equation appears to be true in the case of the model 370.This is the type of machine that leaves you wondering, ""Did anyone bother to test this thing before selling it to the public?"" How else to explain a humidifier that leaves puddles on itself, puddles on furniture where it's placed and wet spots on the floor beneath its mist. (Especially dangerous on bare wood floors, where these slick spots are invisible and invite falls. If you buy the 370, be sure your liability insurance is paid up.)It leaves white dust despite promising none (now remedied, apparently, by removing that promise from its marketing) and its maintenance-free box, while a terrific idea, becomes very expensive at $30 each when it lasts half (or less) of its advertised season-long (or 1,000 hour) lifespan.What you have, in the end, is a humidifier that's expensive to buy and expensive to maintain, while seeming specifically designed to create a damp mess in its immediate surroundings. My first and last Venta product for sure.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXQLEGJVJR57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OUFBZK#wasThisHelpful","R1PXQLEGJVJR57","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a longtime user of Kensington Expert Mouse trackballs, so this seemed like a perfect mobile mouse for my new Macbook Pro unibody. While it's still too new to comment on the reliability issues noted by many reviewers, I will tell you that the performance in either mouse or trackball mode leaves a lot to be desired. Specifically, you'll find you have two tracking speed choices: too slow or too fast. I'm not kidding. If you slide the tracking speed adjustment in your mouse preferences panel to the far left mark (slower), it tracks, not surprisingly, too slow. However, move it just one mark to the right from the slowest position, and your cursor tracks too fast, with no fine control of movement. Move it any further to the right and it's useless. If Kensington Mouseworks software worked with the SlimBlade Trackball Mouse, that would provide the adjustment needed, but it doesn't, so you're stuck. I'm sitting here in a hotel room as I type this, and have abandoned use of the SlimBlade for my trackpad, making this $50 purchase a total waste of money. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a mobile mouse solution--if you have a Mac, this isn't it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2TMZ6QHAUGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VE4MM2#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2TMZ6QHAUGC","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I wouldn't disagree with the five star praise here for the fit and overall quality of this cover, I have one continuing (and not insignificant) problem: it regularly blows off my Performer grill on even modestly windy days, to say nothing of the gusts that get kicked up during a good rainstorm. As a result, my grill gets a thorough soaking anyway while the cover gets blown halfway across my yard. Only the heavy weight of the vinyl has kept it from sailing away completely. I've tried laying bricks on the cover, over the flat, table area of the grill, which does help--but the half of the cover that actually covers the grill portion gets blown off anyway! (And, by the way, I live in NYC, not exactly a locale renowned for windy weather.) I wish that Weber had provided either an elasticized bottom for this cover, or some grommets near the bottom that would allow you to anchor it with a bungee or two.So, all in all, while this is a spiffy looking cover for your awesome Performer grill (and the only real choice available), just be prepared to chase it around your yard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/REW2QYKM75AMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J5MNR4#wasThisHelpful","REW2QYKM75AMQ","AJ34DZU9MYMUE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ34DZU9MYMUE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PROS:+ Nice design+ Rubber non-slip surface+ Discreet, yet visible Charging/Status LED+ Charges quickly, even with case installed+ Long 6ft USB cable & 2A Charger Included+ Slim profileCONS:- Can be a little tricky to line up device at first- Bit pricey compared to competitionI've had other QI chargers before, and some simply work better than others. Usually has to do with phone/tablet positioning as the biggest complaint. There are cheaper alternatives that mostly address this by providing either a larger pad and/or more coils to ensure contact. In the case of the somewhat pricey Belkin, there is likely only one. My Nexus 6 has to be in just the right spot for it to charge.And that's with or without the Seidio Surface case installed. Fortunately there is a green charging LED so you can make sure you've got it on there correctly. I've also figured out if I line up the bottom of the phone with the bottom of the charger (so the top is hanging off), it'll work just fine. The Chloe charger I had didn't care where I put the phone, as long as it was on the pad.Otherwise it's got a nice design, it's flat, and even has a recessed micro-usb connector on the side, underneath the device. This makes for a nicer/cleaner appearance. They were also thoughtful enough to include a long 6ft USB cable and 2A wall charger. So keep that in mind as it at least explains some of the higher price here.Overall, I still consider it recommended. Once you learn where to place your device, it should work fine. Even though I might suggest waiting for a price drop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NT5C7G53STLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VA5SU56#wasThisHelpful","R3NT5C7G53STLI","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ever since the very first Android HTC smart phone several years ago, Ive owned more phones than I can recall. Looking at recent phones, Ive owned Galaxy Note 3 & 4, Galaxy S 4 & 5, LG G2 & G3, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra, and my current daily driver, the Nexus 6. Yeah, Im rather familiar with smartphones. :) So lets take that experience and see how the latest from LG performs compared to the world of smart phones.PROS:+ Fast 64-bit Snapdragon 808 SoC+ Smooth LG User Interface+ Removable 3000mAh battery+ Expandable MicroSD Storage, up to 2TB (when available)+ Standard 32GB Internal Storage (not 16GB!)+ Nice sharp 5.5 Quad HD IPS Display+ Above Average Battery Life+ Reasonably priced for a high-end phone+ Fast Micro-USB Charge Capable+ Functional very slightly curved design+ Excellent 16MP OIS rear camera with crisp/sharp images+ Surprising high-res 8MP front camera+ Loud Speaker+ Lots of extra LG features+ Solid Build Quality & Feel (Leather Back)+ Interchangeable back coversCONS:- Battery could be larger for a big phone- Single rear-facing speaker- No Wireless Charging- Some cases may not fit with optional leather back cover- AT&T BloatwareDESIGNThe LG G4 is a 5.5 phone with a slight curve and a squarish design. Its not as drastic as the original LG G Flex, but just enough to make it a little nicer to hold up to your face. You know, for those that still make phone calls on these things. Beyond that, there is the usual mini-USB port, headphone jack, volume/power on the back, etc.Which by the way, having used LG phones in the past, you really do quickly get used to the buttons on the back. Just like you get used to the size. It's to the point that my index finger naturally rests on the buttons and 5.5 almost seems small.The less common design feature is the removable back. One of which is a leather backing, as mine has. It still looks & feels good. Bit of a plastic feel, but provides nice grip when holding it. There is an ongoing trend towards phones that look and feel premium, but dont function as a premium phone should. Honestly, features like removable battery and expandable storage are far more important to me. And thats not to say it feels or looks cheap. The G4 has a solid feel and looks great.OS & FEATURESBack with the G2, LG basically did a poor job of copying Samsungs throw every feature possible at the phone and see what sticks. It was clunky, slow, and disorganized. Since the G3 and now G4, that has all changed for the better. While they still have far more features than youll ever use, its much more organized, and functional. The OS is now smooth and fluid. And thats despite the AT&T bloatware you cant remove (you can hide it).And well, I could write a whole separate review on individual LG features. Days later Im still finding new things to play with. But some of the more noteworthy are the screen tap to wake/sleep, battery monitor that lets you know what apps are getting resource happy, smart cleaning (helps remove apps you dont use), location based profiles, & split screen multitasking.While Im a big fan of stock Android and faster updates, Ill gladly take the extras if basic performance & functionality doesnt take a hit. And there's enough usable and practical features that I haven't missed the stylus of my Galaxy Note phones, which is really the only thing I noticed ""missing"" vs Samsung. At the time of this review, we're still looking at Lollipop 5.1.PERFORMANCEStutter and lag are some of the most annoying features in a phone. And a big reason why Ive taken a break from Samsung phones. As noted in the OS section above, the user interface runs great. The hexa core CPU has no problem handling whatever I've thrown at it.Im not big on synthetic benchmarks for phones these days. Who cares if you get a ""high score,"" if real-world performance suffers. Swiping, pinching, opening/closing apps, are all nice and smooth. Right on-par with my stock Google Nexus 6. Sure, larger apps may take an extra second to open/close, but this is quite normal, and they run great overall.Gaming is another benefit of high-end specs. Here they are free to run at their highest settings while looking fantastic and smooth. The one thing I will note is that if pushed hard for an extended period of time, the phone does get a bit warm. In particular when going through the initial setup, downloading a bunch of apps, etc. These days, that seems to be the norm with the latest & greatest top spec chips. And overall, a minor issue.DISPLAYAfter having used so many OLED displays, its often difficult going back to a normal IPS LCD. However, the 5.5 Quad HD IPS Display on the LG G4 looks excellent. Even right next my OLED Nexus 6 and my Dell Venue 10 7000, the LG display easily holds its own. Solid (if not quite OLED) black levels, very sharp images, natural looking colors, great viewing angles, no light bleed, etc. Its just a nice screen to look at it.With the LG G3, you really did notice lesser screen quality and poor black levels compared to the newer IPS/OLED displays. Not so here anymore. LG has really made some nice improvements. The only possible negative is that the color temperature is on the very cool side. In other words, whites tend to look a bit blueish when you push the brightness. Which by the way, is fairly bright, and no issues with outdoor visibility. So really, not a big deal and usually comes down to personal preferences. Besides, youll probably get used to it either way.LG has also tweaked auto-brightness so it dims far more than it should, even when adjusting it's sensitivity via included controls. So thatll be left disabled for now. Beyond that, not much in the way of display adjustments.CAMERAFor a phone, this is definitely one of the best rear-facing cameras youre going to find. The 16MP camera has OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) which helps avoid blur from moving your phone around. The flash is average brightness. Another nifty feature of the LG G3 and now G4, is use of lasers to help focus faster and more accurately. And in my testing, I found it do so perfectly. It had no issues quickly adjusting to changing front and foreground focus, as needed.I wont go into all of the extra camera features. If youve used a modern smartphone, it's got those features, plus a ton of extra options for different scenarios and customization. But lets face it, other than the occasional panoramic shot, most of us are going to stick with automatic. And it works great, regardless of shooting conditions.One surprising spec is the front camera, which is 8MP. Considering how many folks are taking selfies these days, it makes sense that manufactures start putting a decent camera on the front. Theres obviously no flash, OIS, or laser focus. But it still takes better pictures than some cheap rear facing cameras.BATTERYThis is one of those features that seems to be at the bottom of the list for phone manufactures who are more interested in making phones as thin as physically possible. The 3000mAh battery combined with some helpful software improvements means youll likely get better than average battery life, as I did.In my use, I was easily seeing 5+ hours screen-on time, and could easily last an entire day with moderate usage. Thats a little over half brightness, watching videos, surfing, a game here and there, etc. Your mileage will absolutely vary. And even with that said, I do still wish the battery was a tad larger. As with most phones, if you decide to really push it, such as high brightness, lots of screen-on time, a high-end game running, youll still be looking for a charger by dinner time.Im probably just being picky, but I love big batteries. And its still noticeably better than the Galaxy S6 and Nexus 6. Plus, with fast charging, its easy to top off in less than a hour. Assuming you havent drained the battery (which you shouldnt). Or, just carry around a spare battery and swap it out! You know, because you can. Not to mention aftermarket extended battery solutions that are starting to show up.SOUNDThere is one speaker, and its on the back. You know, right where you hold it with your hand. Why phone manufacturers insist on doing this is beyond my comprehension. In particular with large screen phones that are more likely to be used for media consumption. Watching youtube, short episode here and there, etc. It's in the wrong location.With that said, the speaker is surprisingly very loud and clear. This little guy has no problems being heard when you crank up the volume. Even when I tried to intentionally cover it up (which isnt hard to do), the sound waves still found a way to escape. Albeit a bit muffled. Its no excuse for the placement, but itll do.CONCLUSIONIf the phone had front stereo speakers and a larger battery, it would be near perfect. But Im afraid no phone is perfect. So I simply look for one that has most of the important stuff covered. And I have to say, the LG G4 does that nearly perfectly.And the cons? Well, lets face it. Theyre few and relatively minor. In fact, its so good it might just tear me away from the 6 OLED screen and stereo speakers that Ive become hooked with on my N6. If only the screen were biggerOverall, I consider this phone highly recommended for those in the market for a larger high-end smartphone that can pretty much do it all. 4.7 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WCUIM9G6NRRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMGSDRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WCUIM9G6NRRZ","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I go through phones every couple months. And as such, I go through Seidio cases every couple months. In other words, if I'm buying a new phone, it's going to have a Seidio Case with Holster. I've gone through so many other cheap and even expensive cases, and they never quite do what I want them to do. Most just have a simple goal, protect the phone, and maybe look cool. Who cares about functionality.Well, apparently Seidio does. This case is a hard plastic material with a felt lining on the inside. It has a matte finish that does a good job of resisting fingerprints. While not 100% immune, it's easy enough to wipe down. It's got all of the right cut-outs for my Nexus 6's microphone, micro-USB port, side buttons, headphone jack, and of course, the camera. It's easy to install as it simply snaps together via it's two-piece design. And unlike some of the earlier generations, it's MUCH easier to remove now.This case clips into a matching belt holster with a large clip, which is made of equally solid plastic and a felt lined interior to protect the screen. But more to make you feel better, really. The latch at the top makes for very simple use as I can insert and remove one-handed all day long.There is a metal kick-stand on the back, which is held closed via magnet. I don't use this too often. But it is very nice to have. I do wish they'd redesign it for the big ones. The weight distribution of the large phones, especially the Nexus 6, means it's not super stable. It still works. Minor issue.Overall, I highly recommend these cases for anybody looking for a good combination of protection, portability, and functionality. Plus, it looks nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9V6ZUUH59V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6T9YTK#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9V6ZUUH59V6","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I decided to use my 09 GMC Sierra Denali truck as a good test subject. I'm very picky when it comes to cleaners for my truck. But this looked harmless enough. And given it's relative age and the life it's led partially exposed to the Texas heat, the rubber seals definitely needed a good protectant. It's also got a fiberglass toneau cover with rubber seals which are likely exposed to even more of the hot stuff.First, I just went over all of the rubber with a natural cleaner. Ensuring to get all sides of the seals, including the back. Then simply shake and apply the 303 protectant via the included applicator, which is part of the bottle. Due to it's design, it won't get into tight spots. So I just used a blue shop towel to both get in those crevices as well as go over everything again. It's easy enough to apply directly to the towel, as needed. This helped provide an even and thorough coating.Then that's it. No mess, easy to apply, no artificial shine, very simple. It's not meant to repair or add shine. Just a seal/protectant. Which is exactly what it does. It's even got a nice smell to it. What's not to like?

"First, I should note these are review units. But they appears to be used/returns as one was kind of moving around freely in the packaging and not much documentation. I'd assume they were testing first, so I'll also conclude that any issues are ""normal,"" unless told otherwise. :)This kit basically includes two separate lights. One plugs into AC power, it's a little brighter, and is activated via motion sensing. The other isn't quite as bright, but is battery powered via 6 AA batteries (included), and is touch activated. This one is meant to be hung or stuck to something. Both have adjustable slider to control brightness, and that's about it.The plug-in version will take up the entire wall plug. Depending on where it's going, could be an issue. When the brightness level is anything less than max, there is a slightly audible high-pitch noise. In a quiet room, it was easily noticeable. There is a light sensor on top, but with no way to adjust it. So it requires a bit of light to prevent the LED from turning on. In the morning, it'll still turn on. The motion sensor is very sensitive, easily able to detect movement several feet away. If approaching from the side, less than 2-3 feet or so.The battery powered version, while not quite as bright, still provides enough light to see what's going on in the room. It too is very basic. Just tap to turn on/off, adjust brightness level, and that's it. No issues with noises on this model. And since it's LED, the batteries should last quite awhile.Overall these lights are quite handy to keep around the house. I've got one in the hallway (which the toddler has been quite fascinated with) so you've automatically got light when walking the house at night. And the battery powered one is under my computer desk. Infinitely helpful for working on the PC or digging through cables and such. Or just to provide some back lighting.I'll give these a reserved recommendation as they are a little buggy and no adjustments on the light sensor, motion detector, light duration, etc. So just be aware of the features and limitations and grab 'em on sale.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBDJE3U3N05I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKJXNQU#wasThisHelpful","RCBDJE3U3N05I","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love butter on my popcorn. How people eat plain popcorn is beyond me. In either case, I must add my own butter. At the theater, you have to ""layer the butter"" yourself these days. Which is somewhat annoying as they don't do it for you anymore. I'm already paying over $6 for popcorn, and you can't even add butter the way I want?Fortunately, that complaint is no longer an issue. Since I got a basic popper, this movie theater button, and seasoning. Just look around this listing, they're usually all purchased together.

"The SoundLogic Charger is basically a charging station for your smart phone and tablets. It has an AC wall plug and 3 slots to hold your devices, whatever it might be. Then take your USB cable and connect it to the charger, which will be on the top, on the inside. For this reason, you may want to consider purchasing shorting USB cables or maybe stuff them in the back. Unfortunately there is no real cable management included here.You also aren't able to adjust the spacing for the slots that hold your gadgets. The one at the back is large enough for just about any tablet I could throw at it. From the Venue 10 7000 to a Nexus 7, they all fit fine, even with a case. The middle/front slots are a bit tighter. A smaller phone like a Galaxy S4 fit comfortably. But my Nexus 6 with a Seidio case was very snug.Then you've got the infamous blue LED that hides next to the USB ports. Yes, it's very bright, and you can't turn it off. You can put some tape over it, however. If you don't, it'll certainly light up the room at night as its directed upward.Back to the 3 USB ports. Only one is a full 2.1A, the other two are 1A. So if your device is sitting on here overnight, not a big deal. If you're looking for a quick charge, you'll need to decide which device is more important. Since that's how I'm using it, it was able to charge my Nexus 7, Nexus 6, and Venue 10 7000 overnight just fine. Although once again, due to the limited spacing, the 10"" tablet ended up sitting on the table.Which somewhat defeats the purpose of this item. I can live with the bright blue LED and slightly low charging speed for some of the ports. But non-adjustable slots really does limit it's usefulness for now. If you're devices happen to fit, won't be a problem. Or if you just want to use it as a 3-port station, that's fine. I set it up at a recent part and let folks ""dock"" in for a quick charge.Overall, I'll give it a reserved recommendation, depending on your needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTO5F61WL807/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S61L3BK#wasThisHelpful","RJTO5F61WL807","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I come to this machine from a bit of a unique standpoint: I've been sewing for over two decades now, and while I imagine the machines in the class where I learned to sew were fairly basic, I have primarily used my mom's higher-end sewing machines for the majority of the time I've been sewing, and especially in the past decade-plus. So coming to this machine (my very first machine that is truly MINE) was something of a step back for me, but I tried to not let my experience with high-end machines color my review of this product.If you have experience with sewing machines already, you could probably open the box, get the machine hooked up (there is one cord that connects the machine to power, and also connects the foot pedal to the machine, so it's a quick-and-easy setup), and start powering away. If this is your very first machine, I would recommend reading the enclosed manual first (of course, I'm generally of the opinion to always read the manual, anyway). The machine comes with a small bag of accessories neatly tucked away into the accessory tray compartment (that little box at the front of the machine that you remove to access the bobbin compartment). There's one bobbin already in the bobbin compartment, plus an additional 3 bobbins (4 total). Also included are 3 extra needles (in addition to the one already installed), 3 total feet (the ""all-purpose"" foot is already attached, plus there is a buttonhole foot and a zipper foot), a darning plate, 2 spool pin felts, a needle plate screwdriver, and a small lint brush with a mini seam ripper hidden inside the handle. All of the accessories fit neatly into the compartment with room to spare.The first thing I did was wind a bobbin. There are diagrams on the top of the machine that show you how to run the thread from the spool to the bobbin winder. The bobbin wound quickly, and the winder simply stopped winding once it was full, even if I kept my foot on the pedal. More diagrams on the top and front of the machine walk you through threading it, and the process is similar to every other sewing machine I've used. It lacks a needle threader, which is handy to have, but I suppose not necessary. If you have issues with threading the needle, a hand-held needle threader (http://www.amazon.com/CottageCutz-CNT1-2-in-1-Needle-Threader/dp/B000YZ462E/ for example) can still be used to help get the thread through the eye.Lead-footed drivers beware: the machine goes FAST. I'm accustomed to the speed control on my mom's machines, where you can set a top speed and, no matter how much you put the pedal to the metal (or carpet, wood, tile, whatever your flooring is), it won't exceed it. The only speed control on this machine comes from how much pressure you apply to the foot pedal, so definitely take it easy! I'm not deducting any stars from the machine for the lack of speed control, because it's not a ""missing feature,"" since nowhere does the information on the machine suggest it has this feature, it's simply something I'm used to from higher-end machines. If this is an issue for you, you may want to consider looking at a different machine.Another feature from higher-end machines that I noticed was not included on this machine was a button to set the needle so that it stops either down or up. Of course, there's a knob on the right side of the machine that raises and lowers the needle, but it can sometimes be handy to have the needle stop down, without trying to time taking your foot off the pedal just right. Again, not worthy of a star deduction, because this is a basic machine, but something to consider. After all, if the needle stops in a position different than what you need (up, down, or anywhere in between), you can simply turn the knob and put the needle where you need it.The lever to raise & lower the presser foot is easy to manage with just a finger, and it can lift the presser foot a fairly decent height, beyond the raised ""resting"" position. There is a thread-cutter located on the left side of the machine. A lever on the front right of the machine allows for easy back-stitching. The big round dial at the top front of the machine (with the blue S in the center) is your stitch-selector: line up the stitch you want with the little marking at the top center, and you're good to go. It includes 3 lengths of straight stitch, 3 zig-zag widths, satin-stitch, blind hem, scallop, and the three parts to the four-step buttonhole stitch (steps 2 & 4 use the same part). There is also a dial a bit to the left of the stitch selector where you can adjust the tension of the stitching, but you'll probably want to leave it on ""4"" for a good majority of your straight stitching, and the manual succinctly covers how to check if the tension is ""good"" for what you're doing, as well as how to adjust it.Overall, it is a nice little machine, great for beginners and those who don't really need all the bells and whistles that come with higher-end machines. I tested it out on both muslin and flannel (the fabrics I had available scraps of), and it held up well on both. If you want to work on heavy-duty fabrics (corduroy, denim, upholstery fabric, etc), you will need to buy the appropriate needles, likewise for the ""wispier"" fabrics such as chiffon. When buying the fabric, an employee should be able to help you find the appropriate needles for your machine and fabric. I give this machine 5 stars because it does what it says it does: it gives beginners a nice little launching pad without overwhelming them with extra features.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23E4P6G7FJXFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV4ZWBQ#wasThisHelpful","R23E4P6G7FJXFO","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ Good Build Quality+ eSATA & USB 3 Ports+ 4 Gigabit Ports+ Fast dual core CPU+ Descent range for only 2 antenna+ Smart Wi-Fi Setup for console access virtually anywhere+ Easy to use interface+ Lots of extra features & customization+ OpenWRT compatible+ Dual Band (2.4Ghz & 5Ghz)CONS:- Expensive for what it does- Bridge or ""Access Point"" mode removes all extra features- Not as fast as cheaper routers which have more antennas- USB Drive speeds not very fast (i.e. NAS)Like many of us, I've owned countless access points over the years. Including the original Linksys WRT54 series that came out back in early 2000.  I'm currently using a TP-Link C5 AC1200 Wireless Router, which has has comparable specs, except it has 6 antenna instead of the two here. Oh, and it costs about $100 less.OUT OF THE BOX & SETUPAs is typical these days for access points, you don't get a whole lot. Just throw the antennas on the box and follow the quick setup guide. Which in this case, is pretty straight forward. You can either connect via LAN or Wireless and are given the option of using the Wizard or manual configuration. For most folks connecting to your modem, the wizard is the way to go.It's able to quickly identify your internet connection and help setup your Access Point names, passwords, etc. From there you, you call it a day and enjoy the internet. Although if you're buying this access point, you're interested in more than this.ADVANCED FEATURESIf there's a feature that Access Points are pushing these days, this router has it all. You've got guess access points modes, tons of parental controls, FTP server, auto-update, etc. The two worth special mention here is the NAS (Network Area Storage) and Smart Wi-Fi. The NAS is very simple to setup.Simply connected my Seagate USB 3.0 drive to the USB port and you're done. Go to the NAS section in the setup interface to get the IP and connect from any system. You have other options such as setting permissions and such. Otherwise, it's ready to go. My main issue here was that it wasn't very fast. Speeds were limited to around 10Mb/s, give or two a few Mb. It didn't matter if I was on 2.4, 5Ghz, or connected via LAN. It just didn't want to go very fast.If speed isn't an issue, Smart Wi-Fi brings some nice added functionality. You basically create an account with Linksys and it allows you to remotely manage your device from anywhere with internet connectivity. This is particular useful if you want to access the files stored on your drive elsewhere. Quite handy.ACCESS POINT / BRIDGE MODEIf you use the wizard, it'll actually automatically detect that you have an existing internet and set itself up so you've got internet. Although it's using DHCP, switches to a whole different subnet, etc. In other words, this isn't ideal. You can try to manually configure some settings to work around this, but it never worked right. You pretty much have to set it to Bridge mode.Which does work. I configured a static IP and my own DHCP/DNS servers took over. Everything good to go. However, it disables every single advanced features. No guest mode, USB storage, Smart Wi-Fi, all gone. For those of us doing this, jumping over to OpenWRT is clearly the best option.PERFORMANCESo how fast did it go. The best AC speeds on 5Ghz were around 35Mb/s average, with a few peaking at about 40Mb/s. And that's only a couple feet away. If I switched back to my TP-Link C5, it was easily about 5Mb/s faster, on average. And it was able to maintain a slightly better signal at further distances. Nothing drastic, but it was noticeable, and expected. There are quite a few more antenna's.Gigabit LAN speeds were right as expected, up to and right around 100MB/s, so nothing out of the ordinary there. Although that is with transferring files over the LAN. As previously noted, using the USB storage was considerably slower.CONCLUSIONOverall, it's really not a bad access point. If you want a lot of features, functionality, and the ability to use OpenWRT, there aren't a lot of options. But if wireless speed is your top priority, there are other access points that cost considerably less, while still providing most of the important features folks are looking for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM9F7HUWDH6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN20T0#wasThisHelpful","R2HM9F7HUWDH6E","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ Pancake compressor has small footprint for it's capacity+ Two connectors for two different tools used as the same time+ Handle for easy transport+ Relatively light weight+ Covered motor to prevent burning+ Oil-Free & Maintenance Free Design+ Easy to read gauges+ Quickly fills up from empty+ Minimal vibration (it won't run away)+ High quality 25"" PVC hose with fittings included+ 16 & 18 GA Nailers includedCONS:- Somewhat noisy- Bit pricey- Only includes 1 hose- Other air tools would be niceOut of the box, you've got the compressor itself, a 25' PVC hose (with fittings), 18 GA nailer, and 16 GA finisher. That's about it, and is really all you need for to get nailing. Although including a 2nd hose would have been nice, as it does support the use of two tools at the same time.Compared to my existing Craftsman 3 Gal compressor, the specifications are very similar with regards to PSI and SCFM. The real difference is that this has a larger capacity and it's oil-free. While this does mean you don't need to ever change the oil or do any maintenance, the motor is a bit louder than I'd like. More so if used in an enclosed garage or house. Outdoors, it's not that big of an issue, and all somewhat common for this design.I ran it through several tests by nailing any piece of wood lying around the garage repeatedly to see how the nailers handled a ""stress test"" as well as the compressor itself. Although I don't recall doing this for actual ""work"" being this entertaining in the past. :) The nailers themselves are fairly basic and of the 'made in china"" variety. The quality feels descent, if not exactly ""expensive"" feeling. They seem to get the job done and don't show any signs poor quality that might cause an early failure. All of the nails went all the way in and looked great.Otherwise you can get a respectable amount of nailing done with a 6 GAL compressor. In particular one that can fill itself up in about 2-3 minutes, depending on how high you have the pressure set to. I suspect using two tools at once will keep it running more frequent, in which case you may want longer hoses to keep it outside.I do wish it came with other air tools, although I already have a few others laying around. Such as an air blowing tool and tire air chuck with gauge. Once again thanks to a good amount of air pressure and capacity, it had no issue quickly airing up the tires in our vehicles. Just as good as the Craftsman, except it didn't need to run quite as much.Overall, if you're looking for a solid compressor and have a need for the nailers, this is an excellent bundle. Just keep an eye out for sales as it's list price is clearly far more than it should be. And additional air tools aren't too much these days either. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTRHTLAQV7ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNM1TI#wasThisHelpful","R2KTRHTLAQV7ZZ","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I prefer using a large mouse pad for both gaming and office related tasks. It's nice having plenty of room to move around. Whether you're selecting a bunch of rows in excel or sniping away in Battlefield. As is the case with many gamer's, we probably have quite a few mouse pads laying around. It's hard to find one that works for everything. But I think this Turtle Beach premium mouse pad gets it done.It has a rubber back so it doesn't slide around on my wooden desk. And the cloth-like texture is quite nice. You can feel it as you move your hand across the surface, but it's not so rough that you'll even notice with the mouse. My Logitech G9X Gaming Laser mouse works perfectly. It's smooth, accurate, and I love it. Another bonus, is they won't get dirt build up like hard mouse pads do, which is quite annoying.Overall, if you're looking for a nice large textured gaming mouse pad that works for everything, look no further.

"I purchased this for use in my '09 GMC Sierra Denali truck along with my Galaxy Tab S 10.5 LTE tablet. The idea being that I could use this large tablet as my main navigation and music device, instead of the out-dated unit that came with the truck. Basically, it really doesn't work all that well on the go. Even on smooth roads, there is just too much movement allowed by it's cheap plastic construction. For some, they may not notice or care, but it really bothers me.I'm using the thickest pad so it stays in the cd-tray rather securely. It could be tighter, but it's the assembly itself that has a hard time staying still with a ~1lb tablet. The naturally firm ride of a full size truck doesn't help, but even on smooth roads, I expected better. However, I do like the vertical adjustments and it does put the tablet at a great viewing position. Even though it does block the vents in my vehicle.I plan on keeping it for use when I'm parked and want to watch a movie or something.

"It's fairly common these days to have multiple pairs of sunglasses for different occasions. I note this first as it's important to realize these aren't likely going to be worn 100% of the time. I've yet to come across a pair that work for everything, no would I want them to. These are meant for outdoor activity use. Which is exactly where I've been using them, and they work great.Doing yard work, outdoor shooting, or just going for a walk. As they are polarized, they do an excellent job at blocking the harsh rays and glare of the sun. I can have the sun right in my peripheral vision and it doesn't even bother me a bit.They are a mostly plastic construction, somewhat flexible, and are extremely light. I can barely even notice I'm wearing them most of the time.While you can use them for driving, the only issue is the obvious fact that they are polarized. Many displays and screens will become invisible at an angle. No surprises there.Otherwise these are my new go-to shades for my many outdoor activities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ0A7FBELA359/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009I2XM6K#wasThisHelpful","RJ0A7FBELA359","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The housing is rather compact and sits nicely on top of the Xbox One. It basically draws hot air up and out towards the back. It uses a single USB port for power, and provides another single USB port to replace the one it used. My headset worked just fine in this port. The top of the surface is rubberized so it's a safe place to put a headset or controllers without risk of scratching the console.It also has a small LED display on the front, facing upward. This shows ambient and supposedly internal temperatures. Once the temp gets below 86 degrees, it'll automatically turn off. Although it's so quiet, you'll never know if it's on or off unless you look at the display on top. Which yes, really should be on the front.But how does it actually work? To confirm it's claims of lowing temps ""up to 30%,"" I grabbed my trusty infrared thermometer. The ambient temperature reading is pretty much dead on. Great. The internal, or even external temp of the housing, is on the low side, by at least 10 degrees. It's most likely not reading the hot spot towards the front/middle area.Without the X-1 Cooler, My Xbox One was hitting around 110 - 115 degrees at peak gaming while playing Destiny for awhile, as indicated by the infrared thermometer. Ambient temps were 78 Degrees. After the cooler had been on for awhile, temps dropped by about 5 degrees. They advertised ""up to"" 30% lower temps, which we're clearly nowhere near.Perhaps if you have a really tight space with ventilation out the back, it could be a bit more effective. But in my A/V rack, there is already descent air-flow. But I'm always all for a drop in temps, since as we know, heat is a big electronics killer. I'm not going to turn down even a couple degree drop. And if you do in fact have your console in an enclosed area, you need to work out ventilation there first. Cut some holes in the back or something. This does no good if it doesn't have both cool air at the intake and a place to exhaust the hot air.Overall, I have reserved recommendations for the X-1 Cooler. In most cases, you're probably better off doing as noted above to help reduce internal temps vs hoping something like this is going to save the day. It'll help, just not quite as much as you might like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WRFAHMPX6Z7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P45U43O#wasThisHelpful","R2WRFAHMPX6Z7V","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have Bermuda grass in Central Texas and it goes dormant over the winter time. Every year, the weeds take the opportunity to take over the lawn. And every year I try different chemicals, but ultimately end up having to crawl around pulling them up. And we're good for the rest of the year when the grass takes over again.In either case, I decided to try out the Ortho Weed B Gon Max Weed Killer on all of the weeds. There were so many, it used up the entire gallon. Which by the way, didn't ship with a sprayer. So I used one of my automatic sprayers from another product.I made sure to follow the directions, used a good amount on each weed. Checked back within 24 hours, and results were somewhat as expected. The crab grass and broadleaf weeds showed signs of being unhealthy, and the rest, were looking as healthy as ever.A week later, and they were still a dark shade of green. Hardly dead. I imagine if I waited long enough, they might eventually die off. But this is one slow acting chemical. Perhaps not concentrated enough? Either way I ended up having to pull them up by hand. Which was even more annoying since the top of the weed just popped off, leaving the root in place.Bottom line, it does technically work, if you are really patient, and only have a few types of weeds it covers. Otherwise I'd suggest just going another route, or simply pulling them up yourself. Then follow up with some entire-lawn chemicals to keep it in check. That's always worked best for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K4CPZTYIA4NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LD2CR0#wasThisHelpful","R1K4CPZTYIA4NA","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During this review, I'm going to focus on the important questions I had with regards to how it compares to my corded vacuum cleaners. More specifically, my current Dyson DC33 corded model that does a fairly good job with our moderately thick carpet. But first, the Pros's & Con's we'll be talking about.PROS:+ Light weight (12.7 lbs)+ Compact design+ Detachable canister unit for extra portability & functionality+ Long lasting Lithium Ion batteries (2 included)+ Bright LED light+ Relatively quiet in ""normal mode""+ Compact swivel floor roller very maneuverable in tight spaces+ Easy setup, operation, and cleaning+ Roller on/off switch+ Effective boost mode great for thick carpet+ Functional dusting attachments+ No cords!CONS:- Gets noisy in ""boost"" mode- No wide angle attachment for stairs or upholstery- Small canister needs more frequent emptying- Small floor surface area may require a few more passes- Must remove battery to see charge status- Bit PriceyOUT OF THE BOX & SETUPSometimes vacuum cleaners get a little over complicated in their attempt to do everything. And as such, setup and operation can become rather cumbersome. So it was a nice surprise being able to get the Hoover all unboxed and setup within a few minutes. All without even touching the instruction manual. Which by the way, is short, to the point, and well written.After the few separate components are put together, just install the batteries and off you go. The batteries already shipped with a mostly full charge and ready to go. There is a stand-alone charger provider, and is the only way to charge them. You've got 3 LED's on the battery itself to see how charged it is. You can only check this after removed from the vacuum cleaner.You'll also note it's equally easy to remove the canister for assembly and cleaning. However, it's obviously quite a bit smaller than a full size vacuum cleaner, and as such, will require more frequent emptying. Even removing the rollers to remove hair is simply, requiring removal of only two tabs.DAILY CARPET CLEANINGWe've got a 2-story house that's about 2,700 sq/ft with a whole lot of carpet and a bit of tile. The carpet is moderately thick and needs a good vacuum cleaner to really pull all of the dirt and dust out of it. I started with a fully charged battery and just ran it until the battery died. The battery lasted roughly 35-40 min or so until it died. It was also rather abrupt, and short of the 50 minutes advertised run-time, but that may be achievable if you turn off the brushes.The LED light on the canister is very bright. So bright, I was even able to vacuum the house as night with most of the lights turn off. Why? No practical reason other than to try it out. :) But even in a normal lit house, it's nice to have that extra light to see what you may run over.Speaking of which, I noticed this thing loves to eat cords. Most vacuum cleaners I've used in the past tend to push them out of the way, but this one is very eager to eat 'em up. Fortunately, if it gets stuck, the brushes turn off because causing any damage to the cables (or vacuum cleaner).Also a big fan of the maneuverability of the floor unit. While it's smaller size can be a negative in that it technically requires more passes in large areas, it also means you can squeeze into, around, and under far more objects around the house. It happily pivots and slides around like they aren't even there. Where as in the past, this would require breaking out a separate attachment or moving things around.STAIRS, DUSTING, & TILEThe stairs are also carpeted as is most of the house. So I found it rather nice to be able to remove the canister for this task. It's even lighter without the rest of the system. However, it's missing a very important accessory. The wide angle tool. It just has the crevice/brush attachment and an angled dusting attachment. The crevice tool is really impracticle for cleaning stairs. Even though the picture shows this being done, that person can't be happy about it.That alone is it's #1 biggest negative for me. The brush slides down on the crevice tool if needed and there is a nifty angled brush tool. It has an extension and it's adjustable to allow easy dusting in hard to reach areas, such as the top of cabinets, refrigerator, ceiling fans, etc. Very handy.And thanks to the easy-to-turn-off brushes, it'll happily glide over title and such up anything in it's path. No need to worry about dirty flying around.VS CORDED VAC (Dyson DC33)The big question and concern I had was whether or not it could replace my larger, more powerful Dyson DC33 vacuum cleaner. Our downstairs part of the house hadn't been vacuum in quite awhile. It was long over due, but would be a good testing surface. First, I started with one section and did a normal pass with the Hoover Air Cordless and noted it picked up a lot of dirt. Then followed up with the DC33. Unfortunately the Dyson did pickup some dust the cordless model missed.But wait, there's more. The Hoover has a ""Boost"" mode which in addition to becoming more noisy (louder than the DC33 at this setting), it sucks in way more dirt. I went to another near-by room and performed the same test. Except this time, the corded vac was unable to find any more dust. Excellent.The battery will take a bit of a hit running in Boost mode, but there's still plenty of power with 2 fully charged batteries for my house.CONCLUSIONTo answer the big question we started off with: Yes, this corded vacuum CAN replace a full size high-end corded vacuum cleaner. They're comparably priced and offer most of the same features and functionality. The benefits of it's smaller size and heft easily ""outweigh"" any con's with regards to a little less cleaning surface area. Two batteries was just enough to clean the entire house with a little juice left over.In either case, I certainly didn't miss the cords getting in the way. I was still able to clean the house in about the same amount of time, but with less fatigue and stress. What I did miss was the wide attachment for the stairs. This should be included in the box. And well, it could always be a little cheaper.Overall I'll give this a solid 4.5 stars and consider it highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX0OJLJ7JX4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","RRX0OJLJ7JX4H","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From working in the IT Support industry for nearly 20 years, I've spent a considerable amount of time working with network gear. Along with many other computer stuff, of course. Let's jump in and take a look at the Netgear ProSAFE 16-Port ""Click Switch.""DESIGNWe have to start with this first, as it is somewhat unique in the networking world. I've never seen a 16-port switch with this design. Most are compact or rack mounted designs that don't really change much in shape, just size. As you can see from the pictures this switch has a long narrow design, that's mean to be easily mounted under a desk, on a wall, post, etc. Given it's compact profile, it'll go just about anywhere.The power cord is angled and can go in either direction, depending on how you have it installed. So it can go straight down, or to the front. Then you've got your basic link and connectivity lights. And at that point, you're dealing with a normal switch.INSTALLThere is an optional bracket that allows easy removal. I simply used the two included screws to attach to the wall behind the small entertainment center in the media room / office. This room has about a dozen computers, large TV, media center, etc. So a 16 port switch is actually the minimum needed to ensure full network connectivity.Once the bracket was screwed in, the switch clicked right in. There is a tab on the top you push down to release. I did note that sometimes you have to push down on the tab for it to snap into place. Not a big deal. After all, you're not going to be removing it very often.There are also included straps that attach to the switch to assist with cable management. You can use them separately, but they are meant to be used with the switch since there are loops to run it through.SETUP & CONFIGThis switch is a ""managed"" switch, which certainly explains the cost. In other words, it has built-in software to provide many advanced features. In most home environments, they will probably never get used. But when you get into more complex home offices and small businesses, it starts to make a lot more sense. You can access these features via the included software (yes, there is a ""CD"") or via the website. Either way, the experience is comparable.The first thing you'll want to do is basic stuff you might do with a router. Setup the password, give it an IP address, and check out the advanced features to see what you might want to use. I won't go into how these features work, as that gets a bit more technical, but you've got VLAN, loop detection, QoS, Cable Testing, and much more. You can even check out ""port statistics"" to see how many bandwidth has gone through each port and how many CRC errors have occurred. Very handy.PERFORMANCEBut does it work fast enough? It sure does. For my ""stress test"" I fired up 6 computers and had them transferring files between each other. All while playing around with the management interface. Bottom line, it had no problem holding at 100-105MB/s transfer rates for all 3 sessions that were running simultaneously. That tells me we've got full gigabit and a back plane that can handle some serious bandwidth.CONCLUSIONIt's important to realize that once you get it managed switches, that you are getting into pricier territory. So if you don't think you'll ever use these features, there are cheaper options. But for those wanting advanced options for current needs or even some ""future proofing,"" this is the way to go. Add in it's unique form factor and flexible installation options and you've got what I consider, a highly recommended switch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32W6XAJM1K27Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CI20#wasThisHelpful","R32W6XAJM1K27Q","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As somebody with allergies, I try to keep a dust-free house. While that's virtually impossible, frequent dusting is a must. I normally use swiffer combined with a hand-held unit that makes things far easier to quickly and effectively dust a room. The issue with the ""dust wipes"" is that you have to use your hand and essentially ""touch"" everything you want to dust.On their own, they do technically work better than swiffer when it comes to collecting dust. One swipe is all I needed and no more sign of dust. Everything from furniture to electronics, it does quite well. Although the surface isn't quite smooth enough that I'd trust it on the screens of your gadgets. Try it at your own risk! I also tried ""cleaning"" some surfaces, such as dirty keyboard. That didn't work well at all. Stick to dusting. :)Overall, it works well on it's own, for it's intended purpose. I like being able to grab one when some quick dusting is needed. For example, my shiny Xbox One needed dusting. I'm done in a second. No need to go grab the swiffer. But when I need to dust the whole room/house, there are more efficient ways to go.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V1HUTX7W2FCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMSX1W0#wasThisHelpful","R1V1HUTX7W2FCV","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used countless mounts over the year. In fact, I have a drawer full of them. Mostly because they don't work, break, or I find something slightly better. I was previously using the 2 part Pro-Clip mount solution, which includes a dash mount + device holder. In my case, that is currently the Galaxy Note 3. The holder was universal so it would work with the case on my phone. It worked alright, but inserting and removing was a little annoying at times.Plus, I wanted to buy a larger extended battery, which had a larger case, and simply wasn't going to work well in that holder. So along comes the iOauto Pro mount.First, the suction cup mount works about as well as can be expected. It has a latch that helps it really stick to the windshield and it's certainly not going anywhere. Although for my primary use, it's going to be used with ProClip dash mount in my 09 GMC Sierra Denali truck. The ProClip mount just clips onto the dash. It's quite secure on it's own.Then the iOauto quite literally screws right in like it was meant to work with it, just like the ProClip device holder. You can toss any extra adapters it includes. That part is done. Next you'll have to stick a metal plate to your phone or case. This is so the magnet can do it's job. My case is plastic, so I was hoping it would stick perfectly. It did not. Even after cleaning the surface and allowing to sit for awhile, it fell off on the first use.This magnet is very, very strong. iOAuto knows this. So I'm not sure why the adhesive is so weak. Not a big deal. Nothing a little super glue couldn't fix. Once again, don't recommend applying this directly to a phone. A cheap case? No problem. That metal plate is going nowhere now.This silver part you see is basically a metal ""dome"" that the round black thing (magnet) sticks to. This allows the magnet to slide just about anywhere you'd like, in any position along the sphere. So once your phone is attached, it's easy to move around, yet stays put the rest of the time.I drive a fairly powerful truck, and, well, it drives like a truck. So I need something that can stay in place regardless of how I'm driving. Mounts that bounce around or vibrate are unacceptable. Rough roads, hard turns, fast stops, starts, etc. Doesn't matter. This phone is rock solid in this mount.TIP: If you want to remove the phone, just tilt it sideways. Just like you would for any magnet. If you pull it off directly, the magnet itself may decide to stick to the phone.Overall, I consider this highly recommended. Easily the best mount I've ever purchased. I just wish it came with better adhesive and was a bit cheaper. And if you don't like things stuck to the windshield, which I hate, grab a Pro-Clip dash mount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNHV0CB1EEP7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG3G6U6#wasThisHelpful","RNHV0CB1EEP7G","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allow me to preface this review by saying that I am very much not a ""beauty is pain"" type  I like my beauty to be as unpainful as possible. I've never had anything waxed, preferring to shave to remove body hair, so that's all I have to compare the experience of this hair removal product to.So far as hair removal goes, this product performs decently. It does take a few sweeps of the same area to remove all the hair, and I even discovered several days later that I had missed a few spots, but it does provide excellent long-term hair removal: as I write this review, it's been 6 days since I used it on my legs, and aside from the spots I'd missed, there's no sign yet of regrowth. Definitely handy if you're going to be traveling and don't want to bother with lugging shaving accoutrements with you. Or if you're lazy like me (or, also like me, have tiny children and have to work in showering/shaving time around their naps) and live somewhere with warm weather and don't want to have to shave several times a week in order to keep smooth legs while wearing shorts (I am definitely looking forward to wearing shorts more often this summer).Now, the downside. This thing HURTS (on both the speeds available). Like I prefaced, I'm not big on the whole pain for beauty thing, so I was gritting my teeth the whole time I was giving this thing a whirl. Of course, it's yanking your hair out at the roots, so of course it hurts. If you're a regular waxer, you probably wouldn't mind it nearly as much. If you're a regular shaver, it'll take some getting used to, so whether the payoff of longer-term smooth legs is worth the pain is entirely up to you. Personally, I'll probably stick with shaving unless I'm planning on traveling and/or planning on wearing shorts/skirts/dresses for several days.The epilator comes with two heads: one for legs/arms/any other large space, and a smaller one for underarms/bikini line/other small space. I have not worked up the nerve to try the smaller one on the underarms or bikini line, but I suspect it works just the same as the larger one, which I have used on my legs. It also comes with a ""gentle cap"" that it recommends for beginners, but I hadn't figured out how to use it when I was testing it out. Now that I've more closely read the book, I will give it another try (once I have hair to try it on again) and possibly update my review. There is also a ""sonic exfoliation head"" that is basically the most fantastic thing EVER. I am horrible on my feet, but using the exfoliation head in conjunction with my body scrub on my feet made that skin feel all soft and like new. Even if I never again used this to remove hair, I would continue to use the exfoliation head. We're BFFs now.Where stars are lost:1 star is lost due to the fact that I do have to make several sweeps of an area to remove all hair, regardless of what speed I have it on. Even the first few sweeps, before hair could potentially be causing a clog, don't clear the area well.1 star is lost due to the fact that my shower gel does not ""lather"" as the product materials suggest it should: both the box and the book recommend adding just a small drop of liquid shower gel to the epilation head after getting it wet, then running it to create a lather. This never happened with mine, and if I turned it off after trying to work up a lather, I could clearly see that the gel stayed entirely within the lines of the one blade area where it was initially applied. I eventually found that slathering my legs with shower gel first was the only way to get the epilation head to work up a lather.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2415E40G4O0C6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KS6XWII#wasThisHelpful","R2415E40G4O0C6","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PACKAGINGFirst, I should note the fact that the package has a shipping weight of 140lbs. UPS only dropped off at the front porch, so keep that in mind for moving it around. It's not light weight at all! Stork Craft did a good job packaging everything into a neat and tight box. Almost too good, actually. It was nearly impossible to get the inner box, out of the larger box it shipped it. It required basically tearing the whole thing apart.Which is what you'll probably end up doing if you don't have enough help to carry the box up stairs or into the room that it'll go into. Just open it up and take it in piece by piece! Otherwise, packaging was good.ASSEMBLYI've assembled many things over the years, but was a little surprised when we started working on this one. I had 2 other folks helping throughout the process, and we all agreed. This was probably a bit more difficult than necessary. For example, there are several points where you must use the included angled Allen wrench to tighten down screws. Most of them are in recessed cut-outs of the wood. Meaning, those nifty power tools probably aren't going to help much!This also means after you get them finger tight, you'll have to do the rest a quarter turn at a time. This gets quite tiresome after a while. The normal Phillips screws were much easier as they were out in the open and were easily accessible with my 20v B&D Driver. Most of the wood pieces even have a wooden peg to help align everything during installation.Which is quite helpful until you got the drawer assembly, which only has a single peg in the middle when attaching the sides, then you add two screws. Two pegs would have made this considerably easier to align and put together. Once again, little things like this made it harder than necessary.Bottom line, I'd highly recommend at least two people when assembly this unit.OVERALLBut let's face it, assembly and packaging are really minor things. Once you put it all together, what's important is how it looks and feels. We're working with good quality materials here. You've got a nice fresh varnish smell, the Espresso color looks great, and the drawers function smoothly. It even matches the crib quite nicely. The wood feels heavy and solid. So naturally, the whole dresser feels solid.It's only upon closer inspection that you see signs of ""customer assembly"" versus being assembled by the manufacture. There's a slight gap and at the top corner, where two wood pieces just aren't quite perfect. Step back and you won't even notice them. So considering the price and final construction, I think you'll be quite pleased with the dresser unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34F71PTGYSZQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M42XZG8#wasThisHelpful","R34F71PTGYSZQ3","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I frequently wear briefs and boxers, but never at the same time! I'd just wear whatever was needed for the occasion, such as when more support is required. I'd go with briefs. Or just a leisurely weekend, I'd go with boxers. So I was intrigued at the idea of having two-in-one. Not to mention the performance aspirations of the X-Temp material.At first, I actually found them to be a little awkward and uncomfortable. They are somewhat form fitting around the thighs and buttocks area. Almost like a spandex type material, so that you are quite aware of them. I mean, it is 100% polyester, not cotton. But they do leave some room around the crotch area, while still providing support. Very similar to your typical briefs in that regard.I went through various activities as I tested them out. Everything from extensive yard work, running, to another busy day in the office. At first, once again, I was quite aware of them and kept noticing minor movement around my legs/crotch. But after the 3 days and 3 pairs, I actually became quite accustomed to them. I hardly notice them any more and I like the added comfort.I really can't say that I noticed any extra heat dissipation, but they do dry rather quickly. Although expect that sweat will still gather in open areas where the material isn't making direct contact. So make sure these do fit securely. They aren't supposed to be loose and baggy. I wear size 34 and medium was perfect (see size chart).While I'm not quite seeing much in the way of boxer replacements in the Ultimate X-Temp garment, they are more of a long-leg pair of briefs with a bit more crotch space. Overall, I consider these recommended for just about any person or occasion. And as an added bonus, my wife likes the feel and form fitting nature of them. :) Just give yourself time to adjust and I think most folks will like them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDLIKNTPK46O3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LCS087O#wasThisHelpful","RDLIKNTPK46O3","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Out of the box, it ships as an OEM drive. So you just get the HD in a plastic casing and static bag. No cables or documentation. Which makes perfect sense as most DVR's are already going to provide power and SATA cables. All you'll need to do is screw it in with the provided screws and you're good to go. It also arrived unformatted, which is nice.The first thing to note is that not all hard drives are the same. They may have the same basic size and specs, but there's a lot more going on with the controller and internal components. Which is why larger servers and high-end workstations will frequently use much beefier hard drives that are meant to be more reliable and last longer.This new hard drive from Seagate appears to use a few terms commonly referenced on those drives, although it's clearly leaning closer to the consumer space than Enterprise. This drive is meant to be used in Surveillance DVR systems where it will run 24/7 and need to be accessed immediately for on-demand needs.Before installation, I did plug it into my custom workstation via the 6GB SATA port for some CrystalDIskMark benchmarks. It managed right about 160MB/s Sequential Read/Write and for the Random 4K tests, Read/Write were 0.58 / 1.44 MB/s. Sequential is what's mostly being used and is plenty fast for what it will be used for.I've installed it with my Q-See 8-Channel QC308 DVR unit. I chose this unit in particular unit since it ships without a drive and is meant for you to provide your own. As this is a standard 3.5"" SATA drive, it installed and worked perfectly. It's been running for about a week, testing with scheduled and motion activated recording. So far, it's worked as well as you can expect.The long-term reliability claims are just one of those things you won't know for quite awhile. But I'll certainly update should anything change in the future. Even though this technically worked just as well as the old off-the-shelf 2TB drive that was previously in the DVR, it's still price reasonably and it's always nice to have some extra reliability features thrown in. Either way, for what it is, I consider it recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNTWSFWS2ULL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JW53C5Y#wasThisHelpful","R2PNTWSFWS2ULL","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pillow has a rather dense and heavy feel to it. It's firmer than most memory foam pillows I've used in the past. But it's still soft enough to provide some give when pressure is applied. The ""cool gel"" blue pad you see in the pictures can barely be felt through the two layers of cloth as it comes out of the packaging. Add on your own pillow case and you'll likely forget about it a few seconds later.You do notice the cooling effect though. I have another ISO Cool pillow and found this one to last longer and doesn't get warm after a while. Most cooling pillows/sheets are only cool at first, then get warm once your body heat gets into the mix. But I found the gel to get the job done much better.The pillow does have a noticeable synthetic odor, which is noted on a card that ships with the pillow. It says to air out for 24 hours. I have a rather sensitive nose, and I could still notice the odor 2 weeks later. I'm hoping it goes away. Fortunately it's not repulsive or anything; I'd just rather not smell it.The real reason for 5 stars? The first night I used the pillow I slept better than I have all week. I don't like super soft pillows that go flat immediately. And I don't want to lay down on a rock. This pillow hits the perfect balance for optimal comfort while staying cool throughout the night.

"I just like chewing gum, in general. Always been a fan. It tastes good and gives your teeth something to do in-between meals. My favorite is the one that has the shortest lasting flavor. Bubble mint. In fact, none of them really last a super long time. So I just grab a couple pieces and chew them all at the same time.Which is probably why I go through a 15 pack so quickly. I grab one of these variety packs and a separate 15 pack of bubble mint, since that goes the fastest. If the taste and activity isn't enough to justify the cost, it does help keep my teeth clean.

"Unfortunately, the less popular phones are left with limited options for cases. Especially if you need a holster case, as I do. I hate having anything in my pockets, especially a phone. More so given the fact that this is a 6"" phone! I'd normally go with something like a Seidio case/holster, but this was all they had.You'll pretty much find this exact case under different brands. Sometimes they get good reviews, sometimes not so much. Which doesn't make sense since they are the same thing.You have a rubber case that slides onto the phone. It's rather loose, so don't expect to use this without the plastic bracket that attaches to the back of the case. This provides additional protection and helps keep it secure. It also adds noticeable bulk to the phone, which isn't ideal. Then you slide it into the belt holster. This part isn't as easy as it should be due to added friction. In particular when the exposed loose portion of the rubber covering gets caught on something.You also have a pop-out plastic stand for watching movies in landscape mode. This really doesn't work well at all. It's extremely difficult to open it with your fingers. I just pretend it's not there. Much easier.If you can find a better holster, go for it.

"PROS:+ Light weight package+ Very portable & compact+ Nice 2-in-1 Tool+ Adjustable power settings+ Simple assembly+ Retractable cord*+ Flexible floor nozzle (i.e. ""Turbo Floor Tool"")CONS:- Bit pricey- Retractable cord can be finicky- Not ideal for thick carpet- Spinning bristles can't be turned off- Plastic connectors don't always want to cooperate- Noisy on hard surfaces with floor nozzleOUT OF THE BOX & SETUPAs there aren't very many parts, setup and assembly is fairly straight forward. You could read the manual, but you might just be more confused. It's one of the guides that tries to cram as many languages on the same page as possible. Pictures aren't much more help. The most awkward part that took a few extra seconds was the bag installation. It goes into a plastic bracket that has two tabs which slide into the back of the housing. Then the lid simply closes over it. It might be confusing if you didn't actually see it installed like this.The rest of the components all snap in simple enough. Although I did find that some required a bit more effort to get the plastic clips to actually align and snap into place properly. You'll need to do this rather often when you switch between the floor nozzle and 2-in-1 tool. Some just slide on and are held in place with friction. Others use the tab/lock mechanism which may or may not decide to cooperate.FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITYThere are apparently sightly different version of this unit as the one I received didn't have an actual handle when using the floor nozzle. You just grab onto a hard plastic piece towards the top of the hose. That also means the only way to power it on/off is by press the odd button on the base unit itself. There is a ""power control"" on the hose that simply opens allows air to escape.But the real ""power control"" is on the main unit itself. You can adjust a slider to increase and decrease the power of the motor itself. Which is actually somewhat handy when you just don't need this thing running at 100%. On the opposite side of the power button is another button that retracts the power cord. Speaking of which, this didn't always work perfectly. Sometimes it will pull the cord in at a fast speed (watch your fingers!) or require multiple presses to coax it back into the unit.You do have the removable exhaust filter (F83) and of course the disposable bag (Type R). There is also a light on the front to let you know when it's time to replace the bag. And that's about it for features.REAL WORLD USEWe have moderately thick carpet and found the floor nozzle had some difficulty managing to clean it. At the very least, it did require turning the power to maximum so the spinning brushes would keep up. Of course with this design, the spinning bristles are powered via the air suction. If they get caught up in thick carpet, or you end up applying too much pressure, they will sometimes just stop spinning.You also can't turn them off, so it's really no ideal for tile or hard wood surfaces. It will technically work, but the brushes usually end up throwing dirt all over the place. It also gets very loud when the floor nozzle is spinning at full speed. However, if there is one thing the floor nozzle is good at, that's getting into low and tight spaces. I can pretty much vacuum the entire underside of the king size bed. It's quite flexible!Although the most beneficial part to me is using the clever 2-in-1 tool, which is actually 3 tools in one. A tool for crevices, a brush for dusting, and a more tradition open nozzle for cleaning larger spaces. Using this mode you can usually turn down the power and get cleaning. The main vacuum will happily follow you along or since it's so light, just carry it along.CONCLUSION:While I really do appreciate it's compact and light weight features, I found it to be rather limited in versatility for my particular situation. If you don't have thick carpet and avoid hard surfaces, this vacuum should work perfectly. Although some may find it more efficient (i.e. cheaper) to just purchase a vacuum that already done most of those things out of the box.It almost feels like a companion to a larger full featured vacuum cleaner that might not be able to handle 100% of the floor cleaning. It's really not a bad vacuum cleaner, but it's probably better suited for small houses or apartments where the pros might outweigh the cons for your particular use. Otherwise I'd suggest looking for a different type of vacuum cleaner in general.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UIVASPL0XOLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4MHMQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3UIVASPL0XOLC","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ Really gets things clean+ Easy to setup+ Simple operation+ Detachable hose+ Provided solution smell nice (and cleans)CONS:- Very noisy- Expensive- Somewhat heavy- Can be cumbersome to operate for some- Drying on thick carpetOUT OF THE BOXYou've got what is basically a typically sized vacuum cleaner. Except this one is meant to compliment your existing cleaning arsenal and tackle the fun job of really getting in there and actually cleaning the carpet and tile-like surfaces. Assembly is fairly straight forward and was easy enough to manage without needing to dig into the manual.Some of the components that need to be removed and re-installed can be a bit stubborn to install. Such as the dirty water canister and even the hose attachment. It requires a bit of force and there isn't always much noise to indicate it's actually snapped into place. There is a squeegee attachment that's mean for hard surfaces that is the hardest to remove. But it needs to be secure, so that's understandable.SETUPBefore you begin, it's important that the surface is already clean. So make sure you've swept or vacuumed first. Fill the top cannister with water and the provided cleaning solution. Speaking of which, there are two 16 oz bottles, one for tile and one for carpet. It'll take about half of that before it's full. This isn't going to last very long, so plan on purchasing more.For example, with tile, we were able to clean the kitchen, dining, entry way, pantry, and a bathroom done before we ran out. Carpet area is comparable, but this all varies depending on the square footage.THE CLEANINGOnce the area is prepped and open, it's time to fire it up. First thing you'll notice is that this thing is LOUD. We have to move past that and start cleaning, however. There is a dial on the front you need to switch from Rise and Clean. You of course will start with Clean and squeeze the trigger on the handle to dispense the cleaning solution on the floor as you move in a forward and backwards motion. After releasing the trigger, you'll just let it suck up the water.Also note that during this time, there are multiple scrubbing brushes going to work at cleaning the surface. And it's loud. So you know it's working. Then you switch over to rise and repeat the process above. Except this time you'll want to go a little slow as you move back and forth to make sure it sucks up the water.Which I should add, it does quite well. Do note that there is a squeegee in use on hard surfaces. Once it starts to get dry in spots, there is much more added resistance. That's another sign that it's probably dry and time to move on to the next section. If for some reason it doesn't get dry, the dirty water canister is probably getting full. This dirty water is also nice indicator showing just how dirty everything was!As for carpet, you simply remove the squeegee and repeat the exact same process. Except you want to use the carpet cleaning solution. Both of which smell rather nice, by the way. Even with thick carpet, cleaning was a little easier than tile. Main issue is getting the carpet too wet, as the drying function doesn't work as well on our thick carpet. You have to press down on the unit to get it to really pull out the water in extra damp areas.Although the dark colored water in the unit proved how effective the cleaning action was. If you've used a steam cleaner, you know they are effective, but require a bit of work.CONCLUSION:The real issues arise in the actual cleaning of your hard surfaces and carpet. In that it actually requires a bit of work. You're moving a vacuum cleaning like thing over the same surface area multiple times. All while having more resistance than you're use with on carpet and on title when the squeegee hits some dry spots.For example, my wife got tired after a few minutes and was ready to move on to something else. Unfortunately this meant that I had to take over most of the cleaning. This alone basically cost it a star. :)  But seriously, it's not too difficult, you just need to follow the simple directions, take your time, and plan on a bit of work. After it's all done, you'll be happy with the clean looking and smelling results. And it's not something you'll get with a vacuum and mop!Just make sure you wear some ear plugs. Overall, I consider it recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JOF03JTOELL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1XCA8S#wasThisHelpful","R31JOF03JTOELL","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have many flashlights, including a few Streamlights, and even the similar sized Streamlight 66118. Except the standard flash light uses normal batteries. What makes this one different? First, it has a ""sleeve"" towards the front that slides down to revel a micro-USB charging port. This feels solid and shouldn't allow dirt and such in there. The battery itself is a proprietary size Lithium-Ion battery pushing out 3.V, 660mAh, and 2.4Wh. Slightly concerning is the fact that the Cell and Assembly is from China. Only time will tell how long it holds up!Otherwise it is rated for 3.5 hours, which honestly, isn't the best I've seen. Putting in normal lithium-ion batteries my other streamlights would result in considerably longer run time (more than double). However, this does push out more lumens, and of course, easily rechargeable! I mean, who doesn't have AC and DC micro-USB chargers all over the place?Yes, it uses a standard micro-usb port and so far 3 phone chargers that I have laying around, including a 2A, work great. The included charger is 1A. There is also a nifty red/green LED to indicate when it's fully charged, or charging.Otherwise it's your typical durable and high quality streamlight with it's sealed rubber button at the back to power on/off. And that's about it. I do wish it lasted longer on a charge and the battery source is questionable, but I'm impressed enough to give it a solid 4.9 stars. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKIPLWFHC5T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZAXE9M#wasThisHelpful","RYKIPLWFHC5T2","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've installed quite a few wall mounts for everything from a 32"" to 65"" LED TV. However, those were all the basic low-profile variety. I wanted an articulating wall mount for use in our game room. This looked like it fit the bill perfectly. Out of the box there is the mount, screws, HDMI cable, level, etc. All expected things.Everything appears to be of good quality and feels quite solid. I certainly have no issues trusting it to hold up a 39"" LED Insignia TV. I simply followed the very well written instructions to mount by doing the basic measurements, marking the holes via stud finder, drill into the stud, and tighten down with a socket wrench by hand. They've even included a template for drilling the 3 holes.The TV attaches easily to the mount via the standard VESA bracket. It latches into place so you don't have to hold it while screwing things in. Once up there, just install the 2 screws for the VESA bracket you were asked to remove earlier, and it's installed.  Use the hand-adjustable screws at the top to get the angle you want. There is a nifty level attached to the back of the base to help keep it, well, level.Then route your cables with enough slack for future movement, and off you go. I was able to get it install by myself without any issues. For a heavier TV, additional help wouldn't hurt.Now it can get pushed back or tilted left, right, or angled up/down. Perfect for it's intended use. Which in my case, is mounted above my computer workstation that works as 4th screen, connected to the PC. I have a TV tuner that displays stuff on it. See attached photo.Given it's functionality and build quality, I consider this one highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C6VDIT8YYJBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMXW0MQ#wasThisHelpful","R1C6VDIT8YYJBM","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OUT OF THE BOXBelkin has been going with simple and straight forward packaging as of late, and this WeMo starter set continues that trend. You've got the two 800 lumen LED bulbs and the WeMo Link. There's a super basic quick start card and that's about it. The WeMo link simply plugs into an A/C outlet, preferably in a central location to allow the best communication with your other WeMo devices.The bulbs are standard A series and only look slightly different than a typical light bulb. Except these are of course, wireless! Let's see how they do.SETUPThis is the part that seems to be hit or miss and I can see why that is. They've really made it ""simple"" to setup, in that it's nearly entirely automated. You plug in the Link adapter, lights bulbs, turns on the light switch, and install the app on your Android or iOS device. Once you launch the app, it will guide you through the steps I noted above, as well as connecting to the WeMo link via WiFi for the initial setup.You do this so that you can tell the WeMo link to talk to your home WiFi network and is a one-time process. After that, you can simply switch back to your normal WiFi connection. The app then automatically starts searching for any devices. In my case, it initially only found 1 light bulb. After closing and restarting the app, it then found the other bulb and all was well.But that's really all it takes to set it up. And once you have it going, it's just a matter of playing with the software. We also installed the app on other Android devices that were on our WiFi network, and they immediately found the WeMo devices, ready to go!THE APPThe app is only available for iOS and Android. No PC or Windows Phone support, which is somewhat unfortunate as it does sort of limit it's full potential. I'm typing this review on a Dell XPS 15 ultrabook. If I wanted to turn the light on/off, I'd have to grab my phone. Or actually get out of my chair. That's simple unacceptable. :)But seriously, that support should be there out of the box. I hope it will be made available soon! Otherwise the app does give you the ability to name the lights, adjust brightness, turn on/off, sync with sunrise/sunset, or turn on/off are a predetermined time to give the impression you are actually home.From the time it takes to launch the app and allow it to ""sync"" with your bulbs, it usually takes about 4-5 seconds before I have full control. If the app is running, usually less than 1-2 seconds. No difference on WiFi or LTE with my Galaxy Note 3. Otherwise it's nearly immediate for the controls to respond to your commands.I also noticed that when first opening the app or when it's possibly still communicating with the lights, sometimes the drop-down menu for the individual lights glitches out a bit. It'll close right when opening, for example. Just minor bugs that need fixing.REAL WORLD USEI have one bulb in our dining room and one under lamp shade in the family room. I've got the family room light set to turn on/off on a schedule so it allows folks to navigate the open family room at night. Then it turns off before bed. The one in the dining room isn't on a timer, but I do frequently use the dimmer.This room is part of the living room where the TV is, so it's quite handy being able to dim while watching TV or turn it up if other activities are happening in this room. Speaking of turning up the brightness, I've found that when using the bulbs on their own, they do have a neutral to slightly warm color temp. Although when compared to a typical CFL or incandescent bulb, they will appear to be noticeably whiter. This is due to the fact that these bulbs have a color temp of 3000K and the CFL bulbs I use are no more than 2700k. Plus, the LED's do get brighter. Technically these LED's are on the warm side though.Back to normal usage, the biggest question was, ""what if I just want to quickly turn a light on/off without an app-enabled device?"" Simple. Just turn the light switch off and on again, and the bulb will default to it's brightness setting. You will of course need to jump back into an app to adjust brightness since it won't remember this when you manually use a normal household light switch.PROS:+ Relatively easy initial setup+ Fully functional iOS/Android Apps+ Bright 800 Lumen LED bulbs (60W equivalent)+ Only 9.5W per bulb+ Warmer color temp than most LED's (3000K)+ Works on WiFi or 3G/LTE (i.e. Remote)+ Nice ""practical"" features+ Light still turns on when switch used manually+ Lots of current and future WeMo compatible devicesCONS:- Expensive- Some bugs during initial setup- Not available for PC, Mac, Windows Phone, etc- Initial app connect delay should be improved- Bulb doesn't remember setting when manually turned off/on- Color temp may appear ""cooler"" compared to traditional bulbs- Indoor use only- Potentially Buggy- Support IssuesCONCLUSION:Of course this isn't something you can't live with out. But it's one of those nifty gadgets that can make things a little easier to live with. It's also new technology, so there are going to be a few bugs here and there. But considering how new it is, I think Belkin did a pretty darn good job at making this easy to use and provide some nice features.It's a bit pricey, but if you're looking to try out this new tech, this is an excellent way to jump in. For me? Next thing on the list: A soon-to-be released WeMo coffee maker. :)*** UPDATE 12/30/14 ***One of the light bulbs has decided to stop being detected wireless. It still turns on/off as a normal light bulb, but of course only one setting now. I've gone through all of the recommended full reset procedures for both the bulb and receiver. No go. One works, the other doesn't.Unfortunately I haven't had any luck contacting Belkin as I just keep getting automated surveys implying I'm out of the 90 day warranty. Still working on this, but until resolved, I'd recommend against purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EG5VR14TEOIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMLTUG0#wasThisHelpful","R1EG5VR14TEOIZ","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried many energy drinks and additives over the years and have never been impressed. They tend to make me jittery and have a very unnatural effect. These results do vary of course as I know many don't experience those symptoms. For me, they just don't work. So when I saw a new more natural approach, I decided to give it a try.Recently I was feeling tired at the usual time of day. You know, about mid-day around 2-3 pm. Tried a can and I did notice I felt more alert, as I was earlier during the day. It didn't give me a big boost or jolt of energy as others do. But I did feel better, which is nice. Certainly better than going the other unhealthy routes to help get you through the day.The results still didn't last long, but were enough to get me through dinner time. I should also note that tropical blast did have a nice fruity taste and wasn't unpleasant at all. I could easily drink this all day long. I like it. Except for the fact that these little cans are quite pricey. And despite the small size of each can, they are ""2 points"" each, if you're on weight watchers.Overall, I consider these recommended to anybody looking for a more healthy energy boost during the day.

"Considering you can basically get the previous ""30MB/s"" card for about the same price as the new ""48MB/s"" card, it's pretty much a given to simply buy this updated card with faster read performance. I've used countless flash media over the years and have always come back to SanDisk for their reliability, performance, and value. This latest speedy card is no exception.But I never make assumptions, so I did run CrystalDiskMark Benchmark on the new version to see how it did. With a 45.92MB/s Read and 14.44 MB/s Write (Sequential), it did not disappoint. Your results will likely vary depending on the system you are using, but that's basically right about what can expect from this class card. I'm on a Dell XPS 15 running Win 8.1.BENCHMARK: READ / WRITE (in MB/s)Sequential: 45.92 / 14.44Random 512K: 41.82 / 0.637Random 4K: 4.251 / 1.421Random 4K QD 32: 3.536 / 1.438Basically it's going to be perfect for most uses in phones, tablets, and other portable devices where sequential speeds are most relevant for media storage. The only exception being something that needs a very high write speed, such as 4K video and high-end SLR cameras. In which case, you'll be looking at a much more expensive card.For typical everyday tasks, I'll take the nice ""free"" bump in read speeds and consider this card highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9O0FKDKQY47Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M55C1I2#wasThisHelpful","R9O0FKDKQY47Q","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ Very compact design & foot print+ Fast printing speeds+ Nice photo print quality+ 6 Separate Ink Cartridges+ Great touch screen and interface+ Easy Setup Process+ Automatic paper output tray+ Software is basic, but functional+ 2-Sided Printing (with thicker paper)CONS:- Limited paper storage- Flimsy touch panel assembly- Cheap plastic CD Tray- Android and PC Software need improvements- Bit expensiveMy first impression was simply how compact the box was, let alone the printer itself. It's rare I can actually carry a printer box with one hand. So we've got a compact high-end ink-jet printer that promises to provide a lot of features. Now it's time to see how it worked out in my hands.OUT OF THE BOXUn-boxing goes just about as you'd expect with a new printer. Lots and lots of tape / wrapping to keep everything in place during shipment. You've also got a power cable, quick start guide and driver CD in the box; and that's it. No USB or network cables included; although if you have Wi-Fi, they aren't technically needed. Just plug it in and off you go with setup.You'll also immediately note that there are in fact 6 different colored ink cartridges. Be sure to shop around for prices as these can get expensive if you plan on ordering them all. On the plus side, you only need to replace the colors that happen to be low. In either case, they are quite easy to install.DESIGNBefore we start setup, let's look at the printer. As initially noted, the printer is super compact. I'm surprised they fit all of these features into such a small package. You do sacrifice paper storage and such. But for most home and home offices who aren't printing 100 pages a day, that's all you need. Not to mention, you wouldn't be buying an ink-jet!The printer has a nifty LCD screen that automatically rotates outward when you power it on. Then closes again, at power off. The LCD and it's user friendly interface as a nice touch. Which can also be taken literally as it's also a touch screen. One that happens to be fast and intuitive to navigate. A slight negative here is that the touch panel assembly wobbles a bit when you push it, in particular in the closed position. More noticeable as the power button is on the same panel.The output tray even automatically extends when you print to catch the print-outs. A button on the touch panel allows you to easily open and close at will. Nice. Not so nice? The CD ""tray"" is a cheap piece of plastic that slides in at the bottom of the printer.SETUPFirst step, toss the CD, and go to epson's website to download the Driver and Software suite. It's going to be more up-to-date. Then run the file and follow the steps. I decided to do this via Wi-Fi as I suspect that's how many folks will tackle this step. You can also setup via LAN and USB cable, if you choose to do so. Even though as previously noted, those cables aren't included.During setup, it will try to attach to the printer with your notebooks wireless card. So yes, you will need a computer with wireless capability if you choose to go this route. Alternatively, you could manually setup via the printer's touch panel. Unless some older printers, this is nowhere near as painful as it used to be. But I'd still stick with the software to save a few steps.In my case, the software failed to connect automatically on the first try on my Windows 7 notebook. I instructed me to kick off a few steps on the printer itself to get it ready to go, and then off it went. Software installed and ready to go. I did note that on both test systems, one with Windows 7 and the other with Windows 8, the firmware update failed (software crashed). Simply reboot and run the Software Updater program separately. Fairly easy to do as it's all automated.At this point you've got the printer attached to your Wi-Fi network, drivers, and software installed ready to go!PRINTING (ANDROID)I first decided to try printing from my Galaxy Note 3 phone and Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet. I simply installed the Epson ""iPrint"" application from the Play Store, allowed it to find the printer, and it's ready to go. The application itself is rather primitive, but does show the printer's status, ink levels, and other basic info. However, it is limited in functionality.It's only a print application, not a service. In other words, you have to print from within the Epson application. if you print a document or file on your tablet, you'll have the option to select the program to handle that task. So you can select Epson iPrint, and off you go.If you try to print from within another application, such as the Gmail app or browser, you cannot. It's looking for a Print Service, such as the one Samsung and HP apps provide. This needs to be updated.PRINTING (WINDOWS)For the rest of my testing, I decided to jump back into Windows 8. You're going to do all printing from the application you are printing. And scanning, from the old-school stand-alone scanning application that's been around for many years. There is no Windows 8 Metro app. Beyond that, everything printed just as good as you'd expect from a high-end ink-jet printer.Open whatever you want to print and off you go. For some reason I do enjoy watching the automatic paper holder extend. Scanning also worked great with this compact Epson. Print speed doesn't set any records, but is plenty fast for it's design.DOUBLE SIDED PRINTI found this feature both odd and interesting. For one, you rarely see this feature on an ink-jet printer. Mostly because of what I experienced & confirmed with my testing, which is ink bleed. Whether you print B&W or Color, if you're using normal office paper, it'll bleed through the paper. Laser printers don't have that issue.You could use photo paper, although those are usually meant to be used on one side. Basically, you'll need to go buy some thicker paper if you want to print on both sides. Although it is nice to have, should you have the need (and correct paper). It worked just fine in my tests.CONCLUSION:I didn't go much into some basic features such as faxing and copying since they pretty much work like they always have. Which is to say very well. This ""small-in-one"" printer, as they call it, has just about everything you could need in a home and home office print environment. It takes up very little space and they just don't get any easier to use than this.However, I do still have my concerns with PC and Android software that's a bit out of date. The Android software needs to run as a service. Windows software needs to not crash during a firmware update. And how about some love for Windows 8? I only mention this because my Samsung printer does all of that perfectly and far more ""feature rich."" Although the Epson software does technically get the job done.At the end of the day, I still consider these issues to be relatively minor and can easily give this printer a solid recommendation (4.5 stars).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W15C83615HCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LV97LTW#wasThisHelpful","R3W15C83615HCB","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:+ 8 Full Speed Gigabit Ports+ Compact Design+ Energy Efficient+ Fan-Less (completely quiet)+ Stays cool under load+ 16 Gbps Max Bandwidth+ Good build quality (metal casing)+ Relatively inexpensiveCONS:- None at this timeI've been working in the IT field for over 15 years and as such, have spent a lot of time working on the PC Client side as well as with the network infrastructure world. I've lost track of how much network gear has come and gone over the years. Everything from cheap little hubs that were worthless to high-end managed Cisco switches. Everything has it's place in the world and you don't necessarily need a super expensive switch to get the job done.In the case of the GS308, it's marketed towards the consumer space. Which is where I've set this up for testing. I've got a couple notebooks hardwired in and spent a couple hours simply transferring files, running speed tests, and even got some gaming done. I won't bore you with all of the details and such as they simply aren't important.Bottom line, it's a fast and reliable switch that is actually priced relatively cheap for what it can do. I had no issues staying at 108MB/s transfer rates just as I do with my other far, far more expensive switches. It never got hot, it's 100% quiet, and it's even fairly compact. The specs even indicated a 16Gb/s total bandwidth (back-plane). Which was confirmed as I had multiple systems transferring files at the same time and never had any performance issues (i.e. dropped packets, latency, etc).Add in some energy efficiency that adjust power based on detected cable length, and you've got one solid device for the home and home office. If that's what you're looking for, I consider this switch highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN3ONHCQWG3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFD0SEA#wasThisHelpful","RNN3ONHCQWG3D","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I feel it is important to just briefly note what exactly this Chromebook is all about. In a nutshell, you're looking at a notebook with high-end tablet specs (i.e. Android tablets) running a modified version as Google's Chrome browser. This is basically functioning as your operating system, with a few extra features thrown in to make things a bit more usable. In other words, you really need to live in a ""Google World"" where everything you access is via the browser, in the cloud, or apps within Chrome.If that doesn't sound like something you'd even be remotely interested in, move along folks, nothing to see here. Otherwise, let's see how this Samsung Chromebook 2 (13 inch) handles life as a notebook.BASIC CHASSISThe notebook definitely has the Samsung feel to it. You'll notice that there is lots of plastic, pretty much everywhere. The entire shell feels like smooth plastic, with the exception of the portion behind the screen. This is just textured plastic. However, carrying it around and even physically flexing the chassis reveals that this really isn't an issue. There is minimal flex, no creaking, and it actually feels pretty solid. At least for a plastic chassis.One notable exterior feature is the speakers. There are two of them and are unfortunately downward firing. They're located on the bottom towards the front left and right corners of the chassis. However, I will note that they are quite loud. They have surprisingly good detail for a notebook. Not much bass, but nothing surprising for it's class. Still wish they were forward facing though.Not much else interesting with the chassis itself. You've got a tiny blue LED for power above at the top/left corner near the keyboard, webcam above the display, etc. I won't go into all of the other specs listed on the site, as most aren't super important beyond what you can see already. And compared to a traditional notebook, it would get blown away in benchmarks. Hence why I'm not going to run any. That's not what this is meant for. But I will continue going into more practical things below.KEYBOARD & TOUCHPADThe keyboard works reasonably well for typing, as it should, right? This is an island style keyboard layout which allows for nice spacing and fast typing. The key travel is a little on the shallow side and the feedback is also a little light. In other words, not the best keyboard out there. But for typing this review and other moderate amount of typing, it actually works pretty darn good.Since you're not running Windows, there are no function keys. Or even page up/down, home, or end keys. Instead you've got some basic shortcut keys for the system, such as back/forward, refresh, brightness, audio, etc. The power button itself is also a ""key"" on the keyboard itself. And unfortunately, the keyboard is not backlit.The touchpad has gone mac-style in that there is only a single click (left click), by pushing down on the touchpad. If you connect an external mouse with a right button, it will work just as expected. I'd suggest getting used to pressing ALT + Click to get the ""right-click menu"" to appear, as well as making use of other shortcut keys with your clicking (i.e. CTRL, SHIFT, etc). The touchpad itself works rather well as it does support multi-finger gestures; although my finger didn't find it as smooth as I'd like. But that is something that could get worn in over time.LCDI can get rather picky when it comes to LCD screens. I've used hundreds, and as a PC tech, I've replaced and repaired considerably more over the years. While I must take into consideration it's price for the rating, I will describe it as I see it. Which is to say this is a rather average to mediocre display, depending on use. It is 1080p and text and images look very sharp and crisp. There's no shortage of pixels here. It's also reasonably bright for daytime use.However, the viewing angles and contrast ratio aren't very good. Horizontal viewing results in minimal fading, while vertical becomes pretty much unusable. The key here is to stay right in the middle, and enjoy. It's more of an issue for multi-person viewing. And if you're sticking with normal web and productivity type tasks, there are no other real complaints. The screen looks just fine.But when viewing full-screen videos, you will note the lack of contrast and image uniformity. In particular towards the lower and upper half of the display, where it becomes noticeably washed out looking. The videos still look fine on their own, but this will become distracting in dark scenes. And of course, increasing brightness doesn't do it any favors, at least in this aspect.OS & PERFORMANCEWe've already mentioned that we're looking at tablet-like specifications here. But since everything we're doing is web browser based, you honestly don't need anything too powerful. I've been watching 4K YouTube videos with several tabs, and many extensions running within Chrome. Most pages load in a few short seconds. Although some more content heavy websites can take an extra second or two. At least when compared to normal full speed desktop or notebook.I should also note your results will absolutely vary depending on how much stuff you've got in Chrome. If you have a bunch extensions that are running and processing each website, this will add some time to each page load. I have 5-6 extensions running and it runs just fine. But you may want to review what you've got running and see if it's really necessary (especially if they are old or duplicated).Beyond that everything Chrome-based runs great. The ""OS"" has some added shortcuts to keep an eye on Wi-Fi signal, battery life, time, and shortcuts to some frequently access programs/sites. Otherwise if you've used Chrome, which I hope you have if you're considering this notebook, it's all going to be very familiar to you.HEAT & BATTERYWhile typing up words, text, and basic web surfing, this guy stays relatively cool. I'm showing 87 degrees at the keyboard and about 92 on the bottom. It gets hottest towards the back/left side, on the bottom. When pushing it, such as playing those 4K videos, I did see it get up to 98 on the bottom. Really not bad at all. At least my legs certainly didn't mind.The battery has so far been lasting quite awhile with my various ""normal"" use cases. Surfing the web, checking e-mail, and other browser type things don't really push a CPU too hard. So I could easily see 6-8 hours of normal usage happening. If you decide to play cpu intensive games or watch a lot of YouTube, this will of course, go down. Either way, it will be tough for most small notebooks to beat this kind of battery life.PROS:+ Only weighs 3 lb+ 1080p Display+ Relatively inexpensive at current price+ Descent keyboard+ MicroSD Slot+ Plenty fast for Chrome+ Solid Battery Life+ Loud Speakers+ Fast AC ChargingCONS:- Plastic build- Poor viewing angles and contrast ratio- No back-lit keyboard- No right-click on touchpad- Touchpad not as ""smooth"" as I'd likeCONCLUSION:Once again, we do have to step back and take a look at this little guy for what it is. Which is a reasonably priced portable chrome notebook / netbook. For this, you really can't ask for more. Well, a nicer LCD and back-lit keyboard would do wonders in my mind. Although I suspect the price would go up. So it's not perfect, but if you can live with it's short comings and are wanting to jump in into the Chromebook world, this is an excellent place to start. I consider it recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36L4UUXEUJE8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J49ZH1U#wasThisHelpful","R36L4UUXEUJE8K","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a 2009 GMC Sierra Denali Truck with the awesome 6.2l V8. It's got less than 32k miles on it, and isn't due for a new air filter. But it is still stock, so I decided to swap it out anyways. I also wanted a non-oiled filter, as I've had them in the past, and really don't like them. They're known for getting oil on the MAF, which just causes issues, and adds more work.And as expected, it really wasn't all that dirty. However, I'm glad I did.I immediately noticed improved throttle response and an ever so slight perceived performance improvement. I'm pretty sensitive to how the truck performs and responds. I'm kind of OCD like that. Now I'm not saying we gained a large or even measurable amount of wheeled horsepower. But the engine certainly feels and sounds better. Otherwise no change in noise and not much else to report. It's just an air-filter, not a blower. :)And if the truck is happy, I'm happy. Definite recommend for OE replacement air filter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11U08F4J1CWIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O87UYQ#wasThisHelpful","R11U08F4J1CWIE","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OUT OF THE BOXOut of the box, there isn't much to say about the router itself. You've just got a router, power, network cable, and quick start guide. Although it's technically fully setup and ready to go when you plug it in. It's already got a unique access point name and password setup. There's even a physical switch that allows you to switch between Auto/Router/Bridge modes. Other than changing the default router password and other optional advanced settings, you almost don't even need to ever log into it's web interface.Just connect everything as the diagram indicates, and it's pretty much ready to provide wireless and wired internet connectivity.FEATURES & SETUPThe router has a pretty basic and easy to navigate web interface that allows you to make all of the changes you need. Which is also mobile friendly, should you prefer not using a PC. The AC 1200 doesn't have a lot of additional features. There's a guest mode, parental control, and that's about it.To continue advanced setup or go with custom settings, you'll want to make sure it's in Router mode, regardless of your home setup. This is the default mode, such as when you have it connected to the modem directly. There is a nifty card on the bottom of the router which has the IP, password, and everything you need to jump in and start setting it up.Which is exactly what I did to change the access point names, passwords, setup a static IP, and other less common ""advanced"" changes I do to make it work with my network. I've already got a separate server and router. All this thing needs to do is provide speedy WiFi. Otherwise functionality is completely the same.This was all pretty straight forward, except I did run into my first issue when going into ""Access Point"" or ""Bridge"" mode, which is that it disable the ability to access the router's web interface. I updated the firmware, reset it, all no go. Per Buffalo tech support, the router defaults to a 192.168.11.100 IP address when going to Bridge mode. Unfortunately I still wasn't able to access it after troubleshooting, and there doesn't appear to be a way to change this functionality.PERFORMANCEI have 802.11ac and 802.11n devices in my two-story house, so I have plenty of devices to test the performance with. First, the router does actually have a gigabit WAN port so that you've got the potential for a lot of speed via your ISP or Local Network connection. This seems like a no-brainer to have with an AC router, but you'd be surprised. The other 4 LAN ports are only 100Mb. As for WiFi, the router is dual band, and is capable of handling both 2.4GHz and 5GHz as the same time.For my initial test I used my Surface Pro 3 (Marvel Avastar Wireless-AC card) and a Dell XPS 11 (Intel 7260 WiFi card).  Both devices seem to be maxing out right around 25MB/s file transfer speeds via my LAN connection with 5GHz on AC or N. 2.4GHz is naturally considerably slower, at around 10Mb/s or so.It just doesn't seem to be capable of going faster than this. The router advertises speeds closer to 866Mb/s. In reality, you'd looking at roughly 40-50% of those speeds, in optimal conditions. And we're talking only a couple feet from the router itself. Also note the difference between bits and bytes (there are 8 bits in a Byte and b=bit / B=Byte). 25MB/s translates to 200Mb/s, which is a bit less than I'd expect for an AC router. Especially since my older 802.11n router could easily achieve those speeds.PROS:+ Easy Setup+ Full gigabit WAN port+ Important features are present+ Small foot print+ AC can still be faster for some WiFi cardsCONS:- Less than expected AC wireless speeds- Web interface not available in Bridge or AP mode- LAN ports are only 100Mb- No advanced features such as QoS and high power transmissionCONCLUSION:Having an AC router will result in your AC capable devices likely performing better than they would with an 802.11n-only router. AC has better range and performance. I have since used other non-AC wireless cards transferring files over Wi-Fi with the Buffalo, and they're on par with what they did on my top-end D-Link 802.11n router. However, some newer AC wireless cards don't tend to do very well in non-AC environments. So there can be an improvement in performance, sometimes twice as fast.However, if you really want the most AC can offer, I'd suggest spending a little more and going for the higher end models that can really move some bits. After all, if you're going to upgrade, you might as well do it right. But if you're just looking for a low cost current gen Access Point, and don't need a lot of features or super fast speeds, this one would get the job done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19QFFI2SVULC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKM0ACW#wasThisHelpful","R19QFFI2SVULC","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allow me to explain my issue with this router. First, please note my use of MB (Mega Bytes) and Mb (Megabits). As there are in fact 8 bits in a byte, if you want to do the math, simply divide by 8 when going from MB to Mb. Simple enough, but I want to clarify this as marketing loves going by Bits and Windows likes Bytes.On the box for the Belkin AC1200 it clearly notes that the 4xLAN ports are 100Mb ports, which translates to 10MB, of course. There's no mention of how fast the 5th Modem port is. But for an 802.11a/b/g router, it wouldn't matter as they'd max out at 54Mb/s. Yes, I'm still going by unrealistic advertised speeds, but hang with me here. For 802.11ac, it's advertised at 867Mbps on the 5GHz band and even 300Mbps on 2.4Ghz. At least on the box for the AC1200, 802.11ac can theoretically go faster with the right hardware (i.e. the AC1750).In real-world use, you're naturally looking at roughly half those speeds, if not less. Wireless is half-duplex (it can't send/receive at the same time like your LAN connection). It's also prone to interference, range, etc. So let's just say we're looking at ""real-world"" 400Mbps on AC/5Ghz, or what should translate to a 50MB/s transfer rate. Sure, I'm sitting right next to the router and there's nothing else near-by. I'm feeling optimistic here.So what happens when you try to transfer files over your speedy AC Wi-Fi connection to your LAN? Well, you'd hope the Modem port is Gigabit (1000Mb) so data can go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, it is not. The modem port is also 100Mb. What this means is that you'll never see speeds past 10MB/s when transferring files in Windows via your LAN. Or if you're ISP (Internet Service Provider) connection is faster than this, you're also capped at 100Mb or 10MB.So where will you actually see these AC speeds? Perhaps going wireless to wireless from one AC device to another AC device or maybe using the USB 2.0 port on the router with a dedicated drive. Keeping in mind WiFi to WiFi is usually pretty slow, regardless of the connection. But that's about it.I spoke with Belkin technical support and after verifying with their supervisors, confirmed that this is in fact ""working as designed."" In my opinion, quite poorly. Personally, I can't recommend this device unless you really only care about WiFi to WiFi speed. If that fits your requirements, it's an otherwise descent little router. It's got plenty of basic features, easy to setup, cheap, etc. But for me, I'd spend a bit more on a better model.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZEPW43YFVTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JY4QCJQ#wasThisHelpful","REZEPW43YFVTD","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a couple of car chargers for my GN3 that I've been using. However, at best, they might be able to prevent the phone from dying while in use. Why is that? Well the Galaxy Note 3 is a larger and powerful phone, which normally uses a 2.0 amp charger. Most car chargers either can't provide this or only work at full amperage with fruit products.So enter the AmazonBasics Micro USB universal charger to save the day. For my test and typical use-case scenario, I put my phone on my dash mount, fired up some navigation software (Waze, in this instance), maxed out the screen brightness, and went for a drive. Should also note I keep all radio's on at all times, including Bluetooth for hands-free calling, Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, and GPS, of course.After about 15-20 minutes, the battery percentage had actually increased by 5%. Success!  If this was any less than 2.0 amp, that simply wouldn't happen.Beyond that there isn't much to say. It's a basic charger design with a coiled cable that's just the right length. While it may go to over 4 ft, it was pretty stiff going past 3 ft. Although I already got that impression from the pictures Amazon posted. And for most dashes, this is more than enough. Any longer and you'll want a straight cable.Overall, I consider it highly recommended for any Android user - even though it will likely work with plenty others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZWMMEU8XK4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFEJNNO#wasThisHelpful","RGZWMMEU8XK4J","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, and they sound pretty darn good too. But let's go into a little more detail. Also want to note that my test sources included a Galaxy Note 3, MSI GT70 notebook with internal Sound Blaster sound card, and my main gaming desktop with is running an X-Fi sound card via Astro mix-amp.OUT OF THE BOXThere's quite a bit of stuff in the box. You've got the headphones, several cables, extensions, and adapters. There's oddly not much in the way of documentation to explain how everything works or what it does. Although you can pretty much figure it out for yourself. The boxing itself is actually fairly high quality and does give the impression of a more expensive product. They were nice enough to allow you to select between the leather ear pads and velvety smooth cloth-type pads. Both are nice and comfy, just personal preference.Kingston also threw in a nifty cloth-like pouch for the headset. And understanding there are many cables, included a secondary outer pocket for the cables and adapters.DESIGN & COMFORTOf course once un-boxed, the first thing I noticed was the really nice and strong leather type smell. Something you'd expect from a far more expensive product. The headband and included ear pads have this super soft and nice smelling leather. I'm a fan. The rest either high quality sturdy rubber or aluminum. There's nothing cheap feeling about them. In fact, they feel nicer than just about everything other headset I have, including some $300 cans (i.e. Sennheiser PC360's). Combined with the red stitching on the headband and other accents, they look pretty darn cool.In addition to smelling and looking nice, they are quite comfortable. With all of this leather, how could it not? One negative however, is the inner felt lining to the interchangeable ear pads. Because it's rather shallow, my ears made contact when I put them on. It's soft, but I did find it a little annoying after extended use. Most over-the-ear headphones have a bit more clearance.CABLES, ADAPTERS, MICAs noted there are several adapters and cables. The main cable with analog mic/headphone jack is permanently attached to the headset is fairly short for use with a notebook, for example. It's right about 4ft, or 48"". Then there are short extension cables if needed. You've also got adapters for different type of analog use, such as your phone with 3 bands (to use sound & mic with a single cable) and even separate left/right 3.5mm connection, which is rather uncommon.In addition to being able to swap out the ear pads, you can also remove the microphone. It's part of a bendy and easy-to-adjust boom that makes it easy to position right where you want it. The other party had no problem hearing me and said I sounded nice and clear via Skype. Although they did admit I sounded a little clearer with my previous headset, which happened to be the much more expensive PC360's.CONTROL POD & PHONE USEThere is also a control pod which adds a bit of cable length (43""). This allows you to adjust volume and mute. Unfortunately without the pod attached, there is no way to do this via the headset or in-line controls. This is a bit clumsy to use on a regular basis, but that's all you get. There is a button on the pod that is only used with a phone. With a non-phone device, it just makes a loud popping noise.So if you use the included 3-ring 3.5mm adapter to connect it to your phone, and you decide to include the control pod in this setup (it's optional, of course), you can press this large square multi-functional button. If you're playing music it'll stop/pause. If a call comes in, you can also use it to answer and hang-up. At least that's what it does with my Android Galaxy Note 3 phone. Sorry, no forward/back button.Unfortunately using the control pod on-the-go means a combined length of around 7 1/2 feet! Not exactly portable unless you roll it up and find a place to put it.SOUND QUALITYThis is where the large 53mm drivers really shine. These headphones easily rival headphones costing 2-3 times as much. They have a very rich sound with deep bass, solid mid-range, and crisp high's. The bass is what you'll really notice. With every audio source I threw at it, the deep full range was very welcome. I watched some movies, played some games with Skype in the background, and threw in some various types of music for good measure.Everything sounded excellent. And thanks to the very comfortable ear pads, my ears and head never got uncomfortable. Which is rather surprising since these are a closed design. In other words, they tend to block most outside noises. This design also tends to limit ventilation, which can get annoying. Although after a long 2 hour gaming session, I did find that I needed a break sooner than my open-air headphones.PROS:+ Excellent sound quality for the price+ Plenty of bass when there should be+ Top-end build quality and materials+ Every adapter you'll ever need+ Removable microphone+ Long & Short cable options+ Works with your phone (using optional adapter)+ Included pouch+ Smells awesomeCONS:+ Closed design can still cause extended listening fatigue+ Ear makes contact with inner felt lining+ Must use control pod with long cable to mute or adjust volume+ Optional control pod's added cable length can be cumbersomeCONCLUSION:If you're looking for a good set of closed gaming headphones with a mic and you're budget happens to be around a hundred bucks, look no further. While there are a few questionable feature choices, nothing is perfect. Sure, you can find something better, but not likely at this price point. And in either case, they certainly won't smell as good. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFGWYP0AG79MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJNQG98#wasThisHelpful","RFGWYP0AG79MR","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm currently using this with the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Tablet, which I'm naturally writing this review on. I currently have it paired with the Logitech Pro Bluetooth keyboard case and now, of course, the Samsung S Mouse. My plan was to make this a replacement for a 12-13"" notebook, and you really do need some kind of mouse to do that. You can do a lot with a touch screen, stylus, and keyboard, but sometimes you just need to click around. Especially if you're doing something with excel spreadsheets, make selections within text, navigating non-touch friendly websites, or using remote desktop.I have other ""normal"" Bluetooth mice and they actually work fine, but they lack the Android specific functions. So other than a nifty mouse cursor on the screen, what do the buttons do on this Android mouse?Left Button - Works like your finger would. Single click to make a selection. Click/Hold to drag.Right Button - Goes Back, like the Android back button does. Long press opens Multi-Window apps (side drawer)Scroll Wheel - Scrolls documents, or if on home page, scrolls through home screens. Single-click goes to Home screen. If double-clicked, opens S-VoiceLeft Side Button - Shows app switcher, to view/select apps already openOtherwise it's a pretty basic mouse. It has a plastic top/bottom and that fake leather material on the sides, which is quite similar to what's on the back of the tablet. So it matches rather nicely, if you're into that kind of thing.I also recently noticed that it doesn't quite work on the same surfaces my other optical mice work on. The cloth on my couch or my jeans, for example, do nothing. Tried my shirt, nothing. It did work on a leather couch, a few wooden & plastic surfaces, mouse pads, etc. That could be an issue for some.Pros:+ Nice design+ Bluetooth+ Android specific functions+ Compact & Portable+ Smooth actions+ Solid click feedbackCons:- Expensive- Doesn't work on all surfaces- Feels like a plastic mouse- Non-rechargeableYou wouldn't think a simple feature such as Android specific functions is all that important. But for an Android tablet, it's extremely helpful and gives you a completely new way to be productive with your tablet. I do wish it was rechargeable, but the included AA battery will have to do.

"There are many emergency devices to choose from, so it's important that you pick one that is both reliable and functional. It must have all of the key features needed to help you survive an emergency situation. After all, we already know these things are critical to keep around the house along with other basic emergency supplies.The Midland ER300 is a basic plastic design with a few rubberized buttons and back-lit display. It features a small handle, LED light, solar panel, AM/FM radio, and of course the emergency weather radio (WX). One uncommon feature is a dog alert feature that emits a very high pitch noise most humans can't hear. Well, if you put your ear next to it, you might notice it. Although wouldn't recommend this.What about power? You can charge it with the include USB->Micro USB port via your notebook or just about any other charger you have laying around the house. I tried a couple such as a Samsung 2.0A adapter and it worked just fine. Be sure to keep this thing charged. It has a lithium-ion battery, which will keep a charge for a while, but these don't last forever. And you really don't want to have to hand-crack this thing unless you have time.It's quite slow to charge, along with solar charging. These are two methods are only meant to give you basic functionality, such flashlight and radio. It can charge devices, but that's assuming you've got a full charge already. The 2,000mAh battery won't last long if you charge up a typical smart phone these days.Although as an added bonus you can add 6 AA batteries, which does require flipping a switch to activate. It won't use the Li-Ion battery and AA at the same time.Beyond that there isn't much to say about it. The only other test is the one you hope you never have to find out. The only last comment is on price. This can do a lot, but the listed price is a tad high. You may want to wait for a sale or go with a cheaper unit, like the WR-111B. However do note that most cheaper units don't have nearly as large of a battery and may leave out a less important feature or two. The extra battery capacity alone may make it worth the price to you.

"I've had many headphones and headsets over the years, but it's important to judge the headphones for what they're intended and of course, the price. My reference headphones are going to be anything from Grado SR60's, Senheiser PC360,PX100's, Logitech H800's, and even Bose Quietcomfort 15 headphones. Yes, some of these are nearly twice as expensive, but others are also half as much.The point is to have a good frame of reference to listen to them back-to-back and see how they sound.SOUND QUALITYOverall, the sound is very crisp and clear. Mid's come in loud and clear. Highs are soft, not too bright, just the way I like them. The base on the other hand is obviously there, but deep base is non-existent. I listened to a wide range of music from R&B, Rock, Acoustic, Classical, Country, etc. I found acoustic and classical to sound the best. Everything else just lacked punch. I've had them playing for a few hours to get them broken in, but the sound quality really hasn't changed.I connected them to an amp to see if they needed more power, but that didn't really help. In fact, they sounded best when connected to my phone, of all things. It seems that's just what they were designed for.DESIGNThe headphones are over-the-ear closed design. I must say they are very comfortable. The foam padding is very soft and they weigh almost nothing at all. The overall headset has a surprisingly small foot print. They just aren't that big. I'm typically not a fan of closed headphones, but they haven't really done a lot to make them block excessive amount of outside noise. In fact, if you look inside the ear piece, you can see that there isn't much there at all.The speakers are actually angled inside the ear piece. That's something not obvious from the included pictures. But you can see the back of the plastic housing and even the perforations of the yellowish foam padding. I suspect this was done to angle the sound into the ear canal, but I really didn't notice an improvement, and honestly... it looks cheap.Of course on the outside, they just look your typical plastic headphones. You can angle the cups about 90 degrees outward and there is some up/down adjustment to fit your head, but no folding mechanism here.MIC & CONTROLSThe detachable audio cable has an in-line microphone which features volume and play/stop buttons, 3 in total. Since the mic has to be positioned closed to your mouth, the controls are going to have to be used by feel alone. That's actually not a problem. The problem is that with my Galaxy Note 3, only pause button worked. Volume control didn't do anything.The microphone did work surprisingly well though. Moving it close to my mouth didn't make any difference, although it will of course pickup background noise rather easily. I did a bit of walking and talking and the other party never had a problem hearing me. Although I had trouble hearing myself. They are after all, a closed design. Definitely not the best if you like you hear yourself talk.PROS:+ Clear high and mid's+ Very light weight & compact+ Comfortable+ In-line Mic works well+ Detachable cable+ Includes carrying caseCONS:- Expensive- Closed design not the best for mic use- Opening inside ear-piece looks cheap- Volume controls not Android compatible- Poor base response- Doesn't fold for easier travelCONCLUSION:Overall they're a fairly descent set of headphones. The added microphone and in-line controls are a nice touch. Which would make them a great set of headphones to travel with, except the lack of folding mechanism seems odd. Considering their relatively small size, this would have been a plus. However, the lack of real base and high price is somewhat unfortunate. Especially when they don't sound or feel like they should cost this much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V6PJXE19MQG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUICOR6#wasThisHelpful","R1V6PJXE19MQG5","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SM-P605 vs SM-P600I'm going to focus on the SM-P605 specific features of this tablet as there are already a ton of reviews for the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition). Although most are the Wi-Fi only version, which is model SM-P600. This version we have here is the international LTE version, SM-P605. Unfortunately these international versions rarely support the US LTE bands, so we're stuck with 3G/4G (i.e. 1900 MHz) here in the US.The P605 also has a Snapdragon 800 instead of the Samsung Exynos processor. I'll go into more details below. Otherwise in addition to the data & phone capabilities of the P605, they are virtually identical. Or a another comparison might be that this is basically a really big Galaxy Note 3 with a USB 2.0 port and higher resolution.NETWORK PERFORMANCEWith T-Mobile in my area (Austin, TX) I'm in a ""re-farmed"" area. In other words, they've taken some 1900 2G spectrum and re-purposed it for 4G connectivity. If you have AT&T, they already use 1900 so you're good to go. But it is nice to be able to have multiple carrier choices, when possible. I do get a strong signal in my area, although I'm only seeing about 2.5MB to 5MB down with H+. This is likely due to limited bands and network limitations. T-Mobile likes to use the 1700 and 2100 bands (AWS) together for 4G, which this tablet doesn't have. My Galaxy Note 3 phone on T-Mobile 4G/LTE can easily see 20+ down and 15+ on HSPA+.I'm hoping future network improvements will help those speeds, otherwise it's more than enough for surfing, Skype calls, or even streaming High Quality YouTube videos.PHONE (VOICE)Yes, the P605 has an actual phone modem built-in to just like my Galaxy Note 3 does. I popped in my T-Mobile pre-paid SIM that gives me 100 minutes, unlimited text, and 5GB of data ($30/mo) and it works great. I can make phone calls and still have access to a ton of data. Why make phone calls on a tablet? Because it's awesome, that's why. :)Seriously though, while making tablet phone calls isn't something I do all that often (i.e. rarely), it is nice having Google Voice forward calls to multiple devices and being able to answer when and wherever I want. It's all about flexibility and having options.TABLET PERFORMANCEI've owned the SM-P600 (Wi-Fi Only) and now the SM-P605. I really wasn't a big fan of the performance in the P600/Exynos. I frequently found lag and stutter throughout it's usage. The UI worked OK, but switching apps and multi-tasking was a bit annoying. Once I moved over the P605 I found everything to run much smoother. Now that is not to say it's all 100% perfect. There is still an occasional stutter here and there, usually app related, which shouldn't even be an issue with a $600 tablet... but it's far more livable.For most usage such as switching apps, playing video, multi-tasking, navigation the UI, games, surfing, all work about as well as they do on my Galaxy Note 3; maybe just not *quite* as smooth at times when certain apps get in the way. Keep in mind this tablet is pushing a lot more pixels than my phone. And I'm personally very sensitive to frame rates and such. Although I'm hopeful future updates will continue to improve in this regard.Let's wrap this up with my overall Pro's & Con's, even though I didn't touch on most of this stuff due to many other reviews already covering it.PROS:* Noticeable performance improvement with Snapdragon 800* Built-in Phone Modem (Accepts normal Phone SIM)* Supports 1900 Mhz Band for US 3G/4G Data* Excellent 2560x1600 (WQXGA) LCD* Solid high-end specs* Light weight and portable (~1.2lb)* Finally a tablet good enough to keep* Descent sounding speakers (for a tablet)* Great battery life, even on 3G/4G* MicroSD Card Slot* Textured back feels nice to hold* Unlocked!CONS:* Would like to see further performance improvements* No US LTE Band Support (or AWS)* No USB 3.0 Port* Fixed home/navigation buttons can be annoying* Plastic bezel looks cheap* TouchWiz still too heavy (resource hog)* ExpensiveCONCLUSIONI returned the SM-P600 after about a week of usage before I even got the SM-P605. I had almost given up on Samsung tablets, but I'm glad I kept looking! The tablet has handled everything I've reasonably asked of it and even gives me added flexibility of basically having both a smaller and larger portable voice and data communication device. It'll do. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TYW8VZXCUHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HX0M7SS#wasThisHelpful","R33TYW8VZXCUHG","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We already know Solid State Drives are super fast and even the slowest will easily blow away any disk drive. But just how fast is this drive when benchmarked? And how does it compare to other similar drives. Well I've got a few tested, so let's see how it did!TEST BEDFor my testing I'm using my custom built 3rd Gen i7 Workstation with an ASUS P8Z68-V PRO Motherboard running Win8.1 x64. Each drive tested was connected as a 2nd drive to the on-board Intel 6GB SATA controller. These drives were also brand new, never used. Just partitioned, quick format, and off we go with tests. The two benchmark programs are CrystalDiskMark and AS SSD. I'll be uploading benchmark results for this drive separately.BENCHMARK EXPLANATIONWithout going into too much technical detail, I'll briefly explain what I'm talking about below. A sequential test is where it simply read/writes large blocks of data that are physically adjacent to each other on the drive, one after another. Not all real-world data use will fall into this category, but half would be a reasonable assumed average. The other is the random test, where we read/write 4K or 512K (depending on test) blocks of data to various locations on the drive. This usually makes up the other half of day-to-day disk usage. Compare them back to back and you have a pretty good idea how the drive will perform in your hands.CRUCIAL 550 (512GB)The Crucial 550 didn't quite hit the advertised speeds, but we should note that your results will vary depending on your configuration. I'm sure Crucial's test bed was a bit more optimized than a random desktop. Sequential Read was 478MB/s and 466MB/s Write with Crystal Mark. 4K Random Read hit 25MB/s and 69MB/s Write. AS SSD had slightly lower results, but it's overall ""score"" was 429 for all 4 Read tests and 393 Write, with an overall benchmark score of 1047.One odd thing was with the AS SSD Compression benchmark was that the Read/Write kept dropping by a significant amount during the test. Something that the other drives never experienced. The ""real-world"" AS SSD file copy test hit a speed 319 MB/s. AS SSD creates two 500MB ISO files and simply clocks the transfer rate and time it takes to copy from one place of the drive, to another.LITE-ON LCS-512M6SThis is a popular drive, common with OEM's. CrystalDiskMark reported an impressive 518MB/s Sequential Read and 451MB/s Write. That's the fastest Sequential Read I've seen on any SSD in this system. Crucial still has a slight edge in Write here. Random 4K test was 28MB/s Read and 55MB/s Write. Lite-On takes a modest lead on Read, and Crucial easily wins with Write speeds.AS SSD scored the Read benchmark at 446, Write at 390, for a total of 1069. Basically the Lite-On's faster Read times gave it a slight edge in the overall scoring. The compression Benchmark was also much more consistent, easily showing the fastest and most consistent times. Then we run the AS SSD ""real-world"" ISO test and we hit a new record of 459MB/s.SAMSUNG PM830 (256GB SSD)While not the absolute latest SSD, this is still a very popular and well respected solid state drive. Also common with OEM's and Retail, it shows up with various model names. In CrystalDiskMark it matched Crucial with 476MB/s sequential Read, but fell a bit short with Write at 399MB/s. 4K Random Read was also the slowest at 20MB/s and Write was 53MB/s.AS SSD gave the overall Read score of 318, Write was 181, for a total score of 664. That's a much lower score, but you'd expect the newer model drives to have an overall edge in performance. Although the real-world ISO copy test still hit a surprising 352MB/s, actually beating the Crucial in this test.CONCLUSIONSo that's a lot of numbers. But should you care? Perhaps... perhaps not. If I test these drives back to back with real-world use, such as booting up windows, or loading up Battlefield or StarCraft 2, you'd likely have a hard time noticing much of a difference. I would have to grab a stop watch to see the fraction of a second improvements. Sure, they do add up over time, which is why you may not want to completely ignore benchmarks. And if you're comparing similarly priced drives, you're naturally going to want to grab the fastest one. Why not?Which brings me to the main point, and that is price. As currently listed, the 512GB model isn't cheap, and the Crucial M550 isn't exactly the fastest; but compared to other similar drives out there it's actually a pretty good value. Since the price is the big factor here (which can change daily), if this one is still priced reasonably when you read this, consider it highly recommended!Also, as noted I will be uploading additional images with benchmarks for this drive only. If you'd like more details for the other tests, please let me know and I'll post back in the comments.

"I'll focus on the important details on this review as these external hard drives are pretty basic and really haven't changed a whole lot over the years. First, out of the box you've got the somewhat large external drive, a micro-USB 3.0 to standard USB 3.0 cable, and an AC adapter. External power is required.The enclosure this large drive is installed in appears to be sealed with no obvious way to open it up. The edges are surprisingly sharp. Not enough to cut yourself, but rather uncomfortable to hold or travel with. There is a more portable version of this drive with smoother edges, although I'm not sure why there needs to be a separate product. In either case, this one is definitely meant to sit on a desk and stay there.The drive itself is fairly quiet, but you can hear a faint humming noise from the drive. The metal tray that holds the drive in and plastic housing makes it sounds like there is fan inside. There isn't one. Although I never noticed a large amount of heat from the drive even after copying several TB of data.Performance with USB 3.0 is excellent, getting transfer speeds on par if not slightly fast than other USB 3.0 drives I have laying around. Which is to say easily around 108MB/sec average transfer rate. See images for a CrystalMark Benchmark.Seagate also includes some basic software to schedule backups. There isn't much to say about it, but there aren't many advanced features. You can backup the entire drive or just select the folders you want. Schedule and let it run. With 4TB you should have plenty of space... for now! The software even lets you turn on/off the LED and let it know if you want the drive to go to sleep when not in use.PROS:+ Fast USB 3.0 Transfer Rates+ 2 Year Warranty+ Backup Software Included+ Software allows basic control of external drive+ Relatively inexpensive+ Automatically wakes up and sleeps with computer+ No fan to fail (pro & con)CONS:- Enclosure has sharp edges- Limited portability due to size/enclosure- External power required- No fan to keep coolCONCLUSIONAs originally noted, there isn't a whole lot to say with these external drives. But Seagate has put together a rather nice package with some useful software (that works) at a fairly good price with a descent warranty. I just wish they had used a more portable enclosure to make it more travel friendly, if needed. Those hard sharp edges seem rather odd.*** UPDATE 8/01/14: ***I opened the enclosure awhile ago and noticed that there isn't actually a fan. I've updated the review above to reflect this. There are over a dozen tabs that hold the blue bottom cover onto the black housing. You'll need a small flat-head screw driver (or two) to carefully pry away the black portion from the blue cover, while lifting upward on the bottom cover at the same time. This is to release the tabs.After some work, it'll eventually snap off, revealing a metal tray that holds the drive itself. The tray has the USB/Power ports attached to it as well. After that's there's just 4 screws holding the drive in the metal drive, that are covered by some rubber isolation pieces.Otherwise nothing new to report with the drive. It's been working great. The plastic case helps keep the outside cool as it creates a barrier from the drive itself. And there are holes on the bottom to help vent. While a fan would be nice, it does mean there's one additional part to fail (which it would eventually).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRY7A828NSRNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFRWXQ0#wasThisHelpful","RRY7A828NSRNZ","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What we have here is basically and all-in-one headset, made for Gamers, such as myself. The idea is to allow you to use one headset for your PC while gaming, answering cell phone calls, or even plugging into an MP3 player on-the-go. So how does it do with so many tasks? Let's find out.OUT OF THE BOXThe package here is pretty basic and straight forward. You've got the wireless headset, wireless USB receiver, 1/8"" audio cable, USB -> Mini-USB charger, detachable microphone (connects via separate 1/8"" jack) and some documentation. That's about it. The headset will talk to you as it helps explain what's going on. ""Power on, pairing, tone settings, etc.""The batteries are sealed and rechargeable, so need to purchase anything else. All of the buttons and connectors on the headset are also quite easy to figure out. I could have probably even set it up and paired everything up without looking at the quick start guide. But after the 5 second pairing process and allowing Windows 8 to automatically load the native drivers, I was ready to go. There was no additional software included.THE HEADSETThe headset is a large on-the-ear design that blocks out most outside noise. This is normally not something I like, however it does have a mic-return function that is adjustable with a separate dial. So you can decide how much you want to hear your voice in the headset. Speaking of the Mic, it's easily removable in case you don't want it there. It also works very well. My friends noted that my voice was very crisp and clear, about the best they've heard so far. One negative is that you have to press (and find) a button to mute. I prefer the auto-mute function of the Sennheiser when moving the boom upwards.The headset does have some cloth-type padding on the ear-piece and head band. It's moderately firm and mostly comfortable, but after a 2 hour gaming session, I was ready to take a break. Not something I've had an issue with using other around the ear headphones, such as my PC360's. Considering how the fit on the ear, it's not bad.Beyond that it's a mostly plastic design, while still feeling durable and well built. There are a few buttons on the ear-piece that are a tad small and will take some getting used to so you can find them easier. The volume wheel is also somewhat stiff. That might wear-in with time. Same goes for the overall comfort as well.AUDIOTo fully test out the headset, I played a wide range of music, watched some movies, made a few phone calls (more on that below), and played few games with friends (while using Skype). Does it sound better than my much more expensive Sennheiser PC360's? No, of course not. But it actually sounds pretty darn good with everything I played. I used the built-in EQ Tone control to switch to Tone #4, which increases bass and treble. The other 3 settings are somewhat useless (flat, high treble, & high bass).To my ears, I felt it had pretty descent highs and lows. I could hear everything going in games, foot steps, explosions, etc. It's not enough to rattle your head, but it certainly good enough.BLUETOOTH & AUX INPart of the multi-tasking functionality is that it can pair to your Bluetooth enabled phone. After holding down the BT button on the headset for a few seconds, I was instantly paired with my LG G2 android phone. The phone basically sees it as any other wireless headset. There are bluetooth specific volume buttons on your headset, but no answer/decline button. Which is fine as I think any more buttons would just become far to hard to reach without looking.Basically, I was in the middle of a game, killing zombies (L4D2), as per usual. My phone rings, I tap answer on the phone, and the game volume is automatically lowered so I can make take the phone call. All while staying alive in my zombie game. When the call is over, hang up, and carry on as if nothing happened. It's just that simple.And if you just want to listen to music on your MP3 player, simply plug in the included 1/8"" audio cable, and listen away. Assuming your MP3 player doesn't already have Bluetooth that is, in which case, who needs cables?PROS:+ Pretty descent sound quality+ Bluetooth headset functionality+ Excellent mic+ Multi-tasking while gaming+ Rechargeable Li-Ion battery+ Easy to setup and use+ Mic audio returnCONS:- Buttons can be a little hard to feel around for.- Headset can become uncomfortable after extended use- Tad priceyCONCLUSION:I think it's important to consider what this is designed for, which is Gamers. Not audiophiles or folks needing something super portable. We're talking about something that handles multiple tasks and still sounds good while doing it. If it were more comfortable and just a little cheaper, I'd give it 5 stars. But even as is, I still consider it recommended for it's intended purpose. After all, I could probably give my eyes a break at the same time. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IZGDYG066FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8T886S#wasThisHelpful","R30IZGDYG066FN","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just had our house build two years ago, where I was present for construction and pictures of where most PVC, Beams, and Electrical wiring is going. Not to mention there are several areas where I've already had to locate studs. I tested out the Dewalt on several walls in my house, some even multiple times.There were a few occasions, where it looked as though it finding the wooden beams and such. But then I'd go over it again and get completely different results. It would say there was something there when I knew for a fact, there was not. I kept thinking maybe user error?But I went through the instructions with different speeds and directions. It's really fool proof to use. You just move it in one direction so it can scan, up to 9.8', and then back in the other direction to get the results on the LCD. It has pictures indicating what is there. And even has a ""confidence meter"" that was always one bar short of a full graph. I mean, it's just basic painted drywall.I also called DeWalt and apparently they have stopped manufacturing of this unit while they review the situation and find out what's going on. Obviously they weren't expecting it to not work at all. Their suggestion is to either return or take it to a service center.

"As the title says, this is a cute book for kids. It's about what happened when all the numbers in town disappeared. Nobody could call anyone, or figure out what day it is, or know what size to wear, or how much anything cost. The entire book is written in rhyme, and some of the rhymes are pretty clever. What I really appreciate about the book, however, is that there are little interjections here and there to define some of the words (numberless, estimate, quantities, calculate, infinity), so it can be useful in teaching those concepts as their definitions are given, as well as being used in context. In all, it's an entertaining read and could be used at home or even in a math class.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R0R1A41X48YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761453857#wasThisHelpful","R3R0R1A41X48YC","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, I want to say that I love that this comes with its own spoon, and a spot to store said spoon. I have a few little individual travel bowls that I use when I'll have to be feeding my one-year-old while we're out and about, but I have to use a snack-size ziploc bag to keep his spoon clean before food-time (and keep the diaper bag clean afterwards). Before using it, I was worried about how well the bowls sealed; just playing around with it after getting it felt like the seal wasn't perfect. So, the first time I used it (to bring my son over to his grandparents' house), I put it in a large ziploc bag, just in case it spilled. I was especially concerned because I put his oatmeal powder in one bowl and sealed that, then (a bit later) opened the other bowl to put cheerios in and saw a few flakes of oatmeal powder in with the spoon. Those may have ended up in there when I was pouring, or they may have migrated; I'm not sure. However, once we got to grandma's house, I checked the bag and it was clean, so I felt reasonably confident in its seal.The unit is a little on the large side, but each bowl holds basically a serving: there was plenty of room in the oatmeal bowl for it, and the cheerios side held what the box considered a serving for the under-4 crowd. If you have a diaper bag that's big enough for it and have a need to bring your child's food with you, I'd recommend it. We don't have too much use for it, as his lunch and dinners right now tend to be served straight from the jars the purees are sold in, so I would only need this for if we're going out before breakfast, and I'm not sure if the size of this unit is worth the convenience of the spoon slot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37OWKSS1Z42O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BV0ESIS#wasThisHelpful","R37OWKSS1Z42O9","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never done pilates before, and only ever done the tiniest bit of yoga (and that yoga is through the Wii Fit). I've been mostly sedentary for years, with my idea of exercise being walking the three-mile loop in my neighborhood (and walking up and down the stairs carrying my one-year-old). I was interested in trying a new type of exercise to try to tone my body, so I thought I'd give this pilates DVD a try.On Tuesday morning, I tried the first routine on the disc, Total Body Lengthen & Strengthen. During the workout, I felt the good kind of burn, though my abs complained ""hey, what's up? you know this isn't what we're meant for!"" Some of the parts of the routine were more difficult than others, and I had to orient myself so I could always be watching the screen to be sure I was doing it right, but it was hard to remember sometimes when I was supposed to be inhaling and when I was supposed to be exhaling: instructor Elizabeth Ordway would throw all the information about the move at you as you're beginning, including which parts to inhale and exhale on; sometimes as you're doing repetitions, she'd remind you when to inhale and exhale, while other times she'd remind you what you're doing, or provide information on this movement will tone; unless she was reminding us of inhales or exhales, it was easy to quickly forget (in the bulk of information provided immediately, when trying to copy what she's doing on the screen) when to breathe. If you already have a decent background in pilates and/or yoga (and are therefore not really a BEGINNER), I imagine you'd know when to breathe for these sorts of exercises, but I have no such background. There were a few parts of the routine where she offered an ""easier"" version if what you were doing hurt your back, but on others you were expected to do it exactly as Ms. Ordway did, regardless of the difficulty.After a warm shower following completion of the 20-minute routine, I went about my normal day's routine, no complaints from my muscles. Not until I was going to bed Tuesday night, when I started to feel a bit of burn in my abs. Wednesday morning, however, my abs were in agony. Doing anything that activated those muscles hurt: a coughing fit at lunch, bending down to pick my son up out of his crib, sitting up from a recline, etc. My abs were still sore when I went to bed Wednesday night. Thursday morning, I forced myself to get up and turn on the second routine on the disc, Long & Lean Waistline. I lasted into that routine about 3 minutes before I had to give up because my abs simply could not take it.I would hardly consider this to be a workout DVD for beginners. When you start one of the workouts, Ms. Ordway leads right into the routine, no preparatory warm-up stretching at the beginning, and there is no cool-down at the end. You need to know that you need to stretch beforehand and cool-down afterwards  and if you're a beginner, you probably (I don't) don't know what appropriate warm-ups and cool-downs are for this type of exercise. I didn't even realize that until my husband, who works out considerably more than I do, pointed it out to me.If you have no experience with this type of exercise, I would heavily recommend that you look into a different workout routine instead of this one. I would only recommend this ""for beginners"" DVD to people who already have a beginner's level of understanding of the basics and core strength.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79YIYQ8QL07A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8A0OZ4#wasThisHelpful","R79YIYQ8QL07A","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used arnica-based creams before, though not this brand and not in years. I have a tendency to get bumps and bruises, so I thought I'd give an old friend a try. One night, my one-year-old tipped backwards while sitting next to me, letting his hard little noggin land with all the force possible right on my arm. And yes, it left a tender, lightly-bruised spot. I applied a bit of the cream to the bruise (after it showed up the next day), and it did seem to help soothe the soreness and may even have helped with the bruise.However, the same one-year-old also has a fondness for bonking his head against his crib and the walls, enough that he gave himself a bruise on the forehead. I applied a tiny bit of arnica to his bruised noggin, and while I have no idea if he had even been feeling pain from the bruised area or if the arnica helped it, I do know that it didn't seem to help the bruise go away: several days later, the bruise is smaller but still visible.I've not had any major bruises since getting the cream, so I can't say how well it works on those, but it does seem to provide a bit of relief to soreness. I'm not sure that I would recommend it, though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SE77HI6P6AZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEYEREY#wasThisHelpful","R1SE77HI6P6AZO","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While looking at this new camera, I'm also going to focus on my comparison between the GoPro Hero3 Silver and the new Hero3+ Silver. What's different, how does it work on its own, is it worth an upgrade? Let's find out.OUT OF THE BOXFirst out is the camera, as it's nicely mounted in the glass container at the top of the box. It's already obvious the new housing for the Hero3+ is noticeably smaller and more compact than the older one. The housing buttons are larger and easier to press, but everything else was downsized. The latch no longer requires an extra tab to slide over, yet still feels very secure and tight when closed. The front covering over the lens has become simplified as there are no longer rivets or a large bezel adding to bulk.There is some concern this could reduce durability, but short of throwing it into a wall, I'm going to just base this on look and feel. Which is to say it appear to be just a solid and durable as the old one. Otherwise the camera itself is identical in size to the old one, so everything is interchangeable. Extra batteries and cables will work just fine with both. You can check the product description to see what exactly is included, but it's just the basics. A few basic mounting brackets, stickers, mini-USB cable, etc. No charger is included.CAMERA SETUPAfter charging, the first step will be to supply a micro-sd card. I did run into an issue where my 32GB Sandisk Class 10 card wouldn't work. I just got an Error on the display. Despite manually cleaning and formatting the card to the specific exFat file system the camera required, it was never happy. At least not until I found the menu option within the camera itself to format the card for me (trash can icon). After that, it's been working great.Speaking of the menu, going through the initial setup via the on-board controls is still as annoying as it was in the previous version. In other words, we have the same basic menu layout and 2 buttons to change menus and make your selections. If you've used them before, you're all set. If not, I do suggest going over the user's guide which has a menu layout that'll help you find what you want and avoid getting lost. As this camera has wireless functionality, it's usually best to get this part setup and use your smartphone to connect and make changes.The GoPro Android app, which I'm using on 2 separate phones, worked great. I used my LG G2 and Note 2 so we could test them out separately. There was virtually no difference between the two, other than the additional video modes the Hero3+ added in the drop-down menus. The preview still has a 1-2 second delay, but more than enough as a basic view-finder. Once again, really no change on the software side of things. At least nothing cosmetic.VIDEO QUALITYThis is of course the important part. So for this test I've basically got them mounted side-by-side on the windshield of the car. Both phones were wirelessly connected to the android phones as well we could easily make identical changes on the fly. Testing was done in daylight and in multiple different video modes. You can check Amazon or GoPro's website to see an exact list of video mode changes going to the plus model, but the important ones are some things that have trickled down from the older Black Series.This includes 1080p @ 60hz, 960p @ 60hz, and 720p @ 120hz which is basically double the frame-rate of older GoPro Silver. Whether I was taking advantage of the higher frame rate of the new model, the video quality was noticeable improved. The image was brighter, more vibrant, and seemed to have more detail than the older non-plus model. And once you take advantage of the higher FPS, action shots look considerably smoother.The camera's megapixels have dropped from 11MP to 10MP, although I didn't notice any change in still photo quality.  It's also not something I use all that much with the GoPro. Even though it of course has plenty of features such as burst shot mode.AUDIOWhile playing both videos back to back, it's very obvious there is an improvement in audio quality. We're using the same backing (with 2 openings) while it was in the car. With the older model, our voices and other audio were quiet and muffled. But with the plus, our voice was very clear and easy to understand. The audio was simply more crisp and detailed. Really a night and day difference.PROS:+ More compact housing+ Increased battery capacity+ Improved High resolution video quality+ Noticable audio quality improvement+ Higher FPS video recording at all HD resolutions+ Durable and Waterproof (in housing)+ Wireless smartphone connectivity+ Has most important features of older Black seriesCONS:- Battery life could always be better- Menu controls can still be confusing- Slightly expensive- Camera gets very warm- Picky with SD card formattingCONCLUSION:Overall there wasn't much to dislike about the new camera. Considering its intended purpose, I don't think you can really find anything better for the money. The GoPro Hero3+ Silver basically offers many of the improved video quality/FPS of the older Black series, for less money. And other than 4K recording of the new Black series, the Silver series fits into a nice ""mid-range"" providing everything most folks are looking for. All while making several minor but very welcome design improvements.Bottom line, spend a little more for the new plus model and you won't be disappointed.UPDATED 1/14/15:I've been meaning to update this review regarding the horizontal flip issue. Basically, when used up-side-down, the image would be flipped horizontally as well as vertically. Just a software glitch that took some time to get fixed. A software update from GoPro has resolved that issue and it works perfectly now. I've updated the review above and removed that particular section.Otherwise the camera is still working great and no other significant changes since I wrote this review. Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBCVAPDP4GF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3F0EIU#wasThisHelpful","R2SBCVAPDP4GF8","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OUT OF THE BOXOut of the box you've got the shaver, two pieces of plastic that form the charging stand, and the power cord. Other than the instruction manual, there isn't much else in the box. The first step is to simply attach the plastic parts together so you can charge the shaver. The power cord plugs directly into the stand so the shaver can rest in there and charge via the metal contacts. This is the only way to charge the shaver, it must be in the dock. That can be somewhat inconvenient if used for extended trips.THE SHAVERThe saver itself is basically a mid-range foil shaver in terms of features and functionality. It's a tad bulky and on the heavy side for most shavers in this class. It has 2 separate foils that are spaced apart due to the middle ""cooling bar"" and cutting system. The shaver is straight as can be, no angle or adjustments. The foils of course move up and down for some movement, but it is limited in this regard.There is a power button and of course, the blue snow-flake to enable cooling functionality. At the back you have a basic trimmer. It opens upward into a locked position allowing for forward and backward movement, without closing. Although the blades are very short and actually angle backwards, which can limit it's usefulness. There is no cleaning system with this unit, but the foil pops off making cleaning about as easy as it gets for this type of razor.THE SHAVEI started my shave without washing my face and at 90 degree angles, as directed. They've made it very clear you shouldn't wash your fast before the shave as I suspect it can prevent a smooth shave. And the 90 degree angle would be required since the head doesn't move and is stuck in one position. I started without the cooling function on one side and it went as expected. Then switched on the cooling for the other side. First, that cooling bar gets rather cool very quickly. It basically feels like a cold metal bar going across your face. It's a rather odd sensation at first. My infrared thermometer was indicating around 68 degrees.Unfortunately, as is expected with most mid-range shavers, they just don't do quite as good of a job as the higher-end models. Essentially requiring more passes over the same area that others went through much easier. Despite this, once I was done, I couldn't help but notice there was slightly less irritation, as my skin can be somewhat sensitive. And at the end of the shave, my face is smooth as can be.PROS+ Cooling bar actually works+ Dual foil system+ Water proof+ Lockable trimmer+ Li-Ion Battery+ Easy to manually clean+ Dock for easy charging+ Smooth shave!CONS- Not cheap- No head adjustment- Somewhat Bulky & Heavy- Can't charge without dock- Short, limited trimmer bladesCONCLUSIONI should note that my most recent shavers are the Braun 790 and Panasonic ES-LV81-K shavers. While these are much more expensive units, I am of course taking into consideration the price and functionality compared to other shavers I've used in the past. I've been using electric shavers decades, so I've gone through a few. With all that considered, and despite my skepticism, I did find the cooling technology to actually work. I'm quite happy with the shave, which says a lot considering it's competition. If you have a good shaver, I don't think it's awesome enough to buy a new one. But if you're looking to upgrade and are interested in trying something just a little different, I consider this one recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21YP5AF15ZYZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6ZV28#wasThisHelpful","R21YP5AF15ZYZS","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've already got the original Sony EC21 magnetic charging cable that was removed from the Sony DK30 Dock/Cradle. But at this time, the dock is still very expensive and I needed another charging cable so I don't have to keep opening the USB charging flap. The Patuoxun replacement cable is a nearly identical copy of the Sony EC21. The cable is slightly shorter by a few inches and I noticed the pogo pins on the Patuoxun are actually a little bigger and wider. The Patuoxun cable itself, not including the connectors, is 30"" long.I compared them back to back and repeatedly removed and reattached them to my Sony Xperia Z Ultra from various angles and it's actually very difficult to tell the difference. Both have nearly the same magnetic hold and connection. That is to say, neither are perfect. They both allow for a little more side-to-side movement than I'd like and aren't meant to be used while using the phone, as they will likely fall off. That's just how they're designed.In either case, if you're looking for a cheaper (and more available) alternative to the Sony EC21, I consider this cable highly recommended. I'll be uploading pictures shortly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KBLHDPEWC4KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDPCP0A#wasThisHelpful","R1KBLHDPEWC4KO","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the 3M Dual-Swivel Monitor arm mounted to my 5' Ikea Galant desk and it's working perfectly. I'm using this with two Dell U2412 24"" Ultrasharp monitors and they work perfectly.There are two separate mounting options included. The desk mount can either be mounted as a ""clamp style,"" which is most common, to attach to a flat surface or via ""Grommet Type"" to go through a hole in the desk. The assembly and installation was pretty straight forward after getting all of the parts together. The included instructions are basic, but the pictures pretty much give you all the information you need.Unlike previous 3M stands, the arms are already fully assembled. You just need to basically screw it to the desk and attach the monitors. For final adjustment, there are Allen Key points to tighten at the pole and the swivel point at back of the monitor. This is a revised version from my original single-monitor 3M mount and appears to be much more durable and has better secure points to prevent the monitor from slipping down.As this is a standard VESA mount, it worked exactly as expected with both Dell monitors I tested it with. There is a new optional detachable plastic VESA mount that allows for easy removal of the monitor via a simple ""tab"" versus having to completely disassemble the entire mount. Unfortunately the plastic piece isn't meant to fit inside the indention of the Dell monitors I have, where the original stand was. It's just slightly too large. The arm has a hidden place to run cables, although because it is enclosed via a plastic cover on the bottom, there is limited space. Also be sure to check your cable length to make sure there is enough slack for future movement. These stands need more ""excess"" cable than you might think to make sure you don't break any cables or connectors.Overall, the mount appears to be sturdy and allows for much more vertical and horizontal movement on my work surface than I had before with the original monitor stand. Since I'm against a wall, I did find the arms to be a bit longer than I'd like, requiring me to work them into an awkward angle so the monitors were together. Also keep in mind some adjustments will still require use of the Allen wrench, unless you keep it loose, which is quite doable. It's also very expensive, but at least seems well built. Otherwise, I'd consider this recommended for anybody looking into a durable dual monitor swivel arm solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I3B9WEFW702C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NSGO3M#wasThisHelpful","R2I3B9WEFW702C","A23QII83UGZP5U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23QII83UGZP5U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We're in wartime London and the Blitz is about to begin.  Livia Ripley is a recent widow living with her two young daughters.  She's a worrier who finds it hard to forgive herself for a terrible mistake that she made as a child.  Over the next few months she will grow in confidence and develop a sense of purpose.  She will also get to know two men who will both have a significant impact on her.This was really a book of two halves for me - or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a book of one third and two thirds.  For the first 100 pages or so, I kept waiting for things to happen.  It just seemed to be about Livia's everyday life with her daughters and her worries about whether she was doing a good job raising them.  It's a slow burner of a plot and the title is quite misleading as are the publisher's comparison to ""Brief Encounter"".  This isn't really a romance, it's more about a woman growing up and forgiving herself for past mistakes.  But somewhere around the 100+ page mark, I realised that I was really enjoying it and I finished the rest in one sitting.This is the third book written by Margaret Leroy that's set during WW2.  The English Girl took place in Vienna and The Soldier's Wife (aka The Collaborator) in Guernsey.  What all three have in common is that they all focus on interesting and flawed women who are struggling to find their feet against the backdrop of wartime events.  I really enjoy the way that she writes and how she gives you a sense of what living in that environment would have been like.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RRJQH3637R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FUGCRE#wasThisHelpful","R39RRJQH3637R9","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twenty years ago (yes, really!), Bill Bryson wrote the brilliant ""Notes from a Small Island"" about his travels around Great Britain.  This is a sequel, of sorts, with Bryson again travelling around Britain and making observations.  He explains in Chapter 1 that his plan was to travel between the two points that were the furtherest apart when separated by a straight line: Bognor Regis in the South and Cape Wrath in northernmost Scotland.  Rather than follow the line religiously, he determined to use it as a rough guidance whilst visiting as many new places as he possibly could.This is rubbish.  In fact, Bryson veers all over the south of Britain, going as far west as Cornwall and Wales and as far east as Norfolk and East Anglia, and showing remarkably little interest in venturing north.  Two thirds of the way through the book and he's only made it to Birmingham.  Scotland gets a mere 12 pages of the total 381 (Wales gets 15).  So really, he should have been honest about the fact that when he says Britain, what he really means is England.  There is a map at the front of the book showing all sorts of places in Britain: it bears zero resemblance to the places that he actually visits.The other thing that emerges - and I suspect the real reason for the lower English focus - is that rather than being one long piece of travel, this is a group of day trips and overnight trips, which are broken up by family events and trips to the US and various other commitments.  If this was to be the approach, I wish Bryson had taken a bit more care in the planning.  So often he turns up somewhere, realises it's Sunday and the museums are closed, and then gives up and leaves again.  (Even worse, sometimes he gets there when the local attraction is open but decides paying 20 pounds is too much and so doesn't bother.  Doesn't he get expenses?  Isn't the entire point to actually visit these places?)Bryson's modus operandi is to turn up in a small town, give us an account of whether they have a bookshop or not, check out the local museum if there is one and report back on the museum cafe, go for a walk through the local countryside, have a beer in the pub and move on to the next destination.  Which could be quite tedious if it wasn't for his gift of making obscure trivia both fascinating and funny.  There are very few pages in this book which fail to amuse, particularly when he pokes fun at the (absence of) Britain's service culture.In fact, Bryson is noticeably grumpier this time around and he frequently breaks his narrative to vent about the failings of internet search engines, incorrect grammar, minor celebrities, littering or a host of other subjects.  I found most of his rants pretty funny but reading other reviews, it seems that they divide readers.  If you don't enjoy them, be warned that there are a lot.Overall this is an enjoyable book, but it suffers from too much self-indulgence and repetition to become a classic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RC1TUWLFVVCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZD5L9K#wasThisHelpful","R1RC1TUWLFVVCB","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are in a rural farming community in New Zealand.  It's 1972.  It's a small community where everyone knows everyone's business, thanks in part to the ""party line"", the shared telephone system which enables people to eavesdrop on one another's conversations if they feel so inclined.  And yet, there are unspoken rules about turning a blind eye to other people's business, even when perhaps the right thing would be to step in and help.Ian Baxter has come to work on one of the farms, bringing his precocious pre-teen daughter Gabrielle.  Ian's wife Bridie recently died of cancer, leaving Ian engulfed in grief and struggling to parent his daughter.  Gabrielle and her new best friend Nickie are left to their own devices.  When they make a discovery about a local family, a situation that the community has been feigning ignorance of, their subsequent actions will send a shockwave rippling through the area.This is a beautifully written book and I savored every page of it.  The characters are real and rounded and the community is vividly brought to life.  The story focuses on three main characters: the grieving Ian Baxter, impressionable Nickie and her mother Joy.  Interestingly, although Gabrielle is a main character and the catalyst for much of the plot, her character remains somewhat inscrutable and I thought this was a shame.This is a debut novel (the author has previously published two books of short stories) and it is a fine one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZMIF9GT069J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0156SSDJK#wasThisHelpful","R1EZMIF9GT069J","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frederick Forsyth is best known as the author of a string of bestselling thrillers, but he was in the RAF and worked as a foreign correspondant before becoming an author, and the first two thirds of this book are about this part of his life.  I don't know how many of his stories are 100% true and how many are embellished, but they feel true and either way they are terrifically entertaining.  Reading this book feels like being at a dinner party, with the host starting increasingly gobsmacking anecdotes with lines like: ""did I ever tell you about the time I was almost murdered in Paris"" or ""did I ever tell you about the time that I narrowly missed getting killed when a bullet went through my legs"".Forsyth's pedigree as a writer is apparent, with chapters ending with teasers designed to keep you reading, or starting with lines like: ""I recall the date when I almost started the Third World War with exact accuracy for reasons that will become plain"".Besides his many adventures, he has had access to a string of fascinating characters: gun runners, assassins, drug smugglers, spies, presidents.  His first novel, The Day of the Jackal, was based in part on conversations he had with de Gaulle's bodyguards.  The Odessa File was guided by none other than Simon Wiesenthal.  While researching The Cobra, he ended up in the middle of a coup d'etat in Guinea-Bissau.In the middle the pace slows slightly as he talks about his time in Nigeria and Biafra, an experience that strongly affected him and that he clearly feels anger about to this day.  While interesting, this part of the book is less engaging than the earlier and subsequent chapters.The overall impression is of a guy who has lived a fascinating and blessed life, and who is fully aware of it.  This is a great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RY4LF1HA2GQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176071#wasThisHelpful","R2RY4LF1HA2GQF","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am working my way through the Gabriel Allon series.  This is the second book of what is now fifteen with presumably more to come.The English Assassin picks up a year after the events of The Kill Artist.  Allon has returned to Cornwall and his work as an art restorer.  He travels to Zurich for a work assignment, but when he arrives there he discovers that his client, a wealthy Swiss banker, is dead and he is promptly arrested in connection with the murder.  Allon is then drawn into an investigation of why the banker was killed which leads into the search for artworks  stolen by the Nazis and missing since WW2.While the book starts well, I found it hard going.  Allon bounds all over Europe in a way that doesn't make a lot of sense and the secondary characters - particularly Anna Rolfe - never come together as real people.  There are also huge plot holes and fortuitous coincidences that never ring true.  While I intend to keep going with this series, this is definitely not as strong as the first book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXHOWXB69AST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451208188#wasThisHelpful","R3OXHOWXB69AST","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is where it all began: the first instalment in the Gabriel Allon series which is up to 15 books now and still going strong.  When we meet Gabriel Allon he is in his late 40s and living a solitary life in Cornwall.  Allon works as a freelance and very successful art restorer and is trying to forget his previous life as an Israeli operative who helped to track down the Black September assassins - and the family he lost when his wife and child were targeted in retaliation.Allon is approached by his former boss, asking him to come out of retirement to help track down a Palestinian terrorist named Tariq.  Reluctantly, he agrees, and it is the ensuing game of cat and mouse between Allon and Tariq that forms the storyline for this book.This is a very accomplished thriller that develops at a steady pace, incorporating some real life events and individuals to give it a sense of realism.  The characters are interesting and rounded, although there are occasional clunky moments where the author clearly struggled with how to integrate their background stories into the narrative.  It's a tense read which is reminiscent of Frederick Forsyth's early books.If this whets your appetite to read on in the series, the next book is The English Assassin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZR4J0YZIKTPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451209338#wasThisHelpful","R1ZR4J0YZIKTPI","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sequel to ""Me Before You"" and it does rely on you being familiar with the first book (luckily it's a great read).  It picks up 18 months after the end of the previous book.  Lou Clark is living in London, working at a tacky airport bar and trying to get on with her life, but she is still grieving for the loss of the man that she loved.  Then two people come into her life: a teenage girl and a paramedic, and each will change her enormously.I felt a bit frustrated during the first half of this book.  It seemed pretty obvious how things were going to pan out and I didn't feel terribly invested in the characters or what would happen to them.  Somewhere around the middle of the book I realised that I didn't have things completely right and that at best, I had only worked out the plot to the end of Act 2.  The final third of the book got me emotionally and really lifted the entire book from a probable two star rating to a near four star rating.JoJo Moyes has a very engaging writing style that exudes a quiet humour.  There aren't any laugh out moments in this book but there are some definite smiles.  She can also get you thinking about second acts in life and learning to move on.  In the end, I really enjoyed this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LBYA35DYAR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426590#wasThisHelpful","R12LBYA35DYAR5","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many others, I loved Shantaram: A Novel, and so I approached this sequel with an equal mix of anticipation and trepidation.  Could Gregory David Roberts repeat the magic?  The short answer is no.  This book isn't nearly as good as Shantaram, and worse, it has the potential to make Shantaram seem worse in retrospect.  But having said that, it's not a total disaster either.  I read it in a week, and despite its near 900 page length, I never lost interest nor found it hard to stay with.The Mountain Shadow is set two years after the events of Shantaram.  Lin is still living in Bombay and working as a forger for his mentor Khaderbhai's mafia organisation, now run by Sanjay Kumar and known as the Sanjay Corporation.  He is living with his girlfriend Lisa (I didn't remember her, but she was in the previous book towards the end), and while he still carries a torch for Karla, he hasn't seen her for two years, since she married Ranjit, an aspiring politician.In the first 100 pages three key events happen.  Lin meets an Irishman by the name of Concannon, he is kidnapped by a rival gang who want information about the Sanjay Corporation and his girlfriend Lisa tells him that she wants to see other people.  These three things will set a train of events in motion that drive the remainder of the plot.  Apart from brief forays to Sri Lanka and to a spiritual retreat, the action is set entirely in Bombay and many familiar characters will appear, among them Didier, Abdullah, Madame Zhou and Karla.  As in the previous book, Bombay is itself a key character in the book, with all its corruption and chaos, millionaires, gangsters, holy men and slum dwellers.This book is overwritten.  It's full of flowery sentences like: ""She was a river, not a stone, and every day was another curve in tomorrow's plain"" or ""Night is Truth wearing a purple dress, and people dance differently there"".  If it wasn't for the author's postscript telling us that he doesn't endorse drug taking, I would have sworn that he was stoned throughout the writing of this book.  So many sentences read like the kind of thing you think is brilliant when you come up with them at 3am, but realise in the cold light of day that they are tripe.  Where was the editor in this process, I wondered?The characters all spend huge amounts of time smoking marijuana and exchanging dialogue that feels like it belongs in a fortune cookie, eg: ""A heart filled with greed, pride or hateful feelings is not free"" or ""It's the things that make us one, that make us worth having"" or ""Money's a river: some of us go with the current and some of us paddle to the shore"".  It's these empty platitudes that take the place of character development.  I've now read 1700 pages of Lin's adventures and I still couldn't really tell you what Karla is like.  Too many characters can be summarised in pithy descriptors like ""angry lesbian"", ""spoiled heiress"", ""free-spirited Aquarian"" or ""foul-tempered crusader"" - they aren't real or rounded people.And yet, for all these flaws, there's something likeable in these pages.  I can't say with hand on heart that ""you should read this"", but it's not a write off either and it ends on a genuinely touching and uplifting note.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R343EQL7IGPR6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802124453#wasThisHelpful","R343EQL7IGPR6X","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Molly and Aidan live in San Francisco and being unable to have children of their own, hope to adopt.  However Molly, who was raised by a woman who was not her biological mother, is apprehensive about her ability to be a good mother to a future baby.  She carries many secrets about her upbringing.  At the end of the first chapter she tells us ""my mother murdered my father"", but it will take most of the book before we - and she -fully understand what actually happened.This synopsis is somewhat of misleading: this isn't a mystery or a crime-centered novel, not even close.  It's a coming of age book which centres on the year in Molly's life when she was 14.  The first half develops quite slowly and it's pretty easy for the reader to guess what's going to happen and this kind of irritated me until I realised that the point of the book is more about Molly's perspective and her lack of awareness about things that are happening around her, rather than being about what actually happens.By the end of the book I felt somewhat unsatisfied.  I didn't really accept that Molly would have cut herself off from her family so completely, nor that no one would have talked to her about what happened  (I also found it hard to believe that her 17 year old cousin would not have been equally protected).  I'm a bit torn between giving this one three stars or four stars.  I like Diane Chamberlain's writing and some the characters that she creates are rounded and brought vividly to life (her husband and biological mother, not so much).  The end is also very moving.  However ultimately I just felt that it was a ""okay/good"" book, neither remarkable nor memorable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R166FUJJCNJSCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250010748#wasThisHelpful","R166FUJJCNJSCO","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Sliding Doors kind of book, when we explore two possible directions in the life of 29 year old Hannah Martin who has just moved to LA, the city she grew up in, fresh off a nasty break-up in New York.  On her first night back she goes out with her best friend Gabby and runs into her high school boyfriend, Ethan.  In one version of her life, she will go home with him.  In the other, she will leave with Gabby and Gabby's husband.  Either way, her life will turn out quite differently.When I started reading this book I thought I was going to love it.  Hannah is a bright and sassy narrator and the back-and-forth banter that she has with Gabby is really fun to read.  However those are the two most sharply drawn characters in the book.  The others - and particularly Hannah's love interests - really don't exist other than to be people that she falls in love with and who fall in love with her.  Also, there are a number of overlaps between the storylines, so we often have to read two versions of the same events, occasionally even the same word for word dialogue.  After a while it gets kind of tedious.As I grew disenchanted with the book, I also became disenchanted with Hannah and her adorable affinity for cinnamon rolls - seriously, did we need this brought up every 10 pages?  Fairly early on it's apparent how each of the two storylines will pan out and with very few surprises they do exactly that.  I just got a bit bored with this book.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BHX24DML25JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476776881#wasThisHelpful","R3BHX24DML25JL","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second ""Sam Dryden"" book by Patrick Lee and it features the same hero as the first, but they are standalone stories. He has a terrific writing style for this genre. His books flow smoothly, carry you along and chapters end with a small hook to keep you reading late into the night. Both books have had a slight supernatural twist. A sentence like that would usually be sufficient to put me off reading the book, but he integrates those elements in a way that feels very grounded and it really works.Sam Dryden is an ex special ops military officer who is living a quiet life restoring houses. He gets a call late one night from Claire, a former colleague and close friend, who tells him to drop everything and meet him near Barstow. She leads him to a small trailer in the middle of nowhere where four young girls are being held captive in a cage. Their abductor is on the brink of torching the place with them in it and they arrive in the brink of time to save the situation. Sam is full of questions: how did Claire know to lead him there and at that precise moment? The answer lies in a new technology that puts both of them into immense danger.This is an extremely readable thriller. I really like this series and I'm curious to see where the author will take it next. My three star rating is because I felt that things got a bit silly towards the very end, but I'd definitely recommend it to people who enjoy well paced and original thrillers. If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AA939H3X1Q8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250030781#wasThisHelpful","R1AA939H3X1Q8W","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been going through something of a reading slump lately.  I've started and then given up on four books in the last couple of weeks.  I keep getting to the 80-100 page mark and losing interest.  So I badly needed something that would hook me in quickly and hold my interest without demanding too much of me.  Vanishing Games delivered perfectly.This is the sequel to Roger Hobbs' debut novel ""Ghostman"", but you don't need to have read that book to make sense of this one.  Although both feature the same protagonist, the storylines are only very slightly related.  Our narrator, perhaps called Jack, is a ""ghostman"" - someone whose job it is to be forgettable, to disappear or to help other criminals disappear.  He lost contact with a friend after a job that went wrong several years ago, but now she's in trouble and needs his help.  Jack travels to Macau to find Angela and discovers that she has some very nasty people after her.There are several things I really like about this book.  Much like Tom Wood's excellent series about ""Victor"", Jack is a level headed professional.  He's logical, he's not going to let his heart rule his head and he's calculated about the risks that he takes.  You feel that you're getting an insight into how a character like this might operate and how he will establish connections in a strange environment.  The locations are well drawn and vividly portrayed.  The author has done his research and incorporates little snippets into the plot which make it feel credible.The plot itself is not outstanding, but it's satisfying.  It doesn't have the relentless readability that a Lee Child book has, but it's still an above average thriller that I really enjoyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HCEIQ56BUB3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352646#wasThisHelpful","R3HCEIQ56BUB3H","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a weakness for stalker thrillers and if you enjoyed books like ""Into the Darkest Corner"" or ""The Bed I Made"", you may well enjoy this one too.  It's about Isabel, who has escaped a controlling relationship by fleeing to India.  When a family tragedy hits she needs to return to England.  At the same time, DI Lorraine Fisher (who has appeared in other books by this author) is investigating the deaths of two women who both reported being stalked before their deaths.  It appears that they may have been seeing the same man who Isabel was involved with.This book starts really well, but it's trying to juggle a number of threads in order to deliver a couple of big twists and at some stage it starts to sag under the weight of it all.  By the end when everything had been revealed, I just felt fed up with how convoluted and unlikely the story had become.  Having said that, it does a very good job of keeping you guessing about what''s going on.  I'd give the first half four stars but the second half only two stars: averaging out at three.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEG9PO073S7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEFBPFK#wasThisHelpful","R2BEG9PO073S7K","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ""Orphan Trains"" transported a reported 200,000 orphaned and homeless children from the East Coast of the US to the Midwest between 1854 and 1929.  Orphans would then be offered for adoption at public events and were often taken by families needing extra labor to help on farms or in small businesses.  Orphan Train focuses on Niamh (pronounced ""Ne-ev"", an Irish girl who is orphaned in 1929 and sent to Minnesota.  The story unfolds in two timeframes, alternating between Niamh and Molly, a troubled foster teen living in Maine in 2011.This is a highly readable book and there are parts that are extremely moving.  I really felt for Niamh and how difficult her life was.  However it's also quite a predictable story in many ways and I didn't engage with nor particularly believe in Molly's character, so the parts of the book in the current day were far less interesting to me.While it was an easy and yes, an enjoyable book to read, it never really raised above being ""perfectly okay"" in my estimation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7ZIXOR1HUHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061950726#wasThisHelpful","R2P7ZIXOR1HUHP","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We are back in sunny Botswana for the 16th instalment in the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.  While the initial books in the series were quite plot driven, it has evolved to a series that is much more about the characters with a thin, almost token, plot thrown in for good measure.  Like the others, this is a charming book that left me feeling all warm and fuzzy about life, but I have to say that there isn't a lot to it.Precious Ramotswe is convinced by Mma Makutsi to take a short holiday from work.  The idea is that she will have a quiet time relaxing at home, but she finds it difficult to let work go.  When Mr Polopetsi comes to her asking for help with a work assignment, she cannot resist the temptation to get involved without Mma Makutsi's knowledge.  If, like me, you occasionally find Mma Makutsi annoying, you will find her extremely irritating this time around, although by the end of the book you may be thinking about the risks of jumping to conclusions.  There are also a couple of smaller sub-plots but each takes up only a few pages towards the end of the book, which then stops quite abruptly as if Alexander McCall Smith's editor had rung up and said ""it'll be fine, just send it now please"".What is lovely about these books is that reading them almost feels like taking a holiday.  You are transported to a sunny and relaxed country where there is always time to exchange pleasantries or savour a cup of tea.  There are also gentle lessons about trusting people and treating them well.  The title itself refers to Mma Ramotswe's relationship with Mr J.L.B. Matekoni and how being loved and admired by him is ""like walking in sunshine"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLBDQ587DDUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XNJEH18#wasThisHelpful","RGLBDQ587DDUF","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philippa Gregory returns to her beloved Tudors with the story of Kateryn Parr, sixth and final wife of Henry VIII. Unfortunately (and maybe this is why she hasn't written about her before), Kateryn is not terribly interesting. She is a devout scholar who spends a considerable amount of time in religious study. About her only other interest in collecting birds. So a lot of this book is about the merits of Mass vs Communion and about canaries. Oh and her secret love for Thomas Seymour, who she sees about 5 times but mentions about 500 times. It's also very repetitive. We get told the same information over and over.What Philippa Gregory does do very well is to convey how powerless the Queen was and how the King's favours could change in a blink of an eye. The final quarter of the book, when a warrant is issued for Kateryn Parr's arrest, is genuinely tense, but it's a slow burn until that point. The book ends with the death of the King, which is a shame because a lot of the most interesting events in Kateryn's life happened after that. Philippa Gregory describes these briefly in the Author's Note, but I would have preferred it if she'd truncated the first half of the book and extended the timeline.So ultimately it's just a bit dull - because it appears that Kateryn was as dull as ditchwater. She starts out all super smart, I must hold the King's favour at all cost, but then gets all full of religious fervour and forgets how to play the game. Why the handsome and sexy Thomas Seymour would ever have remained smitten with her I cannot imagine.PS: When I picked up this book I thought the editor had made a huge error in putting a portrait of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour on the cover, but this is explained and is part of the story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2VESO0X27MG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476758794#wasThisHelpful","R1V2VESO0X27MG","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alice has a good life: balancing three children and a cushy part-time job.  However when her husband realises that he's not going to make partner at his law firm and decides to move on, it becomes apparent that she needs to take on a full time role.  And almost immediately one lands in her lap, working for a hip new retail start-up.  What follows is not unpredictable: her husband struggles with his change of status, the new job isn't all it promised to be, there are family stresses.  The book charts the next year of her life as she struggles to balance everything that life throws at her.It took me probably around 150 pages before I decided that I liked this book.  I considered throwing in the towel two or three times.  It felt like such a predictable premise (that no job is worth losing touch with your family) and the writing style is - how can I describe it?  Elisabeth Egan has a wry and witty take on life, jumps around the place, throws in email and message chains and somehow it starts out irritating but ends up engaging.  There were so many references that struck home for me, ranging from Alice's favourite books to the delights of a whisper quiet Bosch dishwasher, that eventually I just capitulated and went with the ride.  And there are parts that are extremely moving, when you can tell that the author has been there and knows what she's writing about.

"Lucie Brownlee lost her husband Mark when he was only 37. This book is her account of the next two years of her life and how she got by (or didn't). This is no time of ""magical thinking"" . Lucie is raw, bitter and bereft. She drinks heavily, cries a lot and occasionally takes out her anger at the world on those around her. She also moves home, adopts a dog, sees her daughter settled happily into school and embarks on a PhD.I didn't entirely enjoy this book and I dreaded writing this review because I don't want to be the ""unfeeling witch"" who didn't like the book. Full Disclosure: I am the Queen of inadvertently saying precisely the wrong thing to grieving widows. So I've got form. But Lucie's grief was so self-centered and wallowing that while I understood where she was coming from, it was hard to like her. In the second half of the book, when her humour started to return and she was able to give us glimpses of the fine man that she lost, I warmed to her far more and consequently liked the book more.Brownlee has made two stylistic choices in her writing, both of which irritated me. The first is that every reference to Mark is capitalised, as in ""what would He have done""- a grammatical device I have only seen used before to refer to God. I read a review that thought this was a heartbreaking indication of the reverence and respect in which she held him - maybe so (see reference to ""unfeeling witch"" above) but I just found it kind of perturbing and out of place.The other thing she does is always to refer to her young daughter as ""B"", presumably to protect her privacy. Other young relatives get the same treatment, so we occasionally get sentences like ""B took T's hand"". I understand the motivation (though really, anyone who knows B will also know who her mother is, so does this achieve anything?) but I would have infinitely preferred it if she'd just given her daughter an alternative name rather than using the initial. All it did for me was give me a insatiable desire to know what B's name really is - Bernadette? Britney? Beyonce? Becky? For some reason I decided it was Bridget. Anyway my point is, I should have been wrapped up in Brownlee's story, not using all this headspace trying to guess her daughter's name. It distanced me from the narrative.Towards the end my curiousity was all too much for me and I googled Lucie Brownlee and found many photographs of her husband online.

"The first William Boyd book I ever read was Any Human Heart, the diary of a fictional man whose life spans much of the 20th century.  It remains one of my favourite books and I was hopeful that Sweet Caress, also a fictional autobiography, would have a similar impact on me.  The ""author"" is Amory Clay, a photographer born in 1908, who is pulling together her memoirs in 1977.  Over the course of her life she will work as a war photographer in WW2 and Vietnam, spend life as the lady of a manor in Scotland and live in Berlin, New York, Paris and London.William Boyd's writing is a joy to read and he creates a very believable world for Amory (I kept googling people to see if they existed, but I don't think any real individuals made their way into this book).  He has also integrated photographs throughout the book, allegedly taken by her over the course of her lifetime.  This is a clever technique but it actually eroded the story for me because I kept thinking that the standard of the photos was much too weak to make her career successes credible.I'm trying to put a finger on why I didn't like the book more.  I never warmed to Amory, but then I never particularly liked Logan Mountstuart in ""Any Human Heart"" and that didn't stop me loving his story.  Certainly there was an absence of memorable characters.  Amory's love interests floated in and out but never became fully formed people for me (particularly Charbonneau) - and did we really need the descriptions of their penises?  The story touches on some fascinating areas - WW2, Vietnam, California communes, Nazi Germany) - but it always feels like we fail to get a sense of what those places or events were really like because we're too busy focusing on Amory's amateurish photos or love interests.  Perhaps that's deliberate, because after all that is how we all do live our lives, on the fringes not in the centre, but it makes a less compelling book.  In the end I said goodbye to Amory with few regrets.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWX5JVIBO387G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZF8R0GO#wasThisHelpful","RWX5JVIBO387G","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My life is pretty much like this: I spend 11 months and 28 days of every year looking forward to the new Lee Child book and then 2-3 days devouring it.  He is the master of the opening paragraph.  Immediate hooks.  Short sentences.  You don't even notice his writing style after the first page or two but it's effortless to read.  And there are many things about this book which make it a strong addition to the series.  I read it in two days and it definitely gave me the ""Reacher fix"" I wanted.It starts in the usual way with Reacher turning up in a small town and immediately running into a woman in need of assistance (in this case Michelle Chang, a former FBI agent turned private investigator who is looking for her missing colleague), but it turns into a cross-country investigation that touches on issues that are current and very nasty.And that is one of the issues that I had with the book: it's dark.  It goes places that are unpleasant and disturbing. The majority of the book is like a regular Jack Reacher novel, but it changes tone towards the end when it becomes evident what it is that Reacher and Chang are investigating.  The villains in this instance aren't just bad guys - they are evil.  And I can honestly say that this is one Lee Child book I will never re-read.  I didn't like putting those images in my head.Another thing.  It struck me halfway through this book that every woman that Reacher teams up with is exactly the same.  Even as I write that it occurs to me that Lee Child would probably protest that it's not true because Chang is in her 40s and Chinese American, but that kind of proves my point: only the superficialities change.  The banter - and yes, sexual chemistry - between Reacher and Chang is indistinguishable between what he had with Susan Turner or Elizabeth Deveraux or Theresa Lee or Susan Duffy or...you get the picture.  There is nothing distinctive about Chang whatsoever.So not the best Lee Child book - far from it - but it's hard in this genre to maintain a consistently high standard and when you compare him to his contemporaries he still does a better job of it than most.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LSYDXP3DUV75/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKC1SMI#wasThisHelpful","R1LSYDXP3DUV75","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lana and her best friend Kitty are travelling in the Philippines when they meet and join up with a group of young people who are sailing from the Philippines to NZ.  Initially, everything is idyllic.  The yacht sails from one gorgeous and remote island to another.  They spend their days swimming and snorkelling and their nights drinking and sharing stories under the stars.  However when one of them disappears at sea, everything changes.  There is increasing dissension and wariness among the remaining crew members and Lana starts to wonder if she can truly trust any of them.This is a gripping read that really captures both the highs and lows of being on a small boat with other people.  In the early sections of the book I felt almost as if I were on holiday too and then as things start to go wrong, I could really feel the claustrophobia and rising tension.  There is a central mystery which only gets resolved at the very end of the book (in a slightly melodramatic way I have to say), but then there's also a further little satisfying twist in the tale.Everything is slightly dragged out, but overall this is a real page turner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E63UAQU83AQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501116738#wasThisHelpful","R1E63UAQU83AQ6","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Harwood is the widowed father of a nine year old son who has moved home to the small town of Promise Falls, New York.  Having lost his job as a journalist, he has time on his hands to step in and help when his cousin Marla is accused of murdering a local mother and abducting her baby.  He gradually learns that almost everyone in this town has a secret of one kind or another and that his own life may be in danger.This is a readable enough thriller and it has some killer twists that you don't see coming at ALL, but there are way too many strands and quite a few of them remain frustratingly unresolved.  It's clearly set up for there to be a sequel and if you are the kind of person who hated the end of Lee Child's 61 Hours (Jack Reacher) because we didn't know if Reacher was alive or dead, you will probablyl dislike the end of this book too (although the ending is very different and that is in no way a spoiler).  There are a number of little mysteries along the way which we spend a lot of time on and then they are unresolved.  It's annoying!The main plot is quite intriguing and David Harwood is a likeable character.  The chapters when he narrates his investigations are the most enjoyable parts of the book.  However like many books in this genre, the story gets increasingly unbelievable as the bad guys start acting in ways that are less and less credible.  Also, I had to roll my eyes when Marla conveniently had a condition which meant that she was unable to remember people's faces and cars.A final minor complaint: at over 500 pages, this is a heavy book that is hard to hold.  The line spacing and margins are huge - in would have been nice to reduce both slightly and bring the book down to a more manageable size.This feels like a very whiney review!  Overall I didn't mind this book, but nor did I particularly like it.  It took a long time to get exciting.  The final 100 pages flew past but it was a bit sluggish getting to that point.  What saves it is Linwood Barclay's engaging writing style and the strength of his main character.  Plus, as I mentioned earlier, there are a couple of excellent twists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VG31G309VZKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451472675#wasThisHelpful","R3VG31G309VZKG","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So the premise behind this book is that there was a plane crash in the French Alps in 1980.  There is only one survivor: an infant girl.  There were two babies of almost the same age on the flight, so both families immediately assume that the survivor must be their missing grandchild.  One family is extraordinarily rich and the other is not.  Eventually the courts award the baby to the poorer family, but both families continue to harbour doubts that the right decision has been made.  A private detective is hired who spends 18 years investigating the truth and finally works it out - but we have to wait until the book's end to discover the answer, by which time we are well past the point of caring.This is a terrible book and I only kept reading it out of sheer stubbornness.  For starters, the writing style is extremely wooden.  I presume that some of this stems from the translation from its native French, for example clunky sentences like: ""She made a point of always using fresh ingredients: vegetables, ham, and many other ingredients that she would find at the market"" or ""This whole scene stank of a lie"".Then there's the characters, who are all paper thin.  Lylie, the girl at the centre of the mystery, barely features in the book.  She potentially has two siblings (depending on who she is, one from each family).  There is Marc, whom she has a sexual relationship with despite being raised as his sister (yuck), who spends most of the book sitting on trains and leaving panicky messages on Lylie's answerphone.  The other potential sibling is Malvina, a nutcase who stalks round Paris with a gun in her handbag yelling at people.  About the grandmother who raised her, we get little other than repeated references to the ""magnificent plunge"" of her cleavage.And finally, the plot is ridiculous.  Granted, at the time of the plane crash DNA tests to determine the child's identity were not available.  However that did change, and the private investigator arranged the tests.  Then for some unknown reason everyone kept the results a secret and he let both families leap to mistaken conclusions.  For three years.  Why?  I have no idea.  Nothing about this book makes any sense.  I simply do not understand the rave reviews that it's getting - did I read a different book???","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181PNKLIHE0QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLHJBXG#wasThisHelpful","R181PNKLIHE0QJ","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I devoured this book in hungry gulps - it's such an addictive read.  Essentially, it's a fictionalized take on the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, with just enough changes to hopefully spare the author a lawsuit.  Our narrator is Lizzie Pepper, a pretty TV actress on the rise who meets mega movie star Rob Mars.  Rob has a ""mega watt"" smile, a sibling who manages his PR, is the subject of persistent rumors about his sexual orientation and is a avid disciple of the secretive ""One Cell"" studio.  He promptly sweeps Lizzie off her feet with a series of completely OTT dates, introduces her to a One Cell assistant/new BFF and renames her ""Elizabeth"".  Sound familiar?What is so enticing about this book is the idea that you could be reading what really went down in Tom & Katie's marriage (although I suspect that One Cell is significantly more benign than the COS).  The way that Lizzie is wooed and manipulated is both fascinating and chilling to read.  Obviously the author has used her imagination but it all feels chillingly plausible.  What adds to the book's allure is that the author has co-written or ghost-written several celebrity memoirs herself, which gives credibility to the way that she discusses some aspects of celebrity - as examples, the way that stars are paid cash to wear particular clothes, the way that they manage photo-ops, the realities of press tours and how you plug the film that you aren't happy with.A few years ago I read American Wife which was a fictionalized autobiography of Laura Bush and I found that book equally compelling.  Movie Star is not the best written book I've read and it certainly won't win any literary awards, but it's addictive reading material.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M03VROJ0UWBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016411#wasThisHelpful","R2M03VROJ0UWBD","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a mystery that unfolds in two timeframes.  In the late 1960s, Amber and her family spend idyllic holidays at the family estate in Cornwall, nicknamed Black Rabbit Hall.  However tragedy and change are just around the corner.  Over 30 years later, Lorna and her fiance Jon visit Black Rabbit Hall in search of a location for their upcoming wedding.  Instead of Amber's family, the house is home to only an eccentric grand old lady.  However Lorna will stumble on clues that point to dark events in the house's past.I was drawn into this book by the gorgeous cover and reviews promising me an atmospheric family mystery, but it failed to live up to my expectations.  There is an interesting story at its core and this is what kept me reading, wondering how things would all pan out.  But it's an unlikely and drawn out story.  Fans of of Hannah Richell or Kate Morton may enjoy this, but they may also suspect that those authors could have tightened and polished it, ironed out some of the fortuitous and unlikely kinks in the story.I also got irritated by the absence of even one character who behaved in a realistic way.  Among others, I didn't buy into Caroline who has nothing more to her than being an archetypal villian, to Lorna who accepts an invitation to stay with a creepy lady that she doesn't know in a creepy house or to Hugo who has a permanent personality change overnight.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHLXNA164O9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKK5VI6#wasThisHelpful","RWHLXNA164O9H","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never heard of Beryl Markham before picking up this book, but what a fascinating life that woman lived!  Born in England but raised in Kenya by her father who was a horse trainer, Beryl rubbed shoulders with the Happy Valley set, was close friends with Karen Blixen (the author of Out of Africa), possibly had an affair with Queen Elizabeth's uncle and was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from East to West.  Add to this colorful life some truly intoxicating descriptions of Kenya and you have a ""can't put down"" book.  I loved reading it and now I am dying to read more about that period in history and of course to re-watch Out of Africa (although Beryl does not figure in it).This is an immensely readable book - we are swept along by Beryl's eventful life and if anything, the flaw is that so much happened to her that it might have been better to leave some for a sequel.  The book only focuses on 11 years of her life.  Her aviation career only takes shape very near the book's end and adds little to the story.  Wikipedia also tells me some tantalising facts about her life which didn't make it into the book - for example several affairs, including one with Antoine de Saint Expury.  Instead, Circling the Sun is centered on the great love of her life (and also of Karen Blixen's): Denys Hatton.While Beryl is fascinating, I didn't always feel that I fully understood her and I couldn't quite decide if I liked her or not.  Apparently Ernest Hemingway described her as ""very unpleasant and we might even say a high-grade bitch"", and there is enough suggestion in here about why he might have felt that way.  She seemed to be someone who used and discarded the people around her and she didn't exhibit much loyalty to her friend Karen.  Her relationship with the Duke of Gloucester is written in an ambiguous way, which I thought was a cop out of the part of the author - this isn't a biography, so make a decision about what you think happened!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BSMQBHI91Z47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R3BSMQBHI91Z47","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are in a small Nigerian town in the mid 1990s.  Life is governed by uneasy blend of modernity and tradition.  The locals attend church weekly but also honour the ways of the traditional gods.  The local dialect has no word for ""scientist"" so that is a word that must be said in English.Ben is the fourth son in a family of six.  He and his three older brothers roam the town and one day while fishing in the local river they have an encounter with the town's madman who tells them that the oldest boy will be killed by his brother.  This sets in motion a chain of events that will split the family apart.When I'm rating books I always have a slight dilemma: should I rate the book based on how well it is written or by how much I enjoyed it?  If it's the former, I'd give the book 4 stars.  The writing is simple and yet full of imagery and you really understand what it would be like to live in that town at that time.  But if it's the latter, I'd rate it 2 stars.  I struggled with this book - I appreciated it but I didn't enjoy it.  I was all set to abandon it halfway through when it was announced as being longlisted for the Booker prize, and then I felt obliged to see it through.  Hence I have settled on 3 stars.In many ways, it feels like a Shakespearean tale - there is violence and madness and intense grief.  Parts reminded me of MacBeth, other parts of Hamlet.  But it's also a uniquely African story.  It's my failing I'm sure, that I found it slow moving and I kept wanting to shake some sense into the characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DOJUNB7JT0GF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316338370#wasThisHelpful","R3DOJUNB7JT0GF","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alice has grown up knowing that her mother, the famous dancer June Darling, was an orphan, but after her mother's death she discovers that June's birth mother had once sent June a letter.  Curious to find out more about her family heritage, she decides to try to trace her grandmother.  Her quest will lead her to Corsica, Paris and New York.  Her story entwines with that of Alice and Tom, who first meet as children during an idyllic summer in Cornwall in 1913.This is a very readable book.  It's a debut novel and in feels in many way like a cross between Mary Stewart's Greek novels and Kate Morton's historical sagas, with a pinch of The Nightingale thrown in for good measure.  I have to say, it doesn't really throw up any surprises or significant twists along the way.  I guessed very early on how things would pan out and I wasn't mistaken.  But this didn't stop me enjoying the journey.  Maybe it's because I'm coming off two books about major pandemics killing off the majority of the world's population, but this was just a gentle, sweet, engaging book that was very easy to read.  The pace is slow, but also steady.Two parts particularly stood out for me.  The scenes in Corsica are a delight to read.  I felt like I could smell the fragrant, herby air and see the shimmering blue sea.  There is also a segment later in the book which is set during Paris during WW2, and I also found that quite absorbing and surprisingly moving.I did feel that the author wrapped things up a bit too quickly.  How June's mother tracked June down was not explained and I also would have liked slightly more resolution in terms of what happened next.  But overall, I did like this undemanding, atmospheric story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GXDCGIRX4KV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007575327#wasThisHelpful","R27GXDCGIRX4KV","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On a snowy night in Toronto, the famous actor Arthur Leander is appearing on stage as King Lear.  He's been feeling unwell all day and shortly into the play he collapses and dies from a massive heart attack.  The following day, his obituary will appear in the NY Times, but already by then the news of his death will have been eclipsed by the outbreak of an extremely aggressive strain of influenza with a mortality rate close to 100%.  Within weeks, the majority of people on the planet are dead.Station Eleven follows two people who were in the theatre that night.  The first is trainee paramedic Jeevan Chaudary who attempts to save Arthur's life.  Later that night, Jeevan is alerted by a doctor friend about the flu's arrival.  He immediately stocks up on food and essential supplies and holes up with his brother in his brother's apartment.  The second is Kirsten Raymonde, a child who has a small part in the play as one of Lear's daughters.  She is the main focus of the book and we next meet her 20 years later, when she is part of a small troupe of actors and musicians who travel through the tiny settlements of survivors and perform for them.  Their motto is a line from Star Trek: ""Survival is Insufficient"".The book moves forwards and backwards in time, as we learn Arthur's back story and also the fates of Kirsten and Jeevan as well as a couple of other characters who are closely connected to Arthur.  It left me with a satisfying feeling of how we are all interconnected.  I couldn't help feeling that if Krzysztof Kieslowski were still alive, he'd be the perfect person to direct the film of this story.I am so glad I didn't let the fact that this book has been billed as ""science fiction"" put me off.  (It won the Arthur C. Clarke award as the best science fiction novel of 2015).  Obviously my idea of science fiction is wrong because it makes me think of space travel and alien creatures - neither of which, thankfully, make an appearance in this book.  Evidently it is the fact that it is a speculative (near) future that puts it into the science fiction genre, although if that's the case I'm not sure why books like ""The Road"" and ""The Chimes"" aren't classified as science fiction?  Or maybe I'm just displaying my ignorance...  In any case, this is the kind of book that gets under your skin.  I felt so immersed in this deserted world that it almost came as a shock when my reading was interrupted by a helicopter flying over my house.  This is one of my favorite books of the year, perhaps of all time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R76RRGGADCTYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804172447#wasThisHelpful","R76RRGGADCTYB","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in Louise Welch's trilogy about a modern day plague but it's a standalone novel in almost every way so you don't need to have read the first book (or could read it after reading this one).  A new and unidentified virus, known as ""the sweats"" or V596, has swept across the globe and wiped out the majority of the population within a very short time.This book focuses on Magnus McFall, a London-based comedian from the Orkney Islands, who is on the verge of making a career breakthrough when he is arrested after a drunken altercation in an alleyway.  He is in prison as society begins to fall apart.  Realising that he will die if he stays there, he teams up with his cellmate and they manage to find a way out.  But the outside world is rife with dangers and in many ways, illness is the least of them.If books could win awards for cinematography, this one would be a contender.  Louise Welsh paints chilling images of prisoners slowly starving as no one comes to feed them, trains ground to a halt in the underground, rats running rife, bodies lying in the streets where they fell, the internet non-existent and the airwaves falling silent.  I can't wait to see how she brings things together in the third instalment - there is a tiny clue at the very end of the book which made me gasp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMMGHVM8Y4FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PW5V6HE#wasThisHelpful","RWMMGHVM8Y4FP","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tess is a successful photographer with a nine year old son when she meets Greg, a paediatric heart surgeon.  Their relationship develops quickly and intensely and in only a short time she is pregnant and relocating to Boston with her son to be with her new husband.  However adjusting to Boston is difficult.  Tess misses her friends and has difficulties relating to her new neighbours.  Strange, threatening letters arrive at the house.  Her husband is working long hours.  But most importantly, she starts to question why Greg will never tell her about his childhood and why he is so often difficult to contact and she starts to wonder whether he is keeping some important secrets from her.I enjoyed the first half of this book.  I could identify with Tess's sense of isolation and struggles to find her place in a new country.  It reminded me of ""The Expats"" - also a book about a woman transplanted into a new country with a secretive, workaholic husband.  But around the halfway mark I had guessed how things would pan out and that really spoiled the book for me.  I could see the author's attempts to plant red herrings or misdirect us and rather than building tension they just felt like annoying obstacles to the story that lay underneath.  I also started to feel increasingly annoyed by Tess, a character whom I initially had warmed to, but who started to seem increasingly irrational and hysterical.At the core of this book there is quite a good story but I felt that the author had problems working out how to let the facts emerge so she had to resort to some pretty clumsy techniques, such as a man with an unlikely and obsessive grudge to bear and helpful letters that arrive in the nick of time.  The main sub-plot also seems like it's there to create tension in the first half and then gets shed as unnecessary in the second half, meaning that Helena's character never feels like more than a caricature.I'm giving the book three stars because I really liked the first half and as I say there is a good story at its core, but it feels like a book that needed more work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R165CABLLKNX5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOOMX3U#wasThisHelpful","R165CABLLKNX5D","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She lets go of his hand, he runs across the road and is hit by a car.  The driver fails to stop and the boy is killed.  The police have no leads and the heartbroken mother moves away to start afresh somewhere new.

"This is the story of Elodie, a cellist living in Verona during WW2 who gets involved with the Italian Resistance.  It's...okay.  It's fine.  There are some lovely descriptions of Italy and the story starts really well and is moderately involving, but no more so than that.  It's certainly not a patch on The Lost Wife by the same author.What I didn't like was firstly, that none of the characters felt terribly involving or real.  Nor did I feel any particular suspense with any of the supposed danger that Elodie was in.  It felt like the risks that she was taking were pretty slight and for minimal benefit as well.  There are other books that cover similar territory much better, such as The Nightingale or Trapeze.The story itself seemed to have elements that happened for no particular reason other than to serve the plot.  I have no idea why Elodie's mother had never returned to Venice, a short train trip away.  Or why Elodie even came to Portofino.  And I find it ludicrous that (minor spoiler ahead - skip to the next paragraph to miss it but really, surely you're not going to read this ridiculous book) - how can someone feel a baby kicking inside another person's stomach only a month after they get pregnant - that is defying all medical science.Other things irritated me, like the way the book lurches from the present tense to the past tense.  Initially I thought that the past tense would be for everything up to when the book opens, but that's not the case.  It just becomes distracting.  And don't even get me started on the ending - I mean, really?  All wrapped up neatly like that?If you love music, you may like this book because that plays a central part in the story.  And if you like Resistance novels you may like it, but it's one of the weaker ones.  I struggle to recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVRMOTRBM2IE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266257#wasThisHelpful","RDVRMOTRBM2IE","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're in in Elizabeth, New Jersey, between December 1951 and July 1952.  Elizabeth has the unfortunate distinction of being the site of three plane crashes over that time, and this book is about the residents of that city and how their lives were affected by the tragedies.  It weaves together the stories of around a dozen main characters and many more secondary characters, all of whom go through major changes or upheavals over that time.  Somehow Blume manages to make you care about every single one of these people and at the same time to paint a picture of the broader events that the US was going through at that time.  If there is one main character it is Miriam (Miri), aged 15, falling in love with her first boyfriend and witnessing the fall out from the crashes in the lives of people around her.Because of the large cast of characters it does take a while to work out who is who.  I actually started making little notes to myself: ""Miri lives with her mother Rusty and grandmother Irene.  Rusty's brother is Henry and he is a journalist who is dating Leah.  Miri's best friend is Natalie who is the daughter of Dr O, the local dentist.  She has an elder brother called Steve and his best friend is Phil. Daisy and Christina work in the dentist's office"" - and so on.  This is the kind of book that you shouldn't pick up unless you can give it your attention for a good hour.Once you've got your head around who everyone is, this is a fabulous book and very hard to put down.  While the plane crashes are obviously an important part of what happens, it's not really a book about the crashes and they are not covered in huge detail.  It's more about the characters, about the challenges they face and the ways that they react to those challenges.  Now that I've finished it, I'm finding it hard to imagine what I could read next that I could possibly enjoy as much.  I think this is a book that will stay with me for a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7MA4KSFEDGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101875046#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7MA4KSFEDGN","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wacky little guide to decluttering and organising your belongings. Essentially, it comes down to a few principles:- Declutter by category. Start with all of your clothes, wherever they are in the house eg everything in your wardrobe,jackets by the front door, ski gear in storage. Then move onto books. Only focus on your own possessions, no one else's.- When you are working on a category, lay out everything that you own. In turn, lay your hands on the item and ask yourself if it sparks joy in your heart. If yes, keep it. If no, out it goes. You must physically touch everything in turn as you decide. Don't get bogged down in the task: no trying on clothes, no flipping through books. As you discard things, thank them for their service to this date.- Store all items of a kind together. Kondo is a great believer in folding clothes and shelving them vertically. She has her very own method for doing this (the KonMari method!). She gives detailed instructions or you can also find videos online eg the Goop website has some. She also likes to store things out of sight eg books go in a cupboard.- Kondo is pretty brutal about what to keep. Items that may be useful but don't spark joy seem to get turfed. No hanging onto instruction manuals, paid bills etc.That's pretty much it. I have to admit, the sceptic in me wonders about all the things that I use semi-regularly but not particularly joyfully. Paperclips, scissors, specific kitchen implements for example, but maybe the moral is that I should learn to appreciate these things in my life.  If it comes to that, there are days when I don't feel joyfully about anything in my wardrobe - what then, Marie???What makes this book both weird and delightful is Kondo's anthropomorphic take on life. For example, socks should be laid flat and folded rather than balled because they need a rest. Handbags should be emptied at the end of each day because ""being packed all the time, even when not in use, must feel something like going to bed on a full stomach.""So a very readable book and a slightly different take on decluttering, but essentially a small idea padded out into a lengthier book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N44SQ8498V6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607747308#wasThisHelpful","R1N44SQ8498V6E","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's mid-summer in Norfolk and an excavator comes across a buried WW2 plane with a body still inside. Ruth Galloway, forensic archeologist and lecturer at the University of Norfolk, is called to give her expert opinion and quickly ascertains that the body has been recently planted inside the plane. DNA tests are able to identify the body as a member of a local upper class family who was supposedly lost at sea.There are a lot of things I really liked about this book. Unlike some of the previous books, we are not being continually hammered over the head with how much Ruth loves her daughter and Cathbad the Druid is significantly less nutty. Instead there are intriguing and significant developments in many of the regular characters' lives and I for one am itching to read the next installment to see where they will lead.The book also weaves in a lot of history about Norfolk's role in WW2 which was interesting - the titular ""Ghost Fields"" refers to abandoned air strips used by the RAF during WW2. Plus, I learned things about pigs eating habits that I never knew and won't easily forget!The issue for me was the central plot. It started off well but got increasingly preposterous and the final climax just felt a bit silly rather than nail-bitingly tense. The motivations behind the crime all seemed pretty far fetched. It's still an enjoyable story but it could have been better.This is the 7th book in the series featuring Ruth Galloway, Forensic Archeologist, and if you are new to the series you would be well served to start with the first: The Crossing Places. There are lots of nuances and references to previous interactions between characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C14FLY1CMJ93/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544330145#wasThisHelpful","R1C14FLY1CMJ93","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, a warning.  If you haven't read this book, do not read the Amazon description above and do not read the synopsis on the book's dust cover.  Both contain significant spoilers concerning plot elements that don't happen until more than 2/3 of the way through the book.This is the 6th book in in Paul Doiron's series about Mike Bowditch, a game warden based in a remote corner of Maine. The series began with The Poacher's Son, but it's not necessary to have read the other books to enjoy this one and in fact this is one of the best to date.The plot centres on two young women from Georgia who disappear when hiking part of The Appalachian Trail.  Mike is called in to help with the search and is able to locate the hut where the girls spent their last night.  Rumours abound about what has happened to them.  Have they been attacked by coyotes?  Fallen from a precipice?  Or is there a killer in the area?  The first half of this book is quite suspenseful with the action picking up in the second half.One of the things I like most about this series is the incredibly strong sense of place.  Real places and events are woven into the story and they give the book a feel of realism.  There is an interesting juxtaposition between the beautiful wilderness and the laid back, nature-loving locals vs the presence of people with criminal pasts who are drawn to the remote region.  I always finish his books a little unsure about whether I'd ever want to visit Maine or not.Doiron's characters are also well rounded and interesting.  Fans of Steve Hamilton are bound to also enjoy this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAA78EDUVTYED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250063698#wasThisHelpful","RAA78EDUVTYED","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1958, Eva and Jim are nineteen year old students at Cambridge.  Their paths will cross one day in October, and from there this book explores three different directions that their lives might take from that day.  In Version 1, Jim invites Eva for a drink.  They fall in love, she dumps her boyfriend David and they end up marrying.  In Version 2, they don't get together and Eva will end up marrying David.  In Version 3, they get together but then Eva will go back to David.  From there, the book unfolds in chronological order, with chapters alternating between the different versions right through to 2014.  In every version Jim will become an artist and Eva a writer, albeit with varying degrees of success.  Also, in every version their paths will repeatedly cross, with some events occurring in every one of the three strands.This is a clever idea for a novel.  Not completely original - the movie Sliding Doors and the book Life after Life explored similar territory - but still one that holds instant appeal.  In one version of his life, Jim does a painting called ""The Versions of Us"" which he describes as being about the many roads not taken, the many lives not lived.So a clever concept but not one that is necessarily easy to read.  I struggled to keep track of which life I was in at which time - was Eva happily married or unhappily?  Which children did she have in this life?  Around the 150 page mark I gave up on reading the book in order, and instead read each Version right through - first Version 1, then Version 2, then Version 3.  Which made it a lot easier to keep track of what was happening in each strand but which also highlighted to me one of the central problems with this book, which is that none of the three versions are terribly engrossing.  Unlike Life About Life for example, when Ursula's alternate lives showed different facets of life for women in the 20th century, this book just shows varying ways that two people can dance around one another's lives.The other issue is that I never really cared about these people.  In every version, Jim is a hard character to like - the only striking thing about him are his long-lashed violet eyes.  Depending on the version we read, he mopes, he sulks, he's unfaithful, but he's never terribly interesting and I could never see why bright, brave, determined Eva would be drawn to him.  If you think about the fact that each version only has around 130 pages to cover over 50 years, it is no wonder perhaps that characters are only sketched thinly.I realise I'm in the minority with my dislike of this book, but it left me feeling very dissatisfied.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PQTXO0WDLSQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S53JDWU#wasThisHelpful","R1PQTXO0WDLSQP","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zagreb, Croatia.  It is 1991 and Yugoslavia is at war with itself.  Ana is ten years old and her life is about to change forever.At first the war seems distant but gradually things change: evenings spent in bomb shelters, refugees arriving at Ana's school, food shortages.  Her baby sister is seriously unwell and the family will need to take immense risks to get her the help that she needs.Fast forward ten years.  Ana is living in the US and studying at NYU.  She has struggled to adapt to life in the US and has invented a false history for herself rather than telling people the truth about where she is from.  Even her long-term boyfriend doesn't know the truth.  Gradually she realizes that she needs to return to Croatia and make peace with her past.It's hard to believe that this is a first novel - it is remarkably self-assured and beautifully written.  The author has lived in both the US and Croatia and there doesn't seem to be a false note in this book.  It pulls you in and makes you feel that you are living through the events along with Ana.  It's a heart rending, amazing book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNLBB8UMTW1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812996348#wasThisHelpful","R1PNLBB8UMTW1J","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh man, I don't want to be the heartless person who didn't like this book, but what can I say, I'm the heartless person who didn't like this book.  It's about Ivo.  He's 40, he's in a hospice and he's dying from complications from diabetes.  The nurse looking after him suggests that he thinks of a story from his life to correlate with a body part, starting with A (""Adam's Apple"" , ""Anus"", ""Ankle"" and ""Arms"") and working through the alphabet.  So this is Ivo's story, told in disjointed memories that gradually come together, as he thinks about Mia, the love of his life.It took me a while to get into this book, as it seems to dance around all over the place until you have enough pieces to have some sense of the puzzle.  But once I got past that stage, I just expected there to be more in terms of a payoff.  Ultimately Ivo has made some silly decisions in his life that make it hard to feel a great deal of compassion for him, particularly as he is unwilling to forgive others for mistakes that he was complicit in.  Remember how useless and self-destructive Dexter was in ""One Day"".  Well Ivo is like that in triplicate.  I never felt terribly connected to any of the characters in the book with the exception of his nurse, Sheila.It's obvious how a book like this will end but I found the ending curiously unmoving.  Maybe I've read too many similar books lately, but it felt kind of cliched and unoriginal.  Very similar to ""Before I Die"" by Jenny Downham, for one.I know this is a debut novel and I feel like James Hannah is a real talent.  I would definitely read other books by him, but this one was a misfire for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KT92HSV8RNXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI0P0RU#wasThisHelpful","R3KT92HSV8RNXH","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sequel to Trapeze which was published in the UK and some other countries under the title ""The Girl Who Fell From The Sky"".  While it probably could be read as a standalone novel, you will enjoy it much more if you are familiar with the events and characters from the first book.  (Plus, the first book is excellent, so if you haven't read it you are in for a treat.  But don't read any more of this review if you intend to read the first, because it will contain spoilers).Tightrope begins at the end of World War II.  Marian Sutro was an undercover agent in France during the War and at the end of Trapeze she had been apprehended by the Nazis.  When I read that book I assumed that she would have been executed (it never occurred to me that there would be a sequel), but it emerges that after interrogation she was held in prison for several months and then sent to Ravensbruck Concentration Camp.  That experience has permanently scarred her.  Suffering from what we would now call post traumatic stress disorder, she returns to the UK and tries to pick up the fragments of the life she left behind several years previously.  Life in the UK seems meaningless and she struggles to adapt to a civilian existence.  When her former handler makes contact and the Cold War brings the opportunity to undertake some espionage work, she leaps at the opportunity.  It is only later, with hindsight, that she will realise the extent to which she is being used, but she has also acquired a skillset that her handlers may be underestimating.Marian is an enigmatic character.  The book is narrated - albeit from a distance - by a youthful admirer of hers who kept tabs on her over the years and thus we never get a firm sense of what's going on in her head, although she never fails to hold our interest.  Mawer's writing is rich in precise details that bring scenes to life without slowing down the pace in any way.  He also has a wonderfully rich vocabulary which I truly enjoyed.  Occasionally I was driven to look up words that I didn't know: benison, integument, byssus.This book doesn't have quite the same breathless menace that its predecessor does, but it still crackles with a quiet tension.  Marian is a character who only comes alive when she is in danger.  She's not always likeable - she is willing to use or manipulate everyone in her life - but she is endlessly fascinating.  The book also beautifully captures the claustrophobia of the Cold War.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIWQ7K4B6BUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1408706210#wasThisHelpful","RIIWQ7K4B6BUX","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is something so immensely readable about Jane Green's books.  They just suck me in like a Dyson vacuum cleaner and hold me tight for a day or two.  Like Marian Keyes, she writes chicklit that encompasses serious subjects - in this case, alcoholism and how we make amends for our wrongdoings in the past.  But she does this in a way that's still light and fluffy and the summery Nantucket setting honestly made me feel like I was on holiday while I read it.The story is about Cat, an only child who had a difficult relationship with her father and who has always been a heavy drinker.  When she meets Jason, he encourages her to go sober, but it's a lesson that won't take until she is ready to do it for herself.  The book is also about her discovery of a family that she doesn't know she had, and the interactions that she has with them.There's a lot of set up to the story and for a while it's a bit confusing.  The initial chapters jump around a lot, from Cat being 19 to Cat being 29 to Cat's mother's story.  It felt like Jane Green knew the story that she wanted to tell but couldn't quite figure out how to get us all the background information we needed.  Once things settle down and the story progresses more simply, it becomes a lot more involving.  I thought that the story was going to be very predictable, but it does have several twists along the way.Ultimately there is nothing memorable here but it's a perfectly enjoyable distraction for a couple of days and as I mentioned above, the Nantucket setting really did leave me feeling refreshed, like I'd been away.  Crazy but true.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338N2SDRSADPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125004734X#wasThisHelpful","R338N2SDRSADPR","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this.  A little bit Liane Moriarty, a little bit Gillian Flynn, it's a cleverly composed story that reveals its secrets gradually.The story opens with Christy and Joe Davenport buying their dream home in an upscale London suburb.  The previous owners, Amber and Jeremy Fraser, had completed a spare-no-expenses renovation and then abruptly moved out only four months later, leaving without a word goodbye to their friends or neighbours.  It is clear to Christy that there are deep divisions within the street but none of her actively unfriendly neighbours will talk to her about what happened.The chapters alternate between Christy's story and Amber telling us what happened a year previously.  At some stage it emerges that Amber is writing her account as part of a counselling process, but why?I was completely hooked into this book and as intrigued with the charismatic Amber as everyone else in the street is.  The way that it's written means that the reader knows more than Christy does, but sometimes Christy stumbles onto clues that don't sit with the story that we are being told.  At one point I did feel that the story was being dragged out a little too long, but maybe that's just a reflection of how my curiosity kept building and building.  This is a fantastic holiday read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5RAMIQ8SQAA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM4EHGO#wasThisHelpful","R5RAMIQ8SQAA7","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book focuses on a non-literary couple who were at the center of the tight knit group, sometimes called The Lost Generation, that included F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.  Gerald and Sara Murphy were wealthy Americans who moved to the South of France in the 1920s where they were an integral part of a large circle of artists and writers including the Fitzgeralds, the Hemingways, Dorothy Parker, Pablo Picasso and Cole Porter.  Gerald and Sara (a devoted albeit slightly obsessive mother) loved to host parties at their home, which they called Villa America.  Their house became the setting for F Scott Fitzgerald's novel, Tender Is the Night.There have been a number of books lately focusing on this glamorous group.  Some of the better ones are Mrs. Hemingway: A Novel and Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald.  This book fills a gap very pleasingly and I really enjoyed it.  While the novel is based on real events and real people, and at times features real letters, it also features a fictional relationship, albeit one based on insights about the character's real life attitudes and behavior.I loved the way this book brings that era to life and the ending is achingly sad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNMUXLKK36JRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316211362#wasThisHelpful","RNMUXLKK36JRF","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Clearly by the two star rating, I didn't like this book.  It's about an eight year old girl called Carmel who lives with her mum Beth.  The two attend a storytelling festival and Carmel disappears.  The book then covers what happens next to each of them as Beth gradually finds a way to move forward in her life and Carmel has a new life with her abductor.  The story is alternately narrated by Beth and then by Carmel.One of the reasons why I didn't like the book was very emotive.  Having a child abducted by a stranger is such a frightening concept and the way that Carmel's captor was able to immediately win her trust and overcome her questions about why she was with him really disturbed me.  So I suppose that's a unfair reason to dislike it, but I was also very disengaged in Carmel's subsequent story, which often seemed to be written in a way to keep the reader guessing about what was really happening.  And the ending felt like a total cop out and was wrapped up much too neatly and quickly.  I felt really let down that I had invested so much time reading about these people and then I didn't get to find out how things resolved themselves.What I did really enjoy and admire was the way we were taken through the arc of Beth's story, from raw anger and shock and grief to gradually finding a way to move forward, never forgetting or failing to grieve her daughter but equally finding impetus for growth from what had happened.Reading this book I couldn't help but think about poor little Madeleine McCann (if she is alive) and the other less high profile children who go missing every year.  I hope they all get happy endings.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REGPMO7DHTO86/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKPILRM#wasThisHelpful","REGPMO7DHTO86","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Catherine is a successful documentary filmmaker, happily married with a grown son.  However she has a secret: a dark incident from when her son was a child that she has never told anyone.  One day she picks up a book that's lying around the house and is horrified to discover that it is a fictionalised version of her story.  At the beginning of the book, the disclaimer ""any resemblance to persons alive or dead..."" has been menacingly crossed out in red ink.Who knows her secret?  Who wrote the book?  How did it get into her home?From this terrific opening, the book develops gradually.  Perhaps too gradually initially - for around the first third of the book it felt as if we were treading water as we rehashed the same territory over and over.  But once the secrets start to be revealed, the pace picks up significantly.  For a while I wondered if this was just a book about two unpleasant people, one desperate to wreak revenge on the other, but I'm pleased that the characters are more nuanced than that.  The final reveals and the way that the book comes together are very satisfying.A clever book and a great debut that will appeal to fans of The Kind Worth Killing: A Novel or The Liar's Chair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A36PE3I2CAWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062362259#wasThisHelpful","R3A36PE3I2CAWU","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I feel a bit disloyal giving this book three stars, hence I've given it four, although that's a stretch.  I have read all nine books in the series and somewhere along the way I moved from loving them to just kind of liking them.  Having said that, this is one of the best in some time, even if it does take until Chapter 5 before anything of consequence happens.Isabel Dalhousie is the editor of a philosophical magazine who lives in Edinburgh with her handsome husband Jamie (that's only mentioned about, oh! 100 times) and their three year old son Charlie.  She has an active mind and she is always musing about topics as varied as the failings of lions, whether one can be pure of heart without being boring and the reliability of the Swiss railway system.There are two main storylines in this book.  The first concerns Isabel being asked to investigate a child who is convinced that they have had a previous life.  His descriptions of where he lived are so vivid that his mother asks Isabel to find out whether it is possible that such a place exists.  The second storyline concerns her old nemeses Professors Lettuce and Dove, who turn up unexpectedly in Edinburgh.  While both storylines take some time to develop, they are well developed and largely resolved, which is something that hasn't always happened with this series in the past.The main point of this book seems to me to make you think about kindness.  Again and again different characters remind us of the need to be kind to others, to open oneself to goodness ""as one opens a door to allow a friend to come in"".  And ultimately, because you can't read a book in this series without thinking about being a better person, I rate it four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R291H5Y5QT7RCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PG0B4AE#wasThisHelpful","R291H5Y5QT7RCH","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this.  Much like a nervy pregnant woman, I didn't think I could find room in my heart to love another book by Gavin Extence as much as I loved the one I already had (The Universe versus Alex Woods), but I do.  Melody Black is quite a different book, but at its core there are similarities.  Both are about a quirky misfit and both are told with both heart and humour.I knew very little about the story when I picked up this book.  The description on the book's inside cover is extremely vague and the title also gives nothing away - it sounds like a story about a drag queen! - and in any case has only a tenuous link to the plot.  My issue, and I suspect the publisher's concern, is that if you know what the book is about you might say ""huh, sounds like a downer"" and not read it.  And yet it's anything BUT a downer.  It's clever, it's engaging, it's witty, it's truthful and it's cautiously optimistic.  So read the next paragraph with all of that in mind.The book is narrated by Abby, a freelance journalist in her late 20s who lives with her boyfriend Beck.  One evening she goes to borrow a can of tomatoes from their neighbour and finds his dead body in his living room.  (This is not a thriller - the death is from natural causes.)  The discovery affects Abby.  She develops insomnia and starts to have increasingly wild ideas.  Gradually we learn that Abby has bipolar disorder and that the incident has triggered a spiral into mania.  Which is what the book is about - what happens to Abby next.As Gavin Extence explains in the Author's Note at the end of the book, he has some experience of mental illness on which he has drawn to create Abby's completely fictional story.  Perhaps this is why the descriptions of how she feels and behaves seem so real and comprehensible.  The book is littered with the kind of sentences that you want to read out to someone.  One example I loved is when Abby is talking about her sister Fran: ""Fran was never someone who was likely to understand her little sister's mood disorder.  In terms of her own mental health, she was the equivalent of the person who has never caught a cold.""I loved this book.  Abby got under my skin and I am sorry to be saying goodbye to her.

"I wasn't familiar with the description ""shut eye"" before I started reading this book, but as Wikipedia helpfully tells me, a shut eye is a performer who becomes so adept at the illusion of mind reading that the performer comes to believe that he or she actually possesses psychic powers.In this book, the Shut Eye is Richard Latham, a psychic who failed to give the Police actionable visions in the case of a missing girl a year earlier and now gives readings at a local church on Friday evenings.  Among his crowd of desperate attendees is Sandra, who has lost her dog, and Anna, whose four year old son has gone missing.I didn't really like this book and there are a few reasons.  I didn't warm to any of the characters and the setting and premise just felt kind of...grubby.  Be aware too that it's a storyline that concerns two missing children and there are some parts of it that I found quite disturbing and hard to read.  Also, the psychic elements - particularly a twist near the end concerning a photograph - just felt kind of ridiculous.  I have read and liked other books by Belinda Bauer and I think she's a talented writer but in this instance I wish I hadn't picked this book up and I'm a little baffled by the many rave reviews that it's got.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JB9BWTBWM6D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI0OZG2#wasThisHelpful","R3JB9BWTBWM6D7","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simon Kernick's books are reliable page turners.  They hook you in quickly and have you flicking the pages until late in the night.  This one is no exception, and the fact that I gave it only three stars doesn't mean that it's not relentlessly readable - it is!  However it's not one of the strongest plots that Kernick has delivered, relying too much on coincidences and the reader's willingness to overlook logic as the body count mounts.  And while the protagonists are very likeable, their behaviour stretches credibility too far.The plot focuses on Matt Barron, recovering from a car accident which has given him amnesia.  His sister is looking after him and has hired both a nurse and a psychiatrist to help him recover his memories.  However he has a nagging suspicion that things aren't what they appear to be and when two very nasty killers turn up one day, he finds himself on the run for his life, while at the same time desperate to make sense of the vague memories that he has and find out why so many people are after him.Like all of Kernick's books, some familiar characters will make an appearance along the way, including Tina Boyd and DCI Mike Bolt.  As we will also learn, Matt Barron has himself been a major character in a previous book (if you don't want to know which it was because that would constitute a spoiler, stop reading this review now - but if you do want to know, it's the eigthth Simon Kernick book, with the number ten in the title).","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUVXY3YJXCPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPQU3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3DUVXY3YJXCPK","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a terrific reference book for when you have a group of people to entertain. It would be equally good for families or teachers. There are a wealth of parlour and party games (286 to be precise). There are some pen and paper games including ones that most of us are familiar with (hangman, battleships etc) but no card games. The majority need no props or only items that are very easily located.While there are a few games that can be played with only two people, the majority need at least four. It would have been helpful if there was a reference at the beginning of each description to how many people are required/can be accommodated. The instructions for each game are simple, fairly brief and make them sound like fun!The sections are:1. Rainy Day Games2. Car Journey Games3. Games using pen and paper, knucklebone or matchsticks4. Racing games5. Word or number games6. Party Games7. Musical or dramatic games8. Country House Weekend (games for large groups and/or spaces)9.

"Whether you like this book will probably depend on what you're hoping to get from it.  It's a book about balancing energy in your life as well as in your home.  Around half is dedicated to the specifics of the space that you live in, and the rest is a self help book that covers things like the benefits of keeping a gratitude diary, meditation, thinking positively and listening to your own intuition.  So if you are looking for something that is more feng shui specific, this probably isn't the book for you.  The other parts are very sweet and are obviously written with care and heart but for the most part there wasn't much there that I haven't read before in magazines.As far as the more traditional feng shui elements go, Cheryl Grace devotes most of her time talking about the bagua map and how to use it to make corrections and changes to improve all aspects of your life, from wealth to health to relationships.  She talks about fixes like bringing more energy into your life by improving the lighting and choosing artwork and ornaments to reinforce the elements that are important in each space.  Some of her recommendations are very specificI am no feng shui expert but I have certainly read other books that disregard this approach as a simplistic take on the principles of feng shui.  So I don't really know if there is validity to her approach or not.  It wasn't really the book that I was looking for but the things that made it not right for me might suit someone else down to the ground.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PL43SUB1CT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401939783#wasThisHelpful","R32PL43SUB1CT1","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, this one is dark.  It makes Gillian Flynn's books look positive and upbeat.  Rachel and David have been together for twenty years.  They have built a very successful business together and from the outside their lives look perfect.  But Rachel is badly damaged from her childhood and David is extremely controlling and abusive.  When the book opens, Rachel accidentally kills a man in a hit and run and this will set off a chain of events which will unravel her.This is a well written book and in the second half particularly the tension is very high.  Reading it, I was desperate for Rachel to get back at David and willing her not to be a victim.  Be aware that it covers a lot of unpleasant territory and every glimmer of hope will be quickly stamped on.  This is not a book about pleasant people or neat resolutions.  It is dark, darker than a toothless panther on a moonless night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR2NHN5NYRZ17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1447265823#wasThisHelpful","RR2NHN5NYRZ17","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"nb: This book has been published in the UK as ""Better off Dead"".Victor is an assassin at the top of his game. He's clinical, calculating, aloof. This is the fourth book in the series about him and they are very, very good - but this is the weakest in the series to date. I was quite disappointed by it.The plot has Victor travelling to London to find and protect the step-daughter of a former friend. When he does find her, he discovers that some very powerful people want her dead. They are reporting to a woman who is every bit as cool and cunning as Victor is and who even outwits him on occasion.I didn't think this was a terrible book but I didn't love it as I have the others in the series. Partly, I felt that Victor being teamed up with another person meant that he didn't get the opportunity to be as cool as he usually is. I was also very annoyed by a couple of sequences that happened for NO reason other than to keep the action going fast and furious. They didn't fit with risks that Victor would take and they didn't even get explained. (MINOR SPOILER: One of these is halfway through when Victor announces that he needs to talk to Norimov - no he doesn't! And if he does, then why doesn't he do so? It's just an excuse for another action sequence). Even the reason for Victor being sent to London in the first place gets disproven. There are just too many plot developments that don't add up, and this annoyed me greatly.Much as Zero Day read like Baldacci trying to mimic Lee Child, this book reads like someone trying to mimic Tom Wood rather than delivering the quality of the real thing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZOPZP6W42DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469658#wasThisHelpful","R32ZOPZP6W42DT","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to say what I thought of this book.  It starts off slowly and reads a bit like a Fifty Shades piece of fan fiction (perish the thought).  I was picking it up, reading a bit, putting it down.  Then around the halfway mark the pace ramps up and it gets genuinely pretty tense and creepy.  A real page turner.  But then the ending is - well, it's pretty silly and somewhat unresolved to boot.  So I'm back to not liking it so much again.It's narrated by Julia, a happily married woman who goes off the deep end after her sister gets murdered and starts trying to find out who her sister may have met through the internet.  She gets sucked into an online relationship  and it starts to become apparent that the man she is seeing is not being entirely truthful with her.  Part of the tension is figuring out how much he can or cannot be trusted.  There are a few good twists!The book is made weaker by Julia being such an unsympathetic character.  Rather than worrying for her, at times I couldn't help feeling like she'd get what was coming to her.  I couldn't relate to her nor the decisions that she was making.  It reminded me in some ways of Apple Tree Yard, both in terms of the tawdry sex and the implication that bad things will always happen to married women who stray.  It's not a bad book, but the complete lack of plausibility and the absence of people that we care about detracts from what it could have been.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGM9DU84A5B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062060589#wasThisHelpful","R2EGM9DU84A5B9","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"nb: This book was published in the UK under the title ""The Memory Book"".This is the story of Claire, a young mom who is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.  As she deteriorates there is stress on everyone around her, but particularly on her husband Greg whom she suddenly doesn't recognise, and on her teenage daughter Caitlin who is going through a crisis of her own.  Claire struggles to hold herself together long enough to preserve her life's memories for her family and to help her daughter cope with her issues.The book is clearly intended to be a tearjerker and maybe I'm just a callous and hard-hearted witch, but it failed to have a significant impact on me.  I felt that it was too predictable in what was going to happen and a couple of the storylines were resolved so simply that they felt completely unrealistic (seriously, were we meant to believe that Alice would immediately behave as she did?).This is becoming a crowded genre and The Memory Book doesn't have any stand out qualities.  If you want a touching read about a terminally ill woman preparing to let her partner go, a better choice is Before I Go.  If you want to understand the realities of how Alzheimer's eats away at someone's life, I recommend Still Alice.  If you just want a tearjerker, there's Me Before You.

"Warning: if you didn't enjoy Gone Girl because you found the characters too unsympathetic, you won't like this book either.  As one character puts it, it's about people who are born ""with a different kind of morality"".Having said that, I thought this was one of the best thrillers I've read in a long time.  It's a terrific twisty turny story that grabs you tight from the first page and keeps you guessing throughout with several surprising twists along the way.  The author is in complete control of what he wants you to know and think at any given moment and uses multiple narrators to give you different angles on things that you thought you already knew.I don't want to say too much about the plot because you will almost certainly enjoy it more if you know less about what's going to happen.  It starts with a couple meeting at Heathrow airport, strangers who are both about to fly home to Boston.  Their flight is delayed and they share a couple of drinks together.  Ted confesses to Lily about the problems in his marriage and says, half seriously, that he'd like to kill his wife.  Lily's response: ""I think you should"".If this description sounds intriguing, stop reading reviews now and buy or download this book - you won't be disappointed.  It's a genuine thriller.  Perhaps it doesn't have much literary merit beyond that, but it's a masterclass in its genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ24UY1IIEU1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q1UO4TG#wasThisHelpful","RZ24UY1IIEU1W","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Alice Eveleigh is a young woman who has expecting a child after a brief, disastrous relationship.

For starters, it doesn't sound like it's going to be about someone from the 19th century. Nor is Elizabeth a girl, but if the title refers to her daughter that is even more misleading because she's not the one that Alice is interested in. And lastly, Alice spends most of the book being fascinated by Elizabeth without ever seeing a photograph of her at all.

"Amanda Talbot has written this book to explain how good design can play a part in making us feel happier. She explores various aspects of interior design and how we interact with it, among them: colour, lighting, bringing nature into homes, humour, playfulness and a sense of flow. There are a lot of photographs and inspirational quotes.The book is trying to straddle the divide between a coffee table book and a ""how to"" manual and ultimately this means that it doesn't quite succeed in either role. It's large and heavy and many of the photographs are arty rather than informative. But where it really fails for me is that the advice that it gives is so generic - it feels like reading a series of magazine articles peppered with trite suggestions rather than giving you any meat to get your teeth into.As an example, here are some of the tips that the author shares with us - these are basic COMMON SENSE people!:- To get rid of clutter: ""Immediately throw away any boxes filled with unimportant things that haven't seen the light of day for years"".- To relax more: ""Read, walk your dog after dinner, listen to music and have conversations with friends and loved ones. The likelihood is you will sleep better and feel more refreshed and energised for the next day"".- To bring light into your home: ""If your space is lacking daylight, add more windows""- To avoid getting stuck in a rut: ""Have toast for breakfast instead of cereal"".A great concept, but I can't really imagine who would read any of these suggestions and go ""oh wow, never thought of that"".

"In movie parlance, a ""high concept"" script is one that can be easily pitched with a succinctly stated premise.  The Three Day Affair is exactly that: the story of three long-term friends who spontaneously and inadvertently kidnap a teenage girl and then need to work how to extricate themselves from the mess that they have gotten themselves into.  It's an intriguing premise and there's a nice little twist towards the end that elevates it, but ultimately this is a short story that (even though it's not a long book) has been stretched way beyond its merits.The author has an engaging writing style that pulls the reader in.  Where the book falls down is that it  doesn't have enough loft to keep itself in the air.  It simply doesn't make sense, either that the characters would get themselves into such a predicament or that they would feel unable to get themselves out of it.  The more that the book went on, the more irritating this became.As I've alluded above, the ending does somewhat redeem the book, but I can't shake the feeling that it would have been better as a novella or short story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10L48DD2BGFPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AING6E8#wasThisHelpful","R10L48DD2BGFPA","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A beautiful book about a family and the stories that define them.  Anne Tyler is one of my favourite authors and when it comes to capturing family dynamics there is almost no one better - perhaps Maggie O'Farrell.  When you read one of her books you feel like you get to know the characters and when you've finished it you keep thinking about them and wondering how they are doing.In terms of plot there is not a great deal to this book.  It is about a family.  Initially it focuses on the children, then pulls back to focus on the parents and then pulls back again to focus on the grandparents.  As the lens pulls back, the reader recalibrates their understanding of the characters in a way that is very clever.  Yet the result is somewhat disjointed.  At times I felt that I was reading a series of inter-connected short stories rather than a cohesive novel.  The first chapter for example reads very much like a story in its own right.I really enjoyed reading this book.  I savoured the language and got lost in the characters.

"If you enjoyed Into The Darkest Corner and Before I Go To Sleep, this may be your favourite new book. It's an accomplished thriller which is narrated in turn by the central three female characters. It falls short of being truly great: the outcome is too easy to predict and the pace is slightly sluggish. But it's still a terrific holiday read which I read in just two sittings. It feels like watching an escapist movie.The main narrator is Rachel. Her marriage split up two years ago when her husband left her for another woman. She's an alcoholic, she's lost her job and obsesses over Tom, her ex. Sometimes she drinks to the point of blacking out and this makes her an unreliable narrator. From the train everyday she sees a house with a young couple living in it. She fantasises about these people she doesn't know: she gives them imaginary names and daydreams about their perfect marriage. When the woman (Megan) goes missing, Rachel realises that some of the things she has seen from the train may hold the key to finding Megan.I liked the way that the book was structured and the fact that Rachel's memories are somewhat unreliable adds to the mystery. The book is partly narrated by Tom's new partner, Anna, and there are intriguing disparities between her and Rachel's accounts of events. (The third narrator is Megan, filling in her back story.) However I did get a bit tired of reading about Rachel reaching yet again for a bottle of wine or waking with a hangover. I guessed how the book would pan out quite early on and it's made very clear around the 70% mark - at that point it really needed to be sped up. It doesn't quite deliver on the promised tension and it falls short of being the new ""Gone Girl"" that it's being hailed as.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R2W26FUUHRA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOPQU2K#wasThisHelpful","R3R2W26FUUHRA5","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following on from Black Roses, this is a book about actress and clandestine spy Clara Vine who is working in Berlin in pre-WW2 Germany.  It's October 1937 and Clara's career is on the ascendant: she is about to take on her first leading role.  She is disturbed to hear about the murder of a woman whom she once knew and further disturbed to hear that her own name is being bandied about as someone potentially suspicious.  Clara is advised to lie low, but there are secrets that need to be investigated...I do enjoy this series, which like the books of the author's husband (Philip Kerr) feature a mix of fictional and real life characters, such as Goebbels, Himmler, the Mitford sisters, the Duke of Windsor and Charles Lindbergh.  It has a strong sense of place and you feel like you are getting a view into how it might have been to live in Berlin at that time.Jane Thynne's writing style is a little wooden: perfectly readable but I would have liked her to assume a little more intelligence on the part of the reader rather than spelling everything out for us.  There is a pleasing mystery at the book's centre however.  I enjoyed this foray into pre-war Berlin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R108730QXKF0S7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO4G3BA#wasThisHelpful","R108730QXKF0S7","A3PHF9UV3F177L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PHF9UV3F177L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great toning and firming body applicator. If you need an extra umf to get rid of that stubborn body fat then this is the product for you.

This has been great in helping me get rid of that stubborn muffin top and excess fat around my mid section.

"Brita has definitely worked on and succeeded in constructing a streamlined water pitcher that filters and then provides a suitable home for six cups of water with each fill.  My previous observation of Brita filtration pitchers was that the filter was located in exactly the area where it ought not be and this has been rectified with its position in today's pitcher.  Included is one of the new filters which even improves the nothingness taste of filtered water. The plastic components seem harder and more rigid and the pieces all fit together securely.  I'm not in love with the red color but I do love the new structural design. The timer display is reset by pushing a button for 5 seconds and then each time the lid is lifted up for at least 10 seconds,  a fill is recorded.  The battery is said to last a few years and then we return to our own timing.  I am not impressed with this timing display but I certainly am impressed with the pitcher. Do not put any of the parts in the dishwasher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1QB5QGI2YBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M0S#wasThisHelpful","R3E1QB5QGI2YBU","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The blue color is very pretty and the filter fits perfectly as long as you have it lined up properly.  The lid snaps onto the pitcher very well and the spout flap moves when water is poured. One thing I don't quite understand, though,  why is the filter positioned in the area directly where tap water is added,  just where the pitcher fits under the faucet? This is precisely where water is not to be added,  directly on top of the filter.  Anyway,  the water tastes great,  so I will continue being careful when filling the pitcher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4SZ5KKCN66R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JHXFCK#wasThisHelpful","R1J4SZ5KKCN66R","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you are considering this piece,  be sure to check out the photo which demonstrates its petite size and do not expect to receive a disk the size of a quarter. I like the method used to attach the disk to the chain and while I usually prefer a more substantial chain,  this one works visually because of the little pendant with an open design.

"The iluminage Precise Touch hair remover is smaller than the iluminage touch that was previously introduced, but I am uncertain as to the differences since I have not seen the first model.  This one is small enough that it can be taken along for travel if necessary, say if you will be away from home for more than a week. I say this because it is suggested to use the hair removal tool once a week for seven weeks to achieve the best results for permanent hair loss.  Since it is not battery operated, all you need is an electric outlet and about twenty minutes if you want to use this on both legs.  Of course smaller body areas would take less time, but that gives an example of the time involved.  This is used after shaving and I have used it immediately after shaving to get at the root of the matter, that is the hair.  There was no real sensation and no smell of burning hair.  Wearing the provided small goggles adds a level of security, particularly if one is sensitive to strobe lights because this functions by small bursts of bright light which should not be looked at.  There are a lot of warnings for this product, like not using it over areas with tattoos, something that could be an issue.  I would recommend visiting the manufacturers website to view their video about using the product and hope that you do not find the seven times weekly to be as offputting as I did.  My first interpretation was to use it seven times for a week, but knew instinctively that would be too often.  I have not used this on the high setting but likely will progress to that temperature in time.  This is an interesting grooming tool that could benefit many and at the cost of around three hundred dollars right now, it could actually save money for those who have hair removed professionally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPID0W94LVJQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010CHME9K#wasThisHelpful","RPID0W94LVJQJ","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Clear-Ad brochure holder is very similar to another I have been using, but this one has edges that are a bit sharper.  The plastic is very clear and there is no problem with it remaining upright regardless of the number of brochures or business cards it holds.

"The Ivation Evaporative Cooling Towel is rather interesting.  It is a pretty shade of blue and arrived inside a nice hard plastic container.  Out of the container, is was soft and had a sort of dampness to it but it was not really wet.  I hung it overnight and was very surprised to find a stiff towel int he morning, so I immediately ran it under the faucet, wrang it out, rolled it and placed it back in the hard plastic case.  I placed it in the refrigerator so that it would be cool when I needed it later in the day, so it started off as a very cold towel when applied to my head and neck after a workout.  The next time I used it, I did not use the refrigerator for cooling it, yet found that it was as soothing when used.  I wash it in the sink after each use but do not lot it dry completely before returning it to the case.  I have been using this at home, but if I were to take it elsewhere, I would carry it in a sealed plastic bag.  I received a sample for my honest evaluation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZYYV6T3KOI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I0MMNK#wasThisHelpful","R19ZYYV6T3KOI7","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not read a lot of science fiction but was intrigued by the premise of Saturn Run.  The fictional book is interwoven with more scientific information than other mysteries or thrillers, yet the highly readable dialogue and creative characters made for a couple days of entertainment without bogging down the mind in trying to comprehend the whats and whys.  It is a quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROYFBY8UAADW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176950#wasThisHelpful","R3ROYFBY8UAADW","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The look of the Gaiam Mary-Jane Grippy Yoga Socks is very attractive and actually comforting to look at.  The grippy dots are very functional and the cut outs for the toes are smart for movement without slippage.  Unfortunately, these are very large for a one size fits most offering and my feet are the textbook average size.  They are made of 87% cotton, but since I wash them in cold water and air dry them, they have not shrunk at all.  Regardless, I am loving them for the design, construction, appearance and comfort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27K51EVM9WSEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010I7BPEO#wasThisHelpful","R27K51EVM9WSEK","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very rarely, I receive a pieced of jewelry that is much better in person than the images provided online.  This Celtic pendant is one of such products.  Ignore the imperfections that appear in the Amazon photo, as this is truly without a flaw.  There is no break in the thread which wraps into the square woven pattern.  The pendant is edged nicely and the weight is more substantial than the photo implies.  This was made in China and was not only formed beautifully, but was finished well, too.  The chain is very light, so I am wearing it with another that is better suited in my opinion.  I have placed another small pendant on the thin chain provided with this pendant, so the entire piece will be well used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RGN74A1H8WHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEZ8AW2#wasThisHelpful","R2RGN74A1H8WHK","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ferplast Tape Retractable Dog Lead is not a Mini size, but rather the Medium size which is for a maximum weight dog of 25 kg or just over 55 pounds.  I was not expecting to love this one as much as the others I have been using religiously for years, but I was wrong.  I thought it would be a lead that was more for show than for utilitarian and safe functionality, but I was wrong.  I thought it looked good in the provided images and I was right.  In other words, this is a good lead that I am happy to use for walking my dear dog.  The tape lead is a good quality, the gears move very smoothly with little effort, the handle is large enough to be held while I wear gloves, and the lock is secure.  With a large single button that has both a temporary and locking set, it is just as easy to unlock the locked mechanism as to lock it.  The hardware is solid and also moves with ease.  If you want to purchase a decorative plastic cover to make an impression, there are several available.  I am not into dressing my dog other than a sweater or coat to prevent her from the cold and I don't accessorize her other than the jeweled crown brooch I've pinned onto her Puppia harness, but if I ever decide to purchase one of the covers, I already have it picked out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G248A259QI90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGUKO0#wasThisHelpful","R2G248A259QI90","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most milk chocolate bars made in Europe contain sweetened condensed milk. This tends to produce a sweeter chocolate product,  almost like a white chocolate.  The Cailler milk chocolate is a traditional confection that is creamy and very much liked by children because of the rather benign flavor which is more milky. The bar is good,  particularly for those who prefer a milder chocolate.  It is more expensive than other Nestles products,  so I personally won't be buying these for kids,  but for adults who love the European style of milk chocolate,  this was well received. It seems that there is currently  a greater interest in the USA for milk chocolates and this is worth a taste.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35S6URS3IDIV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGGJ4#wasThisHelpful","R35S6URS3IDIV2","A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ZPY91VE3IDN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
